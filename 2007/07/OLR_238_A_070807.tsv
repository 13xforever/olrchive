13922	26973	Tonight, July 8th, 2007, the PlayStation 3 might be getting a price cut in the name of E3, notable games may not even show up at E3, and lots of tunes are dying over a new advertisement in World of Warcraft.
32097	36180	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36260	42244	We are that radio program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42624	47067	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47187	47547	What?
48267	48988	What, huh?
49768	49828	Huh?
49988	50589	How are you doing?
51149	51890	I'm here, aren't I?
52210	53891	Yes, you finally saw Transformers today?
54051	54331	Yes.
54631	55292	And, verdict?
56092	58354	I have a major female boner for Ironhide now.
60195	60355	Is that?
60592	61152	Rob Williams, let's go!
89928	93509	Also joining us, I will not be going on a date with Techmaster Loki.
94069	94429	Hello.
94990	96290	Because your wife might disapprove of that.
97470	97730	Maybe.
98030	98490	Probably not.
100011	101031	She might like it, actually.
101051	101331	Who knows?
101651	102312	How's your week been?
102912	103792	It's been good.
103932	106013	Now, you saw Transformers last week and told us all about it.
106033	107053	Have you seen anything new this week?
108573	108793	No.
109073	112314	Actually, I meant to see Transformers again this week, but I got lazy.
113275	118256	We got out of work early on the 3rd, and I was like, you know, I could go see Transformers again.
118680	122686	But then I got out to my car and it was like hot and I was like, I just want to go home and sit in the air conditioning.
123127	125711	It's been very hot here in Sacramento where our show is based.
126392	128635	Like 106, 107 this week has been crazy.
128976	129817	At least we don't have humidity.
130747	133609	Anyway, you'd think we were a movie podcast or something, but we're actually not.
133649	138311	We talk about video games, so we're going to start off tonight's program as we always do, talking about How Was Your Gaming Week.
138331	141692	But first, I want to introduce our chat room.
141752	143653	It's over at chat.orangelongeradio.com.
143933	153258	We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, and interesting things always happen if you're listening live, such as if you listen tonight, we had to do two takes of our intro because I made a big boo-boo.
153898	161400	So if you want to hear the whole show, you've got to listen live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time at OrangeLondonRadio.com on our live 365 feed.
161960	164560	And you can always participate in our chat room, chat.OrangeLondonRadio.com.
164580	166581	We'll also be opening up our Skype line later on.
166601	170181	That's also a telephone number, an 877 number you can call in to.
170842	172502	And we'll get those calls a little later on in the program.
172542	176663	But first, DarkSakura is going to tell us all about her gaming week.
177543	178023	I had one.
179154	182515	I did try to play some World of Warcraft and then I got tired of updating all that crap.
183076	187578	So all I did was play a little bit of Pokemans.
188838	189498	That was really it.
189578	190519	How's Pokemans been going?
190539	193820	We had an email actually last week asking how you were doing on your Pokemans.
194040	194880	I'm hardly doing.
195681	196401	That's what I answered.
196441	197962	I played a crap ton of pinball.
197982	198802	We got too many machines.
199422	201723	We finally got rid of Retardo Johnny Mnemonic.
202503	204704	And we got rid of Guns N' Roses.
205565	208646	We have a Simpsons pinball party now, which is really freaking cool.
209341	215806	and we have World Cup Soccer, which was my favorite machine ever.
216787	225774	Of course, my first time playing it, I cracked a billion points, which just goes to show that my mad skills at that game have only diminished very slightly.
225794	228716	Because you didn't break two billion.
229337	230498	I've almost gotten there.
230578	232459	I was really, really good at that machine.
233620	235301	I also played the Spider-Man pinball today.
235922	237303	The new one is really, really good.
238044	240186	and I kept hitting Sandman over and over and over again.
240366	243229	This is what you get for being a bad, bad guy in a movie.
243969	244290	The end.
245411	246692	Loki, how was your gaming week?
247052	248133	And less dramatic, please.
249114	249534	It was good.
249834	250935	We finally hooked up.
251356	256960	Well, we have a temporary setup for the 360 LAN systems at my work now.
257341	261344	So we tried a few test games of Saints Row and it's fun.
261524	262185	I can't wait.
262205	264567	The only problem is right now we have
265120	273363	Some of the systems have the patch for the multiplayer in it so that there's no lag, and some of them don't, so we ran into a few issues with that.
273703	279825	But one thing that's awesome in the game is the pimp slap power-up that you can get.
280285	287147	Basically, you run around with a pimp hat on, you can backhand people and fling them across the entire stage, which is awesome.
288202	298629	Um, the only problem is the game only has three multiplayer maps, which kind of sucks, and, you know, I've been kind of spoiled with Infinite Sprint and, um, Grand Theft Auto, so.
299690	302672	It'll hold us over until, uh, Grand Theft Auto 4.
303993	306354	Um, been playing lots of Final Fantasy on the PSP.
307255	311417	I don't know why, but I've been playing it, and it's pretty good.
311577	313639	Just finished, um, was actually...
314398	315239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
331863	334906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
356583	361569	First you have to fight Starscream, and then you eventually have to fight Blackout, then you have to fight them both together.
362129	369818	Well, the little drones that they throw down in the middle were actually harder than Starscream and Blackout, which is stupid.
370478	376325	But, I don't know, the whole game is very glitchy, and I highly recommend not playing it.
377441	382884	I will play it through to get some more achievement points, but I'm going to quickly sell this.
383105	385346	But you did give this game a favorable review last week, right?
385366	386247	It was okay.
386327	387988	Some of the missions are alright.
388068	390129	I haven't played too many of the Decepticon missions.
390149	396653	I'm still playing through the Autobots because I want to play the worst part of the game first and then play stuff where you have to blow up things.
396733	400716	But I actually watched my friend play the first mission of...
402432	406073	The Decepticons, and it didn't look that much more fun, actually.
406333	409353	It looked like it sucked, so I don't know.
409654	412754	It's just a really bad game, I guess, unfortunately.
413314	416755	TigerClaw, a big, big Transformers nerd, has some advice for you.
416795	419936	Loki, Loki, to beat the drones, you have to throw things at them first.
420196	429518	I understand that, and that's what I was doing, because there's, obviously, each drone has the same damn, you know, pattern to them, and I was throwing stuff, and it wasn't doing anything.
429838	430758	So, it was dumb.
431018	431458	All right.
432156	461561	now this happens though sometimes we do change our opinions on video games and not something that's really talked about a whole lot you know like sometimes this happens with movies you may watch a movie like one time and you didn't like it but then like the second time you watch it you see something you didn't see before like sometimes that happens with games too can you think of other games that you've ever like changed your mind on after playing them either favorably or unfavorably um hmm I can't think of anything offhand maybe like Guitar Hero you know it was cool in the beginning and it kind of sucks now
462318	467681	But then again, I'm just not really in... Music games for me right now, I just can't dedicate enough time to them.
468521	469722	So, I don't know.
469862	471863	But, um... I would say World of Warcraft.
471903	473304	I didn't get into it the first time I played it.
473344	474284	Maybe Final Fantasy XI?
474324	474624	Yeah.
474945	476165	Yeah, maybe.
477046	480487	Because after a while, you know, it started just... After two years for me.
480507	486651	After you finally, you know, you get done with the low-level partying stuff, and then you realize, oh, yeah, this kind of sucks now.
487551	489552	But, um... I don't know.
490192	490953	It's okay.
491033	491313	It's just...
492637	495799	It's just something you don't... Activision is pulling an Ubisoft, is what they're doing.
495839	497941	They're really letting me down with a lot of their games.
498141	500382	Or we talked about this last week briefly, Nintendogs.
500742	508488	Like, I think it was the last week or two weeks ago, we talked about how we all loved Nintendogs when we first played it, and then we actually played the full, full game and was like, wow, this got old quick.
508588	516233	And really, I can't blame Activision, I guess, too much for these games, because they're not developing them, but... Stop publishing crappy games.
516793	517894	I mean, seriously, I...
520207	525210	I was discussing something with you guys off-air earlier, and it's like, stop publishing crappy games.
526531	527231	Dumb ideas.
529753	530974	What else was I going to say?
531014	537197	I was just thinking that you don't really see that a lot in the review game industry, where people kind of change their minds over time.
537638	537978	I don't know.
538418	540219	Not really addressed a lot, but it can happen.
540439	541940	Anyway, anything else for your gaming week?
543861	544041	No.
544462	545102	That's pretty much it.
545886	549947	My gaming week wasn't anything too spectacular because I was still playing some World of Warcraft.
549987	556429	I've been working on the Battlestar Galactica themed PvP guild because we aren't just nerds playing World of Warcraft.
556449	559991	We have to take it one step further and incorporate Battlestar Galactica into our guild.
560031	560751	So that's like double nerd.
561791	590895	and so I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft but also the new game I checked out this week I did check out Missile Command on Xbox Live Arcade because I do love the old old 2600 version and the old arcade version to some extent as well and you know the Atari ports are coming out pretty good you know they're cheap they're five bucks and you know the enhanced graphics are actually really good it doesn't feel like kind of like the same type of graphics they actually when they enhanced the graphics they enhanced it for widescreen mode as well so it kind of changes the element of Missile Command and
591135	594577	The only thing I don't really like is that I want to be able to control the game with a mouse.
594757	598039	I don't like using the stick to control the game.
598359	603903	Missile Command was the type of game that was meant for a frickin' trackball or a mouse, which is essentially an inverted trackball, right?
604743	606644	That's why I cannot play that game with a thumbstick.
606764	610107	I need some type of mouse or trackball control to really play Missile Command.
610427	615450	But as far as the presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay, it's Missile Command.
615850	617391	And it's cheap, so it's fine.
617571	618192	Rayman's Raving Rabbids
642128	642729	Oh, I know!
642989	643569	Silent Hill.
644110	645611	I didn't like Silent Hill the first time I played it.
646111	646752	And now I love it.
647252	650915	It's totally just one of those things where I saw something I didn't see before the first time.
651335	651736	Driver 3.
652176	653297	Made peer pressure, I don't know.
653397	654097	I hate the game.
654278	655999	I still hate the game, but it's fun to play.
658330	658870	Oh, Burnout?
659451	660891	I thought it was kind of stupid at first.
661351	667194	And then when I saw how big explosions could be, I was like, I like explosions and wrecks.
667694	669555	And I really like them in my video games.
669615	670856	Especially when that's the whole point.
671336	672716	I had just the opposite.
672836	674397	I liked it when it first came out.
674997	678339	Well, actually, I think the one that really stood out for me was Burnout Takedown.
678839	681600	And then Revenge is kind of eh, it's okay.
682120	684602	And then, you know, the newer ones are just kind of eh.
685282	685642	I don't care.
686793	689094	Of course, our chat room wants to chime in with their suggestions.
689154	692175	JV Mon says, Katamari gets old really fast, like within minutes.
693215	693995	Yeah, the PSP one.
694015	695236	That's a perfect example.
696696	697116	Let's see.
698037	699817	SSJ100 Matt is commenting on Missile Command.
699837	701338	Who needs a port when you got the real thing?
701378	702478	I finally fixed my Atari 400.
703696	704737	for the enhanced mode.
705918	710902	For the enhanced mode is totally high def graphics and Ravar music and all that kind of stuff.
710922	717006	And it's only $5, which if you think about how many quarters you popped into Missile Command back in the day, $5 is not too bad of a deal.
717907	719148	But it just depends.
719188	721269	Some people aren't into the old retro classics.
721449	722890	I am, so it's worth it to me.
723251	726893	But if you're not into the retro upgrades, then there's probably a lot on Xbox Live you don't like.
727514	729015	But I also wanted to say I played Luminous
729704	730905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
755755	757136	Um, there's some pretty decent stuff in there.
757156	762079	Uh, a couple recycles from the old Luminous games, which isn't much of a surprise, but some new stuff as well, so.
762359	764080	I did play a dance game this week, I forgot.
764200	764580	No, what's that?
765241	768623	Uh, I briefly played Neon FM, which, uh... Wow.
769163	770604	You know, on the PC or something?
770704	771925	Yeah, I got leaked in there.
772085	775126	Uh, but, uh, well, it never got made, let me put it that way.
775647	776087	It's okay.
776367	779849	It would have been pretty cool if they had the dance pads for it and stuff, it's just, you know.
781650	784192	Uh, I guess, well, God, you want to keep interrupting my gaming week?
784232	784692	I can't think of...
785103	787707	Luminous, Missile Command, World of Warcraft GameTab
797326	801867	Maybe a little bit, but I'm not allowed to discuss it because I get called a whore and a sellout when I do.
801907	802327	That's okay.
802347	803287	Be a whore and a sellout.
803387	803747	It's up to you.
803767	805948	Then I did play a little bit of GameTap this week as well, yes.
806268	807608	And what did you play on GameTap?
808148	808928	Old Atari 2600 games.
808948	809788	That's one of my things.
809808	812489	I've been going back through leaderboards trying to get high scores on stuff.
812509	813369	I play BurgerTime, too.
813389	814229	Rob likes to score.
814469	815089	Remind.
815629	816089	Oh, sorry.
816109	821270	I was going to say, remind me I need to loan you Salmon Mac Season 1.
821310	822410	Well, you don't need to.
822470	823210	I have it on GameTap.
823250	823971	I just haven't played it.
824831	825391	Then play it.
825591	825831	I know.
825871	826231	I need to.
826653	828194	All right, anyway, so that's that.
828634	832017	Let's go to some housekeeping, and then we'll get into gaming news.
832077	833077	Housekeeping tonight.
833458	836319	SacAnime, we mentioned last week we'll be going to SacAnime.
837000	839021	We only hit a little kink, though.
839041	844145	We don't know if we're actually doing a panel at SacAnime, because communication has not been so great.
844165	844725	But that's okay.
844785	845265	Things happen.
845566	846306	It was very last minute.
846806	850749	I know at least DarkSakura is going to SacAnime, and I'm going as well.
850829	851690	So we'll be around.
851710	852850	So if you're going to be there, say hi.
852871	854031	Loki, I don't know if you're going or not.
854171	854572	When is it?
855152	856453	It's next weekend at the Doubletree.
856973	857654	Next weekend.
857854	858274	Maybe.
858334	860176	As opposed to Quadruple Tree.
862577	863478	Hey, I got an idea.
863778	864639	Let's name it Tree.
865519	866320	No, Double Tree.
866620	866920	Okay.
867521	868902	I was holding up for Quadruple Tree.
870503	871864	Anyhow, that's really it.
871884	875847	We just want to mention that we'll be appearing there one way or another, even if we're just walking the floor like the rest of you.
876386	886988	and, again, we're always looking for anime conventions in California in the West Coast area that we can get to to come say hi because we love doing live panels and that's like, you know, we like doing our show live.
887028	888849	I don't know if you noticed, but we've recorded live.
888869	892149	We always have the chat room and it's a whole other thing to have the studio audience.
892169	894270	Don't you love when everybody's staring right at you, DarkSakura?
894350	895510	Isn't that the best way to record a show?
895530	895930	Oh, my God.
895970	896850	I'm used to it all the time.
899391	899651	All right.
899691	901171	Let's get into some gaming news.
901191	902251	Who wants to start us off tonight?
903172	903972	I guess I could.
904172	904412	All right.
904552	905372	If I got to.
905891	906932	All right, yes, you got it.
907772	914615	Well, there is an expected price cut coming for the PlayStation 3, supposed to reduce by $100.
916516	922639	There was an ad put out by Circuit City saying that it was going to be dropping.
923780	929382	Right now it's $600, but I don't know, $500 might make it actually sell better, I don't know.
930023	932284	But it's supposed to be in conjunction with E3.
933459	936080	So that's going to be this year's E3 speech.
936600	936921	$499 U.S.
936961	937321	dollars.
937781	938801	$499 U.S.
938841	939121	dollars.
939402	941202	And the rest of us are like, okay.
941222	943523	Does that mean the other model is dropping to $399?
943563	944644	What other model?
944664	946204	They're not producing it anymore, are they?
946224	948505	I got a collector's item, yo.
948545	949786	Those bastards.
950086	951206	Collector's item.
951447	955368	I didn't even think of that because when I heard about the $100 price drop, I was like, oh, well, then the other one will be $399.
955428	956809	That will be easily affordable.
956909	958169	I forgot they got rid of that.
958690	959450	Sneaky bastards.
959983	961764	I was all excited about this price drop too.
961964	963304	And I guess everyone's doing it now.
963344	970886	In fact, I think a few people, I remember seeing some scans of Target receipts where people are buying them for $4.99 already, so it's everywhere.
971426	972807	But it's a secret!
973207	974667	You're not supposed to know about this yet!
975167	976168	Shh!
977148	977548	God.
978292	980774	I have to admit, though, I'm still not sold.
980794	982636	$500 is still a lot for me.
982776	988180	You're talking to a guy who's moving in a few weeks and has all those expenses, so I can't be thinking about video game expenses right now?
988561	990102	I'll just go over and play Jamie's.
990362	991163	I don't know, people.
992004	992424	That's okay.
992444	993765	It's collecting dust at my house anyway.
993945	996007	And everyone's like, oh, well, that makes it more affordable.
996027	997008	I'm going to buy that instead of a 360.
997768	1002012	Well, don't you think they're going to drop the price of the 360, too, to compete with this?
1002252	1002673	Obviously.
1002973	1005275	Otherwise, actually, they might leave it the same because...
1006028	1012832	They feel it's competitive pricing still and stuff like that, but I'd hope that they drop the price to $360.
1014153	1015754	Lots and lots of feedback in chatroom on this.
1015814	1018936	Ross Steel UT says, Price drop after less than a year, that's a problem.
1019516	1023058	SSJ100Matt says, They can drop the price as much as they want, but people will still bitch.
1023459	1025500	People bitched when the Wii was $50 more.
1026280	1030323	And Ross Steel UT responds to that, True, if people had their way, they'd be free.
1032148	1037000	and Sephiroth 1215 agrees we paid that $50 on the Wii for the crappy Wii Sports.
1037642	1038303	But I don't know, see...
1039113	1044395	As hardcore gamers, we look at Wii Sports and we go, eh, you know, the novelty wears off after a little bit.
1044415	1050118	But seriously, I know people that are not gamers that still all they talk about Wii Tennis.
1050158	1053900	Like I was having dinner with some friends the other night who are not like the gamer crowd.
1053920	1055500	And they were like, let's have a Wii party.
1055540	1056921	Let's get together and play Wii Tennis.
1056981	1057961	Rob, you have a Wii, don't you?
1058002	1058962	Let's all get together and play.
1059462	1062704	And so like it's still like a lot of fun for a lot of people.
1062764	1067866	Just maybe not the hardcore audience who kind of, you know, got over it after a few months.
1068268	1071231	JV Mon suggests $499 PlayStation 3 is better competition for the Elite 360
1078383	1082424	Jorardimo says if PlayStation 3 dropped the price, I might buy one, even though there are still no games.
1082464	1083365	Hold out.
1084165	1085845	Hold out is all I can say.
1085865	1087066	I mean, think about it.
1087506	1092847	They're going to sucker you into buying it before the Holly season, and guess what's going to fucking come out later on?
1093107	1093847	Oh, look at that!
1093988	1096248	It's the 6-axis controller with Rumble now!
1096668	1098809	And now we're including them with the new systems.
1099389	1102452	Oops, you already bought one, now you have to buy another controller too.
1102552	1103692	Just fucking wait.
1103733	1108456	There's no games really that are super huge coming out between now and Christmas anyways.
1108696	1110278	I mean, wait until the fall.
1110698	1114401	You can wait a few more months and just pick up the good games when they come out then.
1114941	1115942	So I have a question for you guys.
1115962	1122686	I already said I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner at this time, and this doesn't really change my opinion, but my question for you guys is, you guys have bought PlayStation 3s.
1122746	1125588	Loki, you bought the old 499 model, which was the 20 gig.
1126029	1127890	Jamie, you guys bought the deluxe one.
1127910	1129431	Do you guys feel shafted by this?
1131152	1131472	No.
1133234	1139598	You don't feel like you got ripped off, even though they're dropping the... Because maybe you've had, what, nine months of good gameplay before that, or...
1139935	1140255	Right.
1140535	1143236	I got my PlayStation 3 first day, so I don't care.
1143677	1145237	I wouldn't call it... I got my good out of it.
1145557	1147378	I don't really even care about it.
1147458	1148859	I got $100 off of it anyway.
1149559	1151960	Because we used our Discover card and got money back.
1152160	1158582	I wouldn't call it good gameplay, but no, seriously, that's kind of one of my reasons why I'm telling people that they should hold off.
1159403	1161204	I mean, I have my PlayStation 3.
1161424	1164845	I have... I bought maybe like five games for it.
1165325	1167186	I sold back most of those because...
1167833	1168374	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1195191	1195851	and DarkSakura.com.
1219092	1220193	But that's the problem, though.
1220313	1225935	It's only like a couple games, whereas the 360, I'm planning on buying a lot more than just a couple games.
1226735	1237039	So that's a problem, because even if they do get you to buy the system, you're going to be waiting a while for some good games, especially if you're holding out for your Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid 4.
1237139	1246902	You plan on waiting about another, I don't know, almost nine months now until those games come out, if not longer.
1247896	1254321	All right, well, with this price cut on the PlayStation 3, I mean, there's a lot of possible factors for why this price cut is happening now.
1254642	1257504	But could one of them be the pressure from the third-party companies?
1257564	1264970	It also came out this week, just before the news of the price cut, that Sega made an interesting comment about the pricing of the PlayStation 3.
1265931	1270995	One of the executives at Sega, Masano Medea, actually had this quote, quote,
1271650	1274494	Name, brand, price, and software are what count.
1274614	1277037	This is what he told Reuters in an interview.
1277658	1286950	Quote, since it's getting difficult to make software availability a differentiating factor, superior marketing and pricing strategy will be the key for Sony.
1287779	1288339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1303653	1307637	I want to see them here because, you know, promises aren't getting us anywhere.
1307717	1312162	Obviously, they promise all this shit, you know, that's supposed to be out at launch, never came out at launch.
1312542	1317867	All these delays, all these third-party games getting delayed for the PlayStation 3 or just not coming out at all.
1318468	1323933	And then, you know, at the same time, they need to have a strong Christmas or else they're doomed.
1323993	1324394	I mean, because...
1325211	1329573	Already, you know, the 360s had, you know, a couple strong Christmases already.
1330133	1331774	And this is going to be the third strong one.
1331794	1337136	They've got a really good lineup, especially with Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, and God knows what other stuff's coming out around that time.
1338717	1343459	And then the Wii, obviously, the Wii's going to take off like crazy at Christmas because you still can't find them.
1345020	1349522	They really need to, because they're losing, you know, they're dropping behind a lot now.
1349742	1352283	And if they don't, you know, pick it up,
1353678	1354719	It's going to be hard.
1354879	1367650	Now, Matt, though, we are sitting just days away from E3 2007, and Sony pulled a pretty big trump card out of their hand at Game Developers Conference and really changed a lot of people's minds with Home and LittleBigPlanet.
1367790	1369851	Are they sitting on something else right now?
1370052	1370732	I hope they are.
1371012	1374155	And I really do, because I would like to see them be successful.
1375116	1376217	A box of Crayolas.
1377258	1377658	Sorry.
1378278	1381141	I don't have much faith in Sony.
1381441	1382482	Crash Bandicoot paint.
1383905	1387932	There's that new Spyro game.
1388012	1389194	I was watching the ads for it.
1390096	1395306	I'm sorry if all they have to release is Spyro as far as their games go, then...
1396812	1400313	Macman makes an interesting quote, E3 will change everything.
1400913	1402334	Yeah, it'll suck.
1402534	1403674	Because we're not there.
1404114	1404494	Exactly.
1418158	1420760	Isn't all that same pressure still there this year?
1421080	1422301	Has anything changed?
1422741	1427584	People are still going to be making a lot of judgments based off of the cards that people lay on the table at E3.
1428124	1430605	Whether they're there or not, we're all on the internet now.
1431906	1433767	Did you hear what Scott over at All Games is doing?
1434068	1439791	They're going in there with a live camera that's going to sit on Scott's head so you can be at E3 with them.
1440451	1441492	It's just fucking nuts.
1441632	1449298	I mean, if they think the pressure is gone from E3 because they locked it down like Fort Knox, you're mistaken.
1450379	1452681	I understand why they... Critics are watching you.
1452781	1464751	Well, I understand why they did this, but E3 needs to succeed this year because this is kind of a whole new experiment for them to see, kind of changing things up and supposedly they're going to get more business done, but...
1465271	1468993	Really, when you think about it, what kind of business can you get done at E3?
1469033	1473456	I mean, other than, you know, a lot of the press stuff where they're covering all these games and everything.
1473476	1481141	I mean, is there really... I mean, granted us, I mean, we were only like three people at E3, maybe four or five or whatever.
1481501	1484223	But, you know, obviously we can't see all of E3.
1484283	1487064	It's impossible to cover everything in great detail.
1487104	1490907	But, you know, these larger press outlets and stuff, it's a lot easier for them.
1490927	1492888	But really, do you think there's stuff that they're just...
1493568	1494689	Missing from E3?
1494889	1500534	A lot of them just say what the game companies want them to say because they just copy-paste press releases anyway.
1500834	1505037	So are we going to expect them to do any better work at these places?
1505217	1505417	No.
1505978	1509741	There's still enough of the independent press getting in.
1509801	1511302	Not as much as there should be.
1512202	1513924	I'm not saying that bitterly, I promise.
1514144	1514704	Oh, I am.
1514985	1520629	There is enough of the independent press getting in that are not going to be corporate whores.
1520909	1521930	Oh, I'm extremely bitter.
1524025	1525766	I found out with someone from our works going.
1526186	1526646	Bastard.
1528046	1529247	He's feeling it out.
1530207	1537749	Anyhow, I had to say this in chat because now everybody's making plays on the E3 will change everything because now they're coming up with their own taglines.
1538170	1540250	Kyle Snyder says, Dust Cap 2.
1541030	1542531	This time it's not Dust Cap 1.
1543891	1545452	Long running Orange Lingerie joke there.
1545812	1548913	JV Mon says, Emodium AD will change everything.
1549773	1551814	I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean, so forget it.
1552546	1553346	I'm just excited.
1553667	1556528	I can't wait to see the press releases and all that stuff.
1556868	1560450	And also watching the conferences.
1561511	1573077	Anyways, another rumor that's supposedly coming out of the Sony press conference or speculation at least is that the 6-axis controller is getting rumble as well as touch sensitivity.
1573797	1575518	It'll be interesting to see if they do that.
1576058	1581381	They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be doing, but apparently that through...
1582631	1592920	I guess different sections of the controller you'll be able to have touch sensitivity very similar to I guess like the DS touchscreen.
1593881	1606491	And then the Rumble as well, there's been even some confirmation on that coming because apparently in a developer's behind the scenes video for Haze, they were showing...
1607657	1610098	I'm telling you, Sony's got more cards they're going to show at E3.
1610678	1611538	Oh yeah, Eye of Judgment.
1611558	1612218	Fuck the Eye of Judgment.
1612238	1615259	I'm telling you, PlayStation Eye, just a fucking eye toy again.
1615279	1616459	Don't be suckered into it.
1616479	1617719	I'm not suckered into it.
1638086	1655134	Well, we're all going to end up being suckers if we've got a PlayStation 3 down the line because it looks like Sony is going to be working with the Nielsen research folks to see what we're playing, to see what they can advertise in.
1655654	1656475	Isn't that special?
1657295	1660817	So yeah, we're going to get more ads in our games thanks to this crap.
1661057	1662678	Hooray, and we're still going to pay $60 for them.
1664585	1666006	That's bullshit.
1667267	1668969	Big stinking piles of horse hockey.
1669850	1672412	Especially when they have tons of ads in games like Transformers.
1672512	1673152	Come on!
1675054	1678377	Does that mean... The whole movie was an Xbox ad, at least at the end.
1678797	1684282	Because, like, you know, on TV, where the Neil's Rays are, if I want a show to get cancelled, I don't watch it.
1684342	1686144	So how do I get a game to get cancelled?
1686344	1687265	Just not buy it?
1687285	1687725	Don't play it.
1687785	1688486	How do they rate it?
1688566	1692289	I don't... I think it's to see who's playing what the most.
1692890	1694611	so that they know what type of games to advertise in.
1695211	1696531	Interesting.
1696631	1699892	Now, doesn't Microsoft kind of already do that?
1700092	1702273	I mean, I don't know if Sony does this.
1702333	1706935	Microsoft kind of knows what you're playing all the time because you hit that little button to see your friends list.
1706955	1708115	You can see what they're all playing.
1708435	1711836	And Major Nelson posts every week, hey, these are the top ten games on live.
1712197	1713717	So they kind of know what people are playing.
1713957	1718479	I mean, I guess only out of those boxes that are connected to live, but that's still a pretty good representation.
1720119	1720419	I don't know.
1721980	1722380	We'll see.
1723719	1729961	Anyhow, one other thing that you could be playing on the PlayStation 3, and who knows how many ads are going to be in this game, Gran Turismo 5.
1731041	1735983	Gran Turismo 5 will probably not see release until late 2008.
1736123	1741445	This was something that director Kaonori Yamauchi said to Car and Driver magazine.
1741745	1745206	Because spring of 2008 is the earliest possible release window for the game.
1745546	1748387	Sony is trying to get them to push the date further.
1748847	1751610	But they want the game to be absolutely perfect.
1751930	1754893	He did say, though, that there would be no crash damage physics.
1756655	1762721	The perfect damage system will actually be changing the physics of the game and modeling of each panel of each car separately.
1763141	1767105	So I have no idea, but they're taking out crash damage physics.
1767325	1769267	But they did it in Forza.
1770849	1772030	Why can't they do it in Gran Turismo 5?
1772070	1772510	No idea.
1772650	1772751	Yeah.
1774693	1776457	It's kind of a weird, weird thing.
1776577	1777278	It's not a big deal.
1777378	1779723	I mean, Project Gotham I don't think does damage physics either.
1780685	1781607	At least not that I'm aware of.
1782210	1783910	I guess not every racing game does.
1784190	1787111	So, and it's, I mean, Gran Turismo's not Burnout, so, you know.
1787611	1794892	But I guess maybe that's why I kind of get a weird face, because when I think about playing racing games, I like racing games like Burnout, where the point is to crash into shit.
1795292	1797193	And so I go, no crashing physics?
1797693	1799313	What the hell kind of racing game is this?
1799333	1805234	But then I go, yeah, that's right, I've never really been a fan of Gran Turismo, because I like my racers fake.
1806434	1806995	Not real.
1808535	1808935	Anyways.
1808975	1809115	Anyways.
1809643	1819945	And once again, if you're hoping to see some cool shit, especially Final Fantasy XIII at E3, well, you better forget it, because it's not going to be at E3 at all.
1821025	1822725	So, boo-hoo.
1822925	1828466	Not surprising, though, because I know Square Enix this year, they've been doing a lot of Nintendo stuff, like DS and PSP titles.
1828867	1831327	I think there's actually some Wii titles in there as well.
1831787	1834207	Why did they decide not to bring Final Fantasy XIII?
1834968	1836028	It's probably not done yet.
1836288	1836668	Duh.
1836688	1836868	Yeah.
1837409	1839370	I mean, obviously, how long did it take?
1839390	1840211	12 to come out?
1840251	1841811	Well, they had a freaking trailer.
1842032	1843092	Why does Square do that?
1843172	1847154	I remember my very first E3, they showed Final Fantasy XII, and then it wasn't even there the next year.
1847174	1848035	Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
1848295	1856199	They show you a trailer, but then, you know, we'll use Sony, and I think Microsoft used this phrasing, mainly Sony, though.
1856779	1858100	It's a target render.
1858120	1860161	This is what we hope the game to look like.
1860922	1863503	Oh, okay, thank you very much for getting my hopes up.
1864594	1867915	It's not exactly what the game's going to look like, but it's a target, you know.
1868335	1869355	It's one to strive to.
1869655	1873757	I mean, I'm sure the game's still going to look phenomenal and exceed a lot of folks' expectations.
1873797	1877418	I mean, let's face it, Square's always pushed the envelope in that department, you know.
1877638	1878378	Oh, don't get me wrong.
1878418	1880639	It's going to be awesome, but I don't know.
1881099	1883960	I'm more excited seeing what was it, Last Remnant.
1884400	1885220	That looks pretty cool.
1885360	1885540	Hmm.
1886096	1888017	And I think that's going to be there in trailer form.
1914355	1915456	DarkSakura, take it away.
1940561	1942663	Unfortunately, in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, does it?
1942743	1943363	So your F.U.
1943423	1945365	is to patience, in a way.
1945485	1945886	And money.
1946346	1946746	Okay.
1947167	1947967	Patience and money.
1947987	1948668	Patience and money.
1948768	1950129	Loki, my F.U.
1950149	1954893	goes to Stella the Kitty because she... Oh, I want to meet your new kitty!
1955453	1961218	She's very persistent on chewing the power cord to the fan and the light in our house.
1961578	1964541	And she doesn't realize that there's a lot of electricity going through that.
1964561	1965782	And fortunately, she does...
1967165	1968026	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1995342	1997084	Well, you know, I didn't name the cat.
1997504	2006714	Actually, the woman that was fostering the cat, I guess Stella's full name, she calls her Stella Dora, so I don't know.
2007395	2009858	I'm totally going to caturday caption pictures of your cat.
2010559	2011420	We've got plenty more.
2011580	2012521	I brought my camera, too.
2012941	2016585	You should tell your wife that there's a video game reference in your cat's name.
2016645	2017186	She'll love that.
2018726	2019646	You want to watch her go crazy?
2019666	2022847	Get the Jingle Cats video I want to see Stella vs. Shermie
2045202	2045583	and DarkSakura.com.
2061116	2062898	No force on earth can move the shirt.
2062918	2063958	Can I do my FUs now?
2064179	2064379	Okay.
2064559	2068182	Alright, my FU of the week goes to my new driver's license picture.
2068822	2070023	It's horrible!
2070083	2071585	Rob, your face does not look that fat.
2071685	2074227	My face looks like a Christmas light.
2074347	2075888	It's red and fat.
2076008	2076829	It's horrible.
2077209	2078831	I just had to get a new license picture taken.
2078851	2080912	My birthday just passed and it's that year of my license.
2080932	2081993	I had to go in and take a new picture.
2082313	2083554	I look fat and red.
2083775	2084495	You do not!
2084695	2085096	It's horrible.
2085116	2086477	I look like I have a bowl full of jelly.
2086557	2087037	You do not!
2088796	2090437	F you to the DMV!
2090758	2092019	Why do you do this to people?
2092059	2095821	This is why we have rampant anorexia and bulimia in our societies, because of the DMV.
2096102	2096482	That's all.
2096662	2096982	I'm done.
2098543	2100725	And no, chatroom, you may not have a scan.
2100745	2102486	That's personal information.
2102526	2104828	I'm not scanning my driver's license and putting it on the internet.
2104848	2106129	That's one of the dumbest things you could do.
2106910	2112854	Alright, let's get back into the gaming news before I get more frustrated, because then I'm going to take out my wallet and look at my picture again.
2112894	2114195	I'm going to get more angrier.
2116804	2120126	Well, Rob, I'm sorry I'm about to piss you off again.
2121786	2123207	Now, don't we normally love Nintendo?
2123847	2124788	I love Nintendo.
2125148	2133932	Nintendo, we love you so much, but why do you have to hurt us by not having a playable Smash Bros.
2134252	2134892	at E3?
2138274	2138694	Fuckers.
2139774	2142896	So Nintendo's not going to be showing Smash Bros.
2142956	2143056	at E3?
2144661	2146022	What's their excuse?
2146942	2151203	Wasn't it in Kojima's blog that he played an almost complete version?
2152024	2152904	Like, in April?
2155625	2156625	So why not?
2156785	2159226	Why are you fucking with us, Nintendo?
2162427	2164708	Give us a playable Smash Bros.
2164748	2171850	or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank!
2174113	2174593	Give me!
2175614	2178196	I need my pit, and I need my snake.
2179297	2179718	The end.
2179978	2181019	I got a snake, man.
2181759	2182980	I got a snake, man!
2185422	2187284	One time I fed my snake some beer.
2187304	2187384	Okay.
2189846	2190527	Let's see.
2191568	2192408	Going to chat room.
2192468	2195851	RawSteelUT says, Like we don't know how Smash Bros.
2195891	2196652	is going to play...
2197782	2198262	I don't care.
2198743	2199403	My God.
2199743	2204085	They do a damn update on the website every day.
2204406	2210089	And every blog on the face of the earth covers the damn website.
2210949	2214151	Just go to the website and check it out each day.
2214191	2218073	We don't need to hear or see it updated every day.
2218653	2222856	I don't give a crap about the final moves and the control scheme and all that shit.
2222876	2224296	Just wait for the game to come out.
2225277	2226077	Be surprised.
2226918	2227198	All right.
2228231	2238934	Well, as if I wish I had good news for you, but the journey continues here with Nintendo and what they are and aren't going to be showing at E3.
2239334	2241294	Actually, this has nothing to do with what's at E3.
2241474	2242494	This is just the way it is.
2243935	2257378	Michael Kelba, who is actually the head of Retro Studios, who is designing, of course, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, in an interview recently with GamePro, he has confirmed that there will be no online multiplayer games.
2257702	2260002	and Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.
2260963	2274865	Those of us that were hoping and thinking and speculating and convinced that Nintendo is finally going to get into online gaming, they're finally going to open up to the world of online gaming and Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the game that will do it.
2275065	2276825	We just got fucking shot down this week.
2277445	2278906	Way to brace next gen.
2279946	2280766	Or this gen.
2280966	2281566	Last gen.
2281646	2282066	I don't know.
2282886	2283367	Online.
2284407	2284987	God damn it.
2285007	2285887	This makes me angry.
2294358	2297340	Why won't you embrace online gaming, Nintendo?
2297441	2301844	What, did Phantasy Star Online Episodes 1 and 2 burn you that badly?
2302264	2305247	What is your big problem with online gaming?
2305667	2308910	Why do you have to spray us with these friend codes crap?
2309330	2311732	Why won't you put your series that we love online?
2312212	2317997	Why do you give us something crappy like the new Pokemon game that's your only online game and it's mediocre online stuff anyway?
2318317	2323762	Why will you not wake up to the next generation of gaming?
2326772	2329534	and I copy everything that Jamie said before about the deck.
2332075	2333636	Anyways, more positive news.
2334376	2335096	Wait a minute, hold on.
2335157	2335537	No, no, no.
2335557	2336537	I'm going to chat for a minute.
2336837	2340539	HitStun says even fucking Virtua Fighter 5 is going to be online now.
2340840	2347043	You know in a shittacious series like Virtua Fighter goes online and Metroid is still single player only.
2347363	2348964	Something is fucked in this world.
2352975	2355537	RossDLUT says, no Metroid Prime 3 online?
2355617	2355938	Good!
2356298	2357799	Nintendo Online sucks anyway.
2358019	2358780	But it could have been better.
2359761	2362043	JVmon says, Pokemon Online is slow as hell.
2362263	2363584	The DS games are fine!
2364665	2365546	Nintendo can do it!
2366827	2368708	They're just not doing it for some reason.
2370950	2374453	RossDLUT says, people who play Nintendo systems don't want online.
2374493	2375834	Those who want to play online have 360.
2376275	2377736	I beg to differ.
2377876	2381259	If you give them online, they will embrace online.
2381969	2390171	Moms and grandmas like to play Bejeweled Online and that, like, you know, those fucking pop-it games on Pogo and shit and all those other games, like Poker Online.
2390191	2390911	They'll play that.
2390951	2392372	They'll play the Wii Online, too.
2392732	2396573	Don't give me that just because it's not a hardcore gaming audience or whatever.
2396593	2400414	This just makes me angry because I've been waiting so long for Nintendo to go online.
2401114	2402615	What was last year's E3?
2402835	2404395	We're embracing online.
2404615	2410957	You know, the system is going to be, you know, what was that, Nintendo is going to be providing new content daily.
2412035	2416222	And every day you're going to be able to go to your Nintendo Wii system and see new content.
2416362	2419507	Whether it be game downloads or all this shit.
2419627	2424335	Or how about... What else were they promising that was going to be really cool?
2424855	2425436	The Wii Connect 24.
2427546	2429067	Providing updates automatically.
2429547	2429968	Notice!
2430208	2432950	All these promises and nothing following through.
2433190	2435951	You know, I will let this slide, Nintendo, because you know what?
2436012	2439394	In all honesty, Metroid will never be as good 3D as it was in 2D.
2439574	2445217	You can argue with me all you want on that one, but I just feel very strongly that Super Metroid was the all-time greatest Metroid game.
2445418	2448299	And there will never be a Metroid game as good as Super Metroid.
2448720	2449700	Unless... What?
2451101	2453603	They do a new one...
2454238	2457661	in the vein of Super Metroid on the DS.
2458482	2459783	Well, kinda.
2460043	2463866	I mean, on the Advance, there was Zero Mission or whatever.
2464266	2465387	Whatever.
2465427	2466708	It's not the same on a tiny screen.
2466748	2467269	That's the problem.
2467429	2468550	It's not the same on a tiny screen.
2468570	2477757	But the DS is... The first time I played Super Metroid and Crayed, you know, multi-story boss on the TV, that was the shit.
2477777	2478538	The Brinstar music.
2480059	2481460	You can't duplicate that on a DS.
2481841	2482441	Okay, Rob.
2482641	2482922	What?
2483022	2483202	What?
2483720	2484966	Rubber, rubber, rubber.
2485649	2486432	What are you doing on Thursday?
2487296	2487798	I don't know what.
2488408	2489469	We are playing Super Metroid.
2490409	2494212	You are coming to my house and we are playing Super Metroid on my 50 inch widescreen.
2494232	2496953	I'll try to make that happen if we're not house hunting because I am in the middle of that right now.
2497013	2498875	But anyway, what was I ranting about Metroid?
2498915	2502617	Oh, Nintendo, prove me wrong then about this whole online thing.
2503137	2505198	Let that be your cards on the table at E3.
2505599	2510102	I will let this Metroid Prime 3 corruption thing slide if you tell me that Smash Brothers is going to be online.
2510522	2517146	I will throw myself in front of Jamie's tank to stop her evil doings and then I will make love to all of you.
2518294	2518714	Fuck that.
2518754	2520375	I want to see it actually be online.
2520455	2527456	I don't want it being promised online, just like they promise new fucking content each day on goddamn, you know, WeConnect24.
2528177	2533438	What's the point of having my damn system connected to the internet 24 hours a day if you're not going to do anything with it?
2534638	2539079	Fuck, I even got to boot up my system before my messages will download onto it.
2539159	2540320	What the hell is this WeConnect24 shit?
2542003	2543546	Anyways, so hold on real quick.
2543566	2543907	I'm sorry.
2544127	2544327	Sorry.
2544387	2546070	Real quick comments from chat.
2546451	2551360	Mike W0440 says Metroid Prime was one of the greatest games of all time in some people's opinion.
2551861	2552161	That's right.
2552181	2553524	And some people are entitled to be wrong.
2553684	2554105	That's fine.
2554826	2555327	I'm just kidding.
2555854	2558115	Prime was a great game, but Super Metroid was better, that's all.
2558635	2561757	GS191 says, Nintendo has labeled a big disappointment.
2562257	2563978	If they add something, people want more.
2564258	2567099	Nintendo is placed on a very high pedestal and is judged as such.
2567379	2568139	You know, that's true.
2568660	2572121	As mad as I am, Nintendo has the most to lose going into this E3, right?
2574402	2577083	Sony has the most to gain, Nintendo has the most to lose.
2577543	2581365	The problem is, Nintendo, they mark themselves as being innovative people.
2582060	2587382	And they are in certain aspects, but in other aspects they're making really stupid mistakes.
2588142	2589903	Not a lot of storage on their system.
2590303	2593324	Not allowing third party or outside storage.
2593464	2603808	I mean, granted they do have the SD memory cards, but other than transferring your game saves off of it and maybe playing some MP3s in Excite Truck, it's not being used.
2604708	2607149	Or, I don't know, the whole online thing.
2609107	2613250	It's all these promises, and you get your hopes up, and they don't fucking deliver.
2613510	2615511	I want delivery, dammit!
2615791	2619073	Anyways, please read a story that will not make me want to play the FU music again.
2619794	2623156	Alright, so, Nintendo in Japan.
2623596	2625557	They're, of course, Club Nintendo.
2626818	2631461	Including, they have a lot of exclusive games that get released on there, and they get to buy them off.
2632718	2635599	with, I guess, points that you earn from buying different Nintendo games and stuff.
2636259	2643840	Such wonderful games include the Game & Watch Collection for the DS, Tingle's Balloon Fight, and now... Rad!
2644400	2644560	No.
2645020	2648181	And now, Explanation Warriors.
2648501	2652222	It's a bizarre DS game that uses the microphone for gameplay.
2652642	2659803	So, it's kind of like, I guess, a Sentai hero type thing, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
2660248	2660428	Punch!
2660468	2660628	Kick!
2687921	2688301	Kick!
2688921	2690402	Kick, goddammit, I said kick!
2690522	2690742	No!
2691182	2692022	No, I said kick!
2693502	2694003	Brew!
2694503	2694923	Brew.
2699084	2701804	Yeah, my voice was already leaving before tonight's show, by the way.
2701824	2703225	Tonight's show is just making it worse.
2703305	2705886	I just kind of wanted to get that out there because I can feel myself losing my voice.
2705906	2707186	It was already going away last night.
2708326	2709606	This is great.
2709626	2710987	This show is very healthy for me.
2711667	2715688	I think I just shaved five years off of my life with tonight's bout of anger.
2717284	2717384	Jenga!
2717404	2717804	Okay people.
2748012	2750034	Step away from the credit card.
2750635	2751095	Here's why.
2751696	2756460	Why the fuck would you buy a game that's probably not going to play very well?
2756500	2757981	Granted, okay, yeah, it's the Wii.
2758022	2759743	You can, you know, use the Wii Remote too.
2760184	2763887	Okay, but yeah, honestly, the Wii is not that sensitive.
2764728	2768151	Jenga doesn't cost, I would imagine, it's probably less than $10.
2768371	2771014	And you're going to buy a game for at least $20.
2773901	2774801	That's the low end.
2775182	2778363	I bet this Wii version would not have Truth or Dare Jenga on it.
2778643	2780584	And there is a Truth or Dare Jenga game available.
2780644	2781204	It's kind of fun.
2781884	2785085	So... I don't understand why people do this shit.
2785105	2788326	Because people are too lazy to put the block sculpture together.
2788386	2789847	Because it is a little bit painstaking.
2789867	2796309	I mean, you have to put three this way, then three this way, and three... Oh my god, and you can just, like, I don't know, stack it in the plastic thing that comes with it.
2796730	2797750	Oh, that's so difficult!
2798210	2798930	So difficult!
2798950	2800591	That is a lot of effort for some people.
2802691	2816118	What can you imagine, though, taking it out, you know, with the Wii Remote and stuff like that, and all of a sudden, your IR gets fucked up because something, you know, shiny's in the room, and it knocks the whole thing over, and you're like, fucking A, why the hell did I pay money for this damn game?
2816558	2818639	I was doing it perfect, and it fucked it up.
2818679	2819279	What the hell?
2819519	2823181	Maybe this version of Jenga will actually be online.
2823501	2824402	You could play online.
2824442	2824922	Oh, yeah.
2825242	2825683	Oh, wait.
2825743	2827003	It's Nintendo.
2827103	2827904	Never mind.
2828664	2829404	Never mind.
2829985	2832306	It can't be online, because that's not possible.
2833345	2833865	Yeah, I agree.
2833885	2835406	I have no idea why this game exists.
2837047	2839429	But we can talk about some games that will exist pretty soon.
2839889	2841150	Jamie, are you excited about Jenga?
2842050	2844452	No, I want... I miss my actual Jenga.
2846273	2850135	We should play Truth or Dare Jenga on OLR one night during a slow news week.
2850315	2855579	Because the little blocks that you pull out have little questions on them that you have to answer, or little dares you have to do.
2855959	2856840	It's dumb stuff.
2857940	2859441	It's like a Mormon Truth or Dare game.
2859461	2860842	You're not going to do anything that dirty.
2862083	2862403	Anyway...
2863287	2869390	Let's talk about some upcoming release dates over in Japan and some things you can get your hands on pretty soon.
2869871	2873652	Let's talk about the Xbox 360 on July 12th.
2873712	2879875	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 makes its way to the Japanese audience thanks to Ubisoft.
2879976	2881816	That's on the Xbox 360.
2882557	2890841	Going over to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Quest Swords finally shows up on July 12th from Squeenix on the Nintendo Wii.
2891795	2892055	Gundam Musou
2907508	2914970	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games are going into the best hits, so they're getting big price reductions over there in Japan.
2915611	2919512	Also, Disgaea, Hour of Darkness 2 is also getting a price cut.
2920052	2928374	Not a whole lot of new games coming out over there in Japan, although if you're a music game fan, you probably already have Poppin' Music 14 Fever pre-ordered.
2928694	2929475	Poppin' Music 14, of course, the
2930649	2931750	EZUMO ZERO Adventure Game
2956497	2961138	And it's yet another title that has a very nice looking anime chick on the front.
2961158	2963959	I'm sure that's like every other game of that type.
2964879	2968260	I'm totally labeling this based on the box art alone.
2969140	2971661	On the Nintendo DS, Death Note.
2971681	2974642	There's a Death Note game coming out in Konami.
2974702	2975542	Yes, I need this.
2975902	2977242	So you'll like that one.
2977862	2980563	And Monster Farm DS also coming out.
2981450	2988514	One of my favorite titles, I have no idea what this is supposed to mean, but it's Kirarin Revolution Mezase Idol Queen.
2989394	2995938	It's a strategy game from Konami, but it looks like a pop idol kind of contest.
2996398	3001260	And the chick's wearing a cowboy hat and winking at you on the box art cover, so I have no idea what the hell that game's supposed to be.
3002361	3006043	Over on the PSP, coming out on July 12th over in Japan...
3007617	3011378	You have Tekken Dark Resurrection getting a price cut, and that's it.
3011438	3011978	No new games.
3012779	3013239	There you have it.
3013419	3014219	Japanese releases.
3014519	3016160	I was going to mention something real quick.
3016180	3022562	The DDR Hottest Party page finally made it up on the Japanese site for Konami.
3023062	3029984	And I thought there were some interesting... They had quotes from all the music directors and stuff from other Bomani games in Japan.
3030084	3034225	And they have some really interesting quotes like, This game is killing it.
3035185	3037106	The Dance Dance Revolution Extreme director...
3037937	3040758	Um, Inubuzu, which I thought was funny.
3040958	3046861	That's what happens when I don't play DDR for like six months and I try to play like a ten foot song on the arcade.
3046881	3048422	I go, this game is killing me.
3050903	3051183	You know.
3051963	3052163	What?
3053544	3055005	I actually passed a nine footer the other day.
3055945	3056965	Wow, can I shake your hand?
3056985	3057826	After a year of not playing.
3059447	3061728	No, that's good, but did you want to die afterwards?
3061888	3063528	Yes, I did, freaking Kakame.
3063708	3064869	This game is killing it.
3067213	3069274	Anyhow, more release dates, please, Loki.
3069474	3074336	Well, if you're looking for console games this week, keep looking.
3074957	3078999	The only thing that you are going to find, though, is Project Silphid for the 360.
3079779	3081560	That's going to be making its way out this week.
3081640	3082580	Didn't that already come out?
3083060	3083200	No.
3084121	3085261	It is coming out this week, though.
3087568	3117038	and that's about it for console games now for handhelds though we've got a few things Smash Court Tennis 3 is coming out to the PSP as well as Riviera The Promised Land is also making its way out to the PSP see for the DS just Vegas Casino High 5 that's making its way out and then on the PC not a whole lot of good stuff but yet again it doesn't
3117768	3124292	Cease to Amaze Me, another tycoon game, Ride Carnival Tycoon, coming out.
3124472	3126793	I swear to God, there's a new one every fucking week.
3127954	3131716	I can probably play that piece of shit online, but I still can't take my Wii online.
3134497	3138079	Anyhow, how about some European release dates for the listeners?
3138700	3140721	Well, we have a few interesting things.
3142434	3148736	Actually, on the 13th is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Game Boy Advance.
3149397	3150757	Mario Party 8 for Wii.
3151277	3155779	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, also on the 13th for PC.
3156579	3161021	On the 20th, we have The Darkness and Transformers The Game on DS.
3161081	3162121	Sorry, the DS release.
3162381	3167123	And then on the 21st, the one thing everybody's been looking forward to on the PC.
3167183	3168323	This is so exciting.
3169403	3170824	Brian Lara's International Cricket.
3172068	3172589	Hooray!
3173149	3173990	I'm so excited.
3176212	3177874	Because everybody loves cricket.
3180056	3180396	Yeah.
3180716	3183880	And to that statement, I hear a chorus of crickets in the background.
3186402	3187223	Oh god, I'm fired.
3187243	3190326	Wasn't that that little doll that you'd put the tape in her back and she'd read you a story?
3191147	3191407	What?
3192128	3193048	It was called Cricket.
3193268	3194129	It was Teddy Ruxpin.
3194749	3196030	Have you been reading Penny Arcade lately?
3196230	3196510	No.
3196750	3198231	They're doing like... I don't read.
3199392	3202393	They're doing like hardcore Teddy Ruxpin, the action hero.
3202453	3203134	Now that's cool.
3204495	3210618	There should be like a fighting game with our childhood favorites, like Teddy Ruxpin versus a Cabbage Patch doll.
3210798	3211719	Now, here's the thing.
3212099	3217582	You probably never played this game, but it's a... I don't know if it's a tabletop RPG, but it is an RPG.
3219123	3219203	Um...
3220000	3223681	It's called Fuzzy Heroes, and you use stuffed animals.
3224801	3229383	I swear to God, you use stuffed animals as characters in the game.
3229923	3234084	And based on what the stuffed animal has attributes and stuff, you have different attack abilities.
3234284	3241686	And it's a tactical, I guess, I don't know what you'd call it, tabletop RPG, but it's basically like a tabletop RPG.
3242227	3245127	And you move them around and stuff, and you attack with different abilities.
3245328	3246868	So, for example, I had...
3247543	3249184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3276581	3277465	It's an interesting idea.
3278288	3279252	We could do that with Lugen.
3280215	3280416	Yeah.
3282324	3282544	What?
3283573	3284773	Oh my God, Rob.
3284853	3290595	Here's what Miklatov... Best radio ever.
3290615	3297017	Sometimes I wish this were a TV show, but here is the present that Miklatov, Rice Princess, and Extafural went together and got me.
3297517	3301379	It's a panda bear wearing stripper boots and a tutu.
3301499	3302139	A pink tutu.
3302179	3308861	A pink tutu carrying a little wand with a... Jonas just joined us, by the way, and he's making this face like OMG.
3309101	3312402	Jonas, can you please describe this... Her name is Sassy Pants, by the way.
3313062	3315203	Can you please describe Sassy Pants to the listeners?
3316584	3317204	And welcome to the show.
3317224	3318544	How could I even explain?
3318584	3320185	What the hell is this?
3320205	3322346	It's a panda bear wearing a pink tutu and stripper boots.
3322726	3326168	So what I'm curious, how would Sassy Pants fare in Fuzzy Heroes?
3326648	3329209	Because I think she would dominate because she can cast magic.
3329669	3329949	True.
3330269	3332370	She has stripper boots, so you know she can kick.
3332470	3334391	So I want to play Fuzzy Heroes with Sassy Pants.
3335783	3340327	I'm not sure because I unfortunately don't have the rulebook in front of me.
3340707	3341628	This is someone else's thing.
3341948	3343750	But okay, it's a game.
3344050	3349195	If you go to fuzzyheroes.com, I think you can still buy the book.
3350344	3354427	But anyways, it's created by InnerCity Games Designs.
3355147	3357929	And let me see if I can read a brief description of what the game is.
3359049	3365053	InnerCity Games Designs is probably best known for our Fuzzy Heroes line of miniature gaming products.
3365593	3372477	Products that use stuffed toys and action figures as miniature combatants in 3D strategic simulations.
3373017	3378000	These games are designed to be introductory for those who are new to the miniatures hobby, but we both...
3378757	3383479	but with both enough depth and humor to engage the veteran miniatures gamer as well.
3384399	3391641	We still make Fuzzy Heroes and in fact are gearing up for another set of both games and comics for this.
3391941	3393162	I guess they have comics for this too.
3395783	3403165	We also make several independent toy related games including Very Large Creature, Stuffed Toys vs. Miniatures, and
3403875	3410301	Sports Fuzz, 3D football using toys, beer bottles, and whatever happens to be lying around.
3411380	3418185	By the way, Sassy Pants' tiara fell off, so I found that in the living room, but there's also that, which must add some magical powers to it.
3418766	3426992	I don't know, but I swear you can probably find this in a comic shop, any place that has the miniatures, tabletop strategy games and stuff.
3427012	3428834	We're spending far too much time on this topic.
3429254	3429574	Sorry.
3429935	3430895	No, it's funny.
3430995	3432797	I'd never heard of this.
3432857	3434058	It would be fun for, like,
3434898	3436119	That'd be a fun thing to record.
3436139	3438040	Yeah, for YouTube or something.
3438060	3439441	OLR Plays Fuzzy Heroes.
3440141	3443082	I wanted to say, though, about the Harry Potter game that's coming out.
3443383	3446184	It came out here, obviously, already, and I actually got to see it this week.
3446204	3447825	I forgot to say it during my game week because I didn't play it.
3447845	3448885	I watched somebody else play it.
3449326	3450006	It looked boring.
3450046	3451467	It looked like all the other Harry Potter games.
3451947	3453267	I mean, because I was really excited.
3453287	3454428	It's because they're not very great.
3454448	3457650	I was excited about getting to cast magic with the Wiimote.
3457970	3462112	The funniest thing, though, is when my friend Eddie, who was playing it, picked up the table...
3462592	3464013	and was slamming it into people.
3464053	3465895	They would go, oh, oh, that hurts.
3466235	3466875	Oh, that hurts.
3467236	3468256	The game's really funny.
3468717	3472340	It's like you go to Hogwarts and then you run errands for people.
3472400	3473901	It's like Hogwarts errand boy.
3473941	3477523	The game is really what... No, it's like Animal Crossing at Hogwarts.
3478824	3480265	Except Animal Crossing is more fun.
3480466	3480746	Yeah.
3481346	3484308	You can, instead of shaking trees, you get beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
3486630	3486790	Anyway.
3487371	3487591	Anyway.
3488140	3492802	I just wanted to say that real quickly, because I watched the Harry Potter game, and it wasn't all that.
3493322	3495783	Anyway, Australia.
3496083	3503046	We haven't talked a lot about what's going on in Australia, but if you are a Wii owner in Australia, you have some good news for you this week.
3503807	3511830	You got a ton of virtual console games this week, which is very interesting, and that's why we're kind of wanting to report it on the show, is that Nintendo can certainly...
3512631	3515092	Just push out like a shitload of games all at once.
3515152	3515592	Listen to this.
3516433	3518234	Australians got like all of this in one week here.
3518554	3527158	Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, Alien Crush, Military Madness, R-Type, Dungeon Explorer, Soldier Blade, Motor Rotor, and Vigilante.
3527458	3531160	So if you're a TurboGrafx fan in Australia, you had a very good week this week.
3531400	3532480	Hey, Rob, while we're at it.
3532680	3532861	What?
3534882	3537203	There were actually new releases for...
3538752	3540313	and actually now I'm trying to find them again.
3540353	3547297	There were new releases for a virtual console in the UK as well and I unfortunately just lost my link to it.
3548017	3548658	Super Mario Bros.
3548838	3549958	2 in the US.
3550399	3550939	Oh, and over there?
3551699	3552840	I do believe that was one of them.
3553140	3557843	I just had it and I feel really crappy about it because I just looked all this up last night.
3558023	3560424	I think Paper Mario is supposed to be coming over here pretty soon too.
3560624	3562305	Have they said what's coming out over here on Monday?
3563646	3564206	Nothing yet?
3564386	3567468	I saw Paper Mario 4 I think is one of the other regions.
3567924	3575548	Okay, the virtual console for UK, actually, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 just came out.
3575608	3580831	Golden Axe 2, Echo Tides of Time, Dragon Spirit.
3582111	3583152	Those are the games that just came out.
3583192	3585313	I think we got most of those over here already, I think.
3586233	3590495	So, for once, Europe didn't beat us to the punch on virtual console, because they have been lately.
3590535	3592977	They did get some really good games, because I love Echo Tides of Time.
3594457	3596699	Sadly, though, I think this is the Mega Drive version and not the...
3598180	3599041	Mega CD one.
3600422	3600862	Oh, good point.
3600882	3604565	James Patrick in chat says, Australia never saw the release of the TurboGrafx at all.
3605065	3609068	So if you're a TurboGrafx fan living in Australia, you might be the only one.
3609549	3610229	You're a rarity.
3611590	3613512	Either that or you were a major hardcore importer.
3613532	3614913	Yeah, you're a hardcore importer.
3615794	3623760	Another game that's coming out here later in the fall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, is going to be supporting co-op gameplay as well.
3623780	3625241	I mean, what good gun game
3625882	3627023	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3654278	3659642	They did an online game, I thought, with Resident Evil where if you got bit, you became a zombie and stuff.
3659762	3661484	But I think they should do Marvel Zombies the game.
3662825	3664366	Where you're a superhero zombie.
3664466	3666988	Or a George Romero zombie type game or something.
3667328	3668749	I don't know, I guess that's what Dead Rising was.
3668809	3670370	But like one where you actually get to be the zombie.
3670390	3671972	That would be kind of fun, like an online game.
3672612	3675454	Oh, I guess, but that was Resident Evil on PS2, wasn't it?
3675554	3676695	I want Marvel Zombies the game.
3676775	3678356	But make it good this time.
3678437	3679137	Make it memorable.
3679698	3681679	Well, hey, I have something that's memorable.
3681699	3682259	What's that?
3682279	3684141	People were crackheads like me back in the day.
3686035	3689616	Ragnarok Online is going to be on Japanese DS in 2008.
3689836	3700940	The game is also going to be released with Sakana no Aselbo, which is a fishing game.
3703700	3706821	Sorry, there's actually going to be an Ikebana game.
3708062	3709342	Ikebana is flower arranging, by the way.
3710492	3734624	But Ragnarok Online is going to be in real time using the Nintendo Wi-Fi And it's supposed to be, I guess, tailored to the DS But it's only going to be out in Japan right now Which means I'm going to be importing it and sitting around with my dictionary Either that or I will just probably remember where all the shit is anyway Because I played Ragnarok Online for, what, five, six years?
3734892	3739934	Well, there's really only one phrase that you need to know in Japanese, and that's, we ban you.
3741135	3743515	Yeah, but actually, theRobD makes an interesting point.
3743555	3745816	Why are they calling it Ragnarok Online when it's not online?
3746877	3747257	It is online.
3747297	3748017	It's going to be on Wi-Fi.
3748918	3752039	Oh.
3752119	3752659	Touche.
3753740	3754220	So much for that.
3755080	3761923	Also, speaking of quirky games coming over from overseas, Majesco is going to be making a local version of Furufuru Park.
3762263	3764524	It was a game that came out in Japan in April, and get this,
3764946	3765686	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3792796	3793497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3815492	3818153	By the way, the game also has original type of games.
3818173	3822054	There's a karate game, a safe-cracking game, so it's not just retro classics.
3822495	3825796	But minigame fun, because who doesn't love their minigames on the Wii?
3826856	3828177	That's what I live for on the Wii.
3828857	3833559	Well, something very interesting that's going to be coming to arcades pretty soon.
3834959	3839401	Capcom is actually doing an original 2D fighting game.
3840201	3843062	It's going to be the first one that they've done in three years.
3843957	3844737	And it's coming soon.
3844777	3848458	There's a new teaser page on Capcom Japan's site.
3849578	3861161	No word exactly on what it is, although it looks very promising, seeing as some of the shots we've seen so far of the Street Fighter 2 HD for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and stuff.
3861741	3862402	Looks awesome.
3863082	3865002	Do you really think they'd put out Street Fighter 4?
3866463	3867863	No, not for another five years.
3868587	3870288	If Street Fighter 3 was any indication.
3870348	3871989	I think we need another Marvel vs. Capcom.
3872049	3872649	You know what we need?
3872689	3874010	We need a Cyberbot sequel.
3874110	3876491	Because Cyberbot is Capcom's number one fighting game.
3877491	3878232	Interesting choice.
3878432	3879852	To quote Puzzle Fighter, anyway.
3880473	3883674	Let's see, you could have... It's the game that gave us Devilot and Super 8.
3884254	3888737	Capcom and SNK vs. Marvel and... I don't know, your mom.
3888817	3889997	Arcades vs. Comics.
3890037	3890477	There you go.
3890557	3894599	It'll be like... Arcade fighting games vs. comic characters.
3894619	3894860	No, no, no.
3894880	3896040	We just need a new Cyberbot.
3896620	3897721	We need a new Cyberbot.
3898496	3901257	and another Red Earth.
3901717	3903417	How about another Darkstalkers game?
3904298	3907038	That would be cool.
3907058	3907358	I don't know.
3907378	3909119	It's all about a dude who played with his blood.
3909139	3911479	That'd be cool.
3911959	3916921	Going to chatroomchat.orangelandre.com Rob D says, New Capcom 2D fighter?
3917101	3917421	I'm in.
3917481	3918481	No questions asked.
3919581	3920222	Let's see.
3921322	3925283	Shadow Charlie says, But fucking yeah, another Cyberbots.
3926420	3927120	Hell yeah!
3927300	3938465	What they need to do is they need to get, like, you know how they have the Triforce thing for, you know, the F-Zero stuff, whereas Sega and, you know, Namco and Nintendo, they need to do something like that for fighting games.
3938485	3942106	You need to get SNK, Capcom, and, I don't know, maybe Sega, I guess.
3943106	3948849	And do, like, some sort of all-encompassing thing that has a lot of characters from all these different games.
3949069	3953210	You know, you think all those brilliant minds put together could, like, I don't know, save arcades?
3954951	3955051	No.
3955071	3955111	No.
3957148	3957488	Blood Orgy
3984982	3985242	No.
3986062	3987704	I want a new Rival Schools.
3989025	3989145	Ah.
3989685	3995409	I played the crap out of the first one, out of the Evolution one.
3995489	3997150	I paid 90 bucks for the Evolution one.
3997290	4000593	Well, no, there was a rumor about the Apollo Justice game or whatever.
4000993	4006177	That was a subtitle and people are thinking it's either a new Phoenix Wright game or a new Rival Schools game, so...
4007199	4021551	You know what, DJ Dark Knight makes this joke in chat, the super ultimate extreme fighting combat tournament, and that makes me think, oh my god, why doesn't Capcom and Midway just get together, give the fans what they want, Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat, come on, that would be hot.
4021991	4022832	That would be hot!
4023968	4024748	It wouldn't work.
4025049	4027930	They would have to use the really shitball Street Fighter of the game.
4028050	4028711	Actually, no.
4028731	4029411	And Mortal Kombat.
4029551	4030111	Actually, no.
4030171	4033213	They could take the Mortal Kombat characters and make them all cool.
4033333	4034794	With the EX.
4034854	4038096	Or with the more recent ones that are all 3D, they could use the Street Fighter EX.
4039252	4040372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4064972	4068314	But they would never do that because it would be awesome and make sense.
4068474	4071355	Ross Steel UT says Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat wouldn't work.
4071395	4072356	The games are too different.
4072736	4079219	I don't know though, but they made, I mean, they made Capcom fight comic book characters and that somehow worked.
4079439	4089945	I mean... And, you know, Marvel vs. or Capcom vs. SNK, you know, and... It could, I mean, I understand because there's a lot of weaponry that goes into Mortal Kombat and it's a much darker game.
4090365	4094347	Yes, it's a total fanboy thing I'm going off on here with, but come on, in
4095979	4097640	Indulge me for just like five seconds.
4097780	4098680	It might be a fun game.
4100901	4107322	If you don't mind me going to a previous topic, by the way, the Ragnarok Online DS is not actually online.
4107383	4112584	They just have multiplayer elements over Wi-Fi.
4112724	4121187	I'm going to refrain from making the obvious joke here about Nintendo because I'm irritating some folks in chat, although they can kiss my big fat butt.
4121207	4122107	They should just do it on Wii.
4123010	4126451	But instead of your little Ragnarok characters, you have your Miis.
4127371	4128111	Oh, that might be cute.
4128151	4129531	You have, like, Ragnami.
4131051	4131671	Ragnami.
4133932	4134592	You're weird.
4135792	4138413	Alright, enough of this whole fighting game talk.
4138453	4140533	Somebody please bring up another topic.
4141673	4147494	Well, anyone who's a fan of Valkyrie Profile will be happy that Valkyrie Profile 2 has a date.
4148054	4150475	It will be out on the 7th of September!
4151655	4152035	Yay!
4153527	4160938	So, um, the, uh, this one is, uh, you know, got a different story.
4161098	4168669	There's going to be the youngest of three Valkyrie is, uh, booted out of heaven and has to go do shit.
4170967	4173128	That would suck to get booted out of heaven, actually.
4173648	4177250	This is one of those series I've wanted to play but haven't gotten a chance to check out.
4177270	4180531	Well, seeing as how if you're Valkyrie, you have to fight all the time and then pick people to die.
4180551	4183492	So I think being booted out of heaven might not be so bad.
4183792	4188254	The only other game with a Valkyrie I can think of is Gauntlet because I always used to play Blue Valkyrie.
4188754	4189435	Or Macross.
4189855	4190595	Blue Valkyrie.
4190635	4192496	Yeah, but that's a different kind of Valkyrie.
4192636	4193116	Duh.
4193796	4196437	I like that Valkyrie a lot better.
4196477	4199899	Dude, I wouldn't mind having the one where you use your brain like in Macross+.
4203028	4203489	The YF21.
4203969	4204410	That was it.
4205931	4206192	Anyway.
4206973	4212158	You know, a lot of folks in chat, going back to the fighting game topic for a moment, now they're getting all Killer Instinct on it.
4212198	4214160	They're like, who owns Killer Instinct now?
4214180	4215461	Who cares?
4215522	4216723	Killer Instinct sucked.
4217692	4221193	I actually have both of them.
4221893	4224373	I have the one on Nintendo 64.
4225013	4225993	I forgot they had it on 64.
4226314	4228094	Yeah, they did KI2 Gold.
4228114	4228754	That's right.
4228974	4229374	Good times.
4229394	4235775	And I remember, this was before I moved out here, I had Dan play the game over and over and over again just to rip me Orchid's music.
4237055	4240516	SSJ100Matt says, Rare says they have no intention of doing a new Killer Instinct.
4241896	4243957	DIAF Rare.
4244577	4246637	Actually, I did play a Rare game at the party.
4247697	4248197	Pinbot.
4249639	4251421	Rare published Pinbot for the Nintendo.
4251762	4257128	But thank God, though, they're going to be doing that Banjo-Kazooie sequel.
4257148	4257208	Woo!
4257829	4258870	Cannot wait.
4259010	4262515	That's going to be so awesome and totally won't suck.
4263880	4266441	All right, look, let's change the topic completely here.
4266541	4273904	One last topic for this Part A, then we're going to go into a break and come back for Part B. Talking about the Simpsons game, you know, the Simpsons have a game coming out.
4274384	4277465	It's no coincidence there's a movie, and pretty soon there'll be a game.
4277785	4280406	And this game is like a spoof of every other video game, yes?
4280787	4280967	Yes.
4281607	4285428	Well, the ultimate spoof waits for you at the very end of the game.
4285768	4289290	The very last boss, the final boss in the Simpsons game is...
4289870	4293572	Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, is who you will face at the very end of the game.
4293652	4294333	Ooh, spoiler!
4294833	4297094	Yeah, sorry, OMG spoiler, but, you know, come on.
4297134	4299295	You don't play a Simpsons game for the plot.
4299596	4300576	You play it because it's funny.
4300636	4303318	The game looks sexy, too, by the way.
4303738	4306379	And this is like EA's first Simpsons game.
4307100	4308561	It looks awesome.
4308601	4308841	Good.
4308881	4309761	Well, props to EA.
4310041	4313623	You know, sometimes we dog on that company a little bit on this show, but props to them if they pull this off.
4313784	4317966	Definitely not anything like Superman Returns, the game.
4319372	4325320	The Simpsons game, by the way, will be out this fall, so it's going to miss the movie, but probably make it in time for the DVD release, yes?
4326141	4327142	That would be my guess.
4328223	4328884	Let's see.
4328904	4332128	TheRobD says, you totally spoiled the Simpsons game I wasn't going to play.
4332188	4332729	How could you?
4333670	4336594	SSJ100Matt says, still waiting on Simpsons arcade game on 360. 360.
4337756	4339397	You never know, the movie's around the corner.
4339417	4339857	It could happen.
4339997	4340737	It could happen.
4341017	4341537	And you know.
4341877	4349600	But again, it's going to be like that whole, you know, Konami and Ubisoft had to kind of team up to get us Ninja Turtles, so what, Konami and EA are going to have to team up to get us Simpsons, right?
4350040	4350660	Could happen, though.
4351400	4353241	Who knows?
4353401	4357982	It very well could be like Doom, where it's like, Doom, there it is.
4358923	4360983	We didn't tell you about it, so there it is.
4361423	4363924	That's exactly what Peter Moore said at the press conference, too.
4363964	4365925	It's like, Doom, there it is.
4370478	4371179	Yeah, we need a break.
4372680	4373821	I know, that's how I feel too.
4373842	4377465	We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with a little more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4377505	4379748	Hey, and part B tonight, listless.
4380689	4384372	E3 is just around the corner, so we need to do an honorary E3 listless.
4384412	4390579	If you haven't heard listless before, definitely stay tuned for part B. And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
