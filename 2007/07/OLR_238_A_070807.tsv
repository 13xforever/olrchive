0	21040	The PlayStation 3 might be getting a price cut in the name of E3, notable games may not
21040	26280	even show up in E3, and lots of tunes are dying over a new advertisement in World of
26280	33280	Warcraft.
56280	82080	So, let's
82080	83400	have a contest on the program.
83400	96520	In
96520	100800	the next on
100800	101800	Actually, who knows?
101800	102800	How's your week been?
102800	103800	It's been good.
103800	106160	Now, you saw Transformers last week and told us all about it.
106160	107760	You seen anything new this week?
107760	108760	No.
108760	113320	Actually, I meant to see Transformers again this week, but I got lazy.
113320	118040	We got out of work early on the 3rd, and I was like, you know, I could go see Transformers
118040	119040	again.
119040	121780	But then I got out to my car and it was hot, and I was like, I just want to go home and
121780	122780	sit in the air conditioning.
122780	127880	It's been very hot here in Sacramento, where our show is based, like 106 or 107.
127880	128880	This week's been crazy.
128880	129880	At least we don't have humidity.
129880	133640	Anyway, you'd think we were a movie podcast or something, but we're actually not.
133640	136760	We talk about video games, so we're going to start off tonight's program as we always
136760	138400	do, talking about how was your gaming week.
138400	141800	But first, I want to introduce our chat room.
141800	143980	It's over at chat.orangelawnsradio.com.
143980	148660	We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, and interesting things always happen if you're
148660	152600	listening live, such as if you listen tonight, we had to do two takes of our intro because
152600	153600	I made a big boo-boo.
153600	157560	So, if you want to hear the whole show, you've got to listen live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock
157560	162920	Pacific Standard Time at orangelawnsradio.com on our live 365 feed, and you can always participate
162920	163920	in our chat room.
163920	164920	Chat.orangelawnsradio.com.
164920	166720	We'll also be opening up our Skype line later on.
166720	171760	That's also a telephone number, an 877 number you can call into, and we'll get those calls
171760	172760	a little later on in the program.
172760	177440	But first, Dark Soccer's going to tell us all about her gaming week.
177440	178800	I had one.
178800	182720	I did try to play Super Mario World of Warcraft, and then I got tired of updating all that
182720	183720	crap.
183720	189640	So, what I did was play a little bit of Pokemans.
189640	190640	How's Pokemans been going?
190640	194160	We had an email, actually, last week asking how you were doing on your Pokemans, and you
194160	195160	weren't here.
195160	196160	I'm hardly doing.
196160	197160	That's what I answered.
197160	198160	I played a crap ton of pinball.
198160	199160	We got two new machines.
199160	204960	We finally got rid of Retardo Johnny Mnemonic, and we got rid of Guns N' Roses.
204960	212560	We have a Simpsons pinball party now, which is really freaking cool, and we have World
212560	216760	Cup Soccer, which was my favorite machine ever.
216760	222240	Of course, my first time playing it, I cracked a billion points, which just goes to show
222240	226280	that my mad skills at that game have only diminished very slightly, because I could
226280	227280	at least...
227280	229240	Because you didn't break two billion.
229240	230480	I've almost gotten there.
230480	233520	I was really, really good at that machine.
233520	235920	I also played the Spiderman pinball today.
235920	239960	The new one does really, really good, and I kept hitting Sandman over and over and over
239960	240960	again.
240960	244040	Thank God for being a bad, bad guy in the movie.
244040	245040	The end.
245040	247120	Low-key, how was your gaming week?
247120	249120	And less dramatic, please.
249120	250120	It was good.
250120	251120	We finally hooked up.
251120	257840	Well, we have a temporary setup for the 360 LAN systems at my work now, so we tried a
257840	261480	few test games of Saints Row, and it's fun.
261480	262480	I can't wait.
262480	265280	The only problem is, right now we have...
265280	269500	Some of the systems have the patch for the multiplayer in it so that there's no lag,
269500	273840	and some of them don't, so we ran into a few issues with that.
273840	280400	But one thing that's awesome in the game is the pimp slap power-up that you can get.
280400	285040	Basically, you run around with a pimp hat on, you can backhand people and fling them
285040	288920	across the entire stage, which is awesome.
288920	293220	The only problem is the game only has three multiplayer maps, which kind of sucks, and
293220	300840	I've been kind of spoiled with Infinite Sprint and Grand Theft Auto, so it'll hold this over
300840	303480	until Grand Theft Auto IV.
303480	307220	Been playing lots of Final Fantasy on the PSP.
307220	311720	I don't know why, but I've been playing it, and it's pretty good.
311720	318040	Just finished, was actually getting the TNT to the dwarves so they can blow up that one
318040	323080	part of the map to allow you to sail the ship outside a little sea that's in the middle
323080	324680	there.
324680	325680	So that's kind of neat.
325680	333640	And then, other than that, I played Transformers the game, and I think last week I said that
333640	336680	it was an alright game, obviously there's some flaws in it and stuff.
336680	342320	I want to rescind that and say that the game blows ass and it's awful.
342320	347900	The more you play it, the more you realize the game is really, really awful.
347900	352000	I got so frustrated with the game, it's so bad.
352000	358640	I was fighting Starscream and Blackout, and first you have to fight Starscream, and then
358640	362000	you eventually have to fight Blackout, then you have to fight them both together.
362000	367520	Well, the little drones that they throw down in the middle were actually harder than Starscream
367520	370680	and Blackout, which is stupid.
370680	377360	But the whole game is very glitchy, and I highly recommend not playing it.
377360	383180	I will play it through to get some more achievement points, but I'm going to quickly sell this.
383180	385320	But you did give this game a favorable review last week, right?
385320	386320	It was okay.
386320	388040	You know, some of the missions are alright.
388040	391400	I haven't played too many of the Decepticon missions, I'm still playing through the Autobots
391400	395120	because I want to play the worst part of the game first and then play stuff where you have
395120	396840	to blow up things.
396840	403800	But I actually watched my friend play the first mission of the Decepticons, and it didn't
403800	406360	look that much more fun, actually.
406360	409800	It looked like it sucked, so I don't know.
409800	413360	It's just a really bad game, I guess, unfortunately.
413360	416960	Tigerclaw, a big, big Transformers nerd, has some advice for you.
416960	420000	Loki, Loki, to beat the drones, you have to throw things at them first.
420000	424680	I understand that, and that's what I was doing because obviously each drone has the same
424680	429880	damn pattern to them, and I was throwing stuff and it wasn't doing anything.
429880	431480	So it was dumb.
431480	433440	Now, this happens sometimes.
433440	436680	We do change our opinions on video games, and not something that's really talked about
436680	437680	a whole lot.
437680	439320	You know, sometimes this happens with movies.
439320	443000	You may watch a movie one time and you didn't like it, but then the second time you watch
443000	444320	it you see something you didn't see before.
444320	445840	Sometimes that happens with games, too.
445840	449760	Can you think of other games that you've ever changed your mind on after playing them, either
449760	455920	favorably or unfavorably?
455920	458300	I can't think of anything offhand.
458300	462440	Maybe Guitar Hero was cool in the beginning and it kind of sucks now.
462440	468640	And then again, music games for me right now, I just can't dedicate enough time to them.
468640	470640	So I don't know.
470640	473520	I would say World of Warcraft, I didn't get into it the first time I played it.
473520	475760	Maybe Final Fantasy XI, you know?
475760	477320	Yeah, maybe.
477320	479680	Because after a while, you know, it started just...
479680	481080	After two years for me.
481080	485720	Finally you get done with the low-level partying stuff and then you realize, oh yeah, this
485720	487720	kind of sucks now.
487720	493760	But I don't know, it's okay.
493760	495920	Activision is pulling an Ubisoft is what they're doing.
495920	498200	They're really letting me down with a lot of their games.
498200	500880	Or we talked about this last week briefly, Nintendogs.
500880	504600	Like I think it was the last week or two weeks ago we talked about how we all loved Nintendogs
504600	507880	when we first played it and then we actually played the full game and was like, wow, this
507880	508880	got old quick.
508880	512020	And really I can't blame Activision, I guess, too much for these games because they're not
512020	516760	developing them, but stop publishing crappy games.
516760	523880	I mean seriously, I was discussing something with you guys off-air earlier and it's like,
523880	526720	stop publishing crappy games, you know?
526720	527720	Dumb ideas.
527720	531000	What else was I going to say?
531000	535040	I was just thinking that you don't really see that a lot in the review game industry
535040	537600	where people kind of change their minds over time.
537600	538600	I don't know.
538600	540480	Not really addressed a lot, but it can happen.
540480	543000	Anyway, anything else for your gaming week?
543000	545960	No, that's pretty much it.
545960	549520	My gaming week wasn't anything too spectacular because I was still playing some World of
549520	550520	Warcraft.
550520	555720	I've been working on the Battlestar Galactica themed PvP guild because we aren't just nerds
555720	558920	playing World of Warcraft, we have to take it one step further and incorporate Battlestar
558920	562360	Galactica into our guild, so that's like double nerd.
562360	566080	So I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, but also the new game I checked out this week,
566080	570480	I did check out Missile Command on Xbox Live Arcade because I do love the old, old 2600
570480	574000	version and the old arcade version to some extent as well.
574000	577560	And the Atari ports are coming out pretty good.
577560	582200	They're cheap, they're five bucks, and the enhanced graphics are actually really good.
582200	585520	It doesn't feel like the same type of graphics.
585520	589200	They actually, when they enhanced the graphics, they enhanced it for widescreen mode as well,
589200	591200	so it kind of changes the element of Missile Command.
591200	594160	The only thing I don't really like is that I want to be able to control the game with
594160	595160	a mouse.
595160	598600	I don't like using the stick to control the game.
598600	602320	Missile Command was the type of game that was meant for a freaking trackball or a mouse,
602320	604880	which is essentially an inverted trackball, right?
604880	606680	That's why I cannot play that game with a thumbstick.
606680	610480	I need some type of mouse or trackball control to really play Missile Command.
610480	615920	But as far as the presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay, it's Missile Command.
615920	616920	And it's cheap.
616920	617920	So it's fine.
617920	622120	I remember another game that I had with favorable reviews and then they kind of went down towards
622120	623120	the end.
623120	624120	What's that?
624120	625120	Elibits was another one.
625120	626120	Yeah, me too.
626120	627120	Me too.
627120	630040	I really liked Elibits and then I was kind of like, eh, I got old.
630040	632360	It's always, it gets old, just not like that.
632360	635360	That, uh, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I think a little bit.
635360	636520	That's more of a party game though.
636520	641400	I'm trying to think of a game that I hated at first that I grew to like a lot more.
641400	643280	Oh, I know.
643280	644280	Silent Hill.
644280	646160	I didn't like Silent Hill the first time I played it.
646160	647160	And now I love it.
647160	649720	It's like totally just one of those things where I saw, I don't know, I saw something
649720	651360	I didn't see before the first time.
651360	652880	Driver 3 made peer pressure.
652880	653880	I don't know.
653880	654880	I hate the game.
654880	656880	I still hate the game, but it's fun to play.
656880	657880	Uh, Jamie.
657880	658880	Burnout.
658880	659880	Oh, Burnout.
659880	661440	I was kind of stupid at first.
661440	666520	And then when I saw how big explosions could be, I was like, I like, I like explosions
666520	671640	and wrecks and I really like them in my video games, especially when that's the whole point.
671640	672760	I had just the opposite.
672760	674680	I liked it when it first came out.
674680	679240	Um, well actually I think the one that really stood out for me is Burnout Takedown and then
679240	682240	Revenge is just kind of eh, it's okay.
682240	686080	And then, you know, the newer ones are just kind of eh, I don't care.
686080	689120	Uh, of course our chat room wants to chime in with their suggestions.
689120	691640	JV Mon says, Katamari gets old really fast.
691640	692640	Like within minutes.
692640	693640	Yeah, the PSP one.
693640	695640	That's like a perfect example.
695640	699880	Uh, let's see, um, SSJ 100 Matt is commenting on Missile Command.
699880	701360	Who needs a port when you got the real thing?
701360	703200	I finally fixed my Atari 400.
703200	707800	Well, for the enhanced mode, you know, for the enhanced mode is totally, you know, high
707800	710920	def graphics and Rayvar music and you know, all that kind of stuff.
710920	714380	And it's only five bucks, which if you think about how many quarters you popped into Missile
714380	717360	Command back in the day, five bucks is not too bad of a deal.
717360	718960	Um, but you know, it just depends.
718960	721320	I mean, some people aren't into the old retro classics.
721320	723320	I am, so it's worth it to me.
723320	726480	But if you're not into the retro upgrades, well then there's probably a lot on Xbox Live
726480	727480	you don't like.
727480	731620	Uh, but I also wanted to say I played Luminous a lot this week because of the new packs that
731620	732620	came out last week.
732620	734560	I finally got around to downloading those.
734560	738880	And now it's kind of cool because Luminous has all these different skins in it now.
738880	742680	I mean, granted, I've probably dropped like 30 bucks on the game when you count how much
742680	745200	I paid for the game and all these other packs I'm buying.
745200	747000	But the Tokyo Club pack is decent.
747000	750280	I think there's like two okay songs and two pretty good songs.
750280	751280	And the skins are all good.
751280	752680	And the booster pack has some pretty good stuff.
752680	753680	I haven't unlocked everything.
753680	755560	I think I've unlocked 13 of the 20 skins.
755560	757200	Um, there's some pretty decent stuff in there.
757200	760680	Uh, a couple recycles from the old Luminous games, which isn't much of a surprise, but
760680	761680	some new stuff as well.
761680	762680	So.
762680	763680	I did play a dance game this week.
763680	764680	I forgot.
764680	765680	No, what's that?
765680	770720	Uh, briefly played Neon FM, which, uh, went on the PC or something.
770720	772720	Yeah, I got leaked in there.
772720	775480	But, uh, well, it never got made, let me put it that way.
775480	776480	It's okay.
776480	779200	It would have been pretty cool if they had the dance pads for it and stuff.
779200	781200	It's just, you know.
781200	784200	Uh, I guess, well, god, you want to keep interrupting my gaming week?
784200	785200	I can't think.
785200	786200	I'm done.
786200	787200	Yeah, I think I am too.
787200	788200	Luminous was really it.
788200	790720	Luminous and Missile Command and World of Warcraft and that's really it.
790720	791880	Not a whole lot else.
791880	794360	Outside the norm that I've been talking about the last few weeks on the show in regards
794360	795360	to DS.
795360	796360	Oh, come on.
796360	797360	No game tab?
797360	800600	Uh, maybe a little bit, but I'm not allowed to discuss it because I get called a whore
800600	802000	and a sellout when I do.
802000	803000	That's okay.
803000	804000	Be a whore and a sellout.
804000	805000	It's up to you.
805000	806000	Well, then I did play a little bit of game tab this week as well, yes.
806000	807760	And when did you play on game tab?
807760	809160	Uh, old Atari 2600 games.
809160	810160	That's been my thing.
810160	812520	I've been going back through leaderboards trying to get high scores on stuff.
812520	813520	I played BurgerTime too.
813520	814520	Rob likes to score.
814520	815520	Trying to remind.
815520	816520	Oh, sorry.
816520	821440	I was going to say, remind me, I need to let you, uh, loan you, um, Sam and Max season
821440	822440	one.
822440	823440	Well, you don't need to.
823440	824440	I have it on game tab.
824440	825440	I just haven't played it.
825440	826440	Then play it.
826440	827440	I know.
827440	828440	I need to.
828440	829440	All right.
829440	830440	Anyway, so that's that.
830440	832560	Let's, uh, go to some housekeeping and then we'll get into gaming news.
832560	833560	Housekeeping tonight.
833560	836480	SAC anime, we mentioned last week, we'll be going to SAC anime.
836480	839080	Uh, we only hit a little, we hit a little kink though.
839080	843320	We don't know if we're actually doing a panel at SAC anime cause, uh, communication has
843320	844920	not been so great, but that's okay.
844920	845920	Things happen.
845920	846920	It was very last minute.
846920	851080	Uh, I know at least dark Sakura is going to SAC anime, uh, and I'm going as well, so we'll
851080	852080	be around.
852080	853080	So if you're going to be there, say hi, Loki.
853080	854280	I don't know if you're going or not.
854280	855280	When is it?
855280	859840	It's next weekend at the double tree, maybe quadruple tree.
859840	863920	So we'll, you know, Hey, I got an idea.
863920	864920	Let's name it tree.
864920	866560	No, double tree.
866560	867560	Okay.
867560	869560	I was holding up for quadruple tree.
869560	870560	Anyhow.
870560	871960	Uh, that's really it.
871960	874480	We just want to mention that we'll be appearing there in one way or another, even if we're
874480	876560	just walking the floor like the rest of you.
876560	879960	And uh, again, uh, we're always looking for automate conventions in California and the
879960	884000	West coast area that we can get to, to, uh, come say hi, cause we love doing live panels
884000	887040	and that's like, you know, we, we like doing our show live.
887040	888920	I don't know if you noticed, but we've recorded live.
888920	892040	You guys have the chat room and it's a whole nother thing to have the studio audience.
892040	893880	Don't you love when everybody's staring right at you?
893880	895920	Dark Sakura, isn't that the best way to record a show?
895920	899480	I'm used to it all the time.
899480	901240	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
901240	903120	Who wants to start us off tonight?
903120	904120	I guess I could.
904120	905120	All right.
905120	906120	If I got to.
906120	907120	All right.
907120	908120	Yes, you got to.
908120	913880	Well, there is a, uh, expected a price cut coming for the PlayStation three, uh, supposed
913880	915720	to reduce by a hundred dollars.
915720	923040	Um, there was an ad put out by a circuit city saying that, um, it was going to be, uh, dropping,
923040	928880	um, right now it's 600 bucks, but I don't know, 500 might make it actually sell better.
928880	933520	I don't know, but, um, it's supposed to be in conjunction with E3.
933520	939560	So that's going to be this year's E3 speech, 499 us dollars, 499 us dollars.
939560	944200	And the rest of us are like, okay, well, I mean the other models dropping the three 99
944200	946000	other model, they're not producing it anymore.
946000	951360	Oh, I got those bastards item.
951360	954120	I didn't even think of that because when I heard about the a hundred dollar price drop,
954120	955880	I was like, oh, well then the other one will be three 99.
955880	956880	That'll be easily affordable.
956880	957880	I forgot.
957880	958880	They got rid of that.
958880	959920	Sneaky bastards.
959920	962020	I was all excited about this price drop too.
962020	963280	And I guess everyone's doing it now.
963280	967460	In fact, I think a few people at, I remember seeing some scans of target receipts where
967460	969520	people are buying them for four 99 already.
969520	972440	So it's everywhere, but it's a secret.
972440	976520	You're not supposed to know about this yet.
976520	979040	God, I have to admit though.
979040	982880	I'm still not, I'm still not sold 500 still a lot.
982880	986120	You're talking to a guy who's like moving in a few weeks and has all those expenses.
986120	988480	So I can't be thinking about video game expenses right now.
988480	992480	I mean, we're gonna play Jamie's just, I don't know people just, that's okay.
992480	994000	It's collecting dust at my house anyway.
994000	996000	And everyone's like, oh, well that makes it more affordable.
996000	997760	I'm going to buy that instead of a three 60.
997760	1001960	Well, don't you think they're going to re drop the price of a three 62 to compete with
1001960	1002960	this?
1002960	1003960	Obviously.
1003960	1007280	Otherwise actually they might leave it the same because you know, they feel it's competitive
1007280	1009600	pricing still and stuff like that.
1009600	1014360	But I would, I'd hope that they dropped the price of three 60.
1014360	1017680	Lots and lots of feedback in chat room on this raw steel UT says price drop after less
1017680	1018680	than a year.
1018680	1019680	That's a problem.
1019680	1020680	SSJ 100.
1020680	1023640	Matt says they can drop the price as much as they want, but people will still bitch.
1023640	1028200	People bitch when the Wii was $50 more and raw steel UT responds to that true.
1028200	1034560	If people had their way, they'd be free and separate off 12, 15 degrees.
1034560	1037720	We paid that $50 on the Wii for the crappy Wii sports.
1037720	1038720	But I don't know.
1038720	1043280	See as hardcore gamers, we look at Wii sports and we go, eh, you know, the, the novelty
1043280	1048600	wears off after a little bit, but seriously, I know people that are not gamers that still
1048600	1050240	all they talk about Wii tennis.
1050240	1053480	Like I was having dinner with some friends the other night who are not like the gamer
1053480	1055640	crowd and they were like, let's have a Wii party.
1055640	1056880	Let's get together and play Wii tennis.
1056880	1058100	Rob, you have a Wii, don't you?
1058100	1059500	Let's all get together and play.
1059500	1062880	And so like it's, it's still like a lot of fun for a lot of people.
1062880	1067880	Just maybe not the hardcore audience who kind of, you know, got over it after a few months.
1067880	1070320	It was kind of interesting watching the effect that has.
1070320	1071920	There you go.
1071920	1078400	JVMon suggests $499 PlayStation 3 is better competition for the Elite 360.
1078400	1081640	Gerardimo says if PlayStation 3 dropped the price, I might buy one even though there are
1081640	1082720	still no games.
1082720	1084420	Hold out.
1084420	1086660	Hold out is all I can say.
1086660	1087660	Think about it.
1087660	1091360	We're going to sucker you into buying it before the holiday season and guess what's going
1091360	1093000	to fucking come out later on?
1093000	1094080	Oh, look at that.
1094080	1098360	It's the six axis controller with rumble now and now we're including them with the new
1098360	1099360	systems.
1099360	1100360	Oops.
1100360	1101360	You already bought one.
1101360	1102760	Now you have to buy another controller too.
1102760	1103880	Just fucking wait.
1103880	1108400	There's no games really that are super huge coming out between now and Christmas anyways.
1108400	1110760	I mean, wait until the fall.
1110760	1115000	You can wait a few more months and just pick up the good games when they come out then.
1115000	1116000	So I have a question for you guys.
1116000	1119040	I already said I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner at this time and this doesn't really change
1119040	1122800	my opinion, but my question for you guys is you guys have bought PlayStation 3s.
1122800	1126040	Loki, you bought the old $499 model, which was the 20 gig.
1126040	1127920	Jamie, you guys bought the deluxe one.
1127920	1131200	Do you guys feel shafted by this?
1131200	1133320	No.
1133320	1136160	You don't feel like you got ripped off even though they're dropping the price because
1136160	1139920	maybe you've had nine months of good game play before that?
1139920	1140920	Right.
1140920	1143640	I got my PlayStation 3 first day, so I don't care.
1143640	1144640	I wouldn't call it.
1144640	1145640	I got my good out of it.
1145640	1147360	I don't really even care about it.
1147360	1152120	I got $100 off of it anyway because we used our Discover card and got money back.
1152120	1157200	I wouldn't call it good game play, but no, seriously, that's one of my reasons why I'm
1157200	1159720	telling people that they should hold off.
1159720	1162560	I have my PlayStation 3.
1162560	1165160	I bought maybe five games for it.
1165160	1168480	I sold back most of those because guess what?
1168480	1171720	They were just the 360 counterparts and they weren't any better.
1171720	1180320	I mean, Ridge Racer 7 and Full Auto 2, Motorstorm, it was pretty cool for a little bit and then
1180320	1184640	it got boring really quick and then Resistance, that's probably the only one I'd say that's
1184640	1190240	really good on it, but still, that's four games that I bought on that system since it's
1190240	1191240	come out.
1191240	1192720	How many games have I bought on the 360?
1192720	1193720	Way too many.
1193720	1200540	So Lair, Heavenly Sword, Little Big Planet, Hall, but you know Lair's been delayed to
1200540	1204760	August now and who knows, I mean, it keeps getting delayed each month, so who knows if
1204760	1206760	it's not going to end up in September anyways.
1206760	1208200	Heavenly Sword looks awesome.
1208200	1212740	I am planning on picking that one up and also, strangely enough, Ratchet and Clank, Tools
1212740	1216920	of Destruction, which you know, normally a game that I would not be interested in, but
1216920	1220400	it looks pretty cool, but that's the problem though.
1220400	1224980	It's only like a couple games, whereas the 360, I'm planning on buying a lot more than
1224980	1226800	just a couple games.
1226800	1231640	So that's a problem, because even if they do get you to buy the system, you're going
1231640	1235000	to be waiting a while for some good games, especially if you're holding out for your
1235000	1238620	Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV.
1238620	1244600	Plan on waiting about a good another, I don't know, almost nine months now until those games
1244600	1247400	come out, so if not longer.
1247400	1251920	Alright, well, with this price cut on the PlayStation 3, I mean, there's a lot of possible
1251920	1256180	factors for why this price cut is happening now, but could one of them be the pressure
1256180	1257560	from the third-party companies?
1257560	1262940	It also came out this week, just before the news of the price cut, that Sega made an interesting
1262940	1265940	comment about the pricing of the PlayStation 3.
1265940	1272640	One of the executives at Sega, Masano Madea, actually had this quote, quote, name brand,
1272640	1274680	price and software are what count.
1274680	1279080	This is what he told Reuters in an interview, quote, since it's getting difficult to make
1279080	1285600	software availability a differentiating factor, superior marketing and pricing strategy will
1285600	1287840	be the key for Sony.
1287840	1291400	So kind of interesting, he's talking about, you know, maybe Sony should change up their
1291400	1293760	strategy and look at the way that they're pricing the system.
1293760	1295280	And lo and behold, they did.
1295280	1298480	And I do think that they're changing their strategy, I mean, look at the home that's
1298480	1304360	coming out, it's, you know, a sign of good things to be coming, but I want to see them
1304360	1307680	here because, you know, promises aren't getting us anywhere.
1307680	1311060	Obviously, they promise all this shit, you know, that's supposed to be out at launch,
1311060	1315060	never came out at launch, all these delays, all these third-party games getting delayed
1315060	1318560	for the PlayStation 3 or just not coming out at all.
1318560	1322640	And then, you know, at the same time, they need to have a strong Christmas or else they're
1322640	1323640	doomed.
1323640	1329220	I mean, because already, you know, the 360s had, you know, a couple strong Christmases
1329220	1331880	already, and this is going to be the third strong one.
1331880	1335480	They've got a really good lineup, especially with Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, and God knows
1335480	1338800	what other stuff is coming out around that time.
1338800	1342180	And then the Wii, obviously, the Wii is going to take off like crazy at Christmas because
1342180	1345060	you still can't find them.
1345060	1349820	They really need to, because they're losing, you know, they're dropping behind a lot now,
1349820	1354920	and if they don't, you know, pick it up, it's going to be hard.
1354920	1361600	Now Matt, though, we are sitting just days away from E3 2007, and Sony pulled a pretty
1361600	1365540	big trump card out of their hand at Game Developers Conference and really changed a lot of people's
1365540	1367800	minds with Home and LittleBigPlanet.
1367800	1369920	Are they sitting on something else right now?
1369920	1371040	I hope they are.
1371040	1375040	And I really do, because I would like to see them be successful.
1375040	1376680	A box of Crayolas.
1376680	1377680	Sorry.
1377680	1381480	I don't have much faith in Sony.
1381480	1384040	Crash Bandicoot Paint.
1384040	1389600	There's that new Spyro game, I was watching the ads for it.
1389600	1396840	I'm sorry, if all they have to release, you know, is Spyro as far as their games go, then...
1396840	1401480	MacMan makes an interesting quote, E3 will change everything, and it's very interesting.
1401480	1403200	Yeah, it'll suck.
1403200	1404200	Because we're not there.
1404200	1405200	Exactly.
1405200	1408400	The interesting thing about E3 this year is that didn't the developers bitch that E3 was
1408400	1413600	too big of a deal, and you know, that it was ruining their game, and Sony wah wah wah'd
1413600	1418680	about E3 last year, and that's kind of the reason E3 has changed a lot, but isn't all
1418680	1421180	that same pressure still there this year?
1421180	1422960	Has anything changed?
1422960	1426380	People are still going to be making a lot of judgments based off of the cards that people
1426380	1428160	lay on the table at E3.
1428160	1430600	Whether they're there or not, we're all on the internet now.
1430600	1434160	I mean, hell, did you hear what Scott over at All Games is doing?
1434160	1437760	They're like going in there with like a live camera that's going to sit on Scott's head
1437760	1440520	so you can be at E3 with them.
1440520	1441520	It's just fucking nuts.
1441520	1446760	I mean, if they think the pressure is gone from E3 because they made this, you know,
1446760	1449880	they locked it down like Fort Knox, you're mistaken.
1449880	1450880	It's...
1450880	1451880	I understand why they...
1451880	1452880	Critics are watching you.
1452880	1458840	I understand why they did this, but they really, you know, E3 needs to succeed this year because
1458840	1462320	this is kind of a whole new experiment for them to see, you know, kind of changing things
1462320	1465920	up and supposedly they're going to get more business done, but really, when you think
1465920	1469000	about it, what kind of business can you get done at E3?
1469000	1472480	I mean, other than, you know, a lot of the press stuff where they're covering all these
1472480	1478520	games and everything, I mean, is there really, I mean, granted us, I mean, we were only like
1478520	1483000	three people at E3, maybe, you know, four or five or whatever, but, you know, obviously,
1483000	1484360	we can't see all of E3.
1484360	1489200	It's impossible to cover everything in great detail, but, you know, these larger, you know,
1489200	1491960	press outlets and stuff, it's a lot easier for them, but really, do you think there's
1491960	1494720	stuff that they're just missing from E3?
1494720	1495720	I mean, I don't...
1495720	1499720	A lot of them just say what the game companies want them to say because they just copy, paste,
1499720	1500720	press releases anyway.
1500720	1501720	Okay.
1501720	1505200	So we're going to expect them to do any more, you know, better work at these places?
1505200	1506200	No.
1506200	1509680	There's still enough of the independent press getting in.
1509680	1514040	Not as much as there should be, and, you know, I'm not saying that bitterly, I promise, but
1514040	1515040	there is...
1515040	1516040	Oh, I am.
1516040	1520720	There is enough of the independent press getting in that are not going to be corporate whores.
1520720	1524000	Oh, I'm extremely bitter.
1524000	1528280	I found out when someone from our work's going, bastard.
1528280	1529280	He's feeling it out.
1529280	1530280	Oh my God.
1530280	1531280	All right.
1531280	1534920	Anyhow, I had to say this in chat because now everybody's making plays on the E3 will
1534920	1538240	change everything because now they're coming up with their own tag lines.
1538240	1541160	Kyle Snyder says, dust cap two.
1541160	1544000	This time it's not dust cap one.
1544000	1545840	Long running orange lingerie joke there.
1545840	1548880	JV Mon says, Emodium AD will change everything.
1548880	1552480	I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean, so forget it.
1552480	1553480	I'm just excited.
1553480	1560240	I can't wait to see the press releases and all that stuff and also watching the conferences.
1560240	1567360	Anyways, another rumor that's supposedly coming out of the Sony press conference, or speculation
1567360	1573000	at least, is that the six axis controller is getting rumble as well as touch sensitivity.
1573000	1576080	It'll be interesting to see if they do that.
1576080	1582480	They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be doing, but apparently that through,
1582480	1589040	I guess, different sections of the controller, you'll be able to have touch sensitivity very
1589040	1596760	similar to, I guess like the DS touch screen, and then the rumble as well.
1596760	1602840	There's been even some confirmation on that coming because apparently in a developer's
1602840	1608600	behind the scenes video for Haze, they were showing the guy playing the game a little
1608600	1613960	bit and then all of a sudden one of the shots, oh the controller's blurred out for some reason.
1613960	1617760	That's kind of weird that it's blurred out.
1617760	1619440	Why would they do that?
1619440	1622520	I'm telling you, Sony's got more cards they're going to show at E3.
1622520	1626480	Oh yeah, Eye of Judgment.
1626480	1628320	Fuck the Eye of Judgment.
1628320	1632660	I'm telling you, PlayStation Eye is just a fucking eye toy again.
1632660	1634480	Don't be suckered into it.
1634480	1637320	I'm not suckered into it.
1637320	1642320	Well, we're all going to end up being suckers if we've got a PlayStation 3 down the line
1642320	1651540	because it looks like Sony is going to be working with the Nielsen's research folks
1651540	1655540	to see what we're playing, to see what they can advertise in.
1655540	1657340	Isn't that special?
1657340	1660880	So yeah, we're going to get more ads in our games thanks to this crap.
1660880	1664840	Hooray, and we're still going to pay $60 for them.
1664840	1667520	That's bullshit.
1667520	1670160	Big stinkin' piles of horse hockey.
1670160	1672680	Especially when they have tons of ads in games like Transformers.
1672680	1675120	Come on.
1675120	1676120	Does that mean...
1676120	1679000	Well, the whole movie was an Xbox ad, at least at the end.
1679000	1683720	Because on TV, where the Nielsen Rays are, if I want a show to get canceled, I don't
1683720	1684720	watch it.
1684720	1686560	So how do I get a game to get canceled?
1686560	1687560	Just not buy it?
1687560	1688560	Don't play it.
1688560	1689560	How do they rate it?
1689560	1690560	I don't...
1690560	1691560	How exactly are they going to monitor it?
1691560	1693880	I think it's to see who's playing what the most so that they know what type of games
1693880	1695120	to advertise in.
1695120	1696120	Interesting.
1696120	1700040	Now, doesn't Microsoft kind of already do that?
1700040	1702320	I mean, I don't know if Sony does this.
1702320	1705960	Microsoft kind of knows what you're playing all the time because you hit that little button
1705960	1708480	to see your friends list, you can see what they're all playing.
1708480	1712240	And Major Nelson posts every week, hey, these are the top 10 games on live.
1712240	1714120	So they kind of know what people are playing.
1714120	1719120	I guess only out of those boxes that are connected to live, that's still a pretty good representation.
1719120	1721360	I don't know.
1721360	1723280	We'll see.
1723280	1726960	Anyhow, one other thing that you could be playing on the PlayStation 3, and who knows
1726960	1731080	how many ads are going to be in this game, Gran Turismo 5.
1731080	1736200	Gran Turismo 5 will probably not see release until late 2008.
1736200	1741880	This was something that director Kaonori Yamauchi said to Car and Driver magazine.
1741880	1745600	Because spring of 2008 is the earliest possible release window for the game.
1745600	1751960	Sony is trying to get them to push the date, but they want the game to be absolutely perfect.
1751960	1756640	He did say, though, that there would be no crash damage physics.
1756640	1760760	The perfect damage system will actually be changing the physics of the game and modeling
1760760	1763160	of each panel of each car separately.
1763160	1767400	So I have no idea, but they're taking out crash damage physics.
1767400	1770840	But they did it in Forza.
1770840	1772760	Why can't they do it in Gran Turismo 5?
1772760	1773760	No idea.
1773760	1776600	It's kind of a weird, weird thing.
1776600	1777600	It's not a big deal.
1777600	1779880	I mean, Project Gotham, I don't think, does damage physics either.
1779880	1782000	At least it's not that I'm aware of.
1782000	1784240	I guess not every racing game does.
1784240	1787720	I mean, Gran Turismo is not Burnout.
1787720	1790440	But I guess maybe that's why I kind of get a weird phase.
1790440	1793440	Because when I think about playing racing games, I like racing games like Burnout, where
1793440	1795340	the point is to crash into shit.
1795340	1797780	And so I go, no crashing physics?
1797780	1799360	What the hell kind of racing game is this?
1799360	1801000	But then I go, yeah, that's right.
1801000	1806560	I've never really been a fan of Gran Turismo because I like my racers fake.
1806560	1808160	Not real.
1808160	1814520	Anyways, once again if you're hoping to see some cool shit, especially Final Fantasy 13
1814520	1821120	at E3, well, you better forget it because it's not going to be at E3 at all.
1821120	1823040	So boo-hoo.
1823040	1825680	Not surprising though, because I know Square Enix this year, they've been doing a lot
1825680	1830660	of Nintendo stuff like DS and PSP titles, and I think there's actually some Wii titles
1830660	1831880	in there as well.
1831880	1835040	Why did they decide not to bring Final Fantasy 13?
1835040	1836400	It's probably not done yet.
1836400	1837400	Duh.
1837400	1840320	I mean, obviously, how long did it take 12 to come out?
1840320	1843120	Well they had a freaking trailer at one, why does Square do that?
1843120	1846840	I remember my very first E3 they showed Final Fantasy 12 and then it wasn't even there
1846840	1847840	the next year.
1847840	1848840	Yeah, but here's the thing though.
1848840	1853440	They show you a trailer, but then, you know, we'll use Sony, and I think Microsoft used
1853440	1858180	the phrase, mainly Sony though, it's a target render.
1858180	1860360	This is what we hope the game to look like.
1860360	1864660	Oh, okay, thank you very much for getting my hopes up.
1864660	1868480	It's not exactly what the game is going to look like, but it's a target, you know, so
1868480	1869600	I'm going to strive to.
1869600	1873160	I mean, I'm sure the game's still going to look phenomenal and exceed a lot of folks'
1873160	1874160	expectations.
1874160	1877520	I mean, let's face it, Square's always pushed the envelope in that department, you know.
1877520	1883560	Oh, don't get me wrong, it's going to be awesome, but I'm more excited seeing, what is it, Last
1883560	1884560	Remnant.
1884560	1885560	That looks pretty cool.
1885560	1886900	That could be pretty awesome.
1886900	1888480	That's one in the Unreal Engine, huh?
1888480	1891880	I think that's going to be there, in trailer form.
1891880	1895200	You'll see, well, regardless, I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of pissed that
1895200	1898560	Final Fantasy XIII isn't going to be at E3, because that was a game I was really looking
1898560	1902920	forward to, and the game that would have finally made me buy a PlayStation 3, hands down, but
1902920	1906840	now that it's not going to be at E3, I'm a little bit angsty, and when we get angsty
1906840	1918040	here at Orange Lawns Radio, people die, and we bring on the FUs of the Week.
1918040	1920280	Dark Sakura, take it away.
1920280	1926720	My FU of the Week goes toward, um, crap I can't do anything about right now.
1926720	1928600	Very vague FU of the Week, but that's alright.
1928600	1934680	Well, just like lots of stuff, you know, things that I can work toward that, uh, you know,
1934680	1938200	are going to take a lot of hard work that aren't immediate.
1938200	1940640	I would like to see immediate results.
1940640	1942840	Unfortunately in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, does it?
1942840	1945600	So your FU is to patience, in a way.
1945600	1946600	And money.
1946600	1947600	Okay.
1947600	1948600	Patience and money.
1948600	1949600	Patience and money.
1949600	1955560	My FU goes to Stella the Kitty, because she, uh, aw, I want to meet your new kitty!
1955560	1961720	She's very persistent on chewing the power cord to the fan, and the light in our house,
1961720	1965240	and she doesn't realize that there's a lot of electricity going through that, and unfortunately
1965240	1969880	she does, very persistent on it, no matter where you move the fan, she always wants to
1969880	1970880	chew on the cords, so.
1970880	1971880	You know what you should get?
1971880	1972880	A square bottle.
1972880	1973880	No.
1973880	1974880	Bitter apple spray.
1974880	1975880	Ah, yeah.
1975880	1982160	Cats, cats are very sensitive in their noses, and, um, bitter apple is, um, a scent that
1982160	1987440	cats do not really quite care for, except unless they're nuts like one of my old cats.
1987440	1989360	He would lick it.
1989360	1990360	That cat was insane.
1990360	1994560	You do know your cat is named after a popular Atari 2600 emulator?
1994560	1997680	Well, you know, I didn't name the cat.
1997680	2004160	Actually the woman, the woman that, uh, you know, was fostering the cat, um, I guess Stella's
2004160	2006800	full, she calls her Stella-dora, so I don't know.
2006800	2010600	I'm totally gonna cat her to take pictures of your cat.
2010600	2011600	We've got plenty more.
2011600	2012960	I brought my camera, too, so.
2012960	2016720	You should tell your wife that there's a video game reference in your cat's name, she'll
2016720	2017720	love that.
2017720	2020080	She will absolutely love that.
2020080	2024720	Well, my cat was trying to play, um, the PSP last night, or basically she was trying to
2024720	2029440	chew on the headphone cord that I had while I was trying to play the PSP, but I moved
2029440	2032480	around the stuff in Final Fantasy and she was like, hey, there's stuff moving on the
2032480	2035600	screen, she kind of, like, got closer and closer and closer.
2035600	2038920	So pretty soon we'll have the cat playing the PSP or something, or, yeah.
2038920	2039920	You wanna watch her go crazy?
2039920	2040920	Take pictures of her.
2040920	2041920	Get the Jingle Cats video.
2041920	2042920	No, I need the cat.
2042920	2044720	I wanna see Stella versus Shermy.
2044720	2050220	Shermy will just sit there and be like, hi, I'm the fattest cat in the universe.
2050220	2051220	Shermy will do that.
2051220	2052280	She's like the blob.
2052280	2053280	Shermy is like E. Honda.
2053280	2054280	No, she can't.
2054280	2056920	She'll just jump up in the air and sit on Stella.
2056920	2059720	Shermy is like the blob, the immovable object.
2059720	2062960	All right, no force on earth can move the Shermy.
2062960	2064080	Can I do my FUs now?
2064080	2065080	Okay.
2065080	2068160	All right, my FU of the week goes to my new driver's license picture.
2068160	2069160	It's horrible.
2069160	2070160	Oh, come on, Rob.
2070160	2071720	Your face does not look that fat.
2071720	2074440	My face looks like a Christmas light.
2074440	2076100	It's red and fat.
2076100	2077100	It's horrible.
2077100	2078840	I just had to get a new license picture taken.
2078840	2080920	My birthday just passed since that year that my license.
2080920	2082280	I had to go in and take a new picture.
2082280	2083840	I look fat and red.
2083840	2084840	You do not.
2084840	2085840	It's horrible.
2085840	2086840	I look like I have a bowl full of jelly.
2086840	2087840	That's what I do.
2087840	2088840	It's horrible.
2088840	2090840	FU to the DMV.
2090840	2092160	Why do you do this to people?
2092160	2096320	This is why we have rampant anorexia and bulimia in our society is because of the DMV.
2096320	2097320	That's all.
2097320	2098660	I'm done.
2098660	2100920	And no, chat room, you may not have a scan.
2100920	2102560	That's personal information.
2102560	2104960	I'm not scanning my driver's license and putting it on the internet.
2104960	2106640	That's one of the dumbest things you can do.
2106640	2110460	All right, let's get back into the gaming news before I get more frustrated because
2110460	2112920	like then I'm going to take out my wallet and look at my picture again.
2112920	2114960	I'm going to get more angrier.
2114960	2121840	Well, Rob, I'm sorry I'm about to piss you off again.
2121840	2123680	Now don't we normally love Nintendo?
2123680	2125120	I love Nintendo.
2125120	2133000	Nintendo, we love you so much, but why do you have to hurt us by not having a playable
2133000	2137120	Smash Brothers at E3?
2137120	2139840	Fuckers.
2139840	2144440	So Nintendo's not going to be showing Smash Brothers at E3?
2144440	2145440	And you know what they just...
2145440	2146440	What's their excuse?
2146440	2147440	They just...
2147440	2152200	Well, it wasn't in Kojima's blog that he played an almost complete version.
2152200	2153200	Like in April.
2153200	2154200	So why not?
2154200	2155200	Why are you fucking with us, Nintendo?
2155200	2156200	Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head
2156200	2159200	with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.
2159200	2167200	Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head
2167200	2175560	with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.
2175560	2176560	Give me!
2176560	2179320	I need my pit and I need my snake.
2179320	2180320	The end.
2180320	2181320	I got a snake, man.
2181320	2183320	I got a snake, man.
2183320	2190000	One time I fed my snakes some beer.
2190000	2191720	Let's see.
2191720	2192720	Going to chat room.
2192720	2197720	TLUT says, like we don't know how Smash Brothers is going to play?
2197720	2198780	I don't care.
2198780	2199780	My God.
2199780	2208200	They do a damn update on the website every day and every blog on the face of the earth
2208200	2211200	covers the damn website.
2211200	2214220	Just go to the website and check it out each day.
2214220	2218560	We don't need to hear or see it updated every day.
2218560	2223000	I don't give a crap about the final moves and the control scheme and all that shit.
2223000	2225320	Just wait for the game to come out.
2225320	2228320	Be surprised.
2228320	2236560	Well, as if I wish I had good news for you, but the journey continues here with Nintendo
2236560	2239520	and what they are and aren't going to be showing at E3.
2239520	2241560	Actually this has nothing to do with what's at E3.
2241560	2243960	This is just the way it is.
2243960	2248840	Michael Kelba, who is actually the head of Retro Studios who is designing of course Metroid
2248840	2253800	Prime 3 corruption, in an interview recently with GamePro, he has confirmed that there
2253800	2261140	will be no online multiplayer in Metroid Prime 3 corruption.
2261140	2267380	Those of us that were hoping and thinking and speculating and convinced that Nintendo
2267380	2272060	is finally going to get into online gaming, they're finally going to open up to the world
2272060	2275120	of online gaming and Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the game that will do it.
2275120	2277500	We just got fucking shot down this week.
2277500	2284560	Way to brace next gen, or this gen, last gen, I don't know, online.
2284560	2294440	God damn it, this makes me angry.
2294440	2297600	Why won't you embrace online gaming Nintendo?
2297600	2302040	What did Phantasy Star Online episodes 1 and 2 burn you that badly?
2302040	2305760	What is your big problem with online gaming?
2305760	2309400	Why do you have to spray us with these friend codes crap?
2309400	2312280	Why won't you put your series that we love online?
2312280	2316160	Why do you give us something crappy like the new Pokemon game that's your only online game
2316160	2318400	and mediocre online stuff anyway?
2318400	2326840	Why will you not wake up to the next generation of gaming?
2326840	2332680	And I copy everything that Jamie said before about the game.
2332680	2333680	Anyways, more positive news.
2333680	2336920	Wait a minute, hold on, no, no, no, I'm going to chat for a minute.
2336920	2340920	Hitstun says even fucking Virtua Fighter 5 is going to be online now.
2340920	2346220	You know when a shitatious series like Virtua Fighter goes online and Metroid is still single
2346220	2347640	player only.
2347640	2352880	Something is fucked in this world.
2352880	2358160	RosteelUT says no Metroid Prime 3 online, good, Nintendo Online sucks anyway, but it
2358160	2359680	could have been better.
2359680	2362280	Jvmon says Pokemon Online is slow as hell.
2362280	2370880	The DS games are fine, Nintendo can do it, they're just not doing it for some reason.
2370880	2375120	RosteelUT says people who play Nintendo systems don't want online, those who want to play
2375120	2376720	online have 360.
2376720	2381960	I beg to differ, if you give them online, they will embrace online.
2381960	2387720	Moms and grandmas like to play Bejeweled Online and those fucking Popit games on Pogo and
2387720	2391420	shit and all those other games, like Poker Online, they'll play that, they'll play the
2391420	2396140	Wii Online too, they'll give me that just because it's not a hardcore gaming audience
2396140	2397140	or whatever.
2397140	2401360	This just makes me angry because I've been waiting so long for Nintendo to go online.
2401360	2408600	Was last year's E3, we're embracing online, the system is going to be, Nintendo is going
2408600	2413840	to be providing new content daily and every day you're going to be able to go to your
2413840	2419840	Nintendo Wii system and see new content, whether it be game downloads or all this shit or how
2419840	2424880	about, what else were they promising that was going to be really cool.
2424880	2432720	The Wii Connect 24, providing updates automatically, notice all these promises and nothing following
2432720	2433720	through.
2433720	2437260	You know, I will let this slide Nintendo because you know what, in all honesty, Metroid will
2437260	2439600	never be as good 3D as it was in 2D.
2439600	2442840	You can argue with me all you want on that one, but I just feel very strongly that Super
2442840	2446820	Metroid was the all-time greatest Metroid game, and there will never be a Metroid game
2446820	2448720	as good as Super Metroid.
2448720	2458600	Unless they do a new one in the vein of Super Metroid on the DS.
2458600	2465720	Well kinda, I mean on the Advance there was Zero Mission or whatever, but it's not the
2465720	2470600	same on a tiny screen, that's the problem, it's not the same on a tiny screen.
2470600	2477000	The first time I played Super Metroid and Kraid, you know, multi-story boss on the TV,
2477000	2478000	that was the shit.
2478000	2480080	The Brinstar music.
2480080	2482080	You can't duplicate that on a DS.
2482080	2483080	Rob.
2483080	2484080	Rob.
2484080	2485080	Rob.
2485080	2486080	What?
2486080	2487200	What are you doing on Thursday?
2487200	2488440	I don't know, what?
2488440	2490440	We are playing Super Metroid.
2490440	2494240	You are coming to my house and we are playing Super Metroid on my 50 inch widescreen.
2494240	2496680	I'll try to make that happen if we're not house hunting because I am in the middle of
2496680	2497680	that right now.
2497680	2499240	But anyway, what was I ranting about Metroid?
2499240	2503280	Oh, Nintendo, prove me wrong then about this whole online thing.
2503280	2505520	Let that be your cards on the table at E3.
2505520	2509340	I will let this Metroid Prime 3 corruption thing slide if you tell me that Smash Brothers
2509340	2511600	is going to be online.
2511600	2516400	I will throw myself in front of Jamie's tank to stop her evil doings and then I will make
2516400	2518480	love to all of you.
2518480	2520440	Fuck that, I want to see it actually be online.
2520440	2522600	I don't want it being promised online.
2522600	2526960	It's like they promised new fucking content each day on goddamn, you know, Wii Connect
2526960	2528360	24.
2528360	2531960	What's the point of having my damn system connected to the internet 24 hours a day if
2531960	2534040	you're not going to do anything with it?
2534040	2539280	Fuck, I even got to boot up my system before my messages will download onto it.
2539280	2541680	What the hell is this Wii Connect 24 shit?
2541680	2546520	Anyways, so hold on real quick, I'm sorry, sorry, real quick comments from chat.
2546520	2550960	MikeW0440 says Metroid Prime was one of the greatest games of all time in some people's
2550960	2551960	opinion.
2551960	2553800	That's right, and some people are entitled to be wrong.
2553800	2554800	That's fine.
2554800	2555800	I'm just kidding.
2555800	2557960	Prime was a great game, but Super Metroid was better.
2557960	2558960	That's all.
2558960	2562280	GS191 says Nintendo is labeled a big disappointment.
2562280	2564560	If they add something, people want more.
2564560	2567440	Nintendo is placed on a very high pedestal and is judged as such.
2567440	2568680	You know that's true.
2568680	2574440	As mad as I am right, Nintendo has the most to lose going into this E3, right?
2574440	2577560	Sony has the most to gain, Nintendo has the most to lose.
2577560	2583040	The problem is like Nintendo, they mark themselves as being innovative, and they are in certain
2583040	2588280	aspects, but in other aspects, they're making really stupid mistakes.
2588280	2590440	Not a lot of storage on their system.
2590440	2593440	Not allowing third party or outside storage.
2593440	2599080	Granted, they do have the SD memory cards, but other than transferring your game saves
2599080	2605760	off of it and maybe playing some MP3s in Excite Truck, it's not being used, or I don't know,
2605760	2609200	the whole online thing.
2609200	2614200	It's all these promises, and you get your hopes up, and then they don't fucking deliver.
2614200	2616480	I want delivery, dammit.
2616480	2621940	Please read a story that will not make me want to play the FU music again.
2621940	2628920	Nintendo in Japan, they're of course Club Nintendo, including they have a lot of exclusive
2628920	2633860	games that get released on there, and they get to buy them off with points that you earn
2633860	2636480	from buying different Nintendo games and stuff.
2636480	2645120	Such wonderful games include the Game & Watch Collection for the DS, Tingle's Balloon Fight,
2645120	2648560	and now Exclamation Warriors.
2648560	2657560	It's a bizarre DS game that uses the microphone for gameplay, so it's kind of like a Sentai
2657560	2662600	Hero type thing, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and you basically yell your attacks
2662600	2668240	and stuff, so you know, like TRANSFORM, and that's how you play the game.
2668240	2675280	It's like PUNCH, KICK, and they have like some video of people playing it and stuff,
2675280	2677000	so it's very strange.
2677000	2681040	It's something that would probably do pretty well over here, but of course we'll never
2681040	2682040	see it.
2682040	2691000	I could imagine Loki playing this game, PUNCH, KICK, KICK, KICK GOD DAMN IT I SAY KICK NO
2691000	2699120	I SAY KICK BRU BRU
2699120	2702760	Yeah my voice was already leaving before tonight's show by the way, tonight's show is just making
2702760	2705520	it worse, I just kind of wanted to get that out there because I can feel myself losing
2705520	2709280	my voice, it was already going away last night, that's just great.
2709280	2714180	This show is very healthy for me, I think I just shaved five years off of my life with
2714180	2717240	tonight's bout of anger.
2717240	2723840	I have bouts of anger every day, usually when I go to work, this actually makes me a little
2723840	2724840	angry too.
2724840	2730000	Guess the game they're bringing out on the Wii and DS?
2730000	2731480	Lord knows what, Mario?
2731480	2732480	Jenga!
2732480	2734440	Wait, like the board game Jenga?
2734440	2737520	It's not a board game, it's the stacking game, you know where you have all the blocks and
2737520	2739520	you have to pull one out and put it up at the top?
2739520	2745160	But Jenga's only fun if you have all the blocks to fall all over people.
2745160	2750720	Okay people, step away from the credit card.
2750720	2751760	Here's why.
2751760	2757080	Why the fuck would you buy a game that's probably not going to play very well, granted, okay
2757080	2763120	yeah it's the Wii, you can use the Wii Remote too, okay but yeah, honestly, the Wii is not
2763120	2764440	that sensitive.
2764440	2770120	Jenga doesn't cost, I would imagine it's probably less than $10, and you're going to buy a game
2770120	2775080	for at least $20, and that's the low end.
2775080	2779260	I bet this Wii version would not have truth or dare Jenga on it, and there is a truth
2779260	2781940	or dare Jenga game available, it's kind of fun.
2781940	2785240	So I don't understand why people do this shit.
2785240	2789120	Because people are too lazy to put the block sculpture together, because it is a little
2789120	2792280	bit painstaking, I mean you have to put three this way, then three this way, then three
2792280	2793280	this way.
2793280	2795960	Oh my god, and you can just like, I don't know, stack it in the plastic thing that comes
2795960	2796960	with it.
2796960	2798640	Oh that's so difficult, so difficult!
2798640	2802760	That is a lot of effort for some people.
2802760	2806640	What can you imagine though, taking it out with the Wii Remote and stuff like that, and
2806640	2812140	all of a sudden your IR gets fucked up because something shiny is in the room and it knocks
2812140	2815760	the whole thing over and you're like, fucking A, why the hell did I pay money for this damn
2815760	2816760	game?
2816760	2819540	I was doing it perfect and it fucked it up, what the hell?
2819540	2824520	Maybe this version of Jenga will actually be online, you could play online.
2824520	2828560	Oh yeah, oh wait, Nintendo, never mind.
2828560	2832480	It can't be online, because that's not possible.
2832480	2837160	Yeah, I agree, I have no idea why this game exists.
2837160	2839560	But we can talk about some games that will exist pretty soon.
2839560	2842160	Jamie, are you excited about Jenga on the Wii?
2842160	2845320	No, I want, I miss my actual Jenga.
2845320	2850520	We should play Truth or Dare Jenga on OLR one night during a slow news week, because
2850520	2854240	the little blocks that you pull out have little questions on them that you have to answer,
2854240	2858000	or little dares you have to do, or it's dumb stuff.
2858000	2861800	It's like a Mormon Truth or Dare game, you're not going to do anything that dirty.
2861800	2868080	Anyway, let's talk about some upcoming release dates over in Japan and some things you can
2868080	2870040	get your hands on pretty soon.
2870040	2876400	Let's talk about the Xbox 360 on July 12th, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
2876400	2882700	2 makes its way to the Japanese audience thanks to Ubisoft, that's on the Xbox 360.
2882700	2887120	Going over to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Quest Swords finally
2887120	2891920	shows up on July 12th from Squeenix on the Nintendo Wii.
2891920	2896360	Not a very busy release week, but if you go over to the PlayStation 3, you get Gundam
2896360	2900640	Musou, but that's actually coming out in Korea, I'm not sure if that's also coming out in
2900640	2903680	Japan, but it is coming out over there.
2903680	2907680	It's the same TV type anyway, actually the same TV is over here.
2907680	2911680	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games are going into
2911680	2915760	the best hits, so they're getting big price reductions over there in Japan.
2915760	2920160	Also Disgaea Hour of Darkness 2 is also getting a price cut.
2920160	2924440	Not a whole lot of new games coming out over there in Japan, although if you're a music
2924440	2928720	game fan, you probably already have Pop and Music 14 Fever preordered.
2928720	2932980	Pop and Music 14, of course, the long running music game series, it's kind of like a cross
2932980	2938620	between Beat Mania and Trouble with the Pop-O-Matic Bubble, because the controller looks like
2938620	2940480	seven of those and you hit them.
2940480	2943560	If you ever watch that movie, what the hell is that movie?
2943560	2947040	Lost in Translation, which is walking through the arcade, you see somebody freestyling on
2947040	2949440	Pop and Music, it's pretty awesome.
2949440	2955440	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, there's a game called Izumo Zero, it's an adventure
2955440	2957140	game.
2957140	2962080	It's yet another title that has a very nice looking anime chick on the front, I'm sure
2962080	2964840	that's like every other game of that type.
2964840	2969200	I'm totally labeling this based on the box art alone.
2969200	2974760	On the Nintendo DS, Death Note, there's a Death Note game coming out from Konami.
2974760	2976000	I need this.
2976000	2978020	So you'll like that one.
2978020	2983200	And Monster Farm DS also coming out, and one of my favorite titles, I have no idea what
2983200	2990000	this is supposed to mean, but it's Kyurin Revolution Mezase Idol Queen, it's a strategy
2990000	2997120	game from Konami, but it looks like a pop idol kind of contest, and the chick's wearing
2997120	3000440	a cowboy hat and winking at you on the box art cover, so I have no idea what the hell
3000440	3002520	that game's supposed to be.
3002520	3010040	Over on the PSP, coming out on July 12th over in Japan, you have Tekken Dark Resurrection
3010040	3012920	getting a price cut, and that's it, no new games.
3012920	3014520	There you have it, Japanese releases.
3014520	3020520	I was going to mention something real quick, the DDR Hottest Party page finally made it
3020520	3024720	up on the Japanese site for Konami, and I thought there was some intro, they had quotes
3024720	3030440	from all the music directors and stuff from other Bomani games in Japan, and they have
3030440	3036280	some really interesting quotes like, this game is killing it, the Dance Dance Revolution
3036280	3041160	Extreme director, Inubuzu, which I thought was funny.
3041160	3044760	That's what happens when I don't play DDR for like six months, and then I try to play
3044760	3050960	like a ten foot song on the arcade, I go, this game is killing me.
3050960	3051960	You know.
3051960	3052960	What?
3052960	3056000	I actually passed a nine footer the other day.
3056000	3057000	Wow can I shake your hand?
3057000	3058560	After a year of not playing.
3058560	3061840	No that's good, but did you want to die afterwards?
3061840	3063800	Yes I did freaking kakame!
3063800	3066000	This game is killing it!
3066000	3069580	Anyhow, more release dates please, Loki.
3069580	3074960	Well if you're looking for console games this week, keep looking.
3074960	3079960	The only thing that you are going to find though is Project Silpheed for the 360, that's
3079960	3081680	going to be making its way out this week.
3081680	3083120	Didn't that already come out?
3083120	3084120	No.
3084120	3087800	It is coming out this week though.
3087800	3089120	That's about it for console games.
3089120	3094680	Now for handhelds though, we've got a few things, Smash Court Tennis 3 is coming out
3094680	3103120	to the PSP, as well as Riviera, The Promised Land is also making its way out to the PSP.
3103120	3109560	See for the DS, just Vegas Casino High Five, that's making its way out.
3109560	3118040	And then on the PC, not a whole lot of good stuff, but yet again, it doesn't cease to
3118040	3125120	amaze me, another Tycoon game, Ride Carnival Tycoon, coming out, I swear to god there's
3125120	3127880	a new one every fucking week.
3127880	3134560	I can probably play that piece of shit online, but I still can't take my Wii online.
3134560	3138840	Anyhow, how about some European release dates for the listeners?
3138840	3142720	Well we have a few interesting things.
3142720	3149440	Actually on the 13th is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Game Boy Advance,
3149440	3155160	Mario Party 8 for Wii, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, also on the 13th
3155160	3156160	for PC.
3156160	3162440	On the 20th we have The Darkness and Transformers The Game on DS, sorry, the DS release.
3162440	3167360	And then on the 21st, the one thing everybody's been looking forward to on the PC, this is
3167360	3171640	so exciting, Brian Lara's International Cricket.
3171640	3172640	Hooray!
3172640	3176440	I'm so excited.
3176440	3179080	Because everybody loves cricket.
3179080	3180840	Yeah.
3180840	3186520	And to that statement, I hear a chorus of crickets in the background, wah wah wah, oh
3186520	3187520	god I'm fired.
3187520	3190880	Wasn't that that little doll that you'd put the tape in her back and she'd read you a
3190880	3191880	story?
3191880	3192880	What?
3192880	3193880	It was called Cricket.
3193880	3194880	It was Teddy Ruxpin.
3194880	3196280	Have you been reading Penny Arcade lately?
3196280	3197280	No.
3197280	3202280	They're doing like, I don't read, they're doing like hardcore Teddy Ruxpin, the action
3202280	3203280	hero.
3203280	3204560	Now that's cool.
3204560	3208040	There should be, there should be like a fighting game with our childhood favorites, like Teddy
3208040	3210800	Ruxpin versus Cabbage Patch Doll.
3210800	3215280	Now here's the thing, you probably never played this game, but it's a, I don't know if it's
3215280	3220040	a tabletop RPG, but it is an RPG.
3220040	3226120	It's called Fuzzy Heroes, and you use stuffed animals as, I swear to god, you use stuffed
3226120	3232240	animals as characters in the game, and based on what the stuffed animal has, the attributes
3232240	3237560	and stuff, you have different attack abilities, and it's a tactical, like, I guess I don't
3237560	3242480	know what you'd call it, tabletop RPG, but it's basically like a tabletop RPG, and you
3242480	3246280	move them around and stuff and you attack with different abilities, like so for example,
3246280	3250520	I had, we had brought, and we only played this game once, and it kind of sucked.
3250520	3251640	What is this game called again?
3251640	3252640	Fuzzy Heroes.
3252640	3254640	This is like a furry's paradise.
3254640	3262480	And basically, like, I had the dragon from Fantasia, you know, that we got at Disneyland,
3262480	3265920	and so, you know, because it's a dragon, you know, it would have, like, flight and fire
3265920	3272160	and stuff like that, so, I don't know, this was a long time ago, but I don't know, it's,
3272160	3277120	they could do something like that, I guess, with stuffed animals, it's an interesting
3277120	3278120	idea.
3278120	3280120	You could do that with them again.
3280120	3281120	Yeah.
3281120	3282120	Okay.
3282120	3283120	What?
3283120	3285040	Oh, my God, Rob.
3285040	3289760	Here's what Miklotov, here's.
3289760	3290880	Best radio ever.
3290880	3295480	Sometimes I wish this were a TV show, but here is the present that Miklotov, Rice Princess,
3295480	3297600	and Xtaphir all went together and got me.
3297600	3301480	It's a panda bear wearing stripper boots and a tutu.
3301480	3302480	A pink tutu.
3302480	3307720	A pink tutu carrying a little wand with, Jonas just joined us, by the way, and he's making
3307720	3308960	this face like OMG.
3308960	3312720	Jonas, can you please describe this, her name is Sassy Pants, by the way.
3312720	3316640	Can you please describe Sassy Pants to the listeners?
3316640	3317640	And welcome to the show.
3317640	3318640	How could I even explain?
3318640	3319640	What the hell is this?
3319640	3322800	It's a panda bear wearing a pink tutu and stripper boots.
3322800	3326800	So what I'm curious, how would Sassy Pants fare in Fuzzy Heroes?
3326800	3330920	Because I think she would dominate, because she can cast magic, true, she has stripper
3330920	3335640	boots, so you know she can kick, so I want to play Fuzzy Heroes with Sassy Pants.
3335640	3340800	I'm not sure, because I unfortunately don't have the rule book in front of me, because
3340800	3347320	this is someone else's thing, but okay, it's a game, if you go to FuzzyHeroes.com,
3347320	3355280	I think you can still buy the book, but anyways, it's created by Inner City Games Designs,
3355280	3359120	and let me see if I can read a brief description of what the game is.
3359120	3364480	Inner City Games Design is probably best known for our Fuzzy Heroes line of miniature gaming
3364480	3370840	products, products that use stuffed toys and action figures as miniature combatants in
3370840	3373120	a 3D strategic simulation.
3373120	3377560	These games are designed to be introductory for those who are new to the miniatures hobby,
3377560	3384440	but with both enough depth and humor to engage the veteran miniatures gamer as well.
3384440	3390720	We still make Fuzzy Heroes and in fact are gearing up for another set of both games and
3390720	3395800	comics for this line, I guess they have comics for this too.
3395800	3401360	We also make several independent toy related games, including Very Large Creature, Stuffed
3401360	3409520	Toys Vs. Miniatures, and Sports Fuzz, 3D football using toys, beer bottles, and whatever happens
3409520	3411400	to be lying around.
3411400	3415600	By the way, Sassy Pants' tiara fell off, so I found that in the living room, but there's
3415600	3418680	also that, which must add some magical powers to it.
3418680	3423480	I don't know, but I swear you can probably find this in a comic shop, anyplace that has
3423480	3427080	the miniatures tabletop strategy games and stuff.
3427080	3429080	We're spending far too much time on this topic.
3429080	3430080	Sorry.
3430080	3431080	No, it's funny.
3431080	3432880	I'd never heard of this.
3432880	3436320	It would be fun for like, that'd be a fun thing to record.
3436320	3439800	Yeah, for a YouTube or something, OLR plays Fuzzy Heroes.
3439800	3444600	I wanted to say though about the Harry Potter game that's coming out, it came out here obviously
3444600	3447200	already, and I actually got to see it this week, I forgot to say it during my gameweek
3447200	3449080	because I didn't play it, I watched somebody else play it.
3449080	3450080	It looked boring.
3450080	3452600	It looked like all the other Harry Potter games, they didn't look, I mean, because I
3452600	3453600	was really excited.
3453600	3454600	Those figures are not very great.
3454600	3458000	I was excited about getting to cast magic with the wiimote and everything.
3458000	3462680	The funniest thing though was when my friend Eddie, who was playing it, picked up the table
3462680	3463920	and was slamming it into people.
3463920	3467280	They would go, oh, oh, that hurts, oh, that hurts.
3467280	3468840	The game's really funny.
3468840	3472480	It's like, you go to Hogwarts and then you run errands through people.
3472480	3475640	It's like Hogwarts errand boy, the game is really what the hell...
3475640	3478880	No, it's like Animal Crossing at Hogwarts.
3478880	3480840	Except Animal Crossing is more fun?
3480840	3481840	Yeah.
3481840	3485040	Instead of shaking trees, you get beaten up by the whomping willow.
3485040	3490480	Anyway, I just wanted to say that real quickly because I actually played the Harry Potter,
3490480	3493920	well, I watched the Harry Potter game and it wasn't all that.
3493920	3499360	Anyway, Australia, we haven't talked a lot about what's going on in Australia, but
3499360	3503860	if you are a Wii owner in Australia, you have some good news for you this week.
3503860	3508080	You got a ton of virtual console games this week, which is very interesting and that's
3508080	3513020	why we're kind of wanting to report on the show is that Nintendo can certainly just push
3513020	3515320	out like a shitload of games all at once.
3515320	3518600	Listen to this, Australia's got like all of this in one week here.
3518600	3522960	Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, Alien Crush, Military
3522960	3527500	Madness, R-Type, Dungeon Explorer, Soldier Blade, Motor Roader, and Vigilante.
3527500	3531240	So if you're a TurboGrafx fan in Australia, you had a very good week this week.
3531240	3533240	Hey, Rob, while we're at it.
3533240	3540000	Um, there were actually new releases for, um, uh, and actually now I'm trying to find
3540000	3541000	them again.
3541000	3546120	There were new releases for a virtual console in the UK as well and I unfortunately just
3546120	3547960	lost my link to it.
3547960	3550120	Super Mario Brothers 2 in the US.
3550120	3551120	Oh, and over there?
3551120	3552920	I do believe that was one of them.
3552920	3557320	I had just had it and I feel really crappy about it because, um, I just looked all this
3557320	3558320	up last night.
3558320	3560800	I think Paper Mario is supposed to be coming over here pretty soon too.
3560800	3563800	They said what's coming out over here on Monday?
3563800	3564800	Nothing yet?
3564800	3567880	I saw Paper Mario 4, I think, is one of the other regions.
3567880	3568880	Here it is.
3568880	3569880	Okay.
3569880	3575040	The, uh, Virtual Console, um, for, uh, UK, actually Sonic the Hedgehog 2 just came out.
3575040	3583000	Um, Golden Axe 2, Echo Tides of Time, Dragon Spirit, those are the games that just came
3583000	3584000	out.
3584000	3586280	I think we got most of those over here already, I think.
3586280	3589820	So for once, uh, Europe didn't beat us to the punch on Virtual Console because they
3589820	3590820	have been lately.
3590820	3593360	But they did get some really good games because I love Echo Tides of Time.
3593360	3598960	Um, sadly though, I think this is the Mega Drive version and not the, uh, the Mega CD
3598960	3599960	one.
3599960	3600960	Oh, good point.
3600960	3605120	James Patrick in chat says, Australia never saw the release of the TurboGrafx at all.
3605120	3609640	So if you're a TurboGrafx fan living in Australia, you might be the only one.
3609640	3610640	You're a rarity.
3610640	3613720	Either that or you were a major hardcore importer.
3613720	3615360	Yeah, you're a hardcore importer.
3615360	3616360	Anyways.
3616360	3621560	Um, another game that's coming out here later in the fall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles,
3621560	3623720	is going to be supporting co-op gameplay as well.
3623720	3629520	I mean, what good gun game doesn't support, you know, co-op play, but, um, you'll be able
3629520	3633080	to kill zombies and whatnot, uh, with a friend.
3633080	3638220	I think, obviously though, it's probably local co-op and not online because, you know.
3638220	3639220	It is on the Wii.
3639220	3642480	They should totally have it to where you are one person and then other people control the
3642480	3643480	zombies.
3643480	3645560	Sort of like that Pac-Man game.
3645560	3646560	That would be fun.
3646560	3649520	You could, I want Zombie the game where you are a zombie.
3649520	3652000	Why haven't, why hasn't a game like that been made?
3652000	3653000	That's a brilliant idea.
3653000	3654000	They need to do more.
3654000	3655000	What?
3655000	3659040	They did an online game, I thought, with Resident Evil where if you got bit, you became a zombie
3659040	3660040	and stuff.
3660040	3662920	But I think they should do Marvel Zombies the game.
3662920	3664480	Or you're a superhero zombie.
3664480	3666920	Or a George Romero zombie type game or something.
3666920	3668880	I don't know, I guess that's what Dead Rising was.
3668880	3670440	But like one where you actually get to be the zombie.
3670440	3671440	That would be kind of fun.
3671440	3672440	Like an online game.
3672440	3675480	Oh, I guess that was Resident Evil on PS2, wasn't it?
3675480	3676840	I want Marvel Zombies the game.
3676840	3678480	But make it good this time.
3678480	3679480	Make it memorable.
3679480	3681560	Well, hey, I have something that's memorable.
3681560	3682560	What's that?
3682560	3686000	People were crackheads like me back in the day.
3686000	3694440	Ragnarok Online is going to be on Japanese DS in 2008.
3694440	3700920	The game is also going to be released with Sakana no Asobo, which is a fishing game.
3700920	3709040	And a, sorry, there's actually going to be an Ikebana game, Ikebana is flower arranging
3709040	3710040	by the way.
3710040	3717720	But Ragnarok Online is going to be in real time using the Nintendo Wi-Fi.
3717720	3722760	And it's supposed to be, I guess, tailored to the DS, but it's only going to be out in
3722760	3724080	Japan right now.
3724080	3728160	Which means I'm going to be importing it and sitting around with my dictionary.
3728160	3732160	Either that, or I will just probably remember where all the shit is anyway, because I played
3732160	3734960	Ragnarok Online for what, five, six years?
3734960	3739800	Well there's really only one phrase that you need to know in Japanese, and that's we ban
3739800	3740800	you.
3740800	3744980	Yeah, but actually, the Rob D makes an interesting point, why are they calling it Ragnarok Online
3744980	3745980	when it's not online?
3745980	3746980	It is online.
3746980	3748980	It's going to be on Wi-Fi.
3748980	3749980	Oh.
3749980	3750980	Huh?
3750980	3751980	Touche.
3751980	3755260	So much for that.
3755260	3759720	Also speaking of quirky games coming over from overseas, Majesco is going to be making
3759720	3761800	a local version of Furu Furu Park.
3761800	3766620	It was a game that came out in Japan in April, and get this, it's a game on the Wii that
3766620	3769120	consists of mini games.
3769120	3771720	Who doesn't love mini games on the Wii?
3771720	3773200	Good stuff.
3773200	3777560	But the cool thing about it, in all seriousness, is that it's based off a lot of classic Taito
3777560	3782840	games that you've seen re-released in other bundles, but these are re-imagined games.
3782840	3785560	Bubble Bobble, Arkanoid.
3785560	3790360	Majesco's going to be localizing it here for North America, and making it all in English
3790360	3791360	and all that good stuff.
3791360	3792360	I love Arkanoid.
3792360	3796760	That is one of the mindless games that I absolutely just love, is Arkanoid.
3796760	3799560	Will you be able to pass level 30?
3799560	3800840	I'm pretty sure you will be.
3800840	3805480	I always liked Arkanoid Revenge of- Don't!
3805480	3807200	That was one of my favorites.
3807200	3808200	I like those games as a kid a lot.
3808200	3810120	I had my breakout going on back in the day.
3810120	3812280	I was where you could give your paddle a gun.
3812280	3815520	It's like Breakout with guns, that was awesome.
3815520	3818280	By the way, the game also has like original type of games.
3818280	3822620	There's a karate game, a safe cracking game, so it's not just retro classics.
3822620	3826980	But mini game fun, because who doesn't love their mini games on the Wii?
3826980	3828760	That's what I live for on the Wii.
3828760	3835000	Well, something very interesting that's going to be coming to arcades pretty soon.
3835000	3840240	Capcom is actually doing an original 2D fighting game.
3840240	3844200	It's going to be the first one that they've done in three years.
3844200	3845200	It's coming soon.
3845200	3849620	There's a new teaser page on Capcom Japan's site.
3849620	3853520	No word exactly on what it is, although it looks very promising seeing as some of the
3853520	3860340	shots we've seen so far of the Street Fighter 2 HD for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation
3860340	3861340	Network and stuff.
3861340	3863120	Oh, it looks awesome.
3863120	3865680	Do you really think they'd put out Street Fighter 4?
3865680	3868640	No, not for another five years.
3868640	3870320	If Street Fighter 3 was any indication.
3870320	3872120	I think we need another Marvel vs. Capcom.
3872120	3873120	You know what we need?
3873120	3877120	We need a Cyberbot sequel, because Cyberbot is Capcom's number one fighting game.
3877120	3878480	Interesting choice.
3878480	3880600	To quote Puzzle Fighter anyway.
3880600	3881600	Let's see.
3881600	3882600	You could have...
3882600	3884320	It's the game that gave us Devilot and Super 8.
3884320	3889160	Capcom and SNK vs. Marvel and I don't know, your mom.
3889160	3890160	Arcades vs. comics.
3890160	3891160	There you go.
3891160	3894880	It'll be like arcade fighting games vs. comic characters.
3894880	3896640	We just need a new Cyberbot.
3896640	3899600	We need a new Cyberbot, because Cyberbot is still...
3899600	3900600	And we...
3900600	3901600	And another Red Earth.
3901600	3903880	How about another Darkstalkers game?
3903880	3905760	That would be cool.
3905760	3906760	No.
3906760	3907760	How about no?
3907760	3908760	I don't know.
3908760	3909760	It's all about dude who played with his blood.
3909760	3910760	That'd be cool.
3910760	3911760	Go get a...
3911760	3916960	Going to chatroomchat.orangelandtrader.com, Rob D. says, new Capcom 2D fighter?
3916960	3917960	I'm in.
3917960	3918960	No questions asked.
3918960	3919960	Let's see.
3919960	3926560	Shadow Charlie says, quote, butt fucking yeah, another Cyberbot.
3926560	3927560	Hell yeah.
3927560	3931080	What they need to do is they need to get like, you know how they have the Triforce thing
3931080	3936320	for, you know, the F-Zero stuff, where it's Sega and, you know, Namco and Nintendo.
3936320	3943160	They need to do something like that for fighting games, SNK, Capcom, and maybe Sega, I guess.
3943160	3948200	And do like some sort of all-encompassing thing that has a lot of characters from all
3948200	3949200	these different games.
3949200	3952760	You know, you think all those brilliant minds put together could like, I don't know, save
3952760	3953760	arcades?
3953760	3954760	No.
3954760	3957760	You think?
3957760	3958760	I don't know.
3958760	3959760	Maybe they don't want to.
3959760	3960760	Well, I mean, look at MUGEN.
3960760	3962640	I mean, that's the way to go.
3962640	3965040	Billions of fighters all fighting each other.
3965040	3966040	That should be the name of the game.
3966040	3967280	MUGEN is freaking awesome.
3967280	3968280	There it is.
3968280	3969280	There's the name of the game right there.
3969280	3972160	Billions of fighters all fighting each other.
3972160	3973160	That's it, right?
3973160	3974160	Super happy.
3974160	3975160	Yeah.
3975160	3977200	Because, you know, that's fighting orgy.
3977200	3982800	You know what game, though, that I really want a new version of?
3982800	3984880	Not orgy.
3984880	3986320	No.
3986320	3989520	I want a new Rival Schools.
3989520	3995400	I played the crap out of the first one, out of the Evolution one.
3995400	3997200	I paid 90 bucks for the Evolution one.
3997200	4002320	Well, no, there was a rumor about the Apollo Justice game or whatever that was subtitled
4002320	4005840	and people are thinking it's either a new Phoenix Wright game or a new Rival Schools
4005840	4006840	game.
4006840	4007840	So.
4007840	4008840	You know what?
4008840	4013840	MUGEN makes this joke in chat, the Super Ultimate Extreme Fighting Combat Tournament, and that
4013840	4018160	makes me think, oh my god, why doesn't Capcom and Midway just get together, give the fans
4018160	4019360	what they want?
4019360	4020720	Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat.
4020720	4021720	Come on.
4021720	4022720	That would be hot.
4022720	4024000	That would be hot.
4024000	4025000	It wouldn't work.
4025000	4028120	They would have to use, like, this really shitball Street Fighter game.
4028120	4029120	Actually, no.
4029120	4030120	And Mortal Kombat.
4030120	4031120	Actually, no.
4031120	4034760	They could take the Mortal Kombat characters and make them all cool, cell, you know, shaded
4034760	4035760	and stuff.
4035760	4039280	The ones that are all 3D, they could use the Street Fighter EX.
4039280	4042840	Now I do realize this means Capcom and Midway have to get together, which I don't think
4042840	4044960	anybody ever thinks would happen, but.
4044960	4045960	Why not?
4045960	4046960	I would say that would be pretty cool.
4046960	4047960	And there you go.
4047960	4049720	Midway, SNK, and Capcom.
4049720	4053000	And I would say instead of going, you know, with the live, you know, the Mortal Kombat's
4053000	4054800	been out of arcades for how long now?
4054800	4055800	For a long time.
4055800	4059640	And this way you could take, you know, the characters from Mortal Kombat and actually
4059640	4065040	draw them all cell shaded and stuff and it would look pretty awesome.
4065040	4068400	But they would never do that because it would be awesome and make sense.
4068400	4071400	Ross Steele, UT, says Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat wouldn't work.
4071400	4072560	The games are too different.
4072560	4078260	I don't know though, but they made, I mean, they made Capcom fight comic book characters
4078260	4079360	and that somehow worked.
4079360	4085560	I mean, and, you know, Marvel versus Capcom versus SNK, you know, and it could, I mean,
4085560	4089080	I understand because there's a lot of weaponry that goes into Mortal Kombat and it's a much
4089080	4090080	darker game.
4090080	4096600	Yes, it's a total fanboy thing I'm going off on here with, but come on and indulge me for
4096600	4097600	just like five seconds.
4097600	4099760	It might be a fun game.
4099760	4105200	Well, if you don't mind me going to a previous topic, by the way, the Ragnarok Online DS
4105200	4107440	is not actually online.
4107440	4112680	They just have multiplayer elements over Wi-Fi.
4112680	4117840	I'm going to refrain from making the obvious joke here about Nintendo because I'm irritating
4117840	4121120	some folks in chat, although they can kiss my big fat butt.
4121120	4125800	They should just do it on Wii, but instead of your little Ragnarok characters, you have
4125800	4126800	your Miis.
4126800	4128200	No, that might be cute.
4128200	4131200	You have, like, Ragnar-Me.
4131200	4134040	Ragnar-Me?
4134040	4135040	You're weird.
4135040	4138560	All right, enough of this whole fighting game talk.
4138560	4141040	Somebody please bring up another topic.
4141040	4146720	Well, anyone who's a fan of Valkyrie Profile will be happy that Valkyrie Profile 2 has
4146720	4148060	a date.
4148060	4151800	It will be out on the 7th of September.
4151800	4153600	Yay!
4153600	4161240	So this one has got a different story.
4161240	4168000	There's going to be the youngest of three Valkyries is booted out of heaven and has
4168000	4171000	to go do shit.
4171000	4173280	That would suck to get booted out of heaven, actually.
4173280	4177360	So this is one of those series I've wanted to play but haven't gotten a chance to check
4177360	4178360	out.
4178360	4179840	Well, seeing as how if you're a Valkyrie you have to fight all the time and then think
4179840	4183800	people to die, so I think being booted out of heaven might not be so bad.
4183800	4187160	The only other game with a Valkyrie I can think of is Gauntlet because I always used
4187160	4188760	to play Blue Valkyrie.
4188760	4189960	Or Macross.
4189960	4190960	Blue Valkyrie.
4190960	4193680	Yeah, but that's a different kind of Valkyrie, duh.
4193680	4195960	I like that Valkyrie a lot better.
4195960	4202200	Dude, I wouldn't mind having the one where you use your brain, like in Macross Plus.
4202200	4204080	The YF-21.
4204080	4205080	That was it.
4205080	4206080	Anyway.
4206080	4210080	Uh, you know, a lot of folks in chat, going back to the fighting game topic for a moment,
4210080	4212280	now they're getting all Killer Instinct on it.
4212280	4214640	They're like, who owns Killer Instinct now?
4214640	4215640	I do.
4215640	4216640	Who cares?
4216640	4217640	Killer Instinct sucked.
4217640	4218640	It was kind of fun.
4218640	4219640	I liked it.
4219640	4220640	Boo!
4220640	4221640	Boo yourself.
4221640	4222640	I actually have both of them.
4222640	4224800	I have the one on Nintendo 64 and, okay.
4224800	4226720	I forgot they had it on 64.
4226720	4228440	Yeah, they did KI 2 Gold.
4228440	4229440	That's right.
4229440	4230440	Good times.
4230440	4231440	And I remember, this was before I moved out here.
4231440	4236440	I had Dan play the game over and over and over again just to rip me orchid's music.
4236440	4240880	SSJ100Matt says, Rare says they have no intention of doing a new Killer Instinct.
4240880	4241880	DIAF Rare.
4241880	4247880	You know, I played a Rare, actually I did play a Rare game at the party.
4247880	4248880	Pinbot.
4248880	4251480	Rare published Pinbot for the Nintendo.
4251480	4252480	That's true.
4252480	4256560	But thank God, though, they're going to be doing that Banjo Kazooie sequel.
4256560	4257560	Woo!
4257560	4259200	Cannot wait.
4259200	4262880	That's going to be so awesome and totally won't suck.
4262880	4266560	All right, look, let's change the topic completely here.
4266560	4269480	One last topic for this part A, then we're going to go into a break and come back for
4269480	4272040	part B. Talking about the Simpsons game.
4272040	4275400	You know, the Simpsons have a game coming out, you know, it's no coincidence there's
4275400	4277880	a movie and pretty soon there'll be a game.
4277880	4280840	And this game is like a spoof of every other video game, yes?
4280840	4281840	Yes.
4281840	4282840	Yes.
4282840	4285760	Well, the ultimate spoof waits for you at the very end of the game.
4285760	4291040	The very last boss, the final boss in the Simpsons game is Matt Groening, the creator
4291040	4293800	of the Simpsons is who you will face at the very end of the game.
4293800	4294800	Ooh, spoiler!
4294800	4298880	Yeah, sorry, OMG spoiler, but you know, come on, you don't play a Simpsons game for the
4298880	4299880	plot.
4299880	4300880	You play it because it's funny.
4300880	4304120	The game looks sexy, too, by the way.
4304120	4307080	This is like EA's first Simpsons game.
4307080	4308080	It looks awesome.
4308080	4309080	Good.
4309080	4310080	Well, props to EA.
4310080	4312840	You know, sometimes we dog on that company a little bit on this show, but props to them
4312840	4314200	if they pull this off.
4314200	4318480	Certainly not anything like Superman returns the game.
4318480	4323240	This game, by the way, will be out this fall, so it's going to miss the movie, but probably
4323240	4325680	make it in time for the DVD release, yes?
4325680	4328960	That would be my guess.
4328960	4332200	The Rob D says, you totally spoiled the Simpsons game I wasn't going to play.
4332200	4333200	How could you?
4333200	4337120	SSJ100Matt says, still waiting on Simpsons arcade game on 360.
4337120	4339640	You never know, the movie's around the corner.
4339640	4340640	It could happen.
4340640	4341640	It could happen.
4341640	4345320	But, again, it's going to be like that whole, you know, Konami and Ubisoft had to kind of
4345320	4348520	team up to get us Ninja Turtles, so what, Konami and EA are going to have to team up
4348520	4350160	to get us Simpsons, right?
4350160	4351160	Could happen, though.
4351160	4352160	Who knows?
4352160	4358320	You know, it could very well could be like Doom, where it's like, Doom, there it is.
4358320	4361560	We didn't tell you about it, so there it is.
4361560	4365480	That's exactly what Peter Moore said at the press conference, too, is it's like, Doom,
4365480	4368480	there it is.
4368480	4372600	Yeah, we need a break.
4372600	4373920	I know, that's how I feel, too.
4373920	4377120	We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with a little more of Orange Lounge
4377120	4378120	Radio.
4378120	4379960	Hey, in part B tonight, listless.
