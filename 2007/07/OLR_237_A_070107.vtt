00:00.000 --> 00:14.280
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Wonky.

00:14.280 --> 00:20.840
Tonight July 1st, 2007, Soulcalibur IV goes online, The World of Civilization comes to

00:20.840 --> 00:32.520
consoles and our achievements about to get product placement.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.600
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.600 --> 00:37.600
Radio.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.520
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.520
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.160
You might know me as Sky.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.400
Not joining us tonight, sadly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.840
She has the night off, as many of you longtime listeners of the show may know.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.960
She's been very active in taking up massage therapy.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.520
She has a little bit of a conflict with her schooling tonight, but the show must go on,

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
and joining me as always, say hello to Lokey.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
Hello.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.800
How are you doing, Lokey?

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
I'm doing okay.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.880
I just scoffed down a sandwich.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.280
Yeah, you had like a large Quiznos.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
It wasn't like a...

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
Regular size.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.280
Was it?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.280
Yeah, it was a regular size.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.120
It was a balancing act with a sandwich, and also it is spicy, so it's like, you know...

01:18.120 --> 01:19.880
Spicy sandwich.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.160
Regular size, black Angus steak sandwich.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
All right.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.160
Yum, yum.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
Yum, yum.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.760
But not that we endorse any particular commercial products here on this program.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
No.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
No.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
All right.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.360
Filling in tonight of sorts, we have Rice Princess joining us tonight.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.360
Hello.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.360
How are you doing?

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
Is your mic on, sweetie?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.360
I don't know.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
We didn't hear you there.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
It totally is on now.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.360
You're just a little quieter than DarkSakura is, so we'll just adjust your volume.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.360
Very professional radio, but that's what happens when you're live.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
Try again.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
Great idea.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
Okay.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
Good job.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
That's all right.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.360
Say hello to our listeners, and I'll adjust you on the fly here.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.360
Okay.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
Hi, listeners.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.360
How's it going?

01:54.360 --> 01:55.360
Good.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
Thanks.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
I don't know.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.160
If you want to tell Rice Princess how you're doing, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:02.160 --> 02:08.280
We do tape live here on Sunday nights at orangelaungeradio.com, and Rice Princess will just be helping us get a third

02:08.280 --> 02:14.040
perspective tonight, but also the chat room is there, as always, to give us a million

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
more perspectives.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
Yes.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
You're right.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.040
You're in the chat room.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
Maybe.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
That would be the best thing ever.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.440
Well, not in the chat room.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.240
Four or five different opinions in the chat room.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
Yeah.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
And one of them's a robot.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
Over and over.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.240
All right.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.880
Anyhow, let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, where

02:31.880 --> 02:34.040
we talk about what we've been playing this week.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.040
Loki, I guess you're going to start us off tonight.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Okay.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.040
Well, this week I've been playing some interesting things.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.040
Some have actually, you know, people have been questioning why I'm playing them, like

02:45.040 --> 02:47.120
the Transformers game, for one.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.760
I was playing that on 360.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.200
It's okay.

02:52.200 --> 02:57.760
It's kind of like I like the game like I like Driver 3.

02:57.760 --> 03:05.040
It's a poorly put together game, and it has some blatant flaws in it, but it's okay.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
It's just like what?

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
The same type of graphical stuff?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Okay.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.360
Let me put some examples in place here.

03:11.360 --> 03:16.960
When I first started the game, immediately there was a big pileup of cars in the street

03:16.960 --> 03:20.600
because they couldn't figure out how to turn the corner correctly.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.240
So that was kind of funny.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.080
The other thing is if you throw anything at anything in the game, you know, pretty much

03:26.080 --> 03:28.800
like you can throw a road cone at a building.

03:28.800 --> 03:34.560
Well, what happens is when you hit something with said road cone, shrapnel comes off the

03:34.560 --> 03:35.560
building.

03:35.560 --> 03:39.720
Well, that shrapnel hits another building and then more shrapnel comes off that building

03:39.720 --> 03:42.040
and sometimes it goes back to the original building.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.880
So you can literally destroy an entire block by just throwing a road cone at something.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.360
And so that's kind of fascinating at the same time.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.720
First comment of the night, Dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, Loki, testers not doing

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
their job?

03:55.720 --> 03:57.040
Of course not.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.300
It was definitely a rush game.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.420
Is it that testers aren't doing their job or is it that testing gets their corners cut

04:03.420 --> 04:06.520
because the game has a strict deadline of trying to be out in time to move?

04:06.520 --> 04:07.520
I think it's probably corners cut.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.220
That's what I figured.

04:09.220 --> 04:14.400
But other stuff that's kind of crappy in the game, oh, the very first boss that I fought

04:14.400 --> 04:21.200
in Autobot's campaign killed himself.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Suicide man.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.400
We were fighting in this, I don't even know what it's supposed to be, like a power plant

04:26.400 --> 04:33.800
or something like that and they have all these explosive, I guess, propane tanks or something

04:33.800 --> 04:34.800
all around.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.820
And unfortunately, you set off one and the whole place goes up.

04:37.820 --> 04:43.400
So he was just swinging this giant chain at me or something and I got knocked back by

04:43.400 --> 04:47.640
the first propane blast and he got caught in the middle of all the other ones going

04:47.640 --> 04:48.740
off at the same time.

04:48.740 --> 04:55.960
So I actually never fired one shot at him and he ended up killing himself.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.520
A lot of our chatters are big fans of Transformers, looking forward to the movie.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.400
And I understand you actually got to see a little sneak peek of the movie.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.840
I got to see the movie last Wednesday.

05:04.840 --> 05:05.840
Awesome.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
How was it?

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
It was awesome.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
Why?

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
What was awesome about it?

05:09.840 --> 05:15.120
It was awesome because the action in the movie is just non-stop throughout the thing.

05:15.120 --> 05:20.440
It's very similar to Independence Day, how it jumps back and forth between different

05:20.440 --> 05:24.020
character story arcs and stuff like that.

05:24.020 --> 05:30.440
So you've got that plus in the beginning of the movie when Scorponok comes out and stuff,

05:30.440 --> 05:33.240
spears a guy through the chest and pulls him into the ground.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.160
Right there I was like, fuck yeah, this is going to be awesome.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.040
Any spoilers?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.920
There is a couple of spoilers I was going to mention.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.640
These are kind of cameos towards the end of the movie.

05:41.640 --> 05:46.760
Remember that rumor going around that there was going to be an Xbox 360 robot in the movie?

05:46.760 --> 05:53.760
There is, briefly, a cameo because the Allspark causes things to come alive.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.120
So one of the things that happens to get set off by this is a 360, so you see this guy

05:58.120 --> 06:03.640
carrying it out of a GameStop or something, but it busts out the side just for half a

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
second.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.440
And then there is a Mountain Dew machine robot, which is funny, shooting cans at people, so

06:08.440 --> 06:11.720
brief little cameos there.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.060
But it is an excellent movie, highly recommended if you like action movies.

06:15.060 --> 06:18.160
If you are looking for a deep story line or something like that, you are not going to

06:18.160 --> 06:19.960
find it here, but it is good.

06:19.960 --> 06:24.200
Okay, unfortunately we are radio and not television, so you can't really see everything that goes

06:24.200 --> 06:29.620
on here in studio, but Rice Princess is making her patented Laura Roslin face.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.740
And the Laura Roslin face is, if you've ever watched Battlestar Galactica, you know, what's

06:33.740 --> 06:34.740
the actress' name?

06:34.740 --> 06:35.740
Mary McDonald?

06:35.740 --> 06:36.740
Is that it?

06:36.740 --> 06:37.740
I think that's what it is, yeah.

06:37.740 --> 06:41.060
Like, you know, the actress, whenever something negative happens, she has this very distinct

06:41.060 --> 06:45.520
look where she kind of scrunches up her nose and her mouth, and like Irene or Rice Princess

06:45.520 --> 06:47.320
has that look down pat.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.920
So when she's displeased with something, it's the Laura Roslin look.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.920
So why are you giving this review of the Laura Roslin look?

06:52.920 --> 06:56.760
Okay, the Xbox turning into a Transformer.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.520
It's in there for like two seconds.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
I know.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
It's quick.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.140
That's like subliminal advertising, like ew.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.140
I mean, come on.

07:04.140 --> 07:07.520
The cars that are in this movie are being used as advertising.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.200
Yeah, but you didn't see an Xbox 360 in the original Transformers cartoon.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
Well, it's been updated.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.920
They didn't want them to look all blocky and stupid like the cartoon.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.520
That's okay, but there were cars in the original one, so of course there's going to be cars

07:21.520 --> 07:25.480
in this one, but an Xbox 360, come on, Microsoft.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.040
They don't even show the 360.

07:27.040 --> 07:31.680
All they show is the white premium box and an arm punch out the side, you know, and that's

07:31.680 --> 07:35.520
it and the guy drops it and it's there for literally one to two seconds.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
I would drop it too because it's an Xbox.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.600
I caught it, you know, real briefly, but a lot of people probably won't even notice it.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.840
It does not detract from the film whatsoever.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.480
It's not like, let's call Xbox 360 robot.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.680
He will defeat everybody.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.960
I mean, it's not anything like that at all.

07:48.960 --> 07:54.640
So he will charge you, you know, 800 Microsoft points for every projectile that he throws.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.640
Exactly.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.640
There are a few.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.480
Yeah, it's a good movie.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.480
I liked it.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.640
I cannot wait to see it again.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.640
I keep forgetting that Rice Princess is like really anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.480
Then remind me again real quick, why are you so-

08:07.480 --> 08:12.120
I'm not super anti-Xbox and Microsoft.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.120
I'm not.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.520
I don't even know much about, you know, Microsoft to really hate them.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.320
I just don't prefer them.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.200
Like they're very underwhelming to me.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.720
Didn't you tell me it has to do really with the games that they offer though, that there's

08:23.720 --> 08:26.600
not a lot of like- That's what I'm saying, like I'm very underwhelmed

08:26.600 --> 08:28.800
because they don't have anything to offer to me.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.320
Everything appeals to me on that system.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.440
You need to see the Eternal Sonata demo though if you haven't yet because that seems like

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
a Japanese RPG.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.960
I have actually seen it and it does look really pretty and I would totally play it.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.600
Maybe Blue Dragon in the future?

08:42.600 --> 08:46.640
She made the Roslin face like a second ago, you're getting so good at that.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.640
I know.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.120
I've been practicing for a long time, but yeah, I don't know.

08:51.120 --> 08:57.000
Blue Dragon might be cool, I don't know, we'll see, but definitely the other one looked really

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
good.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.400
All right, anyhow, let's see, Ross Steel UT seems to agree with you in chat room.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.160
Xbox 360 is all first person shooter.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.440
It's not all first person shooter.

09:07.440 --> 09:12.720
He also says, listen to Loki blindly defend a shitty unrelated marketing ploy.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.760
It is a blatant ploy, but the whole movie has blatant product placement everywhere.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.400
I mean come on, a fucking Mountain Dew robot.

09:21.400 --> 09:26.680
Enough movie chat, game chat, sorry to interrupt your gaming week, but anyways, what else?

09:26.680 --> 09:32.000
Other than that, actually I bought Nellie the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

09:32.000 --> 09:40.120
for the Wii, which I might add has the worst cameras ever in a game, it's so awful, but

09:40.120 --> 09:41.120
she likes it.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
It's Harry Potter.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.200
I think she actually finished it.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.520
I forgot that was out.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.840
Do you really cast spells with the Wiimote and everything?

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
Heck yeah.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
It's okay.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.320
It's just the whole game, it sounds fun, you get to cast spells and stuff, but the whole

09:53.320 --> 09:55.240
game is doing tasks for people.

09:55.240 --> 10:00.600
It's like running around this stupid place and doing meaningless tasks like, I've lost

10:00.600 --> 10:01.880
my stuff.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.520
People have hidden it somewhere in Hogwarts.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
Go find it.

10:04.520 --> 10:10.640
Well, thank you for giving me no hints whatsoever and Hogwarts isn't exactly small, so it takes

10:10.640 --> 10:14.760
a lot of time and there's also a lot of things where if you forget what you're supposed to

10:14.760 --> 10:18.600
be doing, you go back and ask them, they won't give you any hints to what you're supposed

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
to do or something like that.

10:19.600 --> 10:26.120
A lot of the puzzles are hard to figure out what they want you to do.

10:26.120 --> 10:31.360
The combat in the game using the wand and stuff is pretty stupid because Nellie didn't

10:31.360 --> 10:38.160
really have a grasp on any sort of strategy, so she was just swinging the remote around

10:38.160 --> 10:44.060
like crazy and it won every battle.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.680
It's cool if you love Harry Potter, you'll definitely like the game.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.920
I would recommend though, probably don't get it on the Wii, maybe get it on the 360 or

10:52.920 --> 10:54.320
the Playstation 3.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.600
The Wii-mote waving for your spells is not all that, it's not all that.

10:58.600 --> 11:04.120
I'm not sure if in the normal, like the 360 and the Playstation 3, if you use the other

11:04.120 --> 11:09.440
analog stick as maybe a camera look or something, but I know in the Wii version, it was hard

11:09.440 --> 11:13.240
to even face in the right direction for certain things.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.560
You'd be facing at what you want to cast a spell at, pull out your wand and you'd turn

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
around.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.480
It's like, come on, what the hell?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.120
It looks cool.

11:23.120 --> 11:28.180
The other games I've been playing on the PSP, I actually Wipeout Pulse, which is not out

11:28.180 --> 11:30.560
over here in the U.S. yet, but it's okay.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.560
It's just like Wipeout.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.840
I've played a lot of Wipeout Pure before and it's very similar to that.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.160
Looks almost like a Playstation 2 game, but pretty awesome, so that's going to be coming

11:41.160 --> 11:42.600
out in September.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.520
The other game I've been playing is Final Fantasy, the remake on the PSP, and that's

11:46.520 --> 11:48.200
actually really awesome looking.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.960
You showed that to me and I played it for about 15 seconds and I'm so fucking sold

11:51.960 --> 11:52.960
on it.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.720
The game is freaking gorgeous.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.800
The screenshots don't do it justice.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.480
The game looks so beautiful.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
It's amazing.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.720
It's just amazing.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.560
We're actually going to get married, me and the game.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.880
You and Final Fantasy are going to get married?

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
We totally are.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.080
We've already discussed this.

12:08.080 --> 12:14.240
The last game I was playing was a game called Zainid Revolution, I think, and it's a sequel

12:14.240 --> 12:20.160
to an Xbox shooter game, like one of the shoot-em-ups that came out probably very late in the Xbox

12:20.160 --> 12:22.680
life cycle.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
It's kind of different.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.560
This one now is a 3D shooter.

12:25.560 --> 12:30.240
You're kind of going towards the screen, I guess.

12:30.240 --> 12:35.680
It's still got the shoot-em-up aspect stuff in the game, but after seeing games that are

12:35.680 --> 12:39.520
free, like No Gravity and stuff, I'm sorry.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.720
The background of the whole game is just a full motion video and you can see artifacts

12:42.720 --> 12:47.000
and stuff, it's just not very good when a free game like No Gravity does everything

12:47.000 --> 12:51.280
in real time and it looks amazing for no money.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.720
So I'd probably hold off on buying that, but it's pretty cool, though.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.960
Definitely get Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II when those come out.

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
Awesome games.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
All right.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
I'll go next.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.040
Ashley Rice Francis, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

13:07.040 --> 13:09.040
Okay.

13:09.040 --> 13:14.800
My quite substantial gaming week that consists of just nothing, really.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.800
You didn't play any games?

13:15.800 --> 13:16.800
I played WoW.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.800
Oh, oh, oh!

13:17.800 --> 13:22.160
Did we get into what we're doing with WoW?

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
Go for it.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.300
Why don't you tell us about what we're doing with WoW, since you play nothing but World

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
of Warcraft these days?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.720
Yeah, pretty much, because I don't have time.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.340
Now, just to say, because some folks might go, then why should I believe anything she

13:31.340 --> 13:35.680
has to say about gaming, but that's just because your living situation right now, you just

13:35.680 --> 13:36.680
don't have any...

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
I work two jobs.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.680
I don't have time to game.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
Okay.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
So shut your fucking face, people.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.680
Anyway...

13:41.680 --> 13:42.680
Why are you on this show?

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
I don't really know.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
To say...

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
To cuss a lot.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
I don't know.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
Okay.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.160
But we're going to be creating a twink guild.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.160
What's a twink guild?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
It's a guild...

13:52.160 --> 13:53.480
I know we've had this discussion on a previous show.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.240
I'm not going to go to the porno-related side of this.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
Just tell us straight up.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
What is this guild all about?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.240
The guild's all about PvP.

14:00.240 --> 14:05.160
We're going to be doing Mursangulch and Narathi Basin, and we're going to stay at level 29,

14:05.160 --> 14:10.400
because it's like... so we can do AB, and it's the first one we can do it at.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
Everyone knows what twinks are.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.600
They're just the really super awesome characters that have all the best gear and all the best

14:16.600 --> 14:22.960
enchants and all that stuff, and we're going to make it based on Battlestar Galactica characters.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.300
That's the nerdiest part, is everyone in the guild's named themselves after a character

14:26.300 --> 14:28.800
from Battlestar Galactica, and the guild's called what?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
The Frackers?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
The Frackers.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
Isn't that the best thing ever?

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
Stupidest thing ever.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.760
You're the stupidest thing ever.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.520
What level have you gotten your character up to for the PvP guild?

14:38.520 --> 14:43.160
I haven't even made it yet, but we've been in discussions for it.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.960
Even mine's level 6.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.320
What's your name again?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
It's Liadama.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.320
Liadama?

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
Oh, you nerd!

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
Liadama's mine.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
Shut up.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.320
You shut up.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.480
Mine's going to be Tyrrell, because he's hot and sexy and nobody likes him, except for

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
me.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.560
So I'm like, whatever, I'll take his name.

14:59.560 --> 15:02.600
Who else do we have in our PvP guild?

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
A lot.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.240
I'm pretty sure there's a Roslin.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
I think...

15:06.240 --> 15:08.400
I don't know if there is a Roslin.

15:08.400 --> 15:13.520
One of our guilds said they wanted to be a real bitch, so we said do Admiral Cain.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.440
Yeah, oh my god, isn't that the best thing ever?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.440
She's my hero.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.400
So that's pretty much it on my end of the gaming week.

15:22.400 --> 15:27.240
Alright, let's see.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.280
Rasteel UTS, some advice.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.640
Price Princess, you might have time to game if you didn't upset over that useless time

15:33.640 --> 15:34.640
sink.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.760
In other words, stop playing WoW in your other games.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.000
Oh man, that was hilarious.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.480
Because you're never going to get away from WoW, huh?

15:42.480 --> 15:43.480
Not really, no.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.480
She's giving me Roslin face.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.200
Let's see, my gaming week actually sadly was pretty similar.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.320
I didn't play a whole lot outside of WoW, but I have a good reason, because I was out

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
of town for three days.

15:53.320 --> 15:59.040
I was in LA and I had to do this thing for work where we stayed all together for this

15:59.040 --> 16:02.400
team building thing away from the society, so I couldn't even get out to an arcade or

16:02.400 --> 16:06.920
a bar or anything, so not a whole lot of time I had to game.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.400
When I was able to play some of the games outside of World of Warcraft, I did play some

16:10.400 --> 16:16.240
stuff on the DS, still playing Puzzle Quest, that game is fun, and I'm hoping to beat it.

16:16.240 --> 16:21.360
And also, even though this isn't a video game, it scores me a ton of nerd points.

16:21.360 --> 16:27.240
I've been playing Survivor, like the TV show, I've been playing Survivor on LiveJournal.

16:27.240 --> 16:32.080
Because a lot of people play Dungeons and Dragons online, so there's Survivor on LiveJournal,

16:32.080 --> 16:33.920
so I'm playing that.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.960
I wasn't the first voted out, thank God.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.400
There you go.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.520
I was very happy about that.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
That's pretty much it.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.320
I haven't been playing a lot else with my gaming week, although I did check out that

16:45.320 --> 16:49.200
Final Fantasy I when Loki let me borrow it for a little bit, and boy, that game looks

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
sexy.

16:50.200 --> 16:54.200
I'm going to have to find my PSP and dust it off seriously with Final Fantasy I, II,

16:54.200 --> 16:55.200
Tactics, Castlevania.

16:55.200 --> 17:01.040
A lot of folks that were dishing out the PSP hate because it didn't have the types of games

17:01.040 --> 17:02.360
they were looking for.

17:02.360 --> 17:07.740
It's finally coming, a lot of those types of the role-playings and the ports of classics

17:07.740 --> 17:08.740
that we love.

17:08.740 --> 17:09.740
Yeah.

17:09.740 --> 17:10.740
There you go.

17:10.740 --> 17:16.960
I was kind of having, I was dishing out PSP uncertainty because there wasn't really, again,

17:16.960 --> 17:19.140
it was kind of like the Xbox.

17:19.140 --> 17:23.900
There was nothing that was really appealing to me except for Luminous, but now I'm seeing

17:23.900 --> 17:26.760
all these games and I'm totally going to invest in one.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
All right.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
Yep.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.760
I thought I'd interject with that.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
All right.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
All right.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Well, let's see.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.800
Now that we've gone through our gaming weeks, perhaps we should get into some housekeeping

17:36.800 --> 17:41.200
tonight and tell you guys about what's going on with us.

17:41.200 --> 17:47.540
We are going to be making an appearance at SAC for Sacramento Anime.

17:47.540 --> 17:53.040
We're going to be going to that convention, which is, I believe, two weeks off.

17:53.040 --> 17:57.520
I think we're going to be making an appearance on Saturday, the 14th.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.560
And for those of you that are in the Sacramento area, it's at that hotel that's across Martin

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
Fair Mall.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.960
All the details we will have next week, we're still trying to work that out with the folks

18:04.960 --> 18:08.000
and I need to make sure even all of us are available or else it's only going to be some

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
of us.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.800
However, we will not be taping one of our live usual shows at this convention as we

18:13.800 --> 18:15.000
did for Fanime.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.920
We will be recording a special bonus show that only folks on the live journal, the MySpace,

18:20.920 --> 18:23.120
our communities, will be able to direct download.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.200
It will not go into the RSS feed.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.640
So if you are interested in keeping tabs on all that type of special stuff that we put

18:28.640 --> 18:33.360
out that's extra, check out our live journal community, which is Orange Lounge on Live

18:33.360 --> 18:34.900
Journal, or you can check out our MySpace.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.600
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on MySpace.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.000
You think I just learned English this week.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
What the hell is going on?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
You did.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
You did.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Geez.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.240
Well, you know, because last week was the five-year anniversary and all, now this week,

18:48.240 --> 18:49.240
we're just set up for disappointment.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.240
Like, who gives a fuck anniversary?

18:51.240 --> 18:52.240
Exactly.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
Who gives a fuck anymore?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.760
I'm surprised we're here.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.020
When you're at the top, you got to have to bring it down a notch and like gradually go

18:58.020 --> 19:00.200
down a bit so that you can bring it back up.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.240
For 250 because, you know, 250 is a landmark number so you have to bring it up again for

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
that.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
Totally right.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
Anyway.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.240
Let's see.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.240
Other housekeeping.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.240
Happy Canada Day.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.020
To all our Canadians that are listening, we are taping on July the 1st.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.120
So happy Canada Day.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.120
To you.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.600
It's my six-year anniversary today too.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
Is it?

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
No.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.400
It's the first time that we started dating.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
Was July 1st, really?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
Yes.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
Honestly, it's not like your marriage was in April.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
No.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
No.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
We didn't go through some weird time.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.640
You know my parents' anniversary is July 1st too.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.200
So happy anniversary, Mommy and Daddy, because they got married on July 1st.

19:32.200 --> 19:37.560
And also this week, since it will be this week, to all the American folks that listen,

19:37.560 --> 19:39.320
happy 4th of July.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.220
And to celebrate our anniversary, we're getting a kitty.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.220
Are you really?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.220
Yeah, we're getting a kitty.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.220
What are you going to name it?

19:46.220 --> 19:50.200
Well, the two things that I thought I'd never do, and that's the two things I would never

19:50.200 --> 19:53.720
do, buy an Apple product and get a cat because I'm a dog person.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.920
But we're getting a cat.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.200
I'm not buying an Apple product ever.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Not an iPhone?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
I know.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.200
One of our friends got an iPhone.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.200
They're pretty sexy.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.600
It was bringing sexy back.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.320
Just knowing Apple, there will be something even better next year.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.320
So I'm going to hold off and hopefully I'll have money because I'm moving soon.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.960
Actually, also the countdown is beginning for the last shows in the studio.

20:12.960 --> 20:17.280
We're going to be moving to a new room because I'm moving to a new place and hopefully a

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
bigger studio.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.760
I hope so.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.060
And definitely there will be a webcam in the new studio.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.800
So that's something to look forward to.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.360
Those shows will debut in August.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.880
I think we're going to take a week off while we switch over.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.440
And then in August, probably going to hopefully change a lot.

20:32.440 --> 20:37.720
I'm hoping we're just going to do a new season, kind of redo Orange Lounge for the new studio

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
and everything.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.720
It will be fun.

20:39.720 --> 20:46.480
Our new kitty is going to be, she's four months old and her name is Stella.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.480
Stella.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.040
You already named it?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
No, we didn't name it.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.880
It's a foster cat right now.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
It's in a foster home.

20:53.880 --> 20:58.240
So we are going to be picking it up on Friday.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.360
Jake Simmons says, name it Kitty Bobo.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.480
And Rosteal UT says, name it Tingle.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.880
There you go.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.520
Can't name it Tingle.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.800
It responds to Stella.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.480
We'll see about nicknames.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.480
Alright.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.040
Also, I wanted to mention this real quickly.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.640
You're going to be hearing this a lot, especially those of you guys that listen to a variety

21:19.640 --> 21:21.120
of podcasts.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.440
You're really going to get sick of hearing this after this month is over.

21:24.440 --> 21:28.440
So we're really only going to say this once, but it is that time of year.

21:28.440 --> 21:33.560
The podcast awards are open and nominations have started as of today.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.560
And of course, we would be tickled pink if we could get nominated again this year.

21:37.560 --> 21:41.480
If you want to nominate us, you go over to podcastawards.com.

21:41.480 --> 21:45.360
If you need to know our feed URL, there's actually a thread in our forums and I'll link

21:45.360 --> 21:46.360
that in chat shortly.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.960
It has all the details.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.800
Obviously, we would very much appreciate a nomination for best gaming or best people's

21:51.800 --> 21:53.780
choice, whatever you want.

21:53.780 --> 21:58.400
But if there's a podcast you like better, that's a gaming podcast, hey, no problem.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.000
All we really want to see is the independent podcast prevail in this.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.760
And last year, even though we weren't nominated, we were very happy to see that five independent

22:05.760 --> 22:06.760
podcasts were nominated.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.400
And that's the way we want to keep it because you know what, guys?

22:09.400 --> 22:13.800
Those podcasts that are owned by the corporates and the big game companies and the big gaming

22:13.800 --> 22:16.000
magazines, they don't need the exposure.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.720
They have lots of ad dollars that go into their print, their TV.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.200
They don't need the exposure.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.440
But the independent folks, a podcast award can really help them out because when we won

22:24.440 --> 22:26.680
it in 2005, it really did help us out.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.620
So please make sure an independent wins it, guys.

22:30.620 --> 22:33.920
If it can't be us, we definitely would like to see another independent win it.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.480
So there you have it, podcast awards.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.280
The nominations are open, I think, through the 15th.

22:39.280 --> 22:43.560
And I'm hoping that people will suggest independent podcasts from other categories in our thread

22:43.560 --> 22:47.600
on the forums to maybe nominate because I don't know a lot outside of gaming.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.600
I know a couple sci-fi and a couple, but not a lot.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.480
So I'm hoping we can kind of share and help promote the indie podcasts.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.480
Totally.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
That would be cool.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.480
All right.

22:56.480 --> 23:00.080
Anyhow, let's move on and get into tonight's gaming news.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.200
Yes.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.680
Not a huge surprise, especially with E3 around the corner.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.520
We're getting a lot of announcements of what's going to be coming out at E3, what you can

23:07.520 --> 23:12.280
expect to be reading about because obviously most of you probably aren't going, including

23:12.280 --> 23:13.280
us.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
Fucking people.

23:14.280 --> 23:19.440
Anyways, so one of those, which isn't a big surprise and I'm surprised we haven't seen

23:19.440 --> 23:25.480
more of it yet, Killzone 2, Sony's invite for, I believe, their press conference and

23:25.480 --> 23:31.660
whatnot was, of course, Killzone themed and they're probably going to be featuring the

23:31.660 --> 23:34.000
game playable or in some sort of trailer.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm guessing playable.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.040
I mean, it's got to be coming out pretty soon at the event.

23:39.040 --> 23:45.140
So hopefully soon we'll see some more on Killzone 2 and see if it's really this big game that

23:45.140 --> 23:49.800
everyone's claiming it to be, or at least everyone in Sony camp.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.800
Interesting.

23:50.800 --> 23:57.000
Well, we won't really know much about E3 this year because we aren't going, not that we're

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
bitter or anything.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
No.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Completely.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Whatever.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.840
It's going to be on the internet within five seconds anyway.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.800
And we've seen enough of how the gaming industry works on the inside that what's really going

24:06.800 --> 24:12.080
to happen is that the game companies will sell the rights to one of those big box gaming

24:12.080 --> 24:13.080
companies.

24:13.080 --> 24:17.240
And the big box gaming companies will actually post it the day before E3, meaning that all

24:17.240 --> 24:21.120
the independent press who actually manages to get into E3 has to run their stories 48

24:21.120 --> 24:22.120
hours late.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
That's the way it's really going to work.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
So you know what?

24:24.120 --> 24:27.160
We're just going to stay at home and steal other people's articles this year because

24:27.160 --> 24:28.160
hey, it's the American way.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.680
All I know is when these press conferences will be going on, I will not be doing much

24:31.680 --> 24:35.080
work at my desk because that's usually the case.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.000
I'm usually just getting refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, news!

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Read it.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Oh, refresh.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.240
Can you watch them live like last year or is it because it's not as big a, you know,

24:43.240 --> 24:45.400
that's low key, can't watch that stuff live this year?

24:45.400 --> 24:49.240
I can, but at the work, you know, a lot of the internet's blocked.

24:49.240 --> 24:53.100
So a lot of the, you know, unless they're streaming it straight off their site and off

24:53.100 --> 24:57.320
something else, you know, most likely I can't watch it live.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.320
But who cares?

24:58.320 --> 25:01.560
You know, if I can read about it, that's all I really care about.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.880
I don't think I've told you this.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.880
I'll have to tell you a little more, give you details offhand.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.680
But one of our other folks that works for Orange Launch Radio on one of the other weeknight

25:09.680 --> 25:14.240
shows, actually had some touch with a game company this week and that game company said

25:14.240 --> 25:17.520
they'd invite us to E3, but now it's like too late.

25:17.520 --> 25:23.200
It's like E3's only 10 days away, I'm like, great, now we got a possible invite and now

25:23.200 --> 25:24.200
it's too freaking late.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.200
Aww.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.200
I know, that sucks.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.200
But oh well, maybe next year.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.920
I don't know, weekend I'd drive my ass down there.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
I know.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
That's the problem.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.920
It's like I've already now made commitments of a day job.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.480
Originally I was trying to keep that time open because I thought maybe something would

25:35.480 --> 25:36.480
come through.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.360
Well, you know, I'm not too worried about it because all those demos that are going

25:39.360 --> 25:44.680
to be there at E3 are going to be at E4ALL or PAX or whatever we end up going to next

25:44.680 --> 25:47.060
and big deal.

25:47.060 --> 25:50.280
I sadly can't go to PAX because of a wedding, but I hope somebody from the Orange Launch

25:50.280 --> 25:51.880
Radio staff is able to go up there.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.320
E4ALL I'm definitely going to though.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.800
I'm trying to make it to E4ALL.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.920
I don't know if I'll end up making it out there, but I would like to go because it would

25:59.920 --> 26:01.560
be nice to see that stuff.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.760
Will Rice Princess be going to any of these big gaming conventions?

26:03.760 --> 26:05.760
I want to go to BlizzCon.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
BlizzCon?

26:06.760 --> 26:12.080
I can't though because all the tickets sold out within what, fucking four days or something

26:12.080 --> 26:13.080
like that?

26:13.080 --> 26:14.080
Why does that not surprise me?

26:14.080 --> 26:15.080
I know.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.080
I think about four hours.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.080
Four hours, really?

26:17.080 --> 26:18.080
Days, hours, doesn't matter.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.920
Yeah, I'm really sad about that, but whatever.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.640
I'll go next year.

26:22.640 --> 26:28.040
DS68 says the SF Bay area needs a gaming convention, damn it.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.600
I agree, except there is a whole game developers conference, which is kind of a big deal.

26:31.600 --> 26:35.280
If you remember though, they did try to do something like that.

26:35.280 --> 26:39.640
Remember there was that one convention that was in San Francisco, it was a weekend, and

26:39.640 --> 26:41.640
I don't remember what exactly it was.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.720
I want to say it wasn't sponsored.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.200
It might have been sponsored by GameSpa, like a GameSpot expo or something like that.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.640
TechTV used to be there.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.920
Was it Davis' own GameSpa one time?

26:52.920 --> 26:53.920
No.

26:53.920 --> 26:54.920
Hello.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.920
No, I'm crazy.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.880
I think GamePro or something.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.680
There was a GameSpot expo, I want to say, that was in San Francisco.

27:01.680 --> 27:02.680
It was really small.

27:02.680 --> 27:09.160
They only had maybe 15 publishers out there, but from what I remember reading, there wasn't

27:09.160 --> 27:10.480
that much response to it.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
It was pretty crappy.

27:11.480 --> 27:15.120
Besides, we're being totally selfish because obviously the SF Bay area is pretty much in

27:15.120 --> 27:16.120
our backyard.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.000
It's about two hours away, so it's totally drivable, but I'm sure everybody's like,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.620
I wish they'd have a gaming convention in my part of town.

27:21.620 --> 27:28.200
But the good news is, usually there's at least something small-ish in any type of town, even

27:28.200 --> 27:31.440
if it's like an anime slash game convention, which you see a lot of everywhere.

27:31.440 --> 27:38.160
I would rather go to Gamers' Days over the giant E3s any day.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.840
At least you get more one-on-one time with games.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
Usually.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.840
I kind of agree.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.160
Was it the first Konami Gamers' Day that we went to?

27:45.160 --> 27:48.520
That was pretty low-key and we got to play pretty much everything.

27:48.520 --> 27:53.760
The last one though, not so much because of too much press and the place was kind of smaller

27:53.760 --> 27:58.640
and it seemed like, well, we got to get the shot for our TV show, get out of the way type

27:58.640 --> 27:59.640
of shit.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.200
Everyone's kind of there to do jobs instead of report stuff.

28:04.200 --> 28:10.000
Well, anyhow, obviously one big announcement that came out of E3, actually, I want to read

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
a chat comment here.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.360
GS191 is correcting me here.

28:12.360 --> 28:17.100
Well, actually CNET is actually owned by Ziff Davis, so GameSpot by Proxy is.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.100
So interesting.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.100
I didn't realize that.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.100
All right.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.100
Moving on.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.100
Oh, sorry.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.960
I keep reading chat and I see new stuff pop up.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.520
There was a big convention this weekend that might be a little bit near and dear to our

28:27.520 --> 28:30.240
hearts and the folks have been listening to us from the beginning.

28:30.240 --> 28:36.600
Bolmani Fest was this weekend on the East Coast, which is, of course, this big Bebomani

28:36.600 --> 28:39.820
and Beatmania and DDR convention that's on the East Coast.

28:39.820 --> 28:43.000
They have it at a bowling alley, hence the term Bolmani, which is cute.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.720
And they actually get, usually, some folks that are actually in the games to come out

28:46.720 --> 28:47.720
there and perform.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.920
That's cute.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.720
I wish I was at the East Coast like a couple of weeks later than I was.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.200
Maybe I could have gone.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.800
Anyhow, big conventions.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.400
Last year, one of the big things we saw at E3 was Final Fantasy XIII and, of course,

29:00.400 --> 29:02.520
everybody wants to know when.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.160
When will we get this game?

29:04.160 --> 29:09.520
Well, Square Enix has actually said that they will be doing no games for the PlayStation

29:09.520 --> 29:12.820
3 until after April 1st of 2008.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.060
Why then?

29:14.060 --> 29:15.760
Because that's the new fiscal year.

29:15.760 --> 29:20.400
There will be no games from Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 this fiscal year.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.160
Not a big surprise as far as Final Fantasy XIII is regarded.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.880
I think most of us here in the U.S. were thinking we'd be lucky to see it at the end of 2008

29:27.880 --> 29:30.500
with all the translation and stuff that has to go on.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
But there it is.

29:31.500 --> 29:37.360
That's really sad, though, when you think about it because Sony really needs some strong

29:37.360 --> 29:41.960
titles to come out in order to be able to push this PlayStation 3 to the level that

29:41.960 --> 29:44.760
the 360 and the Wii are right now.

29:44.760 --> 29:49.800
We're hoping for Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV in both those now or after March

29:49.800 --> 29:52.360
of next year.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.620
Missed another Christmas.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.280
That's not good.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.400
That's going to really put them behind.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.740
I don't think they're going to be able to catch up.

30:00.740 --> 30:07.280
It's going to have to be one of those one in a million shots that's going to turn around.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.400
So what's Sony going to push this Christmas?

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
Little Big Planet, Home?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
The same stuff we saw?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
Home, Little Big Planet.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
Killzone?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.400
Killzone?

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
I don't know what you're talking about this year.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.400
There's no way.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.400
I guess that's true.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.360
You're probably looking at the second quarter of next year, but I would say this year probably

30:20.360 --> 30:25.840
Heavenly Sword because that's pretty much God of War on the PlayStation 3 anyways.

30:25.840 --> 30:30.160
Lair is going to be good and probably some unannounced stuff.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.160
Ratchet and Clank.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.160
The new Ratchet and Clank.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
It looks awesome.

30:33.160 --> 30:38.620
I mean, same people did Resistance and that game was sweet, so I don't know.

30:38.620 --> 30:42.080
It's going to be hard for them.

30:42.080 --> 30:46.160
Thomas says, we'll see Final Fantasy 13 before Duke Nukem Forever.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.160
Very true.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.160
Probably.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
Oh my God.

30:49.160 --> 30:53.760
I can't wait for the day when Duke Nukem Forever is actually going to come out.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.520
Frisbee calls it Final Fantasy Sporever.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.520
Get it?

30:58.520 --> 30:59.520
Because Spore is also delayed.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.420
It's just been delayed a few years or something.

31:02.420 --> 31:05.600
These are all games that people cannot freaking wait for.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.840
Well, Spore that we've seen playable in some form, and you know what, it's just a very

31:10.840 --> 31:14.880
large game and they have to make sure that it's going to be everything that they want

31:14.880 --> 31:16.720
to be before they release it.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.800
It's just like Fable 2.

31:18.800 --> 31:19.800
It's just like Fable 2.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.240
Fable 2 is probably going to be delayed forever because they want to make sure that it's perfect.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
And you know what?

31:25.240 --> 31:33.040
I'd rather them be perfect than have another Transformers game come out or Spiderman 3.

31:33.040 --> 31:38.520
One thing that's definitely not been perfect is the brand new firmwares for the PSP.

31:38.520 --> 31:43.900
Not one firmware so far released has been able to be not hacked and such is the case

31:43.900 --> 31:46.080
with 3.5.

31:46.080 --> 31:56.400
In fact, last week they found a new kind of work around called the Illuminati and basically

31:56.400 --> 32:01.800
uses the old Luminous to run Homebrew code.

32:01.800 --> 32:07.240
And of course, immediately after that came out, there is now a 3.5 down grader so you

32:07.240 --> 32:14.320
can down grade your PSP to be able to run either 1.5 so you can run Homebrew that way

32:14.320 --> 32:17.840
or to be able to run custom firmwares, which you know, custom firmwares are the way to

32:17.840 --> 32:20.000
go I think.

32:20.000 --> 32:26.340
Other interesting things though, because of the Illuminati exploit, the Luminous sales

32:26.340 --> 32:30.120
have skyrocketed about 14,000%.

32:30.120 --> 32:34.060
So a lot of people are picking up Luminous, which you know, it's a great game anyways,

32:34.060 --> 32:37.880
but it might be a little harder to find it if you don't have it already.

32:37.880 --> 32:42.320
Well, most people were ignoring Luminous 1 because Luminous 2 was out now and I doubt

32:42.320 --> 32:46.880
Q Entertainment is making a lot of those, or whoever, who published that one actually?

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
Was it Q?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.800
Or was it Sony actually published it?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.080
It was Q, but I think Ubisoft published it.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.080
Wow, okay.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.000
But you know, Ubisoft has been making a lot of copies of that probably because of Luminous

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
2.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I don't think it's available anymore.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.400
I don't think so either, but people are trying to scrounge them up now.

33:02.400 --> 33:09.060
Also on Sony platform's much anticipated Guitar Hero rocks the 80s and they've done a brilliant

33:09.060 --> 33:13.760
job over at Activision of keeping this game in the press every week before it's released

33:13.760 --> 33:17.760
because they'll give you a few more songs this week, a few more songs, a few more songs.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.260
Well finally we know the whole dang song list because we've got some more songs this week

33:21.260 --> 33:22.260
and that's it.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.960
We've got the whole song list.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.200
Caught in a Mosh by Anthrax is in the game.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.960
I'm only going to read the songs I care about.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.000
Police Truck by the Dead Kennedys.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.040
We Got the Beat by the Go-Go's and I love this one, I Think I'm Turning Japanese by

33:35.040 --> 33:36.040
the Vapers.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.040
Awesome.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.040
That's great.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.620
That's going to be a great Guitar Hero song.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.480
Why are you making Rosalind Face, Rice Princess?

33:41.480 --> 33:42.900
Because the song list sucks.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.900
You don't like the song list?

33:43.900 --> 33:44.900
I don't like it at all.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.900
There's some other stuff though that was already announced.

33:45.900 --> 33:46.900
I read the whole song list.

33:46.900 --> 33:47.900
You read the whole thing?

33:47.900 --> 33:48.900
Yeah.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
I agree.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.900
They could have done a little better.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.900
What were you hoping for?

33:51.900 --> 33:58.080
For like better 80s music that wasn't all just like hair bands and just like crap like

33:58.080 --> 33:59.080
that.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.080
She's very diverse.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
Paula Abdul?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
Yes.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.080
But there's no guitar solos there.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.080
She's very famous for guitar solos.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.080
I know.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.080
Then what?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.080
I don't know.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.080
Hair bands were guitar solos.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.080
I don't know.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.720
I mean like just something a little more eclectic.

34:10.720 --> 34:16.440
I don't have any like, I don't know, examples right now, but I don't know.

34:16.440 --> 34:19.280
Raw Steel UT in chat says Guitar Hero 80 sucks.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.560
It doesn't have We're Not Gonna Take It or Money for Nothing.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.960
Twisted Sister would be pretty awesome.

34:23.960 --> 34:24.960
True.

34:24.960 --> 34:25.960
Actually Twisted Sister I think is in the band.

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
It's just the wrong song.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.600
Let's see.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.600
Rama says Guitar Hero needs Weird Al.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.040
Frisbee says Elite Beat Agents was going to have Weird Al.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.760
That was also a song list that turned out to be fake.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.560
I don't know if that was ever actually going to be in the band I think or in the game.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.560
I think somebody just kind of pulled that out of their butt.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.620
Money for Nothing would be fucking awesome.

34:45.620 --> 34:46.620
I agree.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.800
That would be cool.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.720
Drunami says give us Bohemian Rhapsody.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
I think that was 70s though.

34:50.720 --> 34:51.720
Yeah.

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
It'd be too long.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
79 or 78.

34:53.720 --> 34:57.680
All right, well there you have it, Guitar Hero 80s edition.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.480
Those of you guys that do like the air bands, I'm sure you're very excited about that.

35:01.480 --> 35:07.440
Anyways, since E3 is right around the corner, not too surprising we're starting to get leaked

35:07.440 --> 35:09.820
lists from E3.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.200
This course should be of interest to everybody.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
The Konami E3 list was leaked out.

35:15.200 --> 35:22.040
Looks like coming from a tip to Xbox Live Radio or XBL Radio who is another affiliate

35:22.040 --> 35:24.160
on AllGames.com just like us.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.160
Awesome.

35:25.160 --> 35:31.240
Some stuff, of course, not too surprising, DDR Supernova 2 for PlayStation 2, Universe

35:31.240 --> 35:37.520
2 for the 360, Karaoke Revolution American Idol 2 for the PlayStation 2, a game called

35:37.520 --> 35:42.640
DDR Disney Challenge for the PlayStation 2.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.160
Let's see here what else we got.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.480
DDR Disney Challenge?

35:47.480 --> 35:49.480
Because I thought I read a report somewhere else.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.800
I don't know, I was following up with it that said something Disney Channel.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.320
It probably is Disney Channel or something.

35:55.320 --> 36:01.640
Disney Challenge sounds kind of weird unless it's like all hard stuff, whatever.

36:01.640 --> 36:06.360
There's this weird game called Girls Secret Diary for the DS.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.880
Record your secrets and dreams in your journal.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.600
I can't wait.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.600
Is that a game that will finally tear you away from Wow, Girls Secret Diary?

36:13.600 --> 36:14.600
Yeah.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
Oh my God.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.920
I don't know why, but that game starts to sound like Ping Pals to me and I get very

36:18.920 --> 36:21.640
worried because Ping Pals is shitatious.

36:21.640 --> 36:26.080
It should have Girls Secret Diary like RPG or something.

36:26.080 --> 36:30.560
I think you're just bitter because it's Girls Secret Diary and that means you can't use

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
it, Rob.

36:31.560 --> 36:36.120
And you're like, oh fine, it just sounds like Ping Pals anyway, meh, meh, meh.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.120
Shut up.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
You shut up.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.120
Shut your face up.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.720
No, I'm totally not going to get that.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.760
But you know, I'm sure we'll find out more, me and Avery's like what, just over a week

36:45.760 --> 36:46.760
away.

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
Come on, folks.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.880
It's around the corner that the PlayStation 2 is going to kind of have their year or two

36:51.880 --> 36:56.400
of being the budget system, you know, because it's so cheap and most of the games are probably

36:56.400 --> 37:00.960
going to fall to $19.99, $29.99, so like a Disney game on PlayStation 2 kind of makes

37:00.960 --> 37:04.840
a lot of sense to me because, you know, who's going to have the PlayStation 2 now is the

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
young kids.

37:05.840 --> 37:06.840
Exactly.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
That's a perfect...

37:07.840 --> 37:09.080
Mommy and Daddy are buying systems for us.

37:09.080 --> 37:13.080
It's a perfect title for a $29.99 price point.

37:13.080 --> 37:18.280
All right, well even though we might be seeing DDR on the PlayStation 2 soon, the PlayStation

37:18.280 --> 37:22.360
3 is going to be getting another long time series coming to it.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.080
Wipeout Pulse is going to be coming out.

37:25.080 --> 37:29.080
Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe has been showing this off for the past few weeks

37:29.080 --> 37:30.940
over there in London.

37:30.940 --> 37:37.680
Now Wipeout Pulse is going to be a high def version of Wipeout and it's going to be released

37:37.680 --> 37:44.640
in 2008, but hopefully we're going to get to see some hints at the game at E3.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.640
Whoop-a-dee-doo.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.240
I mean, okay, it's high def.

37:47.240 --> 37:53.040
If the whole thing was pretty much cel-shaded anyways, I mean, it's not like upping the

37:53.040 --> 37:56.840
textures are going to make it any better or anything, but hey, cool.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.360
I'm sure it will use the six axis and all that fun stuff.

37:59.360 --> 38:04.880
As long as we get some great raving soundtracks like all the other games, that will be great.

38:04.880 --> 38:09.040
Pulse' soundtrack is actually pretty cool.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.440
Some other interesting stuff coming from the Sony Cam.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.360
This one though in India, and unfortunately we're not going to see an advertising campaign

38:15.360 --> 38:18.240
like this over here, but oh my God, I wish it was.

38:18.240 --> 38:26.120
Apparently, they have a new advertising campaign that is a little bit chauvinistic, I guess.

38:26.120 --> 38:30.680
Let me just really quickly read the entire ad.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.560
Sherry is such a bitch.

38:32.560 --> 38:37.080
Last night, I saw her with this weird guy whom I think she's seen.

38:37.080 --> 38:43.640
I mean, she created such a scene when she broke up with Josie, bloody attention seeker.

38:43.640 --> 38:47.160
It's not been a week and she's already sleeping around.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.160
You know what?

38:48.160 --> 38:51.840
I think Nicole is two-timing Ron again.

38:51.840 --> 39:00.560
In the very bottom, it says, PlayStation 2, because your girlfriend bores you shitless.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.560
That's funny.

39:01.560 --> 39:02.560
How do we do that here?

39:02.560 --> 39:03.560
That's really funny.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.320
People would be pissed off and get offended and stuff.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.280
Are you offended as a woman?

39:08.280 --> 39:12.600
I'm offended it's not being advertised here because that's one of the best advertisements

39:12.600 --> 39:14.560
ever because it's so true.

39:14.560 --> 39:18.280
Of course, Sony likes to make the controversial ads.

39:18.280 --> 39:23.480
Remember the whole PSP ad, the whole white and black thing that was like, oh my gosh,

39:23.480 --> 39:24.480
pushed everybody's butts.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.480
I love this one.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.480
It shows this guy.

39:26.480 --> 39:37.520
It looks like he's from Schoolhouse Rocks and he's just sitting there slouching like

39:37.520 --> 39:41.040
I don't give a shit while his girlfriend's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
So that was kind of funny.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.560
Ross Steele, UT in chat, says, and then we wonder why women don't play video games.

39:46.560 --> 39:51.720
Yes, that's the only reason why because gaming companies make offensive advertisement.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.680
Most women I know would see the offensive advertisement and then go, well, if they're

39:55.680 --> 39:57.880
going to be like that, then I'm going to play lots of video games.

39:57.880 --> 39:58.880
I'll show them.

39:58.880 --> 39:59.880
I don't have to be boring.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.880
Well, it could be like, you know.

40:01.880 --> 40:05.160
Then they'll realize how terrible they are at video games and then they'll stop.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.360
PlayStation 2, if your boyfriend can't satisfy you, rez will.

40:08.360 --> 40:15.160
I mean, there's a great ad campaign as well.

40:15.160 --> 40:20.200
I can't wait to see the ad campaigns for Soul Calibur IV, especially, you know, being that

40:20.200 --> 40:27.160
the IVs, IVs, slutatious boobs are being shown off in the trailer massive side boob

40:27.160 --> 40:28.160
in those pictures.

40:28.160 --> 40:33.180
There is massive side boob in those pictures and a massive bombshell drop this week in

40:33.180 --> 40:34.560
regards to Soul Calibur IV.

40:34.560 --> 40:40.360
First, the game is coming out next year on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and, you know,

40:40.360 --> 40:41.640
Tekken is online now.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.540
So Hello Namco, is Soul Calibur IV going to be online?

40:45.540 --> 40:48.240
And the answer is yes.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.560
And that quote comes from Namco.

40:50.560 --> 40:56.240
It says, quote, with the current environment, we really couldn't make Soul Calibur IV without

40:56.240 --> 40:57.520
online play.

40:57.520 --> 41:04.720
That's from the director, Katsutoshi Sasaki, who makes Soul Calibur IV.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.860
So that's exciting because I know a lot of folks like to play their online games.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.400
Hopefully there is not some crappy lag.

41:10.400 --> 41:14.720
That would be bad because crappy lag always ruins those online fighting games.

41:14.720 --> 41:18.080
But I actually remember reading some other unrelated story this week that talked about

41:18.080 --> 41:22.720
like a lag-free system for fighting games that have been developed that's supposed to

41:22.720 --> 41:25.800
like eliminate practically all the lag that you see in fighting games.

41:25.800 --> 41:30.060
I don't know how well it works, but maybe Soul Calibur IV will be able to implement

41:30.060 --> 41:31.060
some of this technology.

41:31.060 --> 41:32.060
Who knows?

41:32.060 --> 41:35.400
I think it's a myth, kind of like those cars that run on air or something like that, you

41:35.400 --> 41:41.360
know, the magical cars that, you know, zero emissions and, you know, fuel would be plentiful

41:41.360 --> 41:44.560
and it's all a myth.

41:44.560 --> 41:49.800
What's interesting though, this announcement just came out recently.

41:49.800 --> 41:56.600
Apparently the Bourne conspiracy is going to be coming to Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

41:56.600 --> 42:03.080
Now it is based on the Jason Bourne character from the book series and not necessarily from

42:03.080 --> 42:05.280
the movie series even though the Bourne...

42:05.280 --> 42:06.280
So Matt Damon?

42:06.280 --> 42:07.280
No, Matt Damon.

42:07.280 --> 42:11.320
So, you know, same character, you know, not based on the movie though.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.360
It is due out summer 2008.

42:13.360 --> 42:17.600
It's going to be developed by High Moon Studios, which you might remember they did a game a

42:17.600 --> 42:22.560
couple years back called Darkwatch, a vampire western game.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.480
It looks pretty cool though so far, but still a ways away.

42:26.480 --> 42:30.740
Maybe some more details will be coming out from E3, so.

42:30.740 --> 42:33.480
We're getting some feedback on the last story because, you know, sometimes there's a little

42:33.480 --> 42:36.080
bit of lag here between chat and what we're taping live.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.480
Of course chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.600
Toshan is in chat and says this is not a myth, the whole lag-free fighting thing we're talking

42:42.600 --> 42:43.600
about.

42:43.600 --> 42:48.000
He says, my friend made it, FYI, ggpo.net.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.800
Interesting.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.800
I guess we'll see.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.680
Let's see how well it's implemented.

42:52.680 --> 42:57.160
I haven't seen any videos of it in action yet or gotten to use it myself, but the prospects

42:57.160 --> 42:58.160
of it sound very exciting.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.160
Don't get me wrong.

43:00.160 --> 43:04.720
Moving on to another title that's having another version coming out.

43:04.720 --> 43:10.720
TimeSplitters 4 is coming out on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.840
TimeSplitters kind of seems to, it's not a game you hear about a lot, but a lot of folks

43:14.840 --> 43:16.800
that have played this game seem to really enjoy it.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.440
You're a TimeSplitters fan, aren't you, Loki?

43:18.440 --> 43:23.400
I love TimeSplitters, I cannot wait for this.

43:23.400 --> 43:27.800
TimeSplitters is probably hands down one of the best first person shooter games out there,

43:27.800 --> 43:31.520
especially TimeSplitters 2, which is, it's fun.

43:31.520 --> 43:32.520
That's it.

43:32.520 --> 43:38.000
The whole game focuses on multiplayer deathmatches and create your own levels and weird mini

43:38.000 --> 43:43.400
games and stuff like you can race a cat in the third one.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.280
It's just an awesome game.

43:45.280 --> 43:48.480
By the way, if you're skeptical, this was confirmed in the latest edition of the official

43:48.480 --> 43:53.120
Playstation Magazine in the UK, obviously the US one is not around anymore.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.200
The forum post that originally tipped people off to this also says about the article, there's

43:57.200 --> 44:01.420
no actual news on the features other than Steve Ellis says, quote, they're gearing up

44:01.420 --> 44:04.520
to insert monkeys and guns into all the wrong places.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.520
Awesome.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.560
Yeah, that game had lots of monkeys.

44:08.560 --> 44:12.440
I'll make Loki very happy.

44:12.440 --> 44:16.880
Some other interesting stuff, a lot of people have been, of course, overclocking their PSPs

44:16.880 --> 44:23.040
with the home brew scene, especially with the custom firmwares out there.

44:23.040 --> 44:29.560
Although, one of the things that people found out is with the new version 3.5 firmware,

44:29.560 --> 44:39.640
I believe, they actually can tap the full speed of the system, which is about 50% faster.

44:39.640 --> 44:44.480
The first game that's going to be doing this, though, is God of War Chains of Olympus.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.640
It's going to be running at the full speed on there because obviously the game's going

44:48.640 --> 44:52.800
to be quite graphically intensive.

44:52.800 --> 44:57.600
Interesting to see that they're actually finally kind of say, fuck battery life, we're just

44:57.600 --> 45:03.080
going to use the full speed of the system.

45:03.080 --> 45:07.840
Why is it that folks don't want to use the full speed of the system normally?

45:07.840 --> 45:09.480
I don't understand the way that works.

45:09.480 --> 45:13.040
Originally, it's because it cut down on battery life, so they couldn't advertise

45:13.040 --> 45:15.680
that the battery lasts X amount of time.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.600
Originally, they could run it at the full speed.

45:17.600 --> 45:23.600
In fact, you can overclock yours to run at 333 megahertz instead of 222.

45:23.600 --> 45:28.640
In fact, that's what we do for playing Grand Theft Auto, so it's smoother, less load

45:28.640 --> 45:32.120
time, but I don't know.

45:32.120 --> 45:36.920
It's just their choice, I guess, they don't want to do it.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.880
Well our chat room, of course, we're a little bit behind apparently because they're still

45:39.880 --> 45:45.520
reacting to the last story and they're talking about the racing cats and act-def says, we

45:45.520 --> 45:51.720
don't want monkeys, we want laser cats because remember we talked about laser cats, the game

45:51.720 --> 46:00.360
and how somebody badly needs to make that, and then the chat room says that they actually

46:00.360 --> 46:02.920
want rap cats.

46:02.920 --> 46:08.060
Kill me now.

46:08.060 --> 46:12.140
There was some other interesting music that came out a little bit later on, also this

46:12.140 --> 46:19.120
whole hacking the Fermars and stuff, they found that 3.5 and 3.51 have an official ISO

46:19.120 --> 46:27.680
loader, so Sony is actually going to be enabling you to run games off the memory sticks.

46:27.680 --> 46:31.180
So they're going to either have a way to dump games to the memory stick or you're going

46:31.180 --> 46:34.520
to have a new download service where you're going to be able to download games to run

46:34.520 --> 46:37.880
straight off the memory stick, even though they kind of do that with demos right now,

46:37.880 --> 46:43.640
but it is an official ISO loader which apparently is going to be included in the next home brew

46:43.640 --> 46:45.840
firmware that's going to be made.

46:45.840 --> 46:46.840
The plot thickens.

46:46.840 --> 46:50.600
All right, well anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

46:50.600 --> 46:55.080
Even though Dark Soccer isn't here this week, we're going to sneak behind her back and open

46:55.080 --> 46:57.240
up the emailbag because we can't wait.

46:57.240 --> 47:00.360
We're like kids on Christmas Eve, we can't wait to open up our presents and when you

47:00.360 --> 47:04.840
guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orangehonestradio.com, they are like little

47:04.840 --> 47:05.840
presents.

47:05.840 --> 47:10.000
So let's open up the mailbag.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.080
All right, not a whole lot of emails this week, I think because a lot of folks actually

47:16.080 --> 47:20.720
got to call into the show last week and kind of say their piece, however, we do have some

47:20.720 --> 47:21.720
emails.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
I want to start with this.

47:22.720 --> 47:23.720
This is from Dark Mutts.

47:23.720 --> 47:28.240
Hey guys and gal, I have been listening to you for about six months and I found your

47:28.240 --> 47:32.160
podcast to be the only one that is consistent and always entertaining.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.160
Thank you.

47:33.160 --> 47:38.400
I have to thank Loki because without his clever insight about what makes a game fun, I never

47:38.400 --> 47:41.760
would have found Earth Defense Force 2017.

47:41.760 --> 47:44.040
I have been addicted since I acquired it.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.840
Congrats on five years and keep it coming.

47:45.840 --> 47:49.880
The three of you keep me going through my work day without having to light anyone on

47:49.880 --> 47:50.880
fire.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.840
Thanks again, Dark Mutts.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.840
Very cool.

47:53.840 --> 47:57.400
Isn't that a weird feeling when somebody says like, because video games aren't cheap, so

47:57.400 --> 48:01.840
like somebody says like based on your word, I spent $50 of my hard-earned money for my

48:01.840 --> 48:03.640
day job that drives me insane to buy this game.

48:03.640 --> 48:08.360
At least it's only a $40 game so that doesn't, you know, it knows like still, but still,

48:08.360 --> 48:09.360
I know, I know.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.880
So what makes a game fun for you, Loki?

48:11.880 --> 48:13.480
It's just, it's got to be fun.

48:13.480 --> 48:17.840
I mean, you know, Earth Defense Force is one of those games, I'm still playing it.

48:17.840 --> 48:21.520
It's because, you know, you know what you're getting into when you play it.

48:21.520 --> 48:25.860
It's cheesy and weird, but you can really ramp up the difficulty in it and it gives

48:25.860 --> 48:30.720
you something to kind of achieve for, you know, collecting the different weapons used

48:30.720 --> 48:34.520
in the game and trying to beat each level, you know, on different difficulties.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.240
It's a lot of teamwork involved.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
I don't know.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.840
It's just, it's hard to really pinpoint what makes a game great, but you know, Time

48:40.840 --> 48:47.280
Splitters 2 was another one or even Time Splitters 3 had really a lot of, you know, stuff to

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
do in it.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
You can play the story modes.

48:49.280 --> 48:52.800
They have a bunch of like mini games to try out and the mini games get pretty hard.

48:52.800 --> 48:55.680
Like they have, I remember the original Time Splitters, you have to break windows with

48:55.680 --> 49:00.320
bricks and that sounds easy, but you have a time limit and you have to do that and it

49:00.320 --> 49:01.840
gets pretty hard.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.400
So I don't know.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.220
It's a cool game.

49:05.220 --> 49:06.920
Lots of blah, blah, blahs in chat right now.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
Let me read some of these.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.360
Solid Goomba says, I bought Earth Defense Force after hearing Loki rave about it.

49:11.360 --> 49:12.360
So that's another person.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.480
Boy, that company should be sending you a check.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.480
Hey, D3's awesome.

49:15.480 --> 49:21.480
I've been playing, what is it, Work Time Fun right now and that game is so stupid and

49:21.480 --> 49:23.040
awful but I can't stop playing it.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
I don't know why.

49:24.040 --> 49:27.320
JV Mon says, Loki is the king of OLR and Rob is his puppet.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.320
There you go.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.660
RosteelUT, who I've been quoting a lot tonight, I guess I like the cynics tonight because

49:32.660 --> 49:37.220
RosteelUT is kind of our in-house cynic, says, Loki, very fucking insightful.

49:37.220 --> 49:38.220
What makes a game fun?

49:38.220 --> 49:40.440
Um, the game's fun?

49:40.440 --> 49:41.840
I don't know what makes it fun.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.840
Ew, what a cunty bitch, man.

49:43.840 --> 49:48.760
That's what he says to everyone apparently.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.580
It's basically lots of stuff to do in the game, like a lot of options for you.

49:52.580 --> 49:53.580
It's whatever you enjoy.

49:53.580 --> 49:54.580
It's the game play.

49:54.580 --> 49:56.020
You like blowing shit up.

49:56.020 --> 49:57.280
I like blowing stuff up.

49:57.280 --> 50:02.480
I like writing boobs in places I shouldn't be able to and naming things.

50:02.480 --> 50:06.320
Everybody finds something different to be fun usually, right?

50:06.320 --> 50:07.760
It doesn't matter what I find fun.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.840
It's whatever you find fun.

50:08.840 --> 50:14.240
If you don't want to trust my judgment with buying a game, you can always go rent it.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.720
That's a lot cheaper and I'm sure a lot of the mom and pop shops out there would really

50:17.720 --> 50:18.840
appreciate that from you.

50:18.840 --> 50:24.000
Dark Tetsuya says, tonight's OLR has been brought to you by D3 and by GameTap.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.680
I neglected to say I played GameTap during my gaming week because I just needed to leave

50:27.680 --> 50:30.960
it out for once, all right, because I knew there was going to be that fucking comment

50:30.960 --> 50:33.960
at some point.

50:33.960 --> 50:37.920
I'm not on D3 payroll, that's for sure, but at least they have the balls to bring over

50:37.920 --> 50:43.120
games that might not necessarily work over here, like Earth Defense Force and they have

50:43.120 --> 50:48.260
that one that's coming out at one point, the 360 where you're like some chick in lingerie

50:48.260 --> 50:51.760
with a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.680
That might not necessarily do well over here, but at least they're going to give it a shot.

50:54.680 --> 50:55.960
What the fuck are you talking about?

50:55.960 --> 50:56.960
That sounds awesome.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.160
That's the name of the game.

50:58.160 --> 50:59.160
I don't remember what it's called.

50:59.160 --> 51:02.320
It's got some long Japanese name and I'm not even going to attempt to remember what it

51:02.320 --> 51:05.600
was.

51:05.600 --> 51:10.120
Act Deaf says Pac-Man Championship Edition is fun, yet Loki doesn't see that.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.040
I think Pac-Man Championship Edition is a hell of a lot of fun.

51:13.040 --> 51:17.760
It's way more fast paced than the old one, which I think is awesome, the Ray-Far music

51:17.760 --> 51:18.760
and everything.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.480
I'm just not a fan of Pac-Man that much.

51:20.480 --> 51:26.360
I love the really, really retro classics and updates and that stuff, like the old school

51:26.360 --> 51:27.360
arcade game.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.760
It's just like I'm playing Zelda II now for some reason and I don't know why.

51:29.760 --> 51:30.760
Zelda II?

51:30.760 --> 51:31.760
Yeah.

51:31.760 --> 51:32.760
It's like a great game.

51:32.760 --> 51:33.760
Not really.

51:33.760 --> 51:34.760
Yes, it is.

51:34.760 --> 51:35.760
It's like a great game.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.760
I like it too.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.760
I think it's great.

51:37.760 --> 51:38.760
I think I need to buy that on the Wii.

51:38.760 --> 51:39.760
You totally do.

51:39.760 --> 51:40.760
Anyway, what else was I going to say?

51:40.760 --> 51:45.040
Any other fun factor games that people are overlooking right now?

51:45.040 --> 51:47.440
I think about Katamari Damacy.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.720
What sold that game?

51:48.720 --> 51:51.400
The fun factor and the fact that it was a low price.

51:51.400 --> 51:56.360
The game itself wasn't exactly graphically the most impressive.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.960
You would ask people what draws you to Katamari Damacy and people just go, it's fucking fun

51:59.960 --> 52:00.960
to roll over shit.

52:00.960 --> 52:05.760
Then, of course, you have your cynics who just want everybody to say, that game sucks.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.160
You know they're welcome to that opinion.

52:07.160 --> 52:12.200
I would recommend it and this would be pretty hard to find nowadays, but if you can, find

52:12.200 --> 52:13.200
it.

52:13.200 --> 52:17.280
I don't recommend buying it, but if you can rent it, Driver 3.

52:17.280 --> 52:22.200
I know, I know, it's such a horrible game, but it's really a game that you need to play

52:22.200 --> 52:26.300
because you're just like, oh my God, I can't believe it's really this bad.

52:26.300 --> 52:28.020
It's entertaining in that aspect.

52:28.020 --> 52:32.680
My sister is buying my Playstation 2 and we have that game dumped on the hard drive so

52:32.680 --> 52:37.040
she can play it and I swear to God, she plays this thing more than anything else on that

52:37.040 --> 52:38.040
damn system.

52:38.040 --> 52:42.960
They will sit there for hours recording instant replays and watching the AI get all fucked

52:42.960 --> 52:43.960
up.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.200
Driver 3 is the show girls of gaming.

52:46.200 --> 52:49.920
It's so bad, it's pretty good.

52:49.920 --> 52:54.840
There's a lot of games out there that are really hard to, a lot of people overlook that

52:54.840 --> 52:55.840
are fun.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.200
You just really have to play a lot of the stuff.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.040
Saints Row is another one that I love.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.040
New email.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.680
Oh man, Saints Row, the musical, that was so funny.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.040
Only three emails tonight.

53:06.040 --> 53:11.880
Here's the second one and this is from the doctor and says, alright, this is my first

53:11.880 --> 53:12.880
email to the mailbag.

53:12.880 --> 53:13.880
I'm so nervous.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.840
Okay, first question is for DarkSakura.

53:15.840 --> 53:21.880
How many Pokemon do you own in your game because I own 354 because I have no life whatsoever

53:21.880 --> 53:25.920
now that school is over for me and could we possibly battle sometime?

53:25.920 --> 53:28.840
Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here, she can't answer your question.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.440
Maybe she'll read up your email earlier.

53:30.440 --> 53:35.160
I don't think she's super duper far into the game, so she probably has less than 50, but

53:35.160 --> 53:36.160
that's speculation.

53:36.160 --> 53:37.160
I don't know for sure.

53:37.160 --> 53:41.360
But if you want to battle with DarkSakura, urge her to leave her friend code in our forums

53:41.360 --> 53:45.960
because we actually have a forum post for Pokemon friend codes.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.800
Moving on back to the doctor's email.

53:47.800 --> 53:48.800
Second is for Skye.

53:48.800 --> 53:49.800
I heart you.

53:49.800 --> 53:50.840
Aw, thank you.

53:50.840 --> 53:55.640
And could you say, excuse me DarkSakura, again, please, please, please.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.280
I'll see what I can do.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
Third is for Loki.

53:58.280 --> 54:00.680
Okay, I got nothing, sorry, oh wait.

54:00.680 --> 54:03.900
How good were you at DDR before you stopped?

54:03.900 --> 54:08.740
Because I go to the golf and stuff nearest me and play Supernova when I get some extra

54:08.740 --> 54:11.380
money to spend and how the fuck do you manage crossovers?

54:11.380 --> 54:13.160
They piss me off.

54:13.160 --> 54:20.760
I used to play a lot of doubles actually at one time and I used to do a lot of the Katas

54:20.760 --> 54:25.080
because I could never pass max or anything like that on doubles.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.600
It's just too fast.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.620
You get to the point there, especially when you're running back and forth on some of those

54:30.620 --> 54:35.720
doubles things, if there's any amount of dust on there, you're going to fall on your ass.

54:35.720 --> 54:39.960
Really I'd never try to do that stuff, but I did play some really hard edits.

54:39.960 --> 54:45.640
I used to do edits a lot and really they can be as hard as you want to make them, I guess.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.320
There was, oh my God, and I don't remember the guy.

54:48.320 --> 54:53.880
There's this one Japanese guy that had a website with edits on there and they were the fucking

54:53.880 --> 54:54.880
shit.

54:54.880 --> 54:58.200
I don't remember who the guy is now because I haven't been playing edits for a long time,

54:58.200 --> 54:59.760
but I don't know.

54:59.760 --> 55:06.880
If you look for some DDR edit websites, this guy is just amazing and he had a bunch of

55:06.880 --> 55:11.920
Ask URS sites, so I wish I could be more helpful there, but some great stuff.

55:11.920 --> 55:20.840
They had one for, it was called Swingman, that was on the Jazz and it was an awesome

55:20.840 --> 55:21.840
edit.

55:21.840 --> 55:24.600
It had this real flow to it that was really cool.

55:24.600 --> 55:30.560
One last question from the doctor, when did Squaresoft become Square Enix and why?

55:30.560 --> 55:33.920
Or as we call them here on the show, Squeenix.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.940
When did Square Enix become and why?

55:35.940 --> 55:37.080
It was what, about three years ago?

55:37.080 --> 55:38.160
Two or three years ago.

55:38.160 --> 55:43.000
They bought Enix, which had made a bunch of games, Dragon Quest is probably their most

55:43.000 --> 55:49.200
popular series of games, which you may know as Dragon Warrior, years ago it was called.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.600
What else did they make?

55:50.600 --> 55:56.280
I know on Super Nintendo they were very popular for Brain Lord and Illusion of Gaia and those

55:56.280 --> 55:57.280
games.

55:57.280 --> 56:01.700
Then later on, I also know for music game fans, they were the folks that made Bust A

56:01.700 --> 56:02.700
Move.

56:02.700 --> 56:05.440
Did they do the Tow Ball series or was that Square?

56:05.440 --> 56:06.920
I don't know off the top of my head.

56:06.920 --> 56:08.720
I'm sure someone in the chat knows.

56:08.720 --> 56:09.720
So there you go.

56:09.720 --> 56:14.820
Yeah, that's what happened, that was a few years ago and a lot of people were very afraid

56:14.820 --> 56:17.520
when that merge first happened, but it actually hasn't been too bad.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.800
In fact, a lot of good stuff has come out of that company, it's hard to complain.

56:20.800 --> 56:21.960
So there you go.

56:21.960 --> 56:25.280
And just for you, the doctor, I dug this up for you.

56:25.280 --> 56:30.760
Well excuse me, Dark Sakura.

56:30.760 --> 56:36.880
Now don't tell her I played that or I'm going to fucking get beat up when she comes back.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.200
I don't think she was too happy with that.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.200
Why?

56:40.200 --> 56:42.360
I know, I think it's funny.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.360
It's brilliant.

56:43.360 --> 56:46.720
I think it's because I called her Dark Sakura and she doesn't like that.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.680
Well excuse me.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.360
Then there was another one, remember the Rob D made these, he made another one.

56:53.360 --> 57:00.720
Well excuse me again, Dark Sakura.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.400
I'm so going to get beat up.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.880
Love you Jamie, wherever you are.

57:04.880 --> 57:08.000
Anyhow, one more email.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.440
And this one wasn't signed, so I don't really know who to say who this is from.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.080
I don't even know if I want to read the, it's Ikuma is in the header, so we'll just say

57:17.080 --> 57:18.080
it's from them.

57:18.080 --> 57:19.720
It says, hi there.

57:19.720 --> 57:23.440
I have been listening for one and a half year and just want to take this opportunity to

57:23.440 --> 57:25.040
wish you guys happy fifth.

57:25.040 --> 57:29.560
I am a developer in Japan and yes, Rob had once mentioned our game in the new release

57:29.560 --> 57:30.560
section.

57:30.560 --> 57:33.120
We all just love it when Rob reads in Japanese.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.040
And then there's a cute little face there.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.960
And who says no love from developer?

57:37.960 --> 57:42.040
Hope you guys would be part of my Friday for another five years to come.

57:42.040 --> 57:46.280
So unfortunately this person didn't say who they are, what developer they're talking about

57:46.280 --> 57:47.600
or any of that stuff, just that.

57:47.600 --> 57:51.320
I have horribly butchered the name of one of their games on the program in the past.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.320
That's love though.

57:52.320 --> 57:53.320
That's awesome.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.320
That's awesome.

57:54.320 --> 57:55.320
That's awesome.

57:55.320 --> 57:56.520
Thank you so much for the email.

57:56.520 --> 58:00.640
Tell us who you are because we'd love to have more developers on the show, especially ones

58:00.640 --> 58:03.520
that are crazy enough to listen to this.

58:03.520 --> 58:05.760
We'd also love to be invited to Tokyo Game Show.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.640
That's a very good point.

58:07.640 --> 58:13.040
If you would like some coverage of Tokyo Game Show from us, please email us and let us know.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.040
That's awesome.

58:14.040 --> 58:19.240
Dark Tetsuya asks, was it the developer of Dust Cap Extreme 2 Collector's Edition?

58:19.240 --> 58:23.360
Probably one of your hamster love games or something.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.360
God, I hope so.

58:24.360 --> 58:25.360
God, I hope so.

58:25.360 --> 58:26.360
Oh my God.

58:26.360 --> 58:27.360
Oh my God.

58:27.360 --> 58:30.400
Please tell me you guys develop one of those hamster games.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.120
There's another one of those hamster games coming out over here.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.120
There's a couple of hamster games coming out over here.

58:35.120 --> 58:38.080
I think Hamster Life 2 is coming out over here now.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.560
Those Ubisoft games.

58:39.560 --> 58:40.980
All right.

58:40.980 --> 58:41.980
That was the last email.

58:41.980 --> 58:42.980
I'm going to close up the old mailbag.

58:42.980 --> 58:45.520
That comes with a we because I would totally buy that game.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.800
God, that made me so happy when I read that email.

58:47.800 --> 58:48.800
I was like, oh good.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.880
They're not getting all pissed off that I'm butchering their releases.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
Funny American.

58:53.880 --> 58:56.160
It's stupid, Matt.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
All right.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.160
Back to the gaming news.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.600
If you want to email us, mailbag at orangelauncherdo.com.

59:00.600 --> 59:05.360
If you're from an American, Canadian, Antarctican developer, who cares?

59:05.360 --> 59:09.240
Email us and tell us you're listening because we love to hear that folks in the industry

59:09.240 --> 59:10.240
are listening.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.640
Dude, totally need to meet up at the arcade in Antarctica to play some DDR.

59:13.640 --> 59:15.960
Shut up and get to the next story.

59:15.960 --> 59:23.960
Anyways, Civilization is coming to consoles and handhelds soon being brought over by 2K

59:23.960 --> 59:29.160
Games and developed by Fireaxis Games, Civilization Revolution.

59:29.160 --> 59:35.240
It's going to include 16 civilizations to master and lead to victory and of course famous

59:35.240 --> 59:38.680
historical leaders, yada, yada, yada.

59:38.680 --> 59:43.400
Online multiplayer as well is going to be in it.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.400
Pretty cool.

59:44.400 --> 59:48.520
I'm not a huge Civilization fan, but it sounds interesting.

59:48.520 --> 59:53.160
I'm a fucking huge Civilization fan, at least the old school ones, and I don't know how

59:53.160 --> 59:54.160
to approach this.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.160
I'm a little worried.

59:55.160 --> 59:58.680
Well, okay, first off, this is not the first time we've had Civilization on a console.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.880
The original Civilization was on Super Nintendo and there was a version of Civilization II

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.360
I played on the N-Gage of all things, the E3 a couple years ago, and it made me want

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.680
to cry and stab myself with the blunt N-Gage.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680
These are what?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.520
Spin-off games or are these direct ports?

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.980
I think this is a spin-off series.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.520
When I read it, it sounded like a spin-off series, which can go who knows any which way.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:25.200
God, then that makes me worry, is this going to turn out like the Mortal Kombat anthology

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200
stories or whatever?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.520
Remember the Sub-Zero game?

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.640
I don't think it's anything like that, but I hope not.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.360
It's probably going to be maybe a little bit more scaled down for consoles.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.400
I don't know.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400
It sounds okay.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.920
Well, do you really need to scale down for consoles?

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.740
I just could not see the full game itself on an Xbox 360, and the biggest reason why

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.480
is that there's no mouse and those thumb sticks don't cut it.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.040
Some games were meant to be played with a mouse, and that's all there is to it.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.720
I don't understand why they just don't have keyboard and mouse support, since it has fucking

01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720
USB ports.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:09.620
In fact, all of the next-gen platforms have USB ports that can put a keyboard and mouse

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.620
on there.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.760
Except for maybe the Wii, that'd be kind of stupid because you have the Wii Remote,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.400
but still though, if you really want to and if they really would decide to support it,

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.440
they could put a keyboard and mouse on there.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.600
Another very popular PC gaming series is Guild Wars, and IGN had an interview this week on

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.460
their PC site about Guild Wars 2 and the Eye of the North expansion for Guild Wars.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.160
You played Guild Wars for a little bit, right?

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160
I totally did.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160
And what'd you think?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.520
I actually liked it until it got to level 20, and then it was just like, oh.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.760
Well maybe there's something in the Eye of the North for you, because Eye of the North,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.360
I was kind of reading through the interview here, and if you want to read the full thing,

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.500
head over to PC.IGN.com and you can read the full thing.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.720
What I didn't know, because I didn't know a lot about these games before I was reading

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.600
the interview, and Eye of the North is actually the first Guild Wars expansion that requires

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.080
one of the other expansions to play.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.600
And the reason for that is that all of the content they put into this, they put 18 new

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.200
dungeons and they're all for endgame characters.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.880
So whereas with any of the other expansions, you can buy them by themselves and create

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.120
a character from the ground up.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.920
But for this one, they didn't waste any time making a level one through 20 story.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.480
It's all hardcore endgame content, which I think is kind of interesting about that.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.840
And then I kind of went to talking about how they're actually developing the game, and

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.000
did they actually split into two different development teams?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.200
And yes, there's a development team for Guild Wars 2 right now, but then the Eye of the

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.320
North people will come over when Guild Wars 2 is done.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.320
And they admit that most of the resources are being focused on the Guild Wars expansion,

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.700
but then they're going to all shift over to Guild Wars 2 once the expansion is done.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.720
So this definitely sounds like it's going to be the last Guild Wars expansion.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.120
And they actually say that they do kind of tend to monitor the trends in the PVP, like

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:02.240
meta games that people come up with, and then they kind of like figure out, use those ideas

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.200
for like live events and holiday events.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.440
And then they claim them for themselves, they're like, that was my idea!

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
Wait a minute!

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.440
No, they just sound like they're really tied down to the community, which I think is great.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.920
So there you go, some exciting news for Guild Wars fans.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920
Awesome.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:28.760
Anyways, so we've got some interesting stuff, I guess, making its way out to the US.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:36.120
Not a whole lot though, this week's kind of dead, as most of July usually is.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.480
Pretty much this week though, the only things you've got are Ninja Game Sigma for Playstation

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.020
3, and Vampire Rain on the Xbox 360.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.120
That is about it.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:55.080
PC games, there's a bunch of weird stuff coming out, including, let's see, well actually Marvel

01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:02.920
Trading Card games coming out on PC, Title Legends 2 is coming out on PC, Ride!

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.520
Carnival Tycoon, I swear to God, every fucking week there's a goddamn Tycoon game coming

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.920
out.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:18.160
DS, Platinum Sudoku, and Vegas Casino High Five, making its way out.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.040
So that is it.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.720
Alright, let's head on over to the Japanese release dates and check out what's going on

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.340
in Japan.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.280
Is Chicken Shoot coming out this week?

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.880
Chicken Shoot came out last week too.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.000
Oh my God, did it really?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I guess.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
No, Chicken Shoot's great.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.520
Sorry, because it was on the list over here, but as a US release, so I just wanted to kind

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520
of question that.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.900
It doesn't look like there's actually a whole lot coming out in Japan as well, though there

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:45.160
are a couple games coming out on the Playstation 3, Blazing Angels, Squadrons of World War

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.280
2 for the Playstation 3, Boku no Natsu Yasu-oh God, I just butchered that one.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.680
Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out over in Japan as well, and that was like a bug

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.680
catching game.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.400
Wait, I didn't hear that Rob, can you say that again?

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.960
Boku no Natsu Yasumi 3 is coming out.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.480
See the more I practice, the better I get.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.000
It's a bug catching game.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.640
Why don't we get anything like that over here?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.320
Doesn't that look cute?

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.640
Maybe that's what Africa is going to actually be all about.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.640
Africa?

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.640
Poaching animals?

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640
Yes, you poach animals.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.800
That would be fun.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.520
I'm assuming that because I see the little guy on the cover of the game is holding a

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.200
little bug net and little like, you know, thing that you keep bugs in.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.660
Anyway, let's see if there's anything else coming out on some of the other platforms

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.160
that you might be looking forward to.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.160
What?

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.640
It's really crazy kid with bug net murders family.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.780
PlayStation 2, some stuff really just moving into the best hits like Winning Post 7, Ape

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.720
Escape 3, and Ratchet and Clank 4 is all moving into the best.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.320
Not a lot of new stuff coming out otherwise, but some price reductions there.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.080
Coming out on the Nintendo DS though, you have some stuff coming out.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.280
Chibi-Robo Park Patrol is coming out.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:05.760
Yoku Demo Yoga coming out on the DS, and let's see what else we have here, Kururin Donuts

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.040
Okashi Recipe.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.560
I have no idea what that is, but it's got a happy donut on the cover and it's an action

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.960
game, so it kind of makes it look like it might be a racing game involving donuts.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960
I have no fucking idea.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.200
Happy donut action game.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.680
Yeah, but who wouldn't want to buy a happy donut action game?

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680
I don't know.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.120
I'd buy a happy donut action game.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120
Me too.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.120
Poochie Poochie Virus.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.520
It sounds fascinating and is also coming out on the DS.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.280
It's also another action game with a cast of very chibi looking characters there also

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.760
coming to Japan.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:45.680
Quickly looking to see if there's anything on the PSP this week in Japan.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.840
Just like just some games going into the best hits, including Rengoku 2, The Stairway to

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.280
Heaven moving into the best hits.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.680
Or Hell, depending on how you look at it.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:00.880
All right, going over to the European release dates, Dark Sakura, sadly not here this week,

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:06.080
but on July 6th, those of you over in Europe can look forward to The King of Fighters,

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.340
Maximum Impact 2, and The King of Fighters 11 on the PlayStation 2, as well as the Metal

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.160
Slug Anthology coming out on the PlayStation 2.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160
That's really it.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.800
It's a very slow week for those of you guys in Europe.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.280
All right, that does it for release dates.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:29.920
Well, it may be a little too soon, but the VTech report covering what happened with the

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.760
shootings at Virginia Tech, apparently there's no mention of the video game issue, despite

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:44.000
the fact that everybody was saying, hey, video games made him kill people, dah, dah, dah.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
That's interesting, but apparently the PAC though, they've denounced the report saying

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.160
that it's a cover-up, and they're claiming that really it was video games to blame, and

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.480
it's this giant cover-up.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.480
Oh, shut up.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.760
Seriously.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.760
Shut the hell up, people.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.280
Why do people want to blame video games for everything?

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280
I don't know.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:14.680
It's just people want to focus on whatever their agenda is, and if they really want to

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.440
get rid of video games, or censor them to death, just like they did with rap music and

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.240
stuff before, they're going to make any excuses, oh, it's going to make you infertile if you

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.400
play video games, oh, it's kill my baby, stuff like that.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.880
So pretty soon they'll be just like, oh, if you don't have Jesus in your life, you're

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.520
going to go kill people.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.600
It's crazy shit.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.400
Chat room, chat.orangehonestready.com, live on Sunday nights, Solid Goomba says, didn't

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.720
they search his room and not even find a single console?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.600
I seem to remember that to be the case.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.600
Exactly, just because he participates in a goddamn extracurricular activity, which includes

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.400
playing a computer game, oh my God, that doesn't mean that he's trained on that computer game

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.760
to be a killer, and I'm sorry, but there is no way on the face of the earth to train on

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.500
a PC game to become a killer.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:13.260
I think for some sad whatever reason, people have the need to blame something, and obviously

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:19.560
what happened at Virginia Tech was just absolutely tremendously horrible, and a lot of us had

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.960
that reaction of how could something like this happen?

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.360
How fucked up is this world that some kid would do this to their peers?

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.180
So I think out of that desperation, people look for something to blame, and video games

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:38.320
unfortunately are an easy target because they allow you to pretend that you are someone

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.380
else, and unfortunately not everybody can see that line.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.720
I don't even know why this was an issue when they didn't even have any sort of evidence

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.160
in the beginning that video games were even involved in any way, but immediately they're

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:54.480
saying, oh, it must be this, it's Doom, it's Marilyn Manson, it's MTV, it's all this that

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.800
did this.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.080
Take responsibility, people.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:05.000
It was a crazy, crazy, crazy person that probably, I don't know, I don't even want to speculate

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.200
because I'll say something that will be foot and mouth syndrome, but it was a very unfortunate

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.960
thing, period.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.640
I blame World War II.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.640
That's what I blame.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.920
It's all those World War II documentaries out there that show the kamikazes.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920
That's what I blame.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.840
I blame the Atari 2600, don't you?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840
I do.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.120
I mean, they had the man bomber after all in there.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.600
Well, the Atari 2600 is getting the flashback portable, at least it's a little prototype

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.120
that's been made.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.720
Kurt Vendell, who actually made the original Atari flashback, is now trying to make an

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.840
Atari flashback portable, and the thing's tiny.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.240
I mean, it's almost the size of the old Atari cartridge.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.160
So if you've ever wanted to play your favorite 2600 games on the go, that could actually

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.120
be on the way.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.960
The unit is supposed to run off three AAA batteries with a 15-hour run time, I mean,

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.000
it is an Atari 2600 after all, and there's going to be a USB port on it, so that way

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.880
you can actually load games from the USB.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.200
So I don't know if it's going to actually support ROMs or if you're going to buy games

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.160
a la iTunes or what the deal is, because it's really easy to get free Atari games online

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160
at this point.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.320
I swear to God, the entire collection of Atari games, everything ever made, is six megs.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.700
So you could easily fit that on a USB card.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.700
Very tiny.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.440
But what I would like to see that used for is maybe some homebrew, because even the Atari

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.120
2600 still has some homebrew love, a lot of homebrew love for it, so you never know what

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120
might happen.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.640
I don't know if I would necessarily buy this, though, but I don't know, maybe.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.220
Depends, if it was like 20 bucks or something, it would be worth it.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.720
Games were so simple back then, and sometimes that's kind of like, you know, like I was

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.680
saying last week, I found myself playing Pitfall for God knows what reason for quite a chunk

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.540
of time last Saturday.

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:59.920
Can you imagine, if you will, if they were to bring combat to Xbox Live Arcade and have

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.240
like leaderboards for that shit?

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240
That'd be fucking awesome.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.640
Aren't they going to bring some old Atari classics?

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.840
I seem to remember Warlords was coming to Xbox Live.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.840
That's an old school Atari game.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.320
And of course, we have Centipede and Millipede.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.320
I want combat with no graphical upgrades whatsoever.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.840
I just want the whole thing to be done like that and have like leaderboards.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.160
What if they did the classic graphics slash upgrade graphics?

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.680
I guess, if they really want to do that, but I'd be fine with just the classic graphics,

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.520
because I think that'd be funny, and just have like a leaderboard thing where you know,

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.520
win matches and stuff.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.560
I did not realize you were such an Atari 2600 fan.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.400
Oh, I used to play the Atari 2600 all the time.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400
I'm a huge combat fan.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.960
Oh, keep that in mind for later on.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.480
We're going to see what happens later on.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.160
So, I'm going to tease something coming up in Part B. That's all I have to say.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Alright, moving on.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:53.880
Anyways, apparently the ESRB is cracking down on violent game trailers now.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.840
Nothing really new, but of course, especially after the whole fiasco with Manhunt 2, they're

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.800
kind of, I guess, taking notice on some of the trailers that have been released out there,

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:10.400
including Gears of War, which was available online since January, is now, of course, coming

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:21.760
down and apparently Darkness and Dark Sector videos have been immediately, I guess, pulled

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.520
because I guess they were too bloody or whatever and I guess were an adult only thing.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:32.640
They should have such things as a red band trailer for games, I think, but I don't know.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.440
I think it's kind of stupid though since before they were rating them with, oh, because they're

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.560
interactive and stuff, we've got to rate them a little harsher, which is dumb anyways, but

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.200
you're watching a video game play.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.560
You don't have any sort of interaction with it.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.400
I think game trailers are still pretty safe.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.400
I don't understand why.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.960
I didn't even know they rated trailers.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.480
I know that a lot of times they'll say, you know, this product is not yet rated or something

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.480
like that.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.720
The trailers themselves, yeah, red band trailers, very rare and hard to find.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.480
You don't see them a lot in theaters ever, but you see them on home movies sometimes,

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.120
especially from the indie companies.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.120
You sometimes see a red band trailer where the preview is for restricted audiences only

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:17.800
and that's because they'll have a gunshot in it or a real quick bloodshot or maybe some

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800
booby.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.160
It might be an ad for a sexy movie and you see a lady wearing a dress that's see-through

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160
or something.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.320
You see red band trailers once in a while.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.400
I think it's kind of ridiculous though that they're policing game trailers because that's

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.960
not even, you know, it's not the actual game.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.880
It's like kind of a video of it or it's maybe like, you know, I know that they do that with

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:43.360
movie trailers, you know, that they rate that this trailer isn't good for all audiences

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.240
and stuff, but I think it's kind of ridiculous to do that with games.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.800
I could've sworn I heard some point that yellow bands were coming for the PG-13 and up audiences

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800
only.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800
I can't remember.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.600
Maybe it was PG-13 audiences only.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.420
We're going to have yellow band trailers, but I don't know if that ever, I might just

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:04.040
be pulling that out of my butt, but I seem to remember reading that somewhere, I don't

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040
know.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.400
Well, obviously this next topic is rated G. This is definitely for everybody.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.920
This cat, wait, hold on, DarkDockra is not here this week, but so we can't do a website

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.480
of the week, but if she could, and she was here this week, I'm pretty sure this would

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.200
have been a top contender for her website of the week.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.360
Okay, yes, Loki, you can do your outburst now.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.160
Sorry, this cat right here made me get a cat.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160
Really?

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160
Why is that?

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.080
Because it's super cute and I want a gaming cat.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.200
All right, well, yes, this is the Famiko blog and you can visit this blog if you'd like

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200
to it.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:45.840
I love fami.blog90.fc2.com and this is just a cat that poses with it, they make poses

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.200
of it playing the DS and the 360.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.200
Did you ever see the other?

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.200
It's so cute.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.840
Yeah, see, I mean, look at that one up, one more, one more up.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840
It was that one.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.840
Is that one going down?

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.080
Yeah, keep going.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.400
The one that's playing the DS.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.000
The cat is very cute.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.720
It's basically, it's like a oolong, but a kitty.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:09.680
This site reminds me a lot of oolong, which was the bunny with pancakes on its head.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.720
Have you ever seen the macro that says, this thread has gotten boring, so here's a bunny

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.160
with pancakes on its head.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.840
That was oolong, the famous bunny that would, this blog reminds me of that, except it's

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.120
a cat and the cat sometimes plays video games, but not always.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120
This is so cute.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Go up, go up, go up.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120
Keep going.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.120
That's the picture right there.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.000
That is a very cute cat.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.320
And I believe the cat's name is Famicom, right?

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.320
It's Fami.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.700
Or Fami, named after the Famicom.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.700
Very cute.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.700
Named after famine.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:44.360
Are you wanting to, you're so messed up.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.800
Are you wanting to get a kitty someday, Rice Princess?

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800
No.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.800
Oh, okay.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.320
I just wanted you to contribute something to this show.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.280
I am going to attempt to get the cat that we're getting to sit there and oppose that

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.200
look like it's playing the DS.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.600
I don't think it's going to work, but we're going to try it.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.120
You know what you need to do is get the cat to pose reading porn.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120
That would be funny.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.120
Get a picture of that.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.080
I don't have any porn, at least not in magazine form.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080
How can you not have porn?

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080
I'll get my laptop.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.680
I will buy you a freaking Playboy or something and you can pose the cat with porn.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.920
Porn and like have it drinking alcohol and...

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:24.880
Yes, you should be Stella the porno cat.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.040
You should get a little pimp hat.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.640
Oh boy, I think our phone line is already ringing with calls from PETA.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.840
So we better take a break and we're going to take a quick break here and we'll be back

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.160
