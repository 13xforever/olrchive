0	21220	Tonight, July 15th, 2007, an E3 wrap-up, Microsoft gets Disney movies, Nintendo wants you to
21220	32560	get fit, and Sony gives the PSP a makeover.
32560	36640	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36640	41680	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41680	42680	lifestyle.
42680	43680	My name is Rob Roberts.
43680	44680	You might know me as Sky.
44680	47160	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47160	48160	Yo.
48160	49160	How you doing, Jamie?
49160	50160	Uh.
50160	51160	Yeah.
51160	52160	A little, uh.
52160	53160	Conventioning to this morning.
53160	54160	Ah.
54160	57000	We'll talk a little more about that in just a moment, but let me introduce as well, Techmaster
57000	58000	Loki.
58000	59000	Hello.
59000	60000	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
60000	61000	I'm doing fine.
61000	62000	Swell.
62000	63000	Are you all conventioned out as well?
63000	64000	No.
64000	65960	Oh, that's too bad or good?
65960	66960	I don't know if that's good news.
66960	68320	I didn't really go through the convention at all.
68320	69320	All right.
69320	70920	We'll talk about the convention in just a little bit.
70920	73600	We have, unfortunately, no real special guests in the studio tonight.
73600	76740	I mean, Xfer's over there playing WoW, but that means he's probably too busy to actually
76740	78400	comment on tonight's programs.
78400	82400	Some other folks might come in and out, as sometimes happens around here, because we
82400	86520	have an open studio, and we never know who's going to show up here at Orange Lounge Radio,
86520	90280	but we do always have the chat room, and you never know who's going to show up in our chat
90280	91280	room.
91280	96200	If you head on over to orangeloungeradio.com and click on Chat, you can join us and randomly
96200	99140	comment on the show as it's going on.
99140	101020	We have some new folks in chat tonight.
101020	102020	We Too is in chat.
102020	103660	I don't know if I said that name wrong.
103660	105880	It says, geez, Rob sounds different from the podcast.
105880	106880	I don't know.
106880	110320	Well, it could be the fact that it's a different bit rate when we stream live than it is on
110320	111320	the podcast.
111320	112880	I think it's a little cleaner.
112880	116040	Our live stream actually uses MP3 Pro encoding.
116040	119800	Actually, the podcast, our audio archive, uses MP3 Pro as well.
119800	124200	Unfortunately, the iPods don't recognize MP3 Pro, which is how most people listen to us.
124200	127800	If you listen to the shows on WinApp, it actually sounds a little cleaner if you have the MP3
127800	128800	Pro plug-in installed.
128800	131800	Just a little tip for those of you guys that listen live at home.
131800	135800	Anyhow, let's start off tonight's program talking about how is your gaming week.
135800	141000	Unfortunately, none of us were able to go to E3 this year, so we didn't get to do that,
141000	145040	but we'll be talking a lot about that and giving our opinions on things as outsiders
145040	150560	looking in, as well as really relying on your comments as well to let us know what you thought
150560	152040	of this year's E3.
152040	154600	What kind of games did you play this week since you weren't in E3?
154600	155600	Dark Sakura.
155600	159480	Well, I tried to play some Para Para Paradise.
159480	162720	Got as far as getting everything set up and then left the room, which we'll be getting
162720	166080	into that later.
166080	171160	And then I played a little bit of pinball, played some Burning Crusade, well actually
171160	175480	I got as far as setting it up and then realizing I had to patch and then saying screw this
175480	178440	noise and not playing.
178440	187800	And I finally got my first badge in Pokemans, so yeah, while I was on the recumbent bike
187800	189220	at the gym.
189220	193520	The recumbent bike for people who are not gym savvy or vocabulary savvy means you sit
193520	197840	back on your ass and pedal in front of you.
197840	199400	What was that bike, Loki?
199400	205200	You would know this better in that one episode of South Park, Mr. Garrison invented the bike.
205200	207560	It was the It, I think.
207560	208560	The It?
208560	215560	Yeah, remember because it was a parody of the Segway, which remember before that it
215560	217060	was called It.
217060	221040	I don't remember what it was called exactly.
221040	224300	Have you ever seen, they have like a Capri Sun commercial or something like that where
224300	227240	people are riding bikes that look exactly like that, so they do exist.
227240	230560	Okay, I know Dark Soccer doesn't watch a lot of TV, so you have no idea what I'm talking
230560	231560	about.
231560	232560	I don't watch TV at all.
232560	234000	Well, that's not true because you watch Doctor Who.
234000	238380	I downloaded it off the internet, but that's technically not watching TV, but I don't see
238380	240880	commercials or I'm not exposed to idiocy.
240880	243440	Alright, anyway, bear with me here for a minute.
243440	248600	There's this thing and Mr. Garrison invented it and you sit on this thing to make it run
248600	253720	and then you blow into a tube and when you talk about the recumbent bike, it makes it
253720	254720	sound like one of those.
254720	258320	But you're leaning forward and you lean back on a recumbent bike.
258320	260560	Alright, never mind.
260560	264280	The chat room agrees it's the It, so at least somebody will know what I'm talking about.
264280	265280	Thank God.
265280	266280	Anyway, sorry Dark Soccer.
266280	268280	Okay, I want a Segway.
268280	270680	Rob, get me one.
270680	271680	No.
271680	272680	Please.
272680	273680	No money.
273680	274680	Oh, okay.
274680	276880	Getting you presents requires money that I don't have.
276880	278600	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
278600	282680	I meant to play all the E3 demos that were available on Xbox Live.
282680	283760	I just never got around to it.
283760	290160	I got around to downloading them, just not playing them, so that wasn't really helpful.
290160	293360	I did, well, let's see what I played this week.
293360	297960	I played more Saints Row multiplayer because we were still testing out the LAN stuff and
297960	303280	it works great now that I actually updated all the systems to have the multiplayer patch
303280	304280	on it.
304280	308560	So now it works awesome and it's pretty fun actually.
308560	314160	The other thing we tried was, the other thing I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because
314160	317680	yes we're still not done with the game and it's getting pretty hard now because now we
317680	320840	have to play on Inferno.
320840	326960	So we finished a few things on that and then I'm playing more Final Fantasy on the PSP,
326960	330100	or Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories on PSP.
330100	332600	I do have stuff to play this week.
332600	342200	I just got a preview copy of Shimagami Tensei Persona 3, so I'm going to be playing that.
342200	343720	That'll be fun.
343720	344720	And then...
344720	347400	A lot of folks liked the last game that came out in that series, so...
347400	351120	Yeah, so it should be pretty good.
351120	352600	That's pretty much it for right now.
352600	357000	I'm looking, hopefully this week, Paper Mario is going to be making its way out on our virtual
357000	362040	console because it's everywhere else, but you know, I want to play that now.
362040	365560	Because Super Paper Mario is pretty fun and I hear it's not really much different than
365560	367800	the original Paper Mario.
367800	371000	Do you have information to back that up that is definitely coming out here Monday or are
371000	372000	you just guessing?
372000	373000	I'm just guessing.
373000	374000	I'm just guessing.
374000	375000	Alright.
375000	376000	Fair enough.
376000	379480	Okay, well my gaming week, I also tried to download a bunch of those demos that came
379480	380480	out.
380480	385640	The first one I found playing was Blue Dragon, which, you know, I don't like having to read
385640	389480	walls of text to explain to me how to play the game.
389480	393480	I'm a bigger fan of those tutorials that kind of walks you through.
393480	396320	Maybe that's just my learning styles, I like to be kind of hands-on.
396320	400080	But I found in Blue Dragon, before you enter the room to start fighting monsters, you really
400080	404080	have to just read these wall of words that talk about the game and how the battle system
404080	405080	works.
405080	406080	And that doesn't really do it for me.
406080	410200	I like it when you fight a fight and then somebody comes in helping explain it to you
410200	411200	as you're fighting.
411200	412200	I don't know.
412200	413200	Maybe I'm just...
413200	414280	It might be just because it's the demo.
414280	415280	I'm hoping.
415280	416280	I'm really hoping.
416280	420080	And I would never want to base my judgment of an entire game off a demo, but it was very
420080	422320	hard for me to get into for that reason.
422320	424960	I felt like I wasn't really understanding everything that was going on.
424960	428820	But it does seem to have a pretty cool combat system.
428820	434040	It's somewhat a real-time system, but you can have your attacks stronger if you wait
434040	435040	longer.
435040	436040	It's interesting.
436040	438200	So I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.
438200	442280	I'm such a fan of the Japanese RPGs, and especially, I'm interested in the products that Mistwalker
442280	443280	is putting out.
443280	446720	I'm at least going to rent the darn game if I don't buy it.
446720	448720	That and Eternal Sonata and the other stuff that's coming out.
448720	450720	I hear it's three to sixteen.
450720	451720	Blue Dragon?
451720	452720	Really?
452720	453720	Yeah.
453720	454720	I thought it was only two.
454720	455720	I thought it was three.
455720	456720	Oh, well.
456720	457720	So there's that.
457720	462840	And as well, I downloaded Sonic on Arcade, which was a little silly because I have Sonic
462840	464080	on the Wii as well.
464080	467520	But I just kind of wanted to try it out to sort of see, okay, what's the differences
467520	470560	between the emulating on the Wii and the emulating on the Xbox 360?
470560	475840	And I'll tell you, the Xbox 360 one is actually a little bit better because it's not just
475840	476840	a straight-up port.
476840	480720	I mean, playing the Wii one does feel like you've whipped out your Genesis and hooked
480720	484080	it up and you're playing the real deal, but the Xbox 360 one, you can kind of not only
484080	488800	have that, just a straight-up emulation, but you can do the screen resizing.
488800	493160	You can do the smoothing graphics, which although it's an option, I don't think it looks that
493160	494160	good.
494160	495160	You have the online leaderboards.
495160	498760	There's a lot of little extra things that are kind of cool.
498760	504420	And to my mind, it's a better value for five bucks on the Xbox 360 than the eight bucks
504420	507220	it is on the Wii because of the fact that it was a Genesis title.
507220	512240	So I have to say, if you didn't buy Sonic on the Wii and you're a fan of the series,
512240	514680	you should definitely check out Sonic on the 360.
514680	519040	Golden Axe I checked out as well, but the problem is that Golden Axe is one of those
519040	522560	things that was much cooler when we were kids.
522560	523960	For me anyway.
523960	527960	The original Golden Axe was much cooler when we were kids, and yes, I know it's got a great
527960	532360	ending and everything, and the game was so much fun to play, co-op, but I just don't
532360	536280	see the magic there in this day and age playing it on the Xbox 360.
536280	540140	The game's very repetitive to me, and I think it's just one of those things that was much
540140	544280	cooler, watching the magic and everything when I was younger.
544280	545280	Other than that, I...
545280	546280	Yeah, go ahead.
546280	548240	I was going to say, you know what I'm really disappointed they haven't brought to the live
548240	552140	arcade yet is the Gauntlet Legends series.
552140	553560	That would have been cool.
553560	558840	I tried Gauntlet, not a big fan of the original Gauntlet, but Gauntlet Legends, I used to
558840	560200	go play that at the arcade all the time.
560200	561320	Gauntlet Legends is pretty rad.
561320	564840	I had the port on the N64 they made of that, and I had a lot of fun with that, because
564840	567700	that was a good party game as well.
567700	571560	Going to the chat room and looking at comments there, Pekor Uno says, Sonic is actually a
571560	573280	lot harder than I remembered it to be.
573280	575680	Yeah, I'm kind of finding the same thing.
575680	580880	I don't know, I'm finding this game is a lot harder than I remember it, but I used to be
580880	585160	better at video games when I was a kid than I am now in my old age.
585160	586960	Looking to see what other comments there are.
586960	587960	Yeah, Darkseidra?
587960	591540	Sorry, I was talking about Gauntlet 64 really makes me want to play the old Gauntlet now.
591540	592540	The old school one?
592540	593540	Oh, hell yeah!
593540	596200	See, that's another one of those games that I have better memories of as a kid.
596200	597200	I don't know why.
597200	601480	Like, you know, of course we all remember that Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and all
601480	603240	this will say, don't shoot food.
603240	610120	I just have this urge now to go back and play Gauntlet and Mile in Secret Castle, and, oh,
610120	613000	shit, Marble Madness.
613000	614000	I'll give you this.
614000	618560	I think going back and playing a game like Gauntlet is much more fun with four people.
618560	620080	Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
620080	623760	When you have everybody there playing all the old school stuff, that's fun.
623760	627120	I don't have a lot of friends, so I don't get to play the old school.
627120	629280	You know we didn't play Super Metroid on Thursday?
629280	630280	We didn't.
630280	631280	We didn't.
631280	633320	So you have to play Super Metroid with me this week.
633320	634320	Absolutely.
634320	637440	You know, it's funny you mention that, because I did play, I had jury duty this week.
637440	638440	Suck.
638440	639440	Poor Rob.
639440	641840	Yeah, they called me back 13 months after I was there before.
641840	645600	Long time listeners of OLR may remember, I was on like a two week case last year.
645600	649080	But I went back this year, and thank God I didn't get called, but I had to sit around
649080	651620	all day long waiting to see if they'd call me.
651620	656340	I played Metroid Zero Mission, like all day, which, you know, is the next best thing to
656340	660280	Super Metroid on the Game Boy Advance, or in my case, the DS.
660280	664600	But all I could play was the one Advance game I had in the slot, because I lost the stylus
664600	668000	to my DS Fat, which my DS Lite was uncharged.
668000	669720	Fuck that, use your finger.
669720	671720	That's what I'd be doing.
671720	672720	Screw it.
672720	673720	Finger works just as well.
673720	674720	Metroid Zero Mission is pretty awesome.
674720	675720	I didn't want to play puzzle.
675720	679840	I know originally you're thinking, hey, oh crap, it's going to get the screen all messed
679840	680840	up and stuff.
680840	681840	Now fuck it, who cares.
681840	683640	You can just rub it on your shirt, it's all good.
683640	686680	SSJ100Matt says, wow, back to jury duty.
686680	688440	Yeah, unfortunately, Pauly Shore wasn't there, though.
688440	689440	Or you know what?
689440	692480	Those pencils that they make, you fill out the forms or pens or whatever the fuck that
692480	694360	they have, use one of those.
694360	699000	Just fucking turn that shit around or, I don't know, pen cap or something.
699000	700000	Get creative.
700000	704600	All right, so that's pretty much all the games I really played this week, so some new stuff
704600	709880	thanks to the marketplace and some old stuff thanks to my lack of a stylus for the DS.
709880	714720	I played one more game this week, and it's kind of, we'll get into later on with some
714720	718760	other discussion, but I played Motorstorm again, and apparently there's a code out there
718760	722800	now that unlocks everything, so I did that thinking, hey, you know, it's been a while
722800	723800	since I played this.
723800	728520	I was frustrated with how hard the game was, you know, certain races, your bike or whatever,
728520	731560	the physics were really bugging me.
731560	733000	I don't like Motorstorm anymore.
733000	737800	I think it's actually really boring, and you know, before it was pretty good, but now it's
737800	738800	just kind of dumb.
738800	741720	I seem to recall this is the second week in a row you've changed your mind on a game.
741720	743480	Have you gotten finicky in your older age?
743480	749720	I don't know, but you know, I know later on, well, last week we talked about the 88 system
749720	754040	or whatever that they were releasing for the PlayStation 3 with Motorstorm bundled in.
754040	756240	You know, I would rather it be Resistance, I think.
756240	759440	You know, just Motorstorm, it's a cool game.
759440	763560	Like when the demo was out and stuff, everyone was like, oh, I got to get the game, but then
763560	767400	you play it, and it's just the layout's not very good, and the races are kind of, eh,
767400	768400	I don't know.
768400	769400	All right.
769400	773200	Well, like Loki said, we'll get to plenty of Sony talk a little later in the show, actually
773200	777400	probably in part B tonight, because we are going to tackle the avalanche of news that
777400	778600	came out of E3.
778600	783440	Now, we know you guys probably already read a ton about E3.
783440	787200	You know, you guys that subscribe to the show are obviously video gaming fans, so you might
787200	789920	know a lot already about what we're going to talk about tonight.
789920	794080	We hope we picked up some stuff that maybe didn't blip on your radar, but tonight is
794080	798200	really about kind of the feedback from the outside looking in, because think about it.
798200	802640	Everything you've read on the internet to date is people that were there, people that
802640	809360	were, you know, getting to, you know, the breakfasts provided by the staff and the shuttles
809360	811320	going from hotel to hotel and everything.
811320	814320	You know, we're kind of trying to look at, okay, so how does everybody else feel that
814320	817960	wasn't there at E3, because, you know, we're the ones that are really going to be buying
817960	819440	all this stuff that they were selling.
819440	824880	You know, this is going to be kind of weird, you know, but overall in general, the layout
824880	829200	and the way that they did E3 this year, I actually like it more than I did the original
829200	830760	E3.
830760	834520	And the reason being is because it's a lot easier to digest.
834520	837560	Instead of having to, you know, make your way through all the booths, set up all these
837560	841320	appointments, you know, to meet with these publishers or whatever and see their games
841320	842320	and stuff.
842320	844680	Now it's just, okay, go to press conference to press conference.
844680	848600	It's just like a gamer's day and it makes it a lot easier, I think, and then you get
848600	849800	your hands on time afterwards.
849800	851320	I like that.
851320	854500	Can I share a rumor I heard with you from Bobby's show this week?
854500	858480	Because Bobby apparently talked to someone and he won't say who it is, which of course
858480	860800	when you hear this you'll completely understand why.
860800	865080	But Bobby Blackwolf, our old buddy over at AllGames.com, gets complete credit for this
865080	866640	story because I'm stealing it from him.
866640	870060	So listen to his show, Bobby Blackwolf's show and all that stuff.
870060	874180	So here's what he said on his show this week is that apparently he was talking to somebody
874180	878760	and the reason why they had to keep E3 in LA this year was because of contracts.
878760	882480	They had already signed a contract with the city to have this convention and it's all
882480	887960	basically based on the number of hotel nights they guarantee that the city's going to get
887960	888960	from it.
888960	895420	It's kind of about the kickback or the revenue, thank you, for the city that they're going
895420	896420	to get from this.
896420	901600	Well, the thing is this is why they're going to have E4ALL is because they moved E3 to
901600	905480	Santa Monica, which is still in LA County, and made it a smaller event.
905480	910280	But E4ALL was supposed to pick up consumers now and bring in revenue from that.
910280	913280	So they were still going to meet their numbers that they originally signed off to.
913280	920200	But according to Bobby in a show this week, E4ALL I should say is not living up to expectations
920200	924320	as far as the pre-sales are concerned and not a lot of companies are really interested
924320	925640	in going at this point.
925640	929360	Nintendo's really the only one that's on board, Microsoft don't give a shit.
929360	935120	So there is a strong chance that they may opt to take the fine and just cancel E4ALL.
935120	940040	There's a very strong chance that E4ALL is just going to get axed in favor of just paying
940040	942220	a fine and saying cut our losses.
942220	948080	But that would mean E3, if it continues next year, which may not happen, the ESA may just
948080	950240	back out of the show biz altogether.
950240	955840	If the ESA backs out of this, then either the ESA is going to back out or E3 is going
955840	956840	to move to another city.
956840	959520	And, of course, we've heard rumors that they get the possibility...
959520	960520	San Francisco!
960520	961520	San Francisco!
961520	962520	I would be expensive!
962520	963520	San Francisco!
963520	964520	San Francisco is freaking expensive!
964520	965520	I don't care!
965520	966520	Sacramento!
966520	967520	Damn cheap!
967520	968520	Where they had an LA.
968520	969520	Yeah, that's true.
969520	971800	San Francisco is probably just as expensive as LA and worse traffic.
971800	972800	Sacramento!
972800	973800	It's dirt cheap!
973800	974800	Good luck!
974800	975800	Come on!
975800	978680	You can come out here and burn to death.
978680	979680	Good luck.
979680	981080	I know, it's like 106 degrees this whole week.
981080	983920	This is really a minor summer in comparison.
983920	984920	But Sacramento!
984920	985920	Then I can go!
985920	986920	San Jose!
986920	987920	That's a good idea!
987920	988920	That's a good idea!
988920	989920	San Jose!
989920	990920	I'd go to Vegas!
990920	991920	Come on!
991920	992920	You guys afraid of planes?
992920	993920	San Jose or Santa Clara would be pretty good too.
993920	994920	Middle Silicon Valley?
994920	995920	Yeah.
995920	996920	No, we'll see.
996920	999400	Anyway, I hope E4ALL didn't get canceled.
999400	1002520	I was kind of looking forward to going, but then again, if there's not going to be much
1002520	1004280	support, maybe I shouldn't be so excited.
1004280	1005280	I don't know.
1005280	1010560	It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few days and what the fallout is.
1010560	1012880	Floridien says, what about PAX?
1012880	1014680	Pinning Arcade Expo, of course.
1014680	1019100	A lot of folks see PAX as one of those expos that's stepping up to fill in the void left
1019100	1020880	by the old E3.
1020880	1023580	Banda in chat,.orangelandtrader.com says, fuck E3!
1023580	1024840	I can't wait for X07-08!
1024840	1030240	All right, anyway, I just wanted to share that little tidbit rumor thing with you guys.
1030240	1031240	Other housekeeping tonight?
1031240	1032240	Oh, yes.
1032240	1037320	One thing is that I think that I'm going to adopt DarkTetsu's nickname for Kazurai and
1037320	1038960	call him Captain Crayola.
1038960	1039960	Captain Crayola?
1039960	1040960	Yes.
1040960	1041960	All right.
1041960	1046240	Anyway, let's get into some housekeeping for today.
1046240	1050560	First thing I want to say is a big thank you to the folks at SacAnime for having us at
1050560	1052640	their show at the last minute.
1052640	1054340	We did tape a special show there.
1054340	1057560	It's not going to go into our regular RSS feed, though.
1057560	1062640	We recorded about a 45-minute thing Saturday morning, pretty early, and we're going to
1062640	1066840	be putting that on our live journal and MySpace and I guess Facebook communities.
1066840	1071000	Basically any Orange Lawns Radio community will post the link to the MP3, but because
1071000	1076120	of the fact that we also talk about E3 and that, and even though it's a little more,
1076120	1078600	I don't know how to phrase it, it's going to be a little more lax than even what you're
1078600	1082400	going to hear tonight, because of kind of the duplicate news there, we're not going
1082400	1087080	to post the same show to the feed, so it's out there, but it was kind of our initial
1087080	1090200	reactions to a lot of the E3 news, and there were some funny jokes that came out of it,
1090200	1094240	so if you're a fan of OLR, definitely check out the bonus show this week.
1094240	1097280	And I think that's about all I wanted to say for housekeeping, so let's kick it off.
1097280	1098400	Let's start.
1098400	1102160	First press conference at E3 this week was Microsoft, so let's start with some Microsoft
1102160	1103160	news.
1103160	1107880	So Microsoft, they had a lot of bombs to drop, of course, and this is a huge surprise because
1107880	1114440	they did this with Halo 2, but they announced that a special 360 console, Halo themed, will
1114440	1117920	be hitting the market in September.
1117920	1119400	No word on the price yet.
1119400	1123960	Some interesting things about it though is it will be, of course, the camo green.
1123960	1128720	It's going to have a controller and a plain charge kit, also that camo green, I guess
1128720	1131520	they call it Spartan green.
1131520	1135080	It's going to have a 20 gig hard drive, just like a premium system, but it's going to have
1135080	1141120	HDMI just like an Elite, so the question is, how much is it going to cost?
1141120	1145160	And the answer for Microsoft, we're not telling you yet, but soon.
1145160	1150880	But the answer is $30 more than what it should cost because of the Halo propaganda that will
1150880	1152600	be splattered all over this thing, right?
1152600	1153600	Am I right?
1153600	1154600	I guess.
1154600	1158440	But I mean, this only joins, you know, what, their two custom controllers that they have
1158440	1167200	right now with Todd McFarlane art and collectible figurines, you know, a wireless headset, and
1167200	1171400	also their points cards, I believe, their three month cards are now Halo themed.
1171400	1174360	It's just, it's overload is what it is.
1174360	1175360	But hey!
1175360	1176360	People will buy it.
1176360	1181280	Halo 3 Saturation, GS191 in chat says, that's one ugly Xbox 360.
1181280	1183200	I agree, it was ugly.
1183200	1187000	Okay, I don't think it was that ugly, it's not that bad, but here's the thing though.
1187000	1191840	If you're really looking to buy an Elite or something because of the HDMI, but you don't
1191840	1196540	really want to spend the $479, this might be a cheaper alternative for you.
1196540	1198800	But is HDMI that big a difference?
1198800	1199800	Didn't we talk before?
1199800	1200800	It's really not.
1200800	1203160	It's not that big a difference, but there are some people out there that have video
1203160	1206360	files that really want the HDMI stuff, so.
1206360	1207360	Oh my God!
1207360	1212960	If you're going to pay that much money just to have that itty bitty, itty bitty bitty
1212960	1218920	difference between, you know, the normal composite out and the HDMI, I mean seriously, question
1218920	1220320	your priorities.
1220320	1224840	Donate the money to OLR, we'll make good use out of the money.
1224840	1227680	Maybe it can send us to Vegas for next year's E3, I don't know.
1227680	1230440	Well here's the thing, I would just wait and see because later on they're going to be dropping
1230440	1235680	the price of the 360 anyways, and you know, I want to bet that maybe they're going to
1235680	1241240	add HDMI to all of the Xbox 360s at some point, because I believe the Elite is only a limited
1241240	1243120	time thing anyways.
1243120	1249040	Alright, well for the record, I actually have a Halo 2 Xbox 360, or a Halo, or I'm sorry,
1249040	1252720	a Halo Xbox minus the 360, and they're pretty.
1252720	1254360	They're green and you can see through them.
1254360	1256760	They're green and see-through, and you know, compared to...
1256760	1259080	When our first Xbox died, that's what we got.
1259080	1264000	Compared to, like the first Xbox was ugly, so the Halo one was kind of cool, but this
1264000	1266480	grey one doesn't do it for me, I have to say.
1266480	1268480	It's not grey, it's green.
1268480	1269480	Whatever.
1269480	1270480	Grey green.
1270480	1273920	It looks like the color of sadness, I don't know.
1273920	1275160	It's translucent.
1275160	1276160	It looks like violence.
1276160	1277160	Alright, whatever.
1277160	1278160	And violence sells.
1278160	1280280	Alright, I'm not buying this 360.
1280280	1282600	I don't need HDMI that badly.
1282600	1289680	I already have an Elite anyway, so I don't care, and if I want my HDMI, I'll just play
1289680	1290680	my PS3.
1290680	1295720	Anyway, though speaking of HD, this is kind of cool.
1295720	1300320	Disney is actually going to have their movies available in high definition through the download
1300320	1303560	service on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1303560	1306880	That's pretty cool, which I actually think is kind of funny given that they've been pretty
1306880	1310600	Blu-ray oriented, but hey.
1310600	1313700	I thought that was kind of interesting too for that exact same reason, is that Disney's
1313700	1318640	been kind of Blu-ray oriented, but now here they go with the Xbox service, where Xbox
1318640	1322600	has kind of been with HD DVD, but I guess it's really apples to oranges.
1322600	1323600	You can't really compare the two.
1323600	1325620	Yeah, but I think Disney's both, actually.
1325620	1327640	They do both Blu-ray and HD DVD.
1327640	1330800	No, they're exclusive to Blu-ray.
1330800	1332480	There's a few that do both.
1332480	1337000	However, I think this is their way of getting out of the exclusive thing, is by having their
1337000	1341600	movies available for download, they can have it available to both formats and still say
1341600	1342600	exclusive Blu-ray.
1342600	1343600	You know what?
1343600	1348920	And the other thing too is, okay, they sell another rental of their movie.
1348920	1349960	It's pure profit for them.
1349960	1351560	It's just a digital file that someone downloads.
1351560	1356820	They don't even have to make anything for it, so I don't see why it's win-win for them.
1356820	1361400	So when you hear Disney put their movies on Xbox 360, my mind automatically goes to the
1361400	1366240	animated classics, and I go, ooh, I can go download The Little Mermaid on my 360, but
1366240	1367800	it's not quite like that, right?
1367800	1374360	Actually, there are some of the stuff on there, Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure
1374360	1375360	Planet.
1375360	1376360	It was a crap movie anyway.
1376360	1379240	Well, this is just their initial offering.
1379240	1380240	Tarzan was okay.
1380240	1382080	When they put Tron on there, though, let me know.
1382080	1384480	But having Rosie O'Donnell as a gorilla was pretty funny.
1384480	1387640	Though, if they did Tron HD, ha.
1387640	1391600	Heck, ooh, maybe they will in time because we know we're getting the games on Xbox Live
1391600	1393400	Marketplace, so maybe, maybe.
1393400	1399000	Anyway, but I just want to say it's a lot of Disney's subsidiaries as well, like Miramax
1399000	1401720	and Touchtone are putting their movies out too.
1401720	1402720	Clerks, please.
1402720	1405120	Clerks animated series, please.
1405120	1412120	All right, anyhow, also what you will be able to download soon on Xbox Live Arcade are a
1412120	1415480	lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games.
1415480	1421200	They showed this little trailer at E3 that showed a whole lot of new Xbox Live Arcade
1421200	1425120	games, including the stuff that you can now download right away, Son of the Hedgehog and
1425120	1426120	Golden Axe.
1426120	1427640	But here's some new stuff that's coming out.
1427640	1430480	Next week is Bomberman Live, they've already announced that.
1430480	1436760	Undertow, Hexic 2, which is, am I, is that the, that was the sequel to Hexen, right?
1436760	1437760	That's the sequel to Hexic.
1437760	1438760	Oh, never owned a puzzle game.
1438760	1442280	Hexen was the secret to Heretic.
1442280	1444200	Ah, crap, never mind, okay.
1444200	1446000	Hexen, you can turn people into chickens.
1446000	1447000	Damn it.
1447000	1448000	That was great.
1448000	1450880	Because I, when I first saw that, I was like, oh, because I thought it was like the sequel
1450880	1453040	to the Doom game, but I'm just stupid.
1453040	1459840	Okay, then we have Warworld, Sensible World of Soccer, Every Extend Extra Extreme, Gion,
1459840	1466360	Wing Commander Arena, Feeding Frenzy 2, Track and Field, Spyglass Board Games, Space Giraffe,
1466360	1471360	Battle Fighter 2, HD Turbo Remix, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah, Marathon, Poker
1471360	1473960	Smash, Switch Ball, Tetris Splash, Puzzle Quest.
1473960	1474960	Oh, that's a lot.
1474960	1478560	Switch Ball is supposed to be just like Marble Madness, apparently.
1478560	1483880	And that doesn't mention the Battlestar Galactica game either, which, per Kotaku, sucks.
1483880	1488040	So that's kind of sad, if the Battlestar Galactica game sucks, because I was really looking forward
1488040	1489040	to that.
1489040	1490040	Wing Commander game sucks too, from what I hear.
1490040	1492720	So stop making Space Combat Arena games.
1492720	1494320	Sadness.
1494320	1499680	What they should be making is more space RPGs, like Mass Effect, which is coming in November,
1499680	1505240	and is supposed to be the, you know, I guess the cat's meow or whatever you would say.
1505240	1511720	It's going to be fucking awesome, is basically it, and it should be, you know, it's BioWare.
1511720	1519800	Also coming in September will be Project Gotham Racing 4, which in itself is also pretty impressive.
1519800	1523280	I don't know, Project Gotham Racing 3 was pretty cool.
1523280	1524520	I don't know if I'll get 4, though.
1524520	1525880	I can't control the cars in that.
1525880	1526880	I suck at those type of games.
1526880	1528080	I keep crashing into walls.
1528080	1529080	Yeah.
1529080	1531080	I don't know how to drive.
1531080	1533720	Yeah, I get all woman when I play those games.
1533720	1535840	I can't drive.
1535840	1537560	Die.
1537560	1538800	But Mass Effect.
1538800	1541200	I looked at the trailer for Mass Effect.
1541200	1542360	I think I got a semi.
1542360	1544400	That was a real hot trailer.
1544400	1545400	That game looks awesome.
1545400	1550240	Now, when you saw Mass Effect, didn't you, now, for like half a second I thought, you
1550240	1555480	know, Phantasy Star Online could have been this good if they had actually tried, you
1555480	1556480	know?
1556480	1561000	This is like what Phantasy Star Online should have been, but instead Phantasy Star Online
1561000	1568680	gave us, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
1568680	1573920	Sorry, please listen to the theme of Phantasy Star Online if you don't get my joke, or Phantasy
1573920	1575880	Star Universe, whatever the hell it is.
1575880	1577520	But no, Mass Effect looks great.
1577520	1585680	It looks like V, or some type of epic mini-series movie that's coming soon to the sci-fi network,
1585680	1586680	but in HD.
1586680	1587760	It's going to be pretty epic, too.
1587760	1591500	This is only the first of the trilogy, I believe, for it.
1591500	1594760	So it will be a pretty long story, and hell, just make a movie out of it.
1594760	1596840	I mean, it looks like a movie already, so.
1596840	1602240	I heard that the conversation style in it is really cool, like you use the thumbsticks
1602240	1606160	to talk live, like you basically have to choose an option while the other person is kind of
1606160	1609920	talking or whatever, and then that can have an effect on the conversation, so that sounds
1609920	1610920	kind of neat.
1610920	1617480	I say they take the Mass Effect engine and give us another Space Quest.
1617480	1619320	I guess anything is possible.
1619320	1621680	Who knows what might happen?
1621680	1628440	Well, there's actually a good thing that's going to happen for our friends overseas.
1628440	1635400	In Europe, the Xbox 360 Elite will be out on the 24th of August, which actually was
1635400	1640220	released, the information was released at E3, of course.
1640220	1645560	There's not a price listed, speculation is that it will be close to what it costs over
1645560	1647940	here in the US.
1647940	1650920	So congratulations to Europe, even though you have to wait for things a little later,
1650920	1653760	at least you're finally getting your Xbox 360 Elite.
1653760	1654760	If you want it.
1654760	1655760	If you want it, yeah, if you care.
1655760	1659720	And if you can find it, because I know the ones over here are practically sold out everywhere
1659720	1660720	because...
1660720	1662640	Make friends with people who work at video game shops.
1662640	1667520	I guess producing that larger hard drive is a real challenge out there, you know, slapping
1667520	1671680	that laptop drive into a little case.
1671680	1672680	Oui.
1672680	1677880	Well, one thing you might play on your new Xbox 360 Elite is Seen It.
1677880	1680840	Of course, this is a big announcement that Microsoft made at their press conference this
1680840	1685000	year is that they're going to be putting out a casual game called Seen It.
1685000	1686640	Now, you might have heard of Seen It before.
1686640	1690040	It's a really popular DVD board game.
1690040	1694400	I don't know if they have this outside of the US, if they have this in other countries.
1694400	1696400	Basically it's a board game and you play it with a DVD.
1696400	1697880	I've played this before.
1697880	1703600	You watch like little clips from movies and you're supposed to answer trivia questions
1703600	1706080	based off the clips that you see from the movies.
1706080	1708680	And it works together with the board.
1708680	1713460	It would actually make a really great downloadable game, I think, and it's a pretty good casual
1713460	1714460	game.
1714460	1718040	But is it enough to suddenly turn the Xbox 360 into a casual gaming system?
1718040	1719260	I don't know.
1719260	1720480	But I guess it's a start.
1720480	1721800	Like Uno didn't?
1721800	1725040	Well, I guess Uno was another attempt.
1725040	1727280	But what have we really had since Uno?
1727280	1729000	It's like pure casual.
1729000	1730000	Maybe the solitaire game.
1730000	1731000	I don't know.
1731000	1732000	Texas Hold'em?
1732000	1734280	But nothing's really caught on like Uno has.
1734280	1735280	Well, maybe Hold'em.
1735280	1738080	I guess I'll give you that.
1738080	1742960	I think if you really want to reach the casual gaming audience, make your system a lot cheaper
1742960	1748120	and then they will come because of the price cuts because it will look more attractive.
1748120	1749880	There you go.
1749880	1753320	There's a new controller, by the way, that will come with CNET, and it's a controller
1753320	1756200	so simple that even your grandma can use it.
1756200	1760460	It's one giant button and four little buttons to use for the answers.
1760460	1763760	And apparently the game is going to come with four of these controllers, which is kind of
1763760	1764760	interesting.
1764760	1768480	And the funny thing, too, is it's ripped off of the controller from the Buzz game series,
1768480	1772600	which looks almost identical to that one.
1772600	1776040	Some other things coming out from, of course, the Microsoft press conference.
1776040	1777740	A few more game announcements.
1777740	1782960	They announced Viva Pinata Party Animals because the first game was just so awesome that they
1782960	1789360	had to release a party game for it, and apparently it's going to combine both racing and mini
1789360	1795600	games, kind of similar to like a Mario Kart meets Mario Party, and that's due out in November.
1795600	1797920	Also they announced some other stuff.
1797920	1801200	Some more games will be joining the Games for Windows lineup.
1801200	1803760	Gears of War and Viva Pinata.
1803760	1807400	Gears of War is actually supposed to have some additional content for it as well, which
1807400	1815080	I imagine would be probably downloadable here on the Xbox 360 probably around the same time.
1815080	1820320	And other things, Call of Duty 4, they announced that they're going to be doing an exclusive
1820320	1823720	online beta with Xbox 360.
1823720	1829120	No details on what's going to be involved with that since they haven't launched these
1829120	1834680	sign ups yet, but hopefully know more about that soon since the game does come out in
1834680	1835680	November.
1835680	1842640	Another thing, which kind of joining the whole multiple colored accessories trend here, they're
1842640	1848320	going to be releasing pink and blue controllers in October.
1848320	1850800	I don't know why, but they are.
1850800	1856200	Also the Xbox Messenger is going to be coming in September, that thing that's going to attach
1856200	1861020	to the bottom for text messaging for Windows Messenger.
1861020	1866160	And then if you didn't have a chance to go to E3, there's some pretty cool stuff on Xbox
1866160	1873200	Live Marketplace for you, some new demos including Blue Dragon, Ace Combat 6, NCAA Football 08,
1873200	1879620	Stuntman Ignition, The Bigs, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
1879620	1883600	So let's go around and talk about Microsoft's Preface Conference and sort of your guys'
1883600	1885880	reaction to it.
1885880	1889080	And I'll pose this question to Chad as well, we'll read some of your comments.
1889080	1892160	Were you happy with Microsoft's conference?
1892160	1894440	Was there more you were looking for?
1894440	1898800	And if you could, I don't know, I'll throw this totally arbitrary thing out there.
1898800	1902340	If you could rate the press conference on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?
1902340	1905820	So I'm going to say this right off the bat, and I think this goes for all of us.
1905820	1908600	Where was the anticipated price cut?
1908600	1912760	Do you think Microsoft's kind of waiting to make a response to this?
1912760	1915680	It was indisposed.
1915680	1920400	They were on record commenting saying that to announce a price cut in July is really
1920400	1922400	bad timing.
1922400	1926880	They didn't understand why Sony made that announcement, if you can call it an announcement.
1926880	1933560	They said that they hinted that they will be making an announcement closer to the fall.
1933560	1936920	Well I think we might have more on that later in the show, so we'll see.
1936920	1942040	Anyway, Loki, did you like it, did you not like the conference, what would you say?
1942040	1946160	I would say that they set an example of what their conferences should be like.
1946160	1950360	It's basically, they said here, all the games we're going to show you are going to be coming
1950360	1952080	out this year.
1952080	1953540	That's how you fucking do it.
1953540	1960160	You say here's our lineup for this fall, get excited, it's going to be out in a few months.
1960160	1965640	As opposed to certain other companies that said here's what's coming out, I forgot to
1965640	1970740	mention that most of that is going to be next year, late next year, if not later, stuff
1970740	1971740	like that.
1971740	1976800	I forgot that they really hit the nail on the head with that stuff, and there's not
1976800	1979560	really much more I could want from it.
1979560	1983720	It was a little bit disappointing that certain games were announced also coming through their
1983720	1989560	platform, but they're going to have a really solid lineup.
1989560	1993200	Certain other publishers and hardware makers are going to have a hard time catching up
1993200	1998000	if something magical doesn't happen in the fourth quarter.
1998000	2002240	So I would say probably give them an eight or nine.
2002240	2003240	All right.
2003240	2006640	Dark Sakura, care to give your two cents on what happened?
2006640	2015320	Well, given that you two covered most of my same thought on it, really, I don't know,
2015320	2020880	I'm still in, I actually, I think that they are going to do the, I think actually I agree
2020880	2025520	that it was smart for them not to announce a price drop, that if they put something like
2025520	2032280	that more out public around Christmas or right after Thanksgiving for the Christmas rush,
2032280	2037960	then that will, I think, be more of a reason for consumers to go out and get one then.
2037960	2041000	I don't think there's a need that they'd be, they don't need to really announce a
2041000	2045440	price cut right now anyways because they're going into a really strong fourth quarter.
2045440	2050000	It's not like that their system's not number one selling right now in the United States.
2050000	2052400	They don't really need any extra momentum right now.
2052400	2057120	They need to see what the fourth quarter's like and then right at the prime moment, boom,
2057120	2059680	and then just hit the Christmas rush right there.
2059680	2063000	I think that's what they're going to end up doing.
2063000	2068460	Okay, well I guess my thoughts on it, I don't know, like I kind of would like to know what's
2068460	2072520	going to be the big thing that I should be excited about after Halo 3.
2072520	2076040	Like I was kind of hoping there might be a little hint of what's to come in 2008.
2076040	2078800	I mean I guess I understand the strategy of putting all the cards in, what?
2078800	2079800	They did.
2079800	2082760	They talked about Halo Wars, they were talking about Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect.
2082760	2084880	Mass Effect is this year.
2084880	2087000	I know, but it's after Halo 3.
2087000	2094000	Grand Theft Auto 4, beautiful Katamari, I mean there's a big lineup that's not just
2094000	2095560	Halo 3.
2095560	2100000	There was nothing that had me running around screaming and excited.
2100000	2103840	You know, like in years past, there's usually somebody that releases something that makes
2103840	2107040	me go, ooh, that was really cool.
2107040	2111040	But Microsoft's conference for me was just kind of like, yeah, I kind of saw that coming.
2111040	2112040	Yeah, I kind of saw that coming.
2112040	2113040	Yeah, I figured they'd show that.
2113040	2116400	It was all stuff that was previously announced, and the stuff that they, this is the first
2116400	2120120	time we're announcing, Viva Piñata party, and I was like, I don't fucking care.
2120120	2125200	I mean the scene thing is a good effort, I suppose, but it's not enough to make you go,
2125200	2126720	wow, you're really going to win with that.
2126720	2131200	I was like, ooh, it's neat because I'm in the movie industry, so that's kind of neat.
2131200	2132980	That'd be kind of fun to play at work.
2132980	2135920	I wasn't thinking, ooh, I've got to go get me one of those.
2135920	2138160	No, I don't think so.
2138160	2142360	I would maybe rate the conference like a six and a half.
2142360	2143360	I don't know.
2143360	2146320	It's better than middle of the road, but not by much.
2146320	2151840	There was nothing that made me go, hooray, or maybe give me a gamer fang as it was mostly,
2151840	2152840	okay, I figured that was coming.
2152840	2153840	I figured that was coming.
2153840	2154840	I figured that was coming.
2154840	2155840	That's just me, personally.
2155840	2156840	Let's go to chat.
2156840	2159440	Let's see what some chat folks thought there.
2159440	2161960	Lots of you guys here in chat commenting on it.
2161960	2165720	DJ Tyrant says, Microsoft's conference should have addressed the rings of death issue much
2165720	2166720	much more.
2166720	2167720	No.
2167720	2168720	What do they need?
2168720	2169720	Here's the other thing.
2169720	2170720	Why would they bring attention to that?
2170720	2171720	Why would they even need to address that?
2171720	2172720	They've already addressed that.
2172720	2174280	I'm just reading someone else's thoughts.
2174280	2176040	Well, I'm answering to that.
2176040	2177040	We're expanding.
2177040	2180520	Listen, I'm expanding on this, okay, and I'm tired of people complaining about it, and
2180520	2183400	no, I'm not a fucking Microsoft fanboy, but here's the thing.
2183400	2185020	They're dealing with the problem.
2185020	2189980	Your consoles now have a three year warranty on them from the announcement date.
2189980	2193880	They're going to fix any of them for free, and they've already fixed the problem and
2193880	2199880	new consoles being manufactured right now, so what part of it are they not doing anything
2199880	2200880	about?
2200880	2201880	That's what I want to know.
2201880	2206240	There's no reason to even mention that stuff because, okay, and actually Peter Moore did
2206240	2209720	announce, okay, yeah, we made a mistake, but we're taking care of it.
2209720	2210720	All right.
2210720	2211720	Enough said.
2211720	2215480	SSJ100Matt says, Microsoft's conference was basically the status quo.
2215480	2216480	Not that many surprises.
2216480	2218480	B in my mind.
2218480	2222260	I would think the status quo would be a C. No, that's all right.
2222260	2225600	In the gaming industry, we always inflate scores a little bit, right?
2225600	2227240	Let's see.
2227240	2231520	DDRDollarBill says, I wish achievement points meant something.
2231520	2235520	Whatever happened to the whole- You win a no prize.
2235520	2236760	What happened to the whole thing?
2236760	2241360	Remember they had the old spice inflate your gamer score challenge, and you could win actual
2241360	2242760	... Whatever happened to that?
2242760	2244480	It just kind of disappeared.
2244480	2246200	I agree.
2246200	2250420	They need a little boost there, but- That could have been something that they could
2250420	2253480	have talked about that might have gotten me a little more excited.
2253480	2254960	I don't know.
2254960	2257680	TheRobD says, I got to agree with Loki on Microsoft's press conference.
2257680	2260120	This is a good example of how they should do a press conference.
2260120	2262800	I just wish they would have announced some worthwhile stuff.
2262800	2267520	DJDarknight says, Call of Duty 4 totally won me over.
2267520	2271920	And ShadowNextGen disagrees with Rob D and says, I thought Microsoft announced a great
2271920	2272920	lineup.
2272920	2274520	Did they show Fable 2 at the conference?
2274520	2276320	Yeah, it was at the conference briefly.
2276320	2278520	Briefly, but not a whole lot.
2278520	2279960	It's not coming for a while.
2279960	2283400	Now that's a game I'm getting a little more excited about the more I hear about it, but
2283400	2284800	they didn't say a lot.
2284800	2288900	What I was reading about it was coming from stuff outside the conference, like behind
2288900	2290760	closed doors type stuff.
2290760	2294140	Anyway, so there you go.
2294140	2295440	There's a wrap up on Microsoft.
2295440	2298600	Now before we get into some of the other companies, I want to ask real quick, because we didn't
2298600	2302840	really cover it in the gaming week, but we did talk about how we were at SacAnime, and
2302840	2305380	I wanted to ask Dark Soccer how the rest of the convention went.
2305380	2309280	If you met any listeners of the program, or what kind of stuff was there game wise, or
2309280	2310280	what you did?
2310280	2314880	I walked in with my doll feed this morning, and got attacked by doll feed people.
2314880	2321560	So hi everybody that I met at the convention who was into doll feeds, and my poor doll
2321560	2327040	got petted quite a bit, and that was really it, and then I bought a dollick.
2327040	2334280	I spent most of the time in the dealer's room, but I'd have to say that I didn't watch any
2334280	2341760	anime, I didn't really meet anybody except for Warrior Bob, and Andrew was there, and
2341760	2344640	I bought a dollick, and I bought a heartless plushie.
2344640	2349320	Because isn't that what conventions are about, buying crap just because you want it?
2349320	2356160	I bought a Starman keychain for Mario, and a boo, and a coin box and a fire flower.
2356160	2359680	Not a bad sized convention for this town, considering we just had a big one in the Bay
2359680	2360680	Area.
2360680	2364360	It would be better than the Japantown Anime Fair, actually.
2364360	2368180	The only good thing about the Japantown Anime Fair is that they had better cosplay.
2368180	2372040	There was good cosplay, don't get me wrong, Sac Anime is going to grow.
2372040	2375660	It's going to be bigger, we're going to have a real, real big convention.
2375660	2379920	Everybody was great, the staff was fantastic.
2379920	2388440	Honestly I was very ill-prepared for it, given that I've just come off anime, so I almost
2388440	2392560	cosplayed the doctor, Shadow Next Gen. I wish I had thought about the free donuts
2392560	2396040	and orange juice earlier so we could have promoted that and maybe got a few more people
2396040	2397040	in there.
2397040	2399080	You know, we had a bad time.
2399080	2402060	That's my only complaint, is that we had a bad time for the panel.
2402060	2404360	Had we had later, it would have been just fine.
2404360	2408640	But I kind of see this as, you know, you put in your year of good faith, doing it and showing
2408640	2411880	up on time and everything, and then maybe in January, because this is a twice-yearly
2411880	2414840	con, maybe in January we'll get something a little better, because they'll remember
2414840	2418520	us, you know, that we were good troopers and got up early at the crack of dawn this year.
2418520	2419520	So who knows.
2419520	2420520	Yeah, we're not doing that next year.
2420520	2422520	Yeah, that kind of ruined my sabbath.
2422520	2426800	Yeah, these guys are suckers, they'll fill in that one time slot no one wants again.
2426800	2427800	Nope.
2427800	2428800	It was good though.
2428800	2429800	Next year, primetime.
2429800	2432160	Wow, you guys are turning into divas.
2432160	2435760	No, we want to seriously say that, thanks for having us.
2435760	2441060	I love A-1 Comics now, even though they're local, because I got my Dalek for a lot less
2441060	2443000	expensive than eBay had it.
2443000	2446360	It's probably the same one I saw in their store that I called to tell you about.
2446360	2447360	It is.
2447360	2448360	Oh, how funny.
2448360	2449360	All right.
2449360	2450500	Anyhow, speaking of which, you know, I'll kind of put that call out there again.
2450500	2454240	If you are planning a convention, you know, somewhere on the West Coast within a reasonable
2454240	2460720	travel distance, or you want to go real crazy and fly us out, I mean, no, we won't not hear
2460720	2464500	any reasonable requests, but especially at Bay Area, Central Valley conventions, or even
2464500	2469000	Southern California, we'll, you know, consider anything, and we like to get out there and
2469000	2470000	promote our show.
2470000	2471000	That's how we do it.
2471000	2472000	So get in touch with us.
2472000	2473000	Get in touch with us at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2473000	2474000	All right.
2474000	2475280	Anyhow, let's move on.
2475280	2478600	Before we get into Nintendo's conference, let's talk release dates real quick, because
2478600	2482800	we like to cover what's going to be coming out in the gaming world with our release dates.
2482800	2484680	Jamie, why don't you start us off?
2484680	2491500	Well, for our friends in the UK, we have a few things coming out within this week.
2491500	2497680	On the 18th, we have Bomberman Live for Xbox 360, and the 20th, we have The Darkness, Transformers
2497680	2501080	the Game, and Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.
2501080	2502080	That's it.
2502080	2506120	Kind of a slow week for release dates, just because everything, you know, it's going on,
2506120	2507120	but...
2507120	2508880	Everyone's still, you know, crapping their pants over E3.
2508880	2511560	Well, over in Japan, they have some stuff to look forward to.
2511560	2514240	I love the cover art for this game on the Wii.
2514240	2519000	Momotaru Densetsu 16 is coming out on July 19th over in Japan.
2519000	2523280	It looks like a little train conductor game, like maybe like an A-train type thing, or
2523280	2525600	Sim City, one of those, like, simulation games.
2525600	2526960	That looks cute.
2526960	2533600	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Shonen Oyouji Tsubasa Yoima Teni Kare is coming out on July
2533600	2535240	19th, 2007.
2535240	2539000	Looks like a little adventure game, probably based off yet another anime.
2539000	2546360	You know, this series, Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3, is coming out on the PlayStation 2, also
2546360	2551560	on July 19th, although I believe that is simply a price reduction, not just a brand new game.
2551560	2552560	But hey, it's Ultraman.
2552560	2553960	I had to mention it.
2553960	2557400	Cinnamon Ball, Kurukuru Sweets Paradise.
2557400	2558400	That's awesome.
2558400	2560200	I have two pillows for that.
2560200	2561360	That's exactly what it is.
2561360	2566840	It's Cinema Roll from the Hello Kitty series, and Sanrio makes its way to his brand new
2566840	2568920	DS game that's coming out July 19th.
2568920	2571360	It's an action game featuring Cinema Roll.
2571360	2577280	I must admit, out of all the Sanrio characters, Cinema Roll is the most comfortable to lay
2577280	2578280	on.
2578280	2581200	I had a Batsumaru pillow once.
2581200	2582200	I love Batsumaru.
2582200	2583200	It's my favorite.
2583200	2584760	This is my friend in Texas.
2584760	2588360	And since we just talked about an anime convention, of course we have to mention that there is
2588360	2592200	yet another Naruto game coming out.
2592200	2598800	Saikyo Ninja Daikyu 5 is coming out on the DS July 19th as well.
2598800	2601560	Another Naruto game, bet you can't wait, all of you.
2601560	2604400	I can wait and keep waiting, thank you.
2604400	2608360	Now this is one, you don't have to be a fan of Japanese games to know this game.
2608360	2614800	Bomberman, Touch Bomberman Land Star Bomber No Miracle World coming out from Hudson July
2614800	2617800	19th on the DS in Japan.
2617800	2622560	That's all I'll be mentioning this week for release dates, so let's go to the US.
2622560	2628280	The US is going to be getting ready for some football because NCAA Football 08 is going
2628280	2636320	to be coming out this week on Playstation 2, Xbox, Playstation 3, and the 360.
2636320	2640200	And then of course, if you're not a fan of college football, then maybe you want to check
2640200	2646080	out the new All Pro Football 2K8, which is coming out on both Xbox 360 and Playstation
2646080	2647080	3 this week.
2647080	2650640	If you're not a fan of football at all, maybe you're a fan of some other sports games, including
2650640	2657800	Hot Shots Tennis on Playstation 2 and Rugby 08 on Playstation 2, both coming out this
2657800	2658800	week.
2658800	2664840	Or, let's see, on the PSP, Smash Court Tennis 3 is making its way out.
2664840	2670520	Tales of the World Radiant Mythology on the PSP, and then there's a small little game
2670520	2676440	called Parappa the Rapper on the PSP is finally making its way out, which will be pretty cool.
2676440	2689400	And then of course, on the Wii, you have Absolutely Nothing, and then on the DS, Absolutely Nothing
2689400	2690400	as well.
2690400	2694800	I was wrong, in the US, this isn't a slow game week, because you named a lot of big
2694800	2697320	sports titles there, especially with Madden.
2697320	2698320	Well, not Madden.
2698320	2699320	No small change.
2699320	2700320	Oh, I'm sorry.
2700320	2701320	NCAA Football 08.
2701320	2702320	Isn't Madden out very soon?
2702320	2703320	Like this month?
2703320	2704320	August.
2704320	2705320	Oh, it's August.
2705320	2706320	Yeah.
2706320	2707320	Never mind.
2707320	2708320	Well, still, a lot of sports titles there.
2708320	2713600	Your next two Wii titles aren't exactly something to run home about, but Alien Syndrome on the
2713600	2719680	Wii, Escape from Bug Island, which both come out next week, or the week after next, I
2719680	2723560	guess the 24th, and then Mario Strikers Charge is going to be the week after.
2723560	2726720	Dude, the old school Alien Syndrome arcade game was badass.
2726720	2730560	I used to love that game, but I'm sure this Wii version is nothing like it.
2730560	2731560	It looks okay.
2731560	2732560	It looks like Smash Brothers.
2732560	2734800	Or not Smash Brothers, Smash TV.
2734800	2737440	Can I use the Wii Remote as a flamethrower?
2737440	2739560	Because I remember Alien Syndrome had a flamethrower.
2739560	2740560	That might be kind of neat.
2740560	2742040	I think, well, sort of.
2742040	2746680	I think what it is, is that you use the nunchucks analog stick to move around, and then you
2746680	2751480	use the pointer to, or the remote to point where you're aiming.
2751480	2755820	By the way, speaking of Naruto, bringing up the game during the Japanese release dates
2755820	2760640	reminded me, did anybody catch the Xbox 360 try to, like at Microsoft's conference, they
2760640	2764560	tried to make a big deal out of how they had this exclusive Naruto game coming to the 360?
2764560	2765560	Oh, goody.
2765560	2767280	When it's been on damn near everything else?
2767280	2769920	Which was met with a resounding meh.
2769920	2775920	No, this one hasn't been on every other system, however, it's not the only Naruto game coming
2775920	2776920	out this year.
2776920	2782640	In fact, there's another one on the Wii, there's two on the, I think two already, one already
2782640	2785800	that's come out, one more that's coming out on PlayStation 2.
2785800	2789280	Another one on the PSP, and I think a few more on the DS.
2789280	2795520	So yeah, if you don't have the Xbox 360, man, how are you going to play some Naruto games?
2795520	2796880	That's what I want to know.
2796880	2801680	The Rob D. in chat says, the Naruto game on 360 is exclusive and it looks damn good.
2801680	2802680	It does.
2802680	2804360	And it's not a fighting game, I think.
2804360	2809480	All right, well fair enough, we can give it a chance, we're just teasing a little bit
2809480	2810920	on the Naruto stuff.
2810920	2817280	All right, let's check out Nintendo's press conference, we'll go over and get some stories
2817280	2820260	from Nintendo's press conference.
2820260	2827040	We have a date for Super Smash Brothers Brawl, it will be December 3rd, about damn time.
2827040	2832720	I wish it was tomorrow, but I can wait for Pit, I'm a good girl.
2832720	2837520	It's worth the wait if it's going to be good, like really good, and it does look like it's
2837520	2839200	going to be really good.
2839200	2843000	I know they've showed a stage, I think this was in the last week or two, they showed a
2843000	2848840	stage from Animal Crossing, an Animal Crossing inspired stage, and that looked awesome.
2848840	2853560	But did you hear about if you play it at 8 p.m. on Saturday, because the stages will
2853560	2855920	change depending on the time of day that you play.
2855920	2856920	Oh no, I know it's coming.
2856920	2859200	You play at 8 p.m. on Saturday, you know.
2859200	2861480	K.K. comes out and sings.
2861480	2862800	That is great.
2862800	2866200	He should be a selectable character, but only at 8 o'clock.
2866200	2867240	Did you see the other thing?
2867240	2873080	These are those types of little details that are going to make Smash Brothers Brawl like
2873080	2875880	single-handedly the reason to own a Wii, if nothing else.
2875880	2879560	Well, did you see the other weird character that they announced this week, Dr. Wright
2879560	2884240	from the SimCity game is actually going to be coming to Smash Brothers as a playable
2884240	2885240	character, and you can summon him.
2885240	2888360	Oh no, he's not playable, he's one of those little assist guys you get.
2888360	2889520	I thought he was playable.
2889520	2893440	You know, the impression I got was like, you know how in the last Brawl game you had the
2893440	2895920	Pokeballs and it was all the Pokemon that would come to help?
2895920	2898840	Well now it's assist, and various characters will come and help you.
2898840	2902840	Like the Nintendog will paw at the screen, and Dr. Wright makes the skyscrapers that
2902840	2903840	go boom.
2903840	2904840	Oh well, whatever.
2904840	2907280	But nevertheless, it's kind of neat.
2907280	2909880	What a random little tidbit, right?
2909880	2910880	I guess.
2910880	2916000	Yeah, it's just J-100 Man, he's an assist trophy, okay.
2916000	2918240	Well I thought that he would have been a weird character.
2918240	2922040	I was surprised, you know, that was another thing I was surprised, we didn't hear anymore
2922040	2925800	of like, hey Mega Man's going to be in the game, or hey, you know, Sonic's going to be
2925800	2926800	in the game.
2926800	2929200	Although I'm pretty much guaranteeing right now that Sonic's going to be in the game since
2929200	2933240	they're making a Mario and Sonic game, so obviously they're going to...
2933240	2936520	That's what a lot of fans think, we'll see.
2936520	2941800	Well Nintendo also announced at the conference that there is going to be a Wii Mario Kart,
2941800	2943720	to no one's real big surprise.
2943720	2947360	I mean we kind of speculated that of course there would be a new Mario Kart game coming
2947360	2953400	to the Wii, but there were some surprises, and one of them was that it will be online.
2953400	2955800	Thank you Nintendo for hearing our prayers and giving some more...
2955800	2956800	For that game at least.
2956800	2959820	Yeah, at least for that game, maybe if, you know, they could have done it for some other
2959820	2963080	stuff too, but that's okay, at least they're starting to move in the right direction.
2963080	2967120	I mean Mario Kart was one of the first online games on the DS, so I suppose tradition can
2967120	2968120	continue.
2968120	2972200	But then they're also going to be bringing out a Wii Wheel, which will be a peripheral
2972200	2975800	that you can use with Mario Kart on the Wii, and of course obviously...
2975800	2976800	Oh Wii!
2976800	2981080	A little Wii Wheel that you plug your Wii Mode into and you can actually turn it like
2981080	2982480	it's a regular steering wheel.
2982480	2983480	Wii!
2983480	2987700	And Loki, I know you mentioned on Saturday at the convention, they already have this
2987700	2989600	type of peripheral out there, and...
2989600	2995880	This has been out since launch, they've got two really shitty ass Ubisoft games called
2995880	2999600	Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.
2999600	3003880	And let me tell you, it comes with a crappy wheel just like this, basically you snap the
3003880	3008660	controller in, it serves no purpose other than, oh I can't imagine that the remote's
3008660	3012280	a wheel so I need an actual wheel in front of me to turn it!
3012280	3017640	So then you play the game with that, okay granted, okay I'll give them this, it is free,
3017640	3022000	but it's a gimmick to sell the game, just like it was a gimmick to sell those two other
3022000	3023000	games.
3023000	3026200	And I'm going to tell you this much, I will not play it with the damn wheel, and thank
3026200	3030600	God they're going to have multiple control options because I fucking hate games with
3030600	3034280	the Wii that require you to have the Wii remote sideways to steer it.
3034280	3038960	I like Excite Truck where you have it, you know, flat, and then you steer it that way.
3038960	3040960	That's fine.
3040960	3043880	Blaze in our chat asked, does Excite Truck come with a wheel?
3043880	3044880	It actually does not.
3044880	3045880	It does not.
3045880	3048240	But some people use the other wheel adapter for it.
3048240	3049240	You can't.
3049240	3050840	You can't use the other wheel adapter for it.
3050840	3056600	It won't work because the actual controller needs to be held parallel to the ground, and
3056600	3062280	then you steer it that way, whereas the Ubisoft games you have to hold the controller perpendicular
3062280	3064640	to the ground, and then turn it that way.
3064640	3066880	So it's a completely different axis that you would turn it on.
3066880	3071640	Now Act Def says the Ubisoft wheel is crappy, the Wii wheel looks like it's better designed,
3071640	3074000	so I mean it is a Nintendo first party product.
3074000	3078440	Okay, great, it's a better designed piece of crap to get the Sigma controller in.
3078440	3082040	Here's the thing I have a problem with, and we'll get into some more of this stuff with
3082040	3083440	our next story.
3083440	3086920	I'm having a problem with them releasing stuff, I thought, okay, the whole point of having
3086920	3091560	the expansion port in the bottom of the Wii remote is that we would be getting new peripherals
3091560	3095760	that will plug into the bottom, other than the nunchuck, okay?
3095760	3098160	Which I will go into this next story here with the Zapper.
3098160	3100720	Wait, can I say, wait, real quick, before we get to the Zapper, can I say one other
3100720	3102340	thing about Mario Kart?
3102340	3106980	You couldn't see a whole lot of the actual game itself, but I did notice in the brief
3106980	3111240	little bits that they showed of Mario Kart on the Wii, there's only one person in the
3111240	3112240	car.
3112240	3113240	Thank God.
3113240	3116880	Mario Kart isn't a sequel to Double Dash, so I will give Nintendo another few points
3116880	3117880	there.
3117880	3120360	Okay, now you can move on.
3120360	3123680	The other thing they announced was the Wii Zapper.
3123680	3129520	Now I remember looking at this E3 originally last year when they had a prototype, and that
3129520	3134320	prototype looked pretty awesome, because it was actually something that the Wii controller
3134320	3139960	would plug into, and it's a whole new peripheral, how it should be.
3139960	3144800	However, this new Wii Zapper that they're going to be releasing is just a stupid holder
3144800	3149320	for the remote and the nunchuck, and I'm going to tell you what.
3149320	3153900	There were some third-party companies releasing something very similar called the Wii Sharpshooter
3153900	3159220	or the Wii Blaster or whatever, and I thought, my God, who's going to buy this stupid crap?
3159220	3164480	It looks like it's completely useless, and they went ahead and made the same useless
3164480	3166480	peripheral.
3166480	3167480	Knock it off.
3167480	3168480	Seriously.
3168480	3170160	I mean, this thing looks like crap.
3170160	3174560	The only thing that's going to be a selling point for is it's $19.99, and it will come
3174560	3177920	with a pack-in game, so great.
3177920	3184560	You get a game for $20 and this piece of crap with it, but seriously, they need just, instead
3184560	3189720	of releasing something that the remote straps into with the nunchuck, just release a new
3189720	3192440	goddamn thing that you plug the whole thing into.
3192440	3195880	That way, because apparently there's a trigger on the front, and this whole thing is very
3195880	3202200	awkward to hold anyways because it kind of looks like the Menacer, but not.
3202200	3204160	There's no actual dedicated button to the trigger.
3204160	3207800	It's just another button that pushes the B button on the bottom of the remote, which
3207800	3212520	I can tell you is not going to work very well.
3212520	3215400	They kind of looked at these other companies out there and said, oh, look, they're making
3215400	3216880	gimmicky crap and people are buying it.
3216880	3219060	Let's make some gimmicky crap.
3219060	3222880	We don't want to be left out of that, gravy train.
3222880	3231560	Don't you think this is one of those things that you should really try?
3231560	3237000	No, I can tell you right now, I like the other one because the trigger is in the back.
3237000	3238740	It was like a shotgun.
3238740	3239740	It would be comfortable.
3239740	3245680	It had a little analog stick above the top there, kind of like the new Gun Con, and that
3245680	3247080	would be comfortable to hold.
3247080	3248520	This thing looks like crap.
3248520	3253320	It's just probably because, I don't know about you guys, but right now I know nunchucks are
3253320	3254320	hard to come by.
3254320	3259120	Why I don't know that they can make them fast enough is beyond me, but obviously making
3259120	3264560	any additional peripherals that have actual working parts in there would be too much for
3264560	3265560	them.
3265560	3266560	Instead, molding plastic is a lot easier.
3266560	3271840	If you want to pay 20 bucks for a piece of molded plastic, go right ahead.
3271840	3276680	I guarantee you, playing these games without the Zapper will be fucking easier and a lot
3276680	3281840	better than playing it with the Zapper, and you will be sorry that you bought this product.
3281840	3282920	I don't know, Loki.
3282920	3287160	I know this isn't in our show world tonight, so I can say that there's YouTubage on the
3287160	3291560	internet of the new Silent Hill arcade game because it's being location tested in Europe
3291560	3296160	or something right now, so some bootlegs of the game hit the internet, and of course,
3296160	3299320	being a Silent Hill fanboy, the game looks fucking hot.
3299320	3303040	You get to fight Pyramid Head in it, and he tries to chop your face off.
3303040	3304040	It's amazing.
3304040	3305040	I want right now.
3305040	3308880	If they put that game out on the Wii, and I can use this little Wii Zapper thing to
3308880	3315880	play this game, I might have sex with everybody at Nintendo, because that would be phenomenal.
3315880	3318960	Because that kind of puts you in the game.
3318960	3321720	I can be raped by Pyramid Head.
3321720	3323360	It's awkward to play with this.
3323360	3325680	The trigger's on the goddamn front of the gun.
3325680	3327040	It doesn't make any sense.
3327040	3329880	Who the fuck has a gun with a trigger on the goddamn front of it?
3329880	3337000	Even the Super Scope 6 had the trigger in the back.
3337000	3338000	It's crap.
3338000	3340480	I mean, there's other third party peripherals out there.
3340480	3344880	If you want the B like a gun, I've seen one that the remote plugs into it, and it looks
3344880	3345880	like a pistol.
3345880	3348600	It has a pistol grip on it, and you just pull the trigger, and it's like pulling the B button.
3348600	3354200	Alright, now Black Wolf says you don't use the front trigger at all, and he was at E3.
3354200	3357120	Okay, the front trigger in the front.
3357120	3358120	Okay.
3358120	3360120	Why would you not use the trigger in the front?
3360120	3364060	What the hell is there a trigger there for then, if you don't use it for the game?
3364060	3368400	It's for pushing the goddamn B button.
3368400	3374480	I still say bring me Silent Hill, shoot him up to the Wii, I will buy the zapper, I will
3374480	3377560	hump the zapper, and I will be raped by Pyramid Head, and it would be good.
3377560	3379200	I put out this challenge for you.
3379200	3382800	When this shit comes out, and when these two fucking games, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles,
3382800	3387360	and Ghost Squad come out, I would like to see a side-by-side challenge with someone
3387360	3391000	with the zapper, and without the zapper, and see who gets a better fucking score.
3391000	3397640	I bet you anything, money, I will bet fucking $50 that the goddamn person without the zapper
3397640	3400880	will wipe the floor with someone with the zapper.
3400880	3401880	That's why.
3401880	3405040	This thing is a piece of awkward shit, is what it is.
3405040	3411080	$50, I have $50 on this.
3411080	3412360	I will like to see this challenge.
3412360	3414040	We will perform this challenge in studio.
3414040	3416400	I don't know, Rob, are you up to it?
3416400	3429640	I'm not taking the bet, I'll just play the game, I don't care.
3429640	3437040	How about this, since I don't have $50, how about this, we'll make the bet.
3437040	3440760	The bet will be a date.
3440760	3448000	If the gun is indeed better, then I will take your wife out on a date, and take her off
3448000	3452200	your hands for a night so you can do nothing but play video games, alright?
3452200	3463120	But if the gun is better, then you will take me out on a date, deal, deal, that's it, deal.
3463120	3468520	Then the whole chat has heard it, so if the Wii remote is better, the games are better
3468520	3473080	without the zapper peripheral, then I will take Loki's wife out on a date, and she won't
3473080	3476560	be able to nag at Loki for a whole night, but if the gun is indeed better, Loki will
3476560	3479680	take me out on a date, and you better put out.
3479680	3481800	We have this on record.
3481800	3485800	I'm telling you, this thing looks like crap.
3485800	3488000	There's no way it's going to make it better.
3488000	3492380	There's no way at all.
3492380	3496960	WeDoInChat says, Rob offers himself again, what a skank.
3496960	3501440	My significant other might have problems with this, but that's alright.
3501440	3506440	BlackWolf says, I really don't want to interject facts into a Loki rant because it's too funny.
3506440	3511040	WeDo also says, Loki needs a hug, and Rob needs to stop being so skanky.
3511040	3516600	Frisbee says it's a 9.4 on the Loki scale, and SSJ100Matt says Loki's rant level was
3516600	3518040	at 9 out of 10.
3518040	3519040	That's great.
3519040	3522160	Alright, there we go.
3522160	3535920	The date bet over the zapper is on.
3535920	3541600	Fifty dollars for one night with your wife.
3541600	3542600	Indecent Nintendo.
3542600	3543840	Okay, anyway, let's move on.
3543840	3546360	News story, please.
3546360	3552720	And other releases in regards to Nintendo, for anyone who cares, Super Mario Galaxy will
3552720	3554600	be out on November 12th.
3554600	3555600	That's pretty awesome.
3555600	3559200	That game actually looks even better now that I've seen more screenshots and gameplay of
3559200	3560200	it.
3560200	3561200	I'm really looking forward to it.
3561200	3562840	Actually, I have to agree.
3562840	3567800	You know, I really, really loved Super Mario Water Sports.
3567800	3570000	Sorry.
3570000	3571240	Please tell me you mean Mario Sunshine.
3571240	3572240	Mario Sunshine, yes.
3572240	3573240	Thank you.
3573240	3576480	But I'm sorry, just the whole...
3576480	3582240	This actually looks very similar to Mario 64, almost like a sequel to Mario 64.
3582240	3583240	That's what I like.
3583240	3588240	I've even gone back and watched speedruns of Mario 64, you know, people using all the
3588240	3591880	glitches in the game to beat it with 17 stars and all that.
3591880	3595740	And I was like, dude, I need another Mario 64.
3595740	3600800	You know, if they could ROM hack GameCube games like they can the old school 8-bit Nintendo
3600800	3606200	games, I'm sure there would be a Super Mario Water Sports where they would just redo the
3606200	3610280	sprites so he whips it out and uses it as a gun.
3610280	3611280	It's freaky.
3611280	3614680	That was back on the Game Boy with the Link's adventure.
3614680	3620720	Anyhow, so I'm looking forward to Mario Galaxy as well, but I don't want to make a complete
3620720	3626160	opinion until I'm able to play it, but certainly the screenshots and videos look enticing.
3626160	3631000	This was Nintendo's big thing, for lack of a better term.
3631000	3634900	This was their big thing at the press conference, kind of the thing that nobody...
3634900	3637040	You have to admit, nobody called this.
3637040	3638600	Nobody knew this was coming.
3638600	3641120	Wii Fit was the game.
3641120	3644420	It's going to be a game that comes with what's called the Balance Board, and you can think
3644420	3650400	of it as kind of brain training for your body, which I'm sure the idea came from, is probably
3650400	3652080	borrowed from the brain training series.
3652080	3658960	But using the Balance Board, you can do push-ups, steps aerobics, this goalie defense type thing,
3658960	3663040	and dancing, and I guess it's taking the old school 8-bit game dance aerobics into a whole
3663040	3664040	new...
3664040	3665800	Remember with the Power Pad?
3665800	3668520	Take it into a whole new generation.
3668520	3674180	And this was met with a resounding meh from the gaming community, but there's something
3674180	3678160	about this that I think is going to make the Wii catch fire even more, because soccer moms
3678160	3680960	are going to continue to want to buy this for their kids, honestly.
3680960	3682480	I think it's fucking smart.
3682480	3684000	I think it looks cool.
3684000	3687960	This is something I actually kind of want to buy, because I need an excuse to work out,
3687960	3688960	apparently.
3688960	3692080	But here's the other thing, too, that a lot of people aren't looking at.
3692080	3694360	This is how they need to do the peripherals.
3694360	3698320	This is something new, something innovative.
3698320	3703320	You can imagine incorporating it into a snowboarding game, or a skateboarding game, or something
3703320	3704320	like that.
3704320	3707760	It's actually a kind of neat peripheral, if they use it in that sense.
3707760	3714040	Say the next SSX game that comes out, you can use this with a remote as some added immersion
3714040	3717200	into the game.
3717200	3722520	This plastic add-on shit is stupid, but this will be cool, though, I think.
3722520	3726960	I have to admit, when I first saw the press conference and everything, I was one of those
3726960	3728800	people that was kind of like, oh, that's it?
3728800	3729840	That was their big thing?
3729840	3734900	But the more I thought about it, I was like, you know, that is going to get the media talking
3734900	3738920	about the Wii all over again this Christmas, just like last year they talked about, oh,
3738920	3740800	Wii Tennis gets you up and moving.
3740800	3742640	It's going to get them on CNN all over again.
3742640	3746760	I am totally getting Wii Fit, because then I can do yoga and not have to go to class.
3746760	3750920	Honestly, it's a really freaking smart move, and I hate to come off sounding like a Nintendo
3750920	3751920	fanboy.
3751920	3755800	I mean, this is nothing that, you know, obviously I'm still very disappointed there was no real
3755800	3760720	news about online gaming or whatever, but honestly, in the direction the Wii has always
3760720	3766160	said they were going to go and that they've been going in, this is a logical next step
3766160	3770280	that's going to make this thing be popular all over again this Christmas.
3770280	3772160	I think it's going to be a smart move for them.
3772160	3773840	It's not coming out this year, though.
3773840	3774840	Oh, it's not?
3774840	3775840	No.
3775840	3776840	Oh, I thought it was this Christmas.
3776840	3777840	No, next year.
3777840	3778840	Well, damn them.
3778840	3779840	Really?
3779840	3780840	That long?
3780840	3784560	I mean, it looked like the game was pretty well into progress, and they're really going
3784560	3785560	to make us wait that long.
3785560	3786560	It's not coming out until 2008, yeah.
3786560	3792760	Now, I will say, though, however, that the announcement of Wii Fit did give us this year's
3792760	3794280	Giant Enemy Crab Award.
3794280	3798880	Yes, that would be the biggest flub that happened at an E3 press conference, and that would
3798880	3803120	be when Reggie stepped on the little scale, because it measures your body fat as well,
3803120	3806880	and had the Wii tell him he was overweight in front of thousands of people.
3806880	3808340	That's got to feel real good.
3808340	3813620	So congratulations to Reggie Fils-May, winner of the 2007 Giant Enemy Crab Award, yours
3813620	3816200	from Orange Launch Radio with love.
3816200	3820200	Some other interesting things, of course, they're showing off, or actually they kind
3820200	3826980	of went a little bit under the radar, but DK Bongo Blast is coming out in October.
3826980	3831440	This is the Bongo racing game that's coming out.
3831440	3836680	I guess, I think actually you can use the Bongos if you've got them, otherwise you can
3836680	3841280	just use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck and stuff, and it's going to be a racing game, which
3841280	3843280	looks like crap.
3843280	3848000	The other one is a brand new channel called the Check Me Out channel, and it's kind of
3848000	3854880	a combination of a Mii community as well as a Hot or Not thing.
3854880	3858960	You basically can search for different Miis, like say if you want, I use this example on
3858960	3863080	Saturday, if you're looking for a Chuck Norris Mii, you can browse through all the people's
3863080	3867720	Chuck Norris Miis and check out the one that you think most looks like Chuck Norris, and
3867720	3870580	then you can vote that one high or download it and stuff like that.
3870580	3874880	So that's kind of neat.
3874880	3878440	That's pretty much all the big stuff that they were announcing this year.
3878440	3886040	A lot of it was just kind of like, yeah, we've heard your cry for online gaming and stuff,
3886040	3889800	and we're doing what we want still.
3889800	3893320	Bobby Black Wolf had a really funny comment in chat that I think really sums things up
3893320	3894320	here.
3894320	3896940	It says, Nintendo's press conference summarized by Bobby Black Wolf.
3896940	3899120	This is how we've printed money in the past.
3899120	3902680	Here's a bone we're throwing to hardcore gamers, and here's how we will print money in the
3902680	3903680	future.
3903680	3908600	It's kind of a true statement in my mind.
3908600	3910640	All right, let's do the same thing we did for Microsoft.
3910640	3913720	Let's go around what you liked, what you didn't like, rate it.
3913720	3915240	You want to start us off, Dr. Sarca?
3915240	3916240	For Nintendo?
3916240	3917240	Yes.
3917240	3921560	I think that Wii Fit's redeemed the whole thing, so it gets a nine.
3921560	3923720	So you are really excited about Wii Fit that much?
3923720	3924720	Absolutely.
3924720	3925720	All right.
3925720	3926720	Loki?
3926720	3931520	I think that they lost some innovation points with the announcement of the Wii Wheel and
3931520	3935880	the Wii Zapper, because I was really looking forward to the Wii Zapper as something like
3935880	3943800	that we saw at E3 2006, and it was a real let down to see.
3943800	3948240	It's just this hunk of plastic crap that I got to throw Wii Remote and Nunchuck in, and
3948240	3953780	kind of, for me, just said, okay, look, they're embracing this gimmicky shit that people are
3953780	3957600	putting out, and I kind of thought they were a little bit better than that.
3957600	3961600	It was nice to see that they did announce some street dates for some games coming out.
3961600	3967600	Good, because there's some definite spaces in between some of these better games.
3967600	3972520	And I don't know, the Wii Fit thing's great, because they're looking for that whole health
3972520	3974600	fitness angle, but I was really disappointed.
3974600	3979480	There's not a lot of talk of online that really seemed to skimp that whole part of, was it
3979480	3984560	Super Smash, or, not Super Smash Brothers, but Metroid Prime, I know was not supposed
3984560	3987320	to be online, I guess, so.
3987320	3988320	Uh-huh.
3988320	3989320	All right.
3989320	3996200	And then I would rate it probably a six, actually.
3996200	3999640	This was one of those things, I was watching the live feeds of them, I actually turned
3999640	4003160	it off because I got bored.
4003160	4007240	For me, I am a hardcore gamer, and I think one of the disappointing things about Nintendo's
4007240	4011600	press conference is that I can probably count the number of games on one hand that I'm really
4011600	4013820	truly excited about that are coming to the Wii.
4013820	4018000	I mean, I'm not really excited about all that much, but granted the games that I am hyped
4018000	4020420	for, I'm really, really hyped for.
4020420	4023880	So I'm a little bit torn, because I want to give Nintendo props for sticking to their
4023880	4027360	guns and kind of continuing down this path that they promised they were going to do next
4027360	4031600	year in regards to the new generation of gaming versus the next generation of gaming.
4031600	4036220	So I give them props there, but I am still left with disappointment over the lack of
4036220	4043760	some type of centralized online system, just talks about more details on WiiWare, anything
4043760	4047400	that could compete with the behemoth of Xbox Live as far as online goes.
4047400	4048400	I don't know.
4048400	4053000	I still felt like there was a lot to be desired, but then again, that is for the hardcore gamer.
4053000	4057040	But they're going to win a million points with soccer moms, and they're going to continue
4057040	4058960	to do very well in the next year.
4058960	4060840	So I don't know.
4060840	4066160	I personally give them a six, but looking from it, if I wasn't so selfish, I would probably
4066160	4067800	give them more of an eight.
4067800	4068800	So that's that.
4068800	4071600	Let's look at chat and see what the chat says.
4071600	4074300	SSJ100Matt says, I'm giving it a C-D+.
4074300	4079000	They showed their true colors this year that they are careless about hardcore gamers.
4079000	4083020	ActDef says, Rob D., I think Microsoft was worse.
4083020	4085200	They didn't show anything new.
4085200	4088560	And that was to Rob D.'s comments that says, I give Nintendo six out of ten.
4088560	4089720	It was worse than the other two.
4089720	4093560	They're going in a different direction, but they announced Mario Kart.
4093560	4097040	Rob D. also says, Nintendo's press conference was extremely disappointing to me because
4097040	4101520	I think they're showing me that they might be leaving me behind a little bit.
4101520	4103840	Let's see.
4103840	4106560	Zappy asked, was that fitness game for Xbox any good?
4106560	4108640	If you're talking about your self-fitness, no it wasn't.
4108640	4111040	I actually had it.
4111040	4112920	Let's see.
4112920	4116400	WeDo says, Wii needs a soccer kicking game to win over the soccer moms.
4116400	4119960	Well, you know, they have the goalie thing in Wii Fit, so who knows.
4119960	4125600	DS191 says, I'll make a bold statement, Nintendo did nothing, I mean nothing, to convince me
4125600	4128320	to buy a Wii between now and Christmas.
4128320	4132080	And BlackWolf asks, do you have a source for Wii Fit not coming out in 2007, Loki, because
4132080	4133960	they did not confirm or deny that on the show floor.
4133960	4135720	I thought it was not on their list.
4135720	4142280	It was on their release list, I believe, for 2008, because it was supposed to be, God,
4142280	4143280	I don't remember.
4143280	4145240	I know it said not this year, though.
4145240	4146240	I know that for a fact.
4146240	4147240	All right.
4147240	4148240	Two more comments, then we'll move on.
4148240	4151680	David Tyrant says, I give them an 8 out of 10, they showed why they're in a great position
4151680	4155080	right now, they've got solid titles and a great lineup ahead of them with their regular
4155080	4157260	titles, Mario, Metroid, et cetera.
4157260	4161720	And Gerardimo says, just my opinion on Nintendo's online situation, are there really that many
4161720	4163400	games worth playing online right now?
4163400	4167520	Seriously, Mario Party or Big Brain Academy online, that wouldn't be much fun.
4167520	4168520	I don't know, I disagree.
4168520	4171600	I think Mario Party would actually be a lot of fun online.
4171600	4174960	I don't know, I think multiplayer is the only way to go and sometimes your house just can't
4174960	4176900	accommodate all those people.
4176900	4178600	But that's my opinion, and that's yours.
4178600	4182400	So chat.orangeontradio.com if you ever want to join us in the chat room, and of course
4182400	4188480	we do tape live on Sunday nights at orangeontradio.com on our Live 365 feed, which did not shut down
4188480	4192520	on July 15th, contrary to the rumor about the whole internet, but thankfully there was
4192520	4196600	a little reprieve by Congress, which has given people time more to negotiate the rates.
4196600	4201880	Of course, we encourage you to visit savenetradio.org and learn more about the situation impacting
4201880	4203840	internet radio that continues to.
4203840	4207460	For now, let's move on to some other stories that don't have really to do with press conferences
4207460	4209960	per se, but some other things going around around the gaming industry.
4209960	4212080	Well, this is actually pretty cool.
4212080	4218120	We mentioned earlier, but Paper Mario is going to the European Virtual Console, and I think
4218120	4221200	that's pretty cool because it was a really cool game.
4221200	4225640	I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it, but it was classic Nintendo 64 stuff.
4225640	4230020	It's kind of hard to think of Nintendo 64 stuff as being classic though, because I remember
4230020	4233140	when it was new.
4233140	4239560	It is, though, a thousand points to download.
4239560	4242840	Right now, though, on the European Virtual Console, then the total Nintendo 64 games
4242840	4249480	have now Paper Mario, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time,
4249480	4252080	Lilot Wars, and F-Zero X.
4252080	4259040	Also coming out on Virtual Console is Air Zonk, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, which
4259040	4265040	was sort of okay, and it's a 600-point game.
4265040	4267720	Would you download Paper Mario when it's released here?
4267720	4268720	Sure.
4268720	4269720	I've never played it.
4269720	4270720	Why not?
4270720	4271720	Why not?
4271720	4274320	It's something new, and I heard it was a pretty good game.
4274320	4276240	This is an interesting follow-up.
4276240	4280480	It's a news story, but it kind of follows along the same path as something we previously
4280480	4282840	reported on.
4282840	4284840	This comes from gamepolitics.com.
4284840	4290520	Apparently, Mario Party 8 has been pulled in the UK, and the reason why the game was
4290520	4291960	pulled in the UK?
4291960	4294840	The word spastic is used in one scene.
4294840	4297920	The word can be seen on the Shy Guy's Perplex Express board.
4297920	4302040	If a player lands on one of several certain green spaces, Magikoopa will appear, and before
4302040	4307240	rearranging the train cars, will say, Magikoopa magic, turn the train spastic, make this ticket
4307240	4308240	tragic.
4308240	4313280	And of course, we remember we talked previously about the brain training-ish game, or it was
4313280	4317560	actually Mind Quiz was the real game, that had the controversy behind it, because it
4317560	4323360	used the word spastic in it, which here in the US, not really a big deal of a word.
4323360	4328160	It's not a very controversial word, but in the UK carries a lot more meaning and oomph
4328160	4332880	about the mentally handicapped.
4332880	4334520	That's tragic.
4334520	4339100	Interesting that it kind of continues another recall over that word.
4339100	4340100	Very interesting.
4340100	4345720	Well, another thing that's tragic is the fact that the government and government groups
4345720	4351240	feel that they need to step in to protect kids from M-rated games.
4351240	4357260	So the National Institute on Media and Family is building an army of undercover agents or
4357260	4364840	shoppers for their 11th annual video game report card, and they're going to be finding
4364840	4373320	actual minors to go in and attempt to buy M-rated games to see if the actual retailers
4373320	4378240	will prevent them from buying it.
4378240	4383220	I think it's good that they're trying to enforce that stuff.
4383220	4384220	I don't know.
4384220	4388000	I still think though that parents should be more responsible.
4388000	4390960	Stop giving your kids money if you don't want them buying crap.
4390960	4394960	Let's move on to another segment we like to do every week here on the program.
4394960	4398160	It's called the Website of the Week, and it's brought to you by Dark Sakura.
4398160	4401840	She likes to surf the internet up and down and all over every week and find a website
4401840	4404240	to share with you all out there on the internet.
4404240	4410600	Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?
4410600	4420840	The Website of the Week is one that will definitely make an impact, I think, on the world at large.
4420840	4425480	It is AwfulPlasticSurgery.com.
4425480	4435560	It's a site taking very famous people and showing just how bad their plastic surgery
4435560	4436560	is.
4436560	4437960	I'm really not joking.
4437960	4439760	It's AwfulPlasticSurgery.com.
4439760	4443280	Is it not for the squeamish because I have a feeling a site like this will make you kind
4443280	4444280	of go, ah!
4444280	4445280	No, it's not that bad.
4445280	4451000	It's just pictures you'd find anywhere on the internet.
4451000	4454360	Thank you, Dark Sakura, for that lovely Website of the Week.
4454360	4460920	There's also one that's called GoodPlasticSurgery.com, too, that shows plastic surgery is done right.
4460920	4469200	An example on here is, I find this one funny, Brooke Hogan's boob implants.
4469200	4480760	Who was it, Victoria Beckham, her boobs that just look wrong.
4480760	4481760	It's funny.
4481760	4484480	I think it's hilarious.
4484480	4488120	Also something I think that is kind of funny and looks like maybe plastic surgery gone
4488120	4492520	wrong is this very interesting peripheral that was announced at E3 2007.
4492520	4494520	It's the Wii Party Station.
4494520	4495520	What?
4495520	4496520	Huh?
4496520	4497520	What?
4497520	4498520	It's the Wii Party Station.
4498520	4502320	Lego, they make a lot of these types of interesting peripherals.
4502320	4503320	Look at this.
4503320	4504800	They've made this party station.
4504800	4508320	It's a coffee table centerpiece for the Wii games.
4508320	4511760	It's basically got four stations that can hold your Wii remote there.
4511760	4517480	You have little LED counters that can count score, like round scores if you're doing that,
4517480	4522560	but also there's a storage drawer in it for nunchucks and other accessories, and then
4522560	4528000	also there's four freezable cup holders that you can put into this thing and then a little
4528000	4530400	center bowl for chips and dip.
4530400	4533240	It's a little party station for all your Wii crap.
4533240	4534240	That's kind of smart.
4534240	4538840	You can have a Wii tennis party, and the price for it, $24.99.
4538840	4542360	That's not bad just as a storage unit.
4542360	4543720	It's kind of actually not a bad price.
4543720	4544720	I look at it and go, WTF.
4544720	4547720	If I had a coffee table, it'd be great.
4547720	4552080	There's a lot of people that are into having the Wii Sports parties, especially for, again,
4552080	4557280	the casual gamers and the soccer mom parties of the world, and I keep using them, but you
4557280	4558280	know what I mean.
4558280	4561960	People that aren't really into gaming, I think will probably get a kick out of this for their
4561960	4562960	next party.
4562960	4566640	Where was this when we used to do the money parties?
4566640	4567640	Good question.
4567640	4574860	Yeah, because actually having, I don't know, say just a bag of chips on the table or using
4574860	4578840	a bowl for chips is way too difficult.
4578840	4581280	I like having the freezer tray.
4581280	4582280	That's a really good idea.
4582280	4583360	Sure, go ahead and buy this.
4583360	4588200	You're just encouraging them to make more crap like this that's going to come out later.
4588200	4589620	But it's not that bad, Loki.
4589620	4590680	I don't know.
4590680	4594680	It's better than those little plastic golf clubs that you put your remote into.
4594680	4595680	Is it?
4595680	4596680	Really, is it?
4596680	4601320	If the little golf club held chips and dip in it, would it be better?
4601320	4602880	Shut up.
4602880	4607200	Everything is better with chips and dip.
4607200	4611240	We're going to take a quick break because as GS68 says in the chat room, Loki's hit
4611240	4614040	his limit break, so he needs to calm down a little bit.
4614040	4617600	He needs to go fag his anger for a little bit, which by the way, somebody left an iTunes
4617600	4621360	review that said we needed to fag our anger.
4621360	4625640	So thank you very much to the mysterious person who wrote that and snuck it through the iTunes
4625640	4626840	review sensors.
4626840	4629740	If you ever want to leave us an iTunes review, you really should.
4629740	4633600	It helps expose our show to a whole new audience and word of mouth is the only way independent
4633600	4635040	podcasts can survive.
4635040	4639640	So go to iTunes or any website like Yahoo Podcasts, Digg, any of those sites and leave
4639640	4640640	us a review.
4640640	4641640	We appreciate it.
4641640	4643680	And GS68 makes a good point here.
4643680	4649000	Chips equals oily equals oily remote, which equals more remotes being thrown in the TV.
4649000	4651520	So keep the paper towels nearby.
4651520	4652520	Shut up.
4652520	4653520	All right.
4653520	4657000	We're going to take a quick break.
4657000	4660200	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4660200	4664600	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4664600	4665600	a week.
4665600	4678600	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
