14267	18169	Tonight, July 15th, 2007, an E3 wrap-up.
18349	24092	Microsoft gets Disney movies, Nintendo wants you to get fit, and Sony gives the PSP a makeover.
32489	36554	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36594	42060	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42120	43041	My name is Rob Roberts.
43081	43962	You might know me as Sky.
44022	47045	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47326	47666	Yo.
47966	48627	How you doing, Jamie?
49368	49468	Uh.
50289	51010	Uh, a little, uh.
51030	52692	I'm conventioning to this morning.
53367	57408	We'll talk a little more about that in just a moment, but let me introduce as well Techmaster Loki.
57688	57788	Hello.
57808	59308	How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?
59368	59869	I'm doing fine.
60329	60769	Swell.
61529	62769	Are you all conventioned out as well?
63589	63749	No.
64370	65910	Oh, that's too bad or good?
65950	66730	I don't know if that's good news.
66790	68270	I didn't really go to the convention at all.
68330	70091	All right, we'll talk about the convention in just a little bit.
70851	73612	We have, unfortunately, no real special guests in the studio tonight.
73632	77893	I mean, Xfer's over there playing WoW, but that means he's probably too busy to actually comment on tonight's programs.
78293	79553	But other folks might come in and out.
80303	82324	Rob sounds different from the podcast.
106837	110980	I don't know, well, it could be the fact that it's a different bit rate when we stream live than it is on the podcast.
111000	112101	I think it's a little cleaner.
112861	115683	Our live stream actually uses MP3 Pro encoding.
115803	119566	Actually, the podcast, our audio archive uses MP3 Pro as well.
119906	123388	Unfortunately, the iPods don't recognize MP3 Pro, which is how most people listen to us.
123709	128892	But if you listen to the shows on WinApp, it actually sounds a little cleaner if you have the MP3 Pro plug-in installed.
128912	131294	Just a little tip for those of you guys that listen live at home.
131946	135369	Anyhow, let's start off tonight's program talking about how is your gaming week.
135629	151461	And unfortunately, none of us were able to go to E3 this year, so we didn't get to do that, but we'll be talking a lot about that and giving our opinions on things as, you know, outsiders looking in, as well as really relying on your comments as well to kind of let us know what you thought of this year's E3.
151521	154463	But what kind of games did you play this week since you weren't at E3?
154503	155764	DarkSakura?
156685	161649	Well, I tried to play some Power, Power, Paradise, got as far as getting everything set up and then left the room.
162264	163284	Which we'll be getting into that later.
166026	168367	And then I played a little bit of pinball.
169047	170628	Played some Burning Crusade.
170708	174269	Well, actually, I got as far as setting it up and then realizing I had to patch.
174669	176470	And then saying, screw this noise and not playing.
178251	182913	And I finally got my first badge in Pokemans.
185034	185754	So, yeah.
186334	188415	While I was on the recumbent bike at the gym.
189212	195856	The Recumbent Bike for people who are not gym savvy or vocabulary savvy means you sit back on your ass and pedal in front of you.
197757	199358	What was that bike, Loki?
199378	200298	You would know this better.
200339	204401	In that one episode of South Park, Mr. Garrison invented the bike.
204701	207122	It was the It, I think.
207523	208023	The It?
208443	208904	Yeah, remember?
208964	210364	Because it was a parody of...
212625	213045	DarkSakura.com
238184	239084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
268513	269093	Bob, get me one.
269754	269874	No.
271836	272056	Please.
272196	272856	I don't have money.
273397	273817	Oh, okay.
274798	276699	Getting you presents requires money that I don't have.
276799	278200	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
278921	282564	I meant to play all the E3 demos that were available on Xbox Live.
282744	283745	I just never got around to it.
283785	286807	I got around to downloading them, just not playing them.
286947	288368	So that wasn't really helpful.
290530	290850	I did
292911	320107	I played more Saints Row multiplayer because we're still testing out the LAN stuff and it works great now that I actually updated all the systems to have the multiplayer patch on it so now it works awesome and it's pretty fun actually the other thing we tried was the other thing I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because yes we're still not done with the game and it's getting pretty hard now because now we have to play on Inferno um
320771	322571	So we finished a few things on that.
322831	325852	And then I'm playing more Final Fantasy on the PSP.
326872	329113	More Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories on PSP.
330213	332513	I do have stuff to play this week.
332734	340435	I just got a preview copy of Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3.
340515	341795	So I'm going to be playing that.
342596	343136	That'll be fun.
343616	346616	And then... A lot of folks liked the last game that came out in that series.
347597	348757	Yeah, so it should be pretty good.
348777	348817	Um...
350592	352273	Oh, that's pretty much it for right now.
352673	358495	I'm looking, hopefully this week, Paper Mario is going to be making its way out on our virtual console because it's everywhere else.
358615	361676	But, you know, I want to play that now.
361876	363197	Because Super Paper Mario is pretty fun.
363737	366458	And I hear it's not really much different than the original Paper Mario.
367178	370860	But do you have information to back that up that is definitely coming out here Monday?
370900	371960	Or are you just speculating?
372160	372800	I'm just guessing.
372820	373300	All right.
373681	374041	Fair enough.
374501	374601	So.
375325	376466	Thanks for watching!
396118	404140	But I found in Blue Dragon, before you enter the room to start fighting monsters, you really have to just read these wall of words that talk about the game and how the battle system works.
404160	405440	And that doesn't really do it for me.
405520	411062	I like it when you fight a fight, and then somebody comes in helping explain it to you as you're fighting.
411462	414182	I don't know, maybe I'm just... It might be just because it's the demo.
414383	415723	I'm hoping, I'm really hoping.
416163	422144	And I would never want to base my judgment of an entire game off a demo, but it was very hard for me to get into for that reason.
422364	424505	I felt like I wasn't really understanding everything that was going on.
424841	426801	But it does seem to have a pretty cool combat system.
426861	434323	It's somewhat a real-time system, but you can have your attack stronger if you wait longer.
434583	435623	It's interesting.
436343	437684	So I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.
437744	442845	I'm such a fan of the Japanese RPGs, especially I'm interested in the products that Mistwalker's putting out.
442885	446565	I'm at least going to rent the darn game if I don't buy it.
446605	448786	That and Eternal Sonata and the other stuff that's coming.
448806	450066	I hear it's three this long.
450706	451506	Blue Dragon, really?
451706	451946	Yeah.
452166	452947	I thought it was only two.
453167	453967	I thought it was three.
454147	454747	Oh, well, well.
456854	457394	So there's that.
457595	463879	And as well, I downloaded Sonic on Arcade, which was a little silly because I have Sonic on the Wii as well.
463919	470803	But I just kind of wanted to try it out to sort of see, okay, what's the differences between the emulating on the Wii and the emulating on the Xbox 360?
470843	476827	And I'll tell you, the Xbox 360 one is actually a little bit better because it's not just a straight-up port.
477227	481930	I mean, playing the Wii one does feel like you've whipped out your Genesis and hooked it up and you're playing the real deal.
482210	484692	But the Xbox 360 one, you can kind of not only have that,
485715	488458	Just a straight up emulation, but you can do the screen resizing.
488758	493183	You can do the smoothing graphics, which, although it's an option, I don't think it looks that good.
493504	494925	You have the online leaderboards.
494945	497888	I don't know, there's a lot of little extra things that are kind of cool.
498569	507098	And to my mind, it's a better value for $5 on the Xbox 360 than the $8 it is on the Wii, because of the fact that it was a Genesis title.
507819	513465	I have to say if you didn't buy Sonic on the Wii and you're a fan of the series you should definitely check out Sonic on the 360.
514426	521293	Golden Axe I checked out as well but the problem is that Golden Axe is one of those things that was much cooler when we were kids.
522502	535875	For me anyway, the original Golden Axe was much cooler when we were kids, and yes, I know it's got a great ending and everything, and the game was so much fun to play, co-op, but I just don't see the magic there in this day and age playing it on the Xbox 360.
536235	543242	The game's very repetitive to me, and I think it's just one of those things that was much cooler, watching the magic and everything when I was younger.
544147	551540	Other than that, I was going to say, no, I'm really disappointed they haven't brought to live arcade yet is the Gauntlet Legends series.
551981	552943	That would have been cool.
553576	554416	I've tried Gauntlet.
554757	557398	Not a big fan of the original Gauntlet.
557438	560119	But Gauntlet Legends, you just go play that at the arcade all the time.
560219	561280	Gauntlet Legends was pretty rad.
561300	564421	I had the port on the N64 they made of that, and I had a lot of fun with that.
564701	566262	Because that was a good party game as well.
567523	572965	Going to the chat room and looking at comments there, Peeker Uno says, Sonic is actually a lot harder than I remembered it to be.
573445	575326	Yeah, I kind of am finding the same thing.
575747	576047	I don't know.
576107	578788	I'm finding this game is a lot harder than I remember it.
580466	583394	I used to be better at video games when I was a kid than I am now in my old age.
584958	586743	Looking to see what other comments there are.
586763	587465	Yeah, DarkSakura?
587981	588221	Gauntlet 64
613052	613852	I'll give you this.
614092	618574	I think going back and playing a game like Gauntlet is much more fun with four people.
618894	619994	Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
620034	623576	When you have everybody there playing all the old school stuff, that's fun.
623616	627137	But I don't have a lot of friends, so I don't get to play the old school.
627157	629218	You know, we didn't play Super Metroid on Thursday.
629238	629838	We didn't.
629918	630358	We didn't.
630908	632969	So you had to play Super Metroid with me this week.
633469	633910	Absolutely.
633930	635650	You know, it's funny you mention that because I did play.
636031	637251	I had jury duty this week.
637591	637972	Suck.
637992	638652	Poor Rob.
638812	639352	It's okay.
639372	641693	Yeah, they called me back 13 months after I was there before.
641753	644775	Long-time listeners of OLR may remember I was on like a two-week case last year.
645495	648217	But I went back this year and thank God I didn't get called.
648237	651258	But I had to sit around all day long waiting to see if they'd call me.
651698	657081	I played Metroid Zero Mission like all day, which, you know, is the next best thing to Super Metroid.
657741	659782	on the Game Boy Advance, or in my case, the DS.
660142	668304	But all I could play was the one Advance game I had in the slot because I lost the stylus to my DS fat, which my DS Lite was uncharged.
668384	668784	Fuck that.
668844	669564	Use your finger.
669584	670324	That's what I'd be doing.
671705	672125	Screw it.
672385	673345	Finger works just as well.
673365	674385	Metro Zero Mission is pretty awesome.
674405	675986	I didn't want to play Puzzle Buster.
676026	680427	I know originally you're thinking, hey, oh, crap, it's going to get the screen all messed up and stuff.
680467	680947	Now, fuck it.
680967	681307	Who cares?
681327	682368	You can just rub it on your shirt.
682408	682828	It's all good.
684401	699550	SSJ100 Matt says wow back to jury duty yeah unfortunately Pauly Shore wasn't there though or you know what those pencils that they make you fill out the forms or pens or whatever the fuck that they have use one of those just fucking turn that shit around or I don't know pen cap or something get creative
700305	703507	Alright, so that's pretty much all the games I really played this week.
703567	709770	So some new stuff, thanks to the marketplace, and some old stuff, thanks to my lack of a stylist for the DS.
709970	730020	I played one more game this week, and it's kind of, we'll get into later on with some other discussion, but I played Motorstorm again, and apparently there's a code out there now that unlocks everything, so I did that, thinking, hey, you know, it's been a while since I played this, I got frustrated with how hard the game was, you know, certain races, your bike, or whatever, the physics were really bugging me.
731624	732844	I don't like Motorstorm anymore.
733044	734245	I think it's actually really boring.
734925	738407	And, you know, before it was pretty good, but now it's just kind of dumb.
738527	741628	I seem to recall this is the second week in a row you've changed your mind on a game.
741688	743389	Have you gotten finicky in your older age?
743549	752914	I don't know, but, you know, I know later on we'll probably be talking... Well, last week we talked about the 88 system or whatever that they were releasing for the PlayStation 3 with Motorstorm bundled in.
754269	756412	I would rather it be Resistance, I think.
756472	759236	Just Motorstorm, it's a cool game.
759737	762522	When the demo was out and stuff, everyone was like, oh, I gotta get the game.
763383	767870	But then you play it, and it's just the layout's not very good, and the races are kind of, eh, I don't know.
769193	770495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
786772	788173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
805720	811504	The Breakfast is provided by the staff and the shuttles going from hotel to hotel and everything.
811564	815467	We're kind of trying to look at, okay, so how does everybody else feel that wasn't there at E3?
815507	819530	Because we're the ones that are really going to be buying all this stuff that they were selling.
819871	829218	This is going to be kind of weird, but overall, in general, the layout and the way that they did E3 this year, I actually like it more than I did the original E3.
830748	831469	Thanks for watching!
850646	851387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
867348	869670	Listen to his show, Bobby Blackwell's show, and all that stuff.
870010	878395	So here's what he said on his show this week, is that apparently he was talking to somebody, and the reason why they had to keep E3 in LA this year was because of contracts.
878715	888301	They had already signed a contract with the city to have this convention, and it's all basically based on the number of hotel nights they guarantee that the city's going to get from it.
888322	890363	You know, it's kind of about, you know, the...
893232	895913	Kickback on the revenue, thank you, for the city that they're going to get from this.
896233	903157	Well, the thing is, this is why they're going to have E4ALL, is because they moved E3 to Santa Monica, which is still in L.A.
903197	905037	County, and made it a smaller event.
905378	910200	But E4ALL was supposed to pick up consumers now and bring in revenue from that.
910240	912721	So they were still going to meet their numbers that they originally signed off to.
913181	915142	But according to Bobby in his show this week,
916179	922081	E3 is, or E for All, I should say, is not living up to expectations as far as the pre-sales are concerned.
922481	925382	And not a lot of companies are really interested in going at this point.
925642	927323	Nintendo's really the only one that's on board.
927363	928543	Microsoft, don't give a shit.
929303	933505	So there is a strong chance that they may opt to take the fine.
934142	935204	and just cancel E4ALL.
935444	941852	There's a very strong chance that E4ALL is just going to get axed in favor of just paying a fine and saying, cut our losses.
942152	949862	But that would mean E3, if it continues next year, which may not happen, ESA may just back out of the show biz altogether.
950222	952866	If the ESA backs out of this, then...
953644	977545	either the ESA is going to back out or E3 is going to move to another city and of course we've heard rumors that Vegas is a possibility San Francisco San Francisco is freaking expensive I don't care, Sacramento damn cheap yeah that's true, San Francisco is probably just as expensive as LA and worse traffic Sacramento, it's dirt cheap come on you can come out here and burn to death
978564	978864	Good luck.
978884	981005	I know it's like 106 degrees this whole week.
981025	983686	This is really a minor summer in comparison.
983806	985546	But Sacramento, then I can go.
985967	986587	San Jose.
986747	988287	That's a good idea, San Jose.
989388	990248	I'd go to Vegas.
990748	991788	You guys afraid of planes?
991828	993609	San Jose or Santa Clara would be pretty good, too.
993769	995510	Middle Silicon Valley.
995530	995910	We'll see.
997390	999531	Anyway, I hope E4ALL didn't get canceled.
999551	1004173	I was kind of looking forward to going, but then again, if there's not going to be much support, maybe I shouldn't be so excited.
1004373	1004793	I don't know.
1005153	1008134	It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few days and what the fallout is.
1010502	1012583	Floridine says, what about PAX?
1013244	1020350	Penny Arcade Expo, of course, you know, a lot of folks see PAX as kind of one of those expos that's stepping up to kind of fill in the void left by the old E3.
1020830	1024613	Bandit in chat.orangealtradio.com says, fuck E3, I can't wait for X0708.
1025073	1027115	Hmm.
1027155	1029797	Anyway, I just wanted to share that little tidbit rumor thing with you guys.
1030158	1031319	Other housekeeping tonight.
1031439	1031759	Oh, yes.
1032159	1036543	One thing is that I think that I'm going to adopt Dark Tetsuya's nickname for Kaz Harai.
1037407	1038247	and Captain Crayola.
1061893	1066536	and we're going to be putting that on our live journal and MySpace and I guess Facebook communities.
1066576	1075161	Basically any Orange Lounge Radio community will post the link to the MP3 but because of the fact that we also talk about E3 and that and even though it's a little more
1076192	1076792	I don't know how to phrase it.
1076812	1079413	It's going to be a little more lax than even what you're going to hear tonight.
1079953	1084374	Because of kind of the duplicate news there, we're not going to post the same show to the feed.
1084434	1085775	So it's out there.
1086035	1088536	But it was kind of our initial reactions to a lot of the E3 news.
1088556	1090096	And there were some funny jokes that came out of it.
1090116	1093037	So if you're a fan of OLR, definitely check out the bonus show this week.
1094109	1095910	and I think that's about all I wanted to say for housekeeping.
1096050	1097111	So let's kick it off.
1097171	1097591	Let's start.
1098211	1100453	First press conference at E3 this week was Microsoft.
1100533	1102234	So let's start with some Microsoft news.
1102554	1106396	So Microsoft, they had a lot of bombs to drop, of course, and this isn't
1106886	1108027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1131428	1131829	Thanks for watching!
1142685	1144926	We're not telling you yet, but soon.
1145086	1152489	But the answer is $30 more than what it should cost because of the Halo propaganda that will be splattered all over this thing, right?
1152589	1152969	Am I right?
1153730	1154030	I guess.
1154310	1156271	But, I mean, this only joins, you know, what?
1156311	1161993	There are two custom controllers that they have right now with Todd McFarlane art and, you know, collectible figurines.
1162373	1165515	You know, a wireless headset and...
1167208	1171231	Also, their points cards, I believe, their three-month cards are now Halo-themed.
1171331	1173353	It's just, it's overload is what it is.
1174274	1175535	But hey, people will buy it.
1176415	1177656	Halo 3 saturation.
1177696	1180879	GS191 in chat says, that's one ugly Xbox 360.
1181239	1182941	I agree, it was ugly.
1183341	1185022	Okay, I don't think it was that ugly.
1185082	1185823	It's not that bad.
1185863	1186644	But here's the thing, though.
1187004	1195691	If you're really looking to buy an Elite or something because of the HDMI, but you don't really want to spend the $479, this might be a cheaper alternative for you.
1196702	1198803	Donate the money to OLR.
1198823	1199803	We'll make good use out of the money.
1224622	1227685	Maybe it can send us to Vegas for next year's E3, I don't know.
1227745	1242280	Well, here's the thing, I would just wait and see, because later on they're going to be dropping the price of the 360 anyways, and I want to bet that maybe they're going to add HDMI to all of the Xbox 360s at some point, because I believe the Elite is only a limited time thing anyways.
1244178	1251220	Alright, well, for the record, I actually have a Halo 2 Xbox 360 or a Halo, I'm sorry, a Halo Xbox minus the 360.
1251920	1252620	And they're pretty.
1253020	1254501	They're green and you can see through them.
1254541	1256561	They're green and see through.
1256601	1258322	When our first Xbox died, that's what we got.
1258722	1261082	Compared to, like, the first Xbox was ugly.
1261822	1263803	So the Halo one was kind of cool.
1263823	1266123	But this gray one doesn't do it for me, I have to say.
1266404	1267504	It's not gray, it's green.
1268044	1268484	Whatever.
1269104	1269704	Gray-green.
1270965	1271965	It looks like the color of
1272805	1273786	I don't know.
1273806	1274566	It's translucent.
1275127	1276067	It looks like violence.
1276447	1276707	Whatever.
1276727	1277548	And violence sells.
1278569	1280130	I'm not buying this 360.
1280370	1281791	I don't need HDMI that badly.
1282671	1284532	I already have an Elite anyway, so I don't care.
1284552	1288895	And if I want my HDMI, I'll just play my PS3.
1290096	1294778	Anyway, though, speaking of HD, this is kind of cool.
1295659	1300702	Disney is actually going to have their movies available in high definition through the download service.
1301533	1302535	X-Box Live Marketplace
1310649	1322558	I thought that was kind of interesting, too, for that exact same reason, is that Disney's been kind of Blu-ray oriented, but now here they go with the Xbox service, where Xbox has kind of been with HD DVD, but I guess it's really apples to oranges.
1322578	1323419	You can't really compare the two.
1323459	1325421	Yeah, but I think Disney's both, actually.
1325581	1327442	They do both Blu-ray and HD DVD.
1327782	1330004	No, they're exclusive to Blu-ray.
1330745	1331725	There's a few that do both.
1331805	1332266	However...
1333084	1333765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1354110	1356511	I don't see why it's win-win for them.
1356751	1362652	And when you hear Disney put their movies on Xbox 360, my mind automatically goes to the animated classics.
1362712	1365473	And I go, ooh, I can go download The Little Mermaid on my 360.
1366093	1367634	But it's not quite like that, right?
1367854	1369874	Actually, there are some of the stuff on there.
1369914	1374516	Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet.
1374536	1375676	It was a crap movie anyway.
1376519	1379121	Well, this is just their initial offering.
1379141	1380042	Tarzan was okay.
1380262	1381923	When they put Tron on there, though, let me know.
1381983	1384165	But having Rosie O'Donnell as a gorilla was pretty funny.
1385066	1387368	If they did Tron HD, ha!
1387868	1394053	Heck, ooh, maybe they will in time because we know we're getting the games on Xbox Live Marketplace, so maybe, maybe.
1394614	1401399	Anyway, but I just want to say it's a lot of Disney subsidiaries as well, like Miramax and Touchtone are putting their movies out, too.
1401699	1402500	Clerks, please.
1402620	1404161	Clerks animated series, please.
1405682	1406243	All right, anyhow.
1407179	1415085	Also, what you will be able to download soon on Xbox Live Arcade are a lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games.
1415446	1427056	They showed this little trailer at E3 that showed a whole lot of new Xbox Live Arcade games, including the stuff that you can now download right away, Sonic the Hedgehog and Golden Axe, but here's some new stuff that's coming out.
1427416	1429738	Next week is Bomberman Live, they've already announced that.
1430353	1436038	Undertow, Hexic 2, which is, am I, is that the, that was the sequel to Hexen, right?
1436618	1437819	That's the sequel to Hexic.
1439401	1442123	Oh, Hexen was the sequel to Heretic.
1442764	1444325	Ah, crap, never mind, okay.
1444365	1445946	Hexen, you could turn people into chickens.
1446447	1446647	Damn it.
1446667	1447367	That was great.
1447447	1452712	Because when I first saw that, I was like, oh, because I thought it was like the sequel to the Doom game, but I'm just stupid.
1453192	1458617	Okay, then we have War World, Sensible World of Soccer, Every Extent Extra Extreme.
1458997	1483084	Gion, Wing Commander Arena, Feeding Frenzy 2, Track and Field, Spyglass Board Games, Space Giraffe, Puzzle Fighter 2, HD Turbo Remix, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah Marathon, Poker Smash, Switch Ball, Tetris Splash, Puzzle Quest Switch Ball is supposed to be just like Marvel Madness, apparently And that doesn't mention the Battlestar Galactica game either, which, per Kotaku, sucks
1483840	1487983	So that's kind of sad, if the Battlestar Galactica game sucks, because I was really looking forward to that.
1488003	1491805	Wing Commander game sucks too, from what I hear, so stop making space combat arena games.
1492526	1492986	Sadness.
1494247	1504934	What they should be making is more space RPGs, like Mass Effect, which is coming in November, and is supposed to be the, you know, I guess the cat's meow, or whatever you would say.
1505154	1507636	It's gonna be fucking awesome, is basically it.
1508176	1509997	And it should be, you know, it's Bioware.
1510017	1510057	Um...
1511545	1517790	Also coming in September will be Project Gotham Racing 4, which in itself is also pretty impressive.
1519871	1522193	I don't know, Project Gotham Racing 3 was pretty cool.
1523394	1524495	I don't know if I'll get 4, though.
1524595	1525876	I can't control the cars in that.
1525936	1526876	I suck at those type of games.
1526956	1527957	I keep crashing into walls.
1528478	1529198	I don't know how to drive.
1531140	1533241	Yeah, I get all woman when I play those games.
1533822	1534402	I can't drive.
1536311	1536631	Die.
1537472	1538432	But Mass Effect.
1538912	1540653	I looked at the trailer for Mass Effect.
1541274	1542254	I think I got a semi.
1542274	1544315	That was a real hot trailer.
1544335	1545536	That game looks awesome.
1545676	1555341	When you saw Mass Effect, didn't you... For like a half a second, I thought, you know, Phantasy Star Online could have been this good if they had actually tried.
1556021	1558502	This is like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.
1559503	1564025	But instead, Phantasy Star Online gave us... Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
1564045	1564766	Na, na.
1568779	1571980	Sorry, please listen to the theme of Phantasy Star Online if you don't get my joke.
1572601	1575082	Or Phantasy Star Universe, whatever the hell it is.
1575782	1577323	But no, Mass Effect looks great.
1577523	1586626	It looks like V, or some type of epic miniseries movie that's coming soon to the SyFy Network, but in HD.
1586746	1587687	It's going to be pretty epic, too.
1587707	1590768	This is only the first of the trilogy, I believe, for it.
1591443	1594744	So it will be a pretty long story, and hell, just make a movie out of it.
1594764	1596265	I mean, it looks like a movie already, so.
1596945	1601207	I heard that the conversation style in it's really cool.
1601227	1603308	Like, you use the thumbsticks to talk live.
1603688	1609390	Like, you basically have to choose an option while the other person's kind of talking or whatever, and then that can have an effect on the conversation.
1609470	1610471	So that sounds kind of neat.
1610691	1614673	I say they take the Mass Effect engine and give us another space quest.
1617594	1619214	I guess anything is possible.
1619295	1620315	Who knows what might happen?
1622501	1627303	Well, there's actually a good thing that's going to happen for our friends overseas.
1628403	1639248	In Europe, the Xbox 360 Elite will be out on the 24th of August, which actually was released, the information was released at E3, of course.
1640088	1642389	There's not a price listed.
1642649	1646111	The speculation is that it will be close to what it cost over here in the U.S.,
1647887	1650908	So congratulations to Europe, even though you have to wait for things a little later.
1650948	1652768	At least you're finally getting your Xbox 360 Elite.
1653748	1654288	If you want it.
1654608	1655669	If you want it, yeah, if you care.
1655909	1660230	And if you can find it, because I know the ones over here are practically sold out everywhere.
1660410	1662470	Make friends with people who work at video game shops.
1662730	1666391	I guess producing that larger hard drive is a real challenge out there.
1667151	1670852	Slapping that laptop drive into a little case.
1671512	1671672	Wee.
1672791	1677654	Well, one thing you might play on your new Xbox 360 Elite is Seen It.
1677874	1684918	Of course, this was a big announcement that Microsoft made at their press conference this year, is that they're going to be putting out a casual game called Seen It.
1685218	1686559	Now, you might have heard of Seen It before.
1686599	1689861	It's a really popular DVD board game.
1689901	1693803	Like, I don't know if they have this outside of the U.S., if they have this in other countries.
1694143	1696385	Basically, it's a board game, and you play it with a DVD.
1696445	1697265	I've played this before.
1697786	1699827	You watch, like, little...
1700507	1701388	Like, you know, didn't...
1722176	1726860	Well, I guess Uno was another attempt, but what have we really had since Uno?
1727221	1730944	It's like pure casual, maybe the solitaire game, I don't know.
1731124	1733927	But nothing's really caught on like Uno has.
1734187	1734928	Well, maybe Hold'em.
1735268	1735929	I guess I'll give you that.
1737130	1748140	But I think if you really want to reach the casual gaming audience, make your system a lot cheaper, and then they will come because of the price cuts, because it'll look more attractive, but
1749360	1749700	There you go.
1749740	1755985	There's a new controller, by the way, that will come with CNET, and it's a controller so simple that even your grandma can use it.
1756125	1760028	It's one giant button and four little buttons to use for the answers.
1760368	1764191	And apparently the game is going to come with four of these controllers, which is kind of interesting.
1764652	1770816	The funny thing, too, is it's ripped off of the controller from the Buzz game series, which looks almost identical to that one.
1772495	1773075	Viva Piñata Party Animals
1793198	1794640	And that's due out in November.
1795361	1797383	Also, they announced some other stuff.
1797823	1800566	Some more games will be joining the Games for Windows lineup.
1801067	1802909	Gears of War and Viva Pinata.
1803669	1813400	Gears of War is actually supposed to have some additional content for it as well, which I imagine would be probably downloadable here on the Xbox 360, probably around the same time.
1814921	1815081	And...
1816264	1822966	Call of Duty 4, they announced that they're going to be doing an exclusive online beta with Xbox 360.
1823706	1829767	No details on what's going to be involved with that since they haven't launched these signups yet.
1830267	1834328	But hopefully we'll know more about that soon since the game does come out in November.
1835548	1842130	The other thing, which kind of joining the whole multiple colored accessories trend here,
1843850	1846273	Pink and Blue Controllers in October
1860939	1868125	And then if you didn't have a chance to go to E3, there are some pretty cool stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for you.
1868145	1876793	Some new demos including Blue Dragon, Ace Combat 6, NCAA Football 08, Stuntman Ignition, The Bigs, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
1879568	1884572	So let's go around and talk about Microsoft's press conference and sort of your guys' reaction to it.
1885172	1887453	And I'll pose this question to chat as well.
1887473	1888514	We'll read some of your comments.
1888974	1891716	Were you happy with Microsoft's conference?
1892056	1893918	Was there more you were looking for?
1894538	1898801	And if you could, like, I don't know, I'll throw this totally arbitrary thing out there.
1898821	1901723	If you could rate the press conference on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?
1902303	1905365	So I'm going to say this right off the bat, and I think this goes for all of us.
1905645	1908267	Where was the anticipated price cut?
1909175	1909655	It was indisposed.
1909776	1910096	Interesting.
1910136	1910576	Interesting.
1928889	1932852	They hinted that they will be making an announcement closer to the fall.
1933433	1936175	Well, I think we might have more on that later in the show, so we'll see.
1937396	1939757	Anyway, Loki, did you like it?
1939797	1940878	Did you not like the conference?
1941018	1941939	What would you say?
1942179	1946002	I would say that they set an example of what their conferences should be like.
1946082	1951006	It's basically, they said, here, all the games we're going to show you are going to be coming out this year.
1951846	1953268	That's how you fucking do it.
1953508	1956290	You say, here's our lineup for this fall.
1957023	1959204	Get excited, it's going to be out in a few months.
1959984	1963545	As opposed to certain other companies that said, here's what's coming out.
1965105	1970487	I forgot to mention that most of that's going to be next year, late next year, if not later.
1970607	1971047	Stuff like that.
1971487	1976049	I thought that they really hit the nail on the head with that stuff.
1976429	1979010	There's not really much more I could want from it.
1979570	1986692	It was a little bit disappointing that certain games were announced also coming to their platform, but they're going to have a really solid lineup
1987967	1996614	There are really certain other publishers and hardware makers are going to have a hard time catching up if something magical doesn't happen in the fourth quarter.
1997955	2001257	So I would say probably give them an 8 or 9.
2002018	2002338	All right.
2002998	2005720	DarkSakura, care to give your two cents on what happened?
2007041	2011945	Well, given that you two covered most of my same thought on it, really...
2014884	2037107	I don't know, I'm still in, I actually, I think that they are going to do the, I think actually I agree that it was smart for them not to announce a price drop, that if they put something like that more out public around Christmas, or, you know, right after Thanksgiving, you know, for the Christmas rush, then that will, I think, be more of a reason for consumers to go out and get one then.
2038038	2044644	I don't think there's a need that they... They don't need to really announce a price cut right now anyways because they're going into a really strong fourth quarter.
2045184	2049428	And it's not like that their system's not number one selling right now in the United States.
2049968	2052410	They don't really need any extra momentum right now.
2052691	2056954	They need to see what the fourth quarter's like and then right at the prime moment, boom!
2057074	2059316	And then just hit the Christmas rush right there.
2059717	2061098	And I think that's what they're going to end up doing.
2063200	2065221	Okay, well, I guess my thoughts on it... I...
2066448	2066768	I don't know.
2066868	2071629	I kind of would like to know what's going to be the big thing that I should be excited about after Halo 3.
2072469	2075530	I was kind of hoping there might be a little hint of what's to come in 2008.
2075910	2078230	I mean, I guess I understand the strategy of putting all the cards on the table.
2078250	2078431	What?
2078751	2079071	They did.
2079131	2080351	They were talking about Halo Wars.
2080371	2082991	They were talking about Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect.
2083532	2084512	Mass Effect is this year.
2084992	2086372	I know, but it's after Halo 3.
2087772	2088033	All right.
2088133	2091433	I mean, Grand Theft Auto 4, Beautiful Katamari.
2091673	2094454	I mean, there's a big lineup that's not just Halo 3.
2095475	2096376	Thank you for watching!
2112250	2113351	Yeah, I figured they'd show that.
2113371	2119896	It was all stuff that was previously announced, and the stuff that they, this is the first time we're announcing, Viva Piñata Party, and I was like, I don't fucking care.
2120176	2126621	I mean, the CNET thing is a good effort, I suppose, but it's not enough to make you go, wow, you're really gonna win with that.
2126641	2132646	I was like, ooh, it's neat, because, you know, I'm in the movie industry, so, you know, oh, that's kinda neat, that'd be kinda fun to play at work.
2133106	2135728	I wasn't thinking, ooh, I gotta go get me one of those.
2135908	2137289	No, I don't think so.
2138270	2140352	I would maybe rate the conference like a
2142324	2159209	6.5, I don't know, it's better than Middle of the Road, but not by much, like, there was nothing that made me go, like, hooray, you know, or, like, maybe give me a gamer fangasm, it was mostly, okay, I figured that was coming, I figured that was coming, I figured that was coming, so, that's just me personally, let's go to chat, let's see what some chat folks thought there.
2159802	2161423	Lots of you guys here in chat commenting on it.
2161924	2166387	DJ Tyrant says, Microsoft's conference should have addressed the rings of death issue much, much more.
2166707	2169849	No, what do they need to... Why would they bring attention to that?
2169869	2171170	Why would they even need to address that?
2171210	2172310	They've already addressed that.
2172351	2174112	I'm just reading someone else's thoughts.
2174132	2175953	Well, I'm answering to that.
2175993	2176593	We're expanding.
2176793	2178455	Listen, I'm expanding on this, okay?
2178575	2182257	And I'm tired of people complaining about it, and no, I'm not a fucking Microsoft fanboy.
2182297	2182898	But here's the thing.
2183278	2184519	They're dealing with the problem.
2184919	2189502	Your consoles now have a three-year warranty on them from the announcement date.
2189882	2196107	They're going to fix any of them for free, and they've already fixed the problem in new consoles being manufactured right now.
2196627	2200170	So, what part of it are they not doing anything about?
2200270	2201091	That's what I want to know.
2201471	2209217	There's no reason to even mention that stuff, because, okay, and actually Peter Moore did announce, okay, yeah, we made a mistake, but we're taking care of it.
2209937	2210578	Alright, enough said.
2211218	2217263	SSJ100Matt says, Microsoft Prince Conference was basically the status quo, not that many surprises, B in my mind.
2218547	2220988	I think the status quo would be a C. No, that's all right.
2222229	2224591	In the gaming industry, we always inflate scores a little bit, right?
2226592	2226952	Let's see.
2227232	2230274	DDRDollarBill says, I wish achievement points meant something.
2230975	2234717	Like, you know, whatever happened to the whole... You win a no prize.
2235217	2236438	But what happened to the whole thing?
2236458	2242521	Like, remember they had the Old Spice Inflate Your Gamer Score Challenge, and, you know, you could win, like, actual... Like, whatever happened to that?
2242602	2243242	Like, it just kind of...
2244108	2248532	I agree, they need a little boost there.
2248932	2253856	That could have been something that they could have talked about that might have gotten me a little more excited, I don't know.
2254957	2257799	TheRobD says, I gotta agree with Loki on Microsoft's press conference.
2257819	2259820	This is a good example of how they should do a press conference.
2260221	2262302	I just wish they would have announced some worthwhile stuff.
2263323	2265865	DJ Dark Knight says, Call of Duty 4 totally won me over.
2267466	2272110	And ShadowNextGen disagrees with RobD and says, I thought Microsoft announced a great lineup.
2272910	2273991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2292870	2293470	So there you go.
2293990	2295371	There's a wrap-up on Microsoft.
2295391	2310034	Now, before we get into some of the other companies, I want to ask real quick, because we didn't really cover it in the Gaming Week, but we did talk about how we were at SAC Anime, and I wanted to ask DarkSakura kind of how the rest of the convention went, and if you met any listeners of the program, or what kind of stuff was there game-wise, or what you did.
2310154	2314055	I walked in with my Dolphy this morning and got attacked by Dolphy people.
2314815	2319476	So hi, everybody that I met at the convention who was into Dolphys.
2320308	2322830	and my poor doll got petted quite a bit.
2323471	2324332	And that was really it.
2324372	2325393	And then I bought a Dalek.
2327355	2328215	Exterminate.
2328276	2329717	I spent most of the time in the dealer's room.
2331278	2334601	But I'd have to say that I didn't watch any anime.
2336103	2338325	I didn't really meet anybody except for Warrior Bob.
2339005	2339986	And Andrew was there.
2341608	2342589	And I bought a Dalek.
2343109	2343870	And I bought a Heartless.
2344731	2345031	Plushie.
2345703	2349324	because this is not what conventions are about, buying crap just because you want it.
2349404	2355867	I bought a Starman keychain for Mario and a boo and a coin box and a fire flower.
2356047	2360049	Not a bad-sized convention for this town, considering we just had a big one in the Bay Area.
2360109	2364290	It was actually better than the Japan Town Anime Fair, actually.
2364330	2367591	The only good thing about the Japan Town Anime Fair is that they had better cosplay.
2368092	2369752	There was good cosplay, don't get me wrong.
2370393	2371373	Sack anime is going to grow.
2371946	2372946	It's gonna be bigger.
2372966	2375287	We're gonna have a real, real big convention.
2375367	2376187	Everybody was great.
2376227	2378267	The staff was fantastic.
2379627	2383488	Honestly, I was very ill-prepared for it, given that I've just come off Fanime.
2384208	2389369	So, I think that, you know, with... Yeah, I almost cosplayed the Doctor.
2389609	2390329	Shadow Next Gen.
2390449	2396350	I wish I had thought about the free donuts and orange juice earlier, so we could have promoted that and maybe got a few more people in there.
2396750	2398471	You know, we had a bad time.
2398951	2401111	That's my only complaint, is that we had a bad time for the panel.
2402014	2402875	And these guys are suckers.
2403255	2404877	They'll fill in that one time slot no one wants.
2404917	2405537	It was good, though.
2427805	2428786	Next year, primetime.
2430247	2431749	Wow, you guys are turning into divas.
2432930	2435673	No, we want to seriously say thanks for having us.
2435913	2442359	I love A1 Comics now, even though they're local, because I got my Dalek for a lot less expensive than eBay had it.
2442839	2446142	That's probably the same one I saw in their store that I called to tell you about.
2446222	2446683	Oh, how funny.
2447210	2449391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2474170	2475031	Anyhow, let's move on.
2475051	2482696	Before we get into Nintendo's conference, let's talk release dates real quick, because we like to cover what's going to be coming out in the gaming world with our release dates.
2483136	2483937	Jamie, why don't you start us off?
2484597	2490261	Well, for our friends in the UK, we have a few things coming out within this week.
2491502	2500147	On the 18th, we have Bomberman Live for Xbox 360, and the 20th, we have The Darkness, Transformers the Game, and Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.
2500908	2501248	That's it.
2502702	2504063	Momotaro Densetsu 16 Train Conductor
2524362	2525463	One of those simulation games.
2525503	2526123	That looks cute.
2526763	2533546	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, Shonen Oyoji Tsubasa Yoima Ten Ikare is coming out on July 19, 2007.
2535107	2538088	Looks like a little adventure game, probably based off yet another anime.
2538929	2551494	You know this series, Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3 is coming out on the PlayStation 2, also on July 19, although I believe that is simply a price reduction, not just a brand new game.
2551514	2552295	But hey, it's Ultraman.
2552315	2552855	I had to mention it.
2553838	2557941	Cinnamon Ball, Kurukuru Sweets Paradise I had a Batsumaru pillow once
2581331	2582271	I love Batsumaru.
2582311	2582711	It's my favorite.
2582731	2584072	I gave it to my friend in Texas.
2584652	2591294	And since we just talked about an anime convention, of course we have to mention that there is yet another Naruto game coming out.
2592134	2598015	Saikyo Ninja Daishu 5 is coming out on the DS July 19th as well.
2598616	2599576	Another Naruto game.
2599636	2600216	Bet you can't wait.
2600996	2601316	All of you.
2601696	2603117	I can wait and keep waiting.
2603157	2603477	Thank you.
2604379	2607920	Now this is one you don't have to be a fan of Japanese games to know this game.
2608320	2617163	Bomberman, Touch Bomberman Land, Star Bomber, No Miracle World, coming out from Hudson July 19th on the DS in Japan.
2617423	2620263	And that's all I will be mentioning this week for release dates.
2620303	2621064	So let's go to the U.S.
2621544	2621924	All right.
2622544	2626145	The U.S., you're going to be getting ready for some football because...
2626801	2633967	NCAA Football 08 is going to be coming out this week on PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation 3, and the 360.
2636189	2646538	And then of course, if you're not a fan of college football, then maybe you want to check out the new All-Pro Football 2K8, which is coming out on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
2647125	2658050	If you're not a fan of football at all, maybe you're a fan of some other sports games, including Hot Shots Tennis on PlayStation 2 and Rugby 08 on PlayStation 2, both coming out this week.
2658750	2664232	Or, let's see, on the PSP, Smash Court Tennis 3 is making its way out.
2664752	2668094	Tales of the World Radiant Mythology on the PSP.
2668914	2675577	And then just a small little game called Parappa the Rapper on the PSP is finally making its way out, which will be pretty cool.
2676326	2681671	And then, of course, on the Wii, you have absolutely nothing.
2683773	2684434	Surprise.
2684854	2685475	Surprise.
2686676	2689879	And then on the DS, absolutely nothing as well.
2690260	2691461	Well, I was wrong.
2691501	2696646	In the US, this isn't a slow game week because you named a lot of big sports titles there, especially with Madden.
2697130	2698311	NCAA Football 08 Escape from Bug Island
2716377	2716977	and Mario Strikers Charge
2734682	2735784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2751468	2764343	By the way, speaking of Naruto, bringing up the game during the Japanese release dates reminded me, did anybody catch that Xbox 360 tried to, like, at Microsoft's conference, they tried to make a big deal out of how they had, like, this exclusive Naruto game coming to the 360?
2764564	2765104	Oh, well, goody.
2765184	2767127	It was on damn near everything else.
2767187	2769149	Which was met with a resounding meh.
2770074	2773556	No, this one hasn't been on every other system.
2773696	2776477	However, it's not the only Naruto game coming out this year.
2776857	2778818	In fact, there's another one on the Wii.
2779159	2788844	There's one already that's come out, one more that's coming out on PlayStation 2, another one on the PSP, and I think a few more on the DS.
2790982	2795305	Yeah, if you don't have the Xbox 360, man, how are you going to play some Naruto games?
2795385	2796246	That's what I want to know.
2796867	2801410	TheRobD in chat says, the Naruto game on 360 is exclusive and it looks damn good.
2801670	2801970	It does.
2802331	2804172	And it's not a fighting game, I think.
2804672	2805573	Alright, well, fair enough.
2806034	2807214	We can give it a chance.
2808535	2810397	We're just teasing a little bit on the Naruto stuff.
2810477	2815060	Alright, let's check out Nintendo's press conference.
2815241	2818643	We'll go over and get some stories from Nintendo's press conference.
2819344	2819424	Um...
2820160	2820982	Super Smash Bros.
2821062	2821222	Brawl
2831829	2832349	I'm a good girl.
2832609	2835990	It's worth the wait if it's going to be good, like really good.
2836430	2838771	And it does look like it's going to be really good.
2839311	2841192	I know they've showed a stage.
2841212	2842572	I think this was in the last week or two.
2842612	2847434	They showed a stage from Animal Crossing, an Animal Crossing-inspired stage.
2847814	2849094	And that looked awesome.
2849114	2851075	But did you hear about if you play it at 8 p.m.
2851215	2851935	on Saturday?
2852175	2855616	Because the stages will change depending on the time of day that you play.
2855636	2856456	Oh, no, I know it's coming.
2856476	2857217	You play at 8 p.m.
2857317	2858737	on Saturday, you get, you know.
2859178	2860379	KK comes out and sings.
2861300	2862160	That is great.
2862781	2865142	He should be a selectable character, but only at 8 o'clock.
2866123	2867024	Did you see the other thing?
2867124	2871167	These are those types of little details that are going to make Smash Bros.
2871287	2872428	Brawl like...
2873030	2873930	I thought he was playable.
2890959	2895682	The impression I got was like, you know how in the last Brawl game you had the Pokeballs, and it was all the Pokemon that would come help?
2895843	2903388	Well, now it's Assist, and various characters will come out and help you, like the Nintendog will paw at the screen, and Dr. Right makes the skyscrapers that go boom!
2904228	2905750	But nevertheless, it's kind of neat.
2906230	2909032	I mean, but it's, what a random little tidbit, right?
2909992	2910393	I guess.
2912514	2915176	Yeah, SSJ100Magichat confirms he's not playable.
2915857	2917738	Well, I thought that he would have been a weird character.
2918345	2935019	I was surprised, that, you know, that was another thing I was surprised we didn't hear anymore of like, hey, Mega Man's gonna be in the game, or hey, you know, Sonic's gonna be in the game, although I'm pretty much guaranteed right now Sonic's gonna be in the game since, uh, they're making a Mario and Sonic game, so obviously they're gonna, that's what a lot of fans think, we'll see.
2935059	2935440	Do something.
2936645	2943673	Nintendo also announced at the conference that there is going to be a Wii Mario Kart, to no one's real big surprise.
2943753	2952542	I mean, we kind of speculated that of course there would be a new Mario Kart game coming to the Wii, but there were some surprises, and one of them was that it will be online...
2953171	2955112	Thank you, Nintendo, for hearing our prayers.
2955532	2956652	For that game, at least.
2956752	2957993	Yeah, at least for that game.
2958033	2960274	Maybe if, you know, they could have done it for some other stuff, too.
2960294	2960854	But that's okay.
2961394	2963035	At least they're starting to move in the right direction.
2963075	2967197	I mean, Mario Kart was one of the first online games on the DS, so I suppose tradition can continue.
2967577	2974259	But then they're also going to be bringing out a Wii wheel, which will be a peripheral that you can use with Mario Kart on the Wii.
2974700	2976300	And, of course, obviously... Oh, Wii!
2976560	2982283	It's a little Wii wheel that you plug your Wii mode into, and you can actually turn it like it's a regular steering wheel.
2982383	2982703	Wii!
2983383	2990887	And Loki, I know you mentioned on Saturday at the convention, they already have this type of peripheral out there, and... This has been out since launch.
2990927	2999011	They've got two really shitty-ass Ubisoft games called Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.
2999551	3002773	And let me tell you, it comes with a crappy wheel just like this.
3002853	3004533	Basically, you snap the controller in.
3004914	3011737	It serves no purpose other than, oh, I can't imagine that the remote's a wheel, so I need an actual wheel in front of me to turn it.
3012217	3014038	So then you play the game with that.
3014178	3015639	Okay, granted, okay, I'll give them this.
3016280	3022123	It is free, but it's a gimmick to sell the game, just like it was a gimmick to sell those two other games.
3022604	3023584	And I'm going to tell you this much.
3024285	3034151	I will not play it with the damn wheel, and thank God they're going to have multiple control options, because I fucking hate games with the Wii that require you to have the Wii remote sideways to steer it.
3034331	3038674	I like Excite Truck, where you have it, you know, flat, and then you steer it that way.
3038814	3039254	That's fine.
3041055	3043798	Blaze in our chat asks, does Excite Truck come with a wheel?
3043858	3044639	It actually does not.
3044759	3045199	It does not.
3045259	3047762	But some people use the other wheel adapter for it.
3048182	3048643	You can't.
3048923	3050705	You can't use the other wheel adapter for it.
3050845	3057792	It won't work because the actual controller needs to be held parallel to the ground and then you steer it that way.
3057872	3063057	Whereas the Ubisoft games, you have to hold the controller perpendicular to the ground and
3063630	3064531	and then turn it that way.
3064571	3066632	So it's a completely different axis that you would turn it on.
3066872	3069394	Now, Actdeft says the Ubisoft wheel is crappy.
3069454	3071475	The Wii wheel looks like it's better designed.
3071595	3073756	So, I mean, it is a Nintendo first-party product.
3074156	3075397	Okay, great.
3075477	3078039	It's a better designed piece of crap to get the Sigma controller in.
3078359	3079580	Here's the thing I have a problem with.
3079880	3082982	And we'll get into some more of this stuff with our next story.
3083482	3085523	I'm having a problem with them releasing stuff.
3085603	3094249	I thought, okay, the whole point of having the expansion port in the bottom of the Wii Remote is that we would be getting new peripherals that will plug into the bottom, other than the nunchuck.
3094649	3095470	Okay?
3095670	3098432	Which I will go into this next story here with the Zapper.
3098452	3101574	Wait, real quick, before we get to the Zapper, can I say one other thing about Mario Kart?
3102294	3109339	You couldn't see a whole lot of the actual game itself, but I did notice in the brief little bits that they showed of Mario Kart on the Wii...
3109881	3111602	There's only one person in the car.
3112042	3114462	So thank God this isn't a sequel to Double Dash.
3114682	3117523	So I will give Nintendo another few points there.
3117543	3119044	Okay.
3119304	3119964	Now you can move on.
3120324	3123105	The other thing they announced was the Wii Zapper.
3123645	3129227	Now, I remember looking at this at E3 originally, you know, last year when they had a prototype.
3129307	3137809	And that prototype looked pretty awesome because it was actually something that the Wii controller would plug into, you know, and it's a whole new peripheral.
3138382	3139722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3166448	3167108	Knock it off!
3167368	3167968	Seriously!
3168329	3170109	I mean, this thing looks like crap.
3170129	3175911	The only thing that's going to be a selling point for is it's $19.99 and it will come with a pack-in game.
3176071	3181012	So, great, you get a game for $20 and this piece of crap with it.
3181112	3186734	But, seriously, they need just... Instead of releasing something that the remote, you know...
3187409	3187930	and DarkSakura.
3211331	3216734	Just, you know, they kind of looked at these other companies out there and said, oh, look, they're making gimmicky crap and people are buying it.
3216774	3217854	Let's make some gimmicky crap.
3218755	3221396	Well, we don't want to be left out of that gravy train.
3225618	3226999	Sorry, it's just gravy train.
3228123	3231205	But isn't this, don't you think this is one of those things that you should really try?
3231765	3232025	No.
3232445	3239449	I can tell you right now, okay, if I want, I like the other one because the trigger is in the back, it was like a shotgun, you know, it would be comfortable.
3239469	3246793	It had a little analog stick above the top there, kind of like the new GunCon, and that would be comfortable to hold.
3246913	3248274	This thing looks like crap.
3248434	3254017	It's just probably because, I don't know about you guys, but right now I know nunchucks are hard to come by.
3254117	3256939	Why I don't know that they can make them fast enough is beyond me, but...
3257847	3264604	You know, obviously making any additional peripherals that have actual working parts in there would be too much for them.
3264644	3266368	Instead, molding plastic is a lot easier.
3267951	3271012	If you want to pay $20 for a piece of molded plastic, go right ahead.
3271052	3278434	But I guarantee you, playing these games without the zapper will be fucking easier and a lot better than playing it with the zapper.
3278454	3280955	And you will be sorry that you bought this product.
3281915	3282875	I don't know, Loki.
3282935	3292298	I know this isn't in our show role tonight, so I can say that there's YouTubage on the internet of the new Silent Hill arcade game because it's being location tested in Europe or something right now.
3292618	3294959	So some bootlegs of the game hit the internet and...
3295523	3296284	Thanks for watching!
3310814	3314636	I might have sex with everybody at Nintendo because that would be phenomenal.
3336578	3337558	It's just, it's crap.
3337679	3340439	I mean, there's other third-party, you know, peripherals out there.
3340459	3345361	If you want the B like a gun, I've seen one that the remote plugs into it, and it looks like a pistol.
3345381	3348502	It has a pistol grip on it, and you just pull the trigger, and it's like pulling the B button.
3348522	3353304	All right, now, BlackWolf says you don't use the front trigger at all, and he was at E3.
3355084	3357145	Okay, the front trigger in the front, okay.
3358025	3359546	Why would you not use the trigger in the front?
3359626	3363147	What the hell is there a trigger there for, then, if you don't use it for the game?
3363940	3366242	It's for pushing the goddamn B button.
3368804	3369925	I still say bring me Silent Hill.
3369965	3370646	It looks like crap.
3370746	3371927	Bring me Silent Hill.
3371947	3372967	Shoot him up to the Wii.
3373288	3374228	I will buy the Zapper.
3374348	3375289	I will hump the Zapper.
3375409	3377351	And I will be raped by Pyramid Head and it will be good.
3377671	3379072	I put out this challenge for you.
3379112	3390942	When this shit comes out and when these two fucking games, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, and Ghost Squad come out, I would like to see a side-by-side challenge with someone with the Zapper and without the Zapper and see who gets a better fucking score.
3391142	3392243	I bet you anything...
3392823	3393083	Money!
3393443	3400365	I will bet fucking $50 that the goddamn person without the zapper will wipe the floor with someone with the zapper.
3400705	3401345	That's why.
3401365	3403666	This thing is a piece of awkward shit, is what it is.
3403686	3403666	$50!
3406426	3408707	I have $50 on this.
3408727	3412308	I will like to see this challenge.
3412328	3414268	We will perform this challenge in studio.
3414528	3415489	I don't know, Rob, you up to it?
3416269	3417069	Sure, I don't have $50.
3417129	3417509	Well, I'm not...
3422183	3423323	Taking the bet, I'll just play the game.
3423463	3423864	I don't care.
3429585	3430166	How about this?
3430226	3434167	Since I don't have $50, how about this?
3434207	3434887	We'll make the bet.
3437008	3439449	The bet will be a date.
3440729	3450352	If the gun is indeed better, then I will take your wife out on a date and take her off your hands for a night so you can do nothing but play video games.
3452065	3479397	but if the gun is better then you will take me out on a date deal that's it deal alright then the whole chat has heard it so if the Wii remote is better and the games are better without the zapper peripheral then I will take Loki's wife out on a date and she won't be able to nag at Loki for a whole night but if the gun is indeed better Loki will take me out on a date and you better put out
3479673	3481474	We have this on record.
3483475	3485396	I'm telling you, this thing looks like crap.
3485636	3487336	There's no way it's going to make it better.
3487877	3489517	There's no way at all.
3492319	3494600	WeDoInChat says, Rob offers himself again.
3494640	3495300	What a skank.
3495500	3496040	Yeah, I know.
3496921	3499402	My significant other might have problems with this, but that's all right.
3500290	3500670	Let's see.
3501370	3505312	BlackWolf says, I really don't want to interject facts into a Loki rant because it's too funny.
3506332	3509493	Weedo also says, Loki needs a hug and Rob needs to stop being so skanky.
3510333	3513254	And Frisbee says it's a 9.4 on the Loki scale.
3514374	3517175	And SSJ100Matt says, Loki's rant level was at 9 out of 10.
3517895	3518315	That's great.
3519896	3520576	All right, there we go.
3520676	3524257	So the date bet over the zapper is on.
3526481	3531244	Let your wife know she was just completely used as an object in the program.
3531264	3538068	$50 for one night with your wife.
3541210	3542351	Alright, indecent Nintendo.
3542431	3543752	Okay, anyway, let's move on.
3543812	3544492	New story, please.
3545093	3554018	Well, in other releases in regards to Nintendo, for anyone who cared, Super Mario Galaxy will be out on November 12th.
3554479	3555159	That's pretty awesome.
3555632	3556212	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3569912	3570873	Mario Sunshine Mario 64 Mario 64
3596078	3603223	If they could ROM hack GameCube games like they can the old school 8-bit Nintendo games, I'm sure there would be a Super Mario Water Sports.
3604583	3608866	They would just redo the sprites so he whips it out and uses it as a gun.
3610107	3610507	That's freaky.
3610527	3613789	That was back on the Game Boy with the Link's Adventure.
3616070	3625216	Anyhow, I'm looking forward to Mario Galaxy as well, but I don't want to make a complete opinion until I'm able to play it, but certainly the screenshots and videos look enticing.
3625991	3630898	This was Nintendo's big thing, for lack of a better term.
3630918	3632981	This was their big thing at the press conference.
3634523	3636345	You have to admit, nobody called this.
3636786	3637907	Nobody knew this was coming.
3638548	3639069	Wii Fit.
3640183	3640683	was the game.
3641043	3643725	It's going to be a game that comes with what's called the balance board.
3643785	3649147	And you can think of it as kind of brain training for your body, which I'm sure the idea came from.
3649887	3651948	It's probably borrowed from the brain training series.
3651988	3659572	But using the balance board, you can do push-ups, steps aerobics, this goalie defense type thing, and dancing.
3659632	3665054	And I guess it's taking the old school 8-bit game dance aerobics into a whole new... Remember with the power pad?
3665654	3667175	Take it into a whole new generation.
3668445	3672128	And this was met with a resounding meh from the gaming community.
3672889	3677312	But there's something about this that I think is going to make the Wii catch fire even more.
3677372	3680375	Because soccer moms are going to continue to want to buy this for their kids.
3680615	3680935	Honestly.
3681255	3682476	I think it's fucking smart.
3682536	3683337	I think it looks cool.
3683717	3685599	You know, this is something I actually kind of want to buy.
3685839	3687881	Because I need an excuse to work out, apparently.
3688661	3691384	But here's the other thing, too, that a lot of people aren't looking at.
3691704	3694206	See, this is how they need to do their peripherals.
3694266	3695427	This is something new.
3695807	3696888	Something innovative.
3696968	3697288	Okay?
3697569	3697769	This...
3698269	3703630	You can imagine incorporating it into a snowboarding game or a skateboarding game or something like that.
3704011	3707471	It's actually a kind of neat peripheral if they use it in that sense.
3707511	3714693	Like, say, the next SSX game that comes out, you can use this with a remote as some added immersion into the game.
3715454	3718714	But this plastic add-on shit is stupid.
3719635	3720875	But this will be cool, though, I think.
3722113	3723074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3746724	3751587	Honestly, it's a really freaking smart move, and I hate to come off sounding like a Nintendo fanboy.
3751667	3769898	I mean, this is nothing that, you know, obviously I'm still very disappointed there was no real news about, like, online gaming or whatever, but honestly, in the direction the Wii has always said they were going to go, and that they've been going in, this is a logical next step that's going to make these things be popular all over again this Christmas.
3770618	3771899	I think it's going to be a smart move for them.
3772699	3773720	It's not coming out this year, though.
3774200	3774700	Oh, it's not?
3774960	3775861	Oh, I thought it was this Christmas.
3776021	3776481	No, next year.
3776762	3777722	Well, damn them.
3779463	3779804	Really?
3779884	3780504	That long?
3780544	3785147	I mean, it looked like the game was pretty well into progress, and they're really going to make us wait that long?
3785167	3786628	It's not coming out until 2008, yeah.
3786708	3794333	Now, I will say, though, however, that the announcement of Wii Fit did give us this year's Giant Enemy Crab Award.
3794793	3796334	Yes, that would be the biggest flub ever.
3796752	3796792	D.K.
3796812	3797712	Bongo Blast is coming out in October
3826912	3831414	This is the bongo racing game that's coming out.
3831474	3835715	I guess, I think actually you can use the bongos if you've got them.
3836115	3838896	Otherwise, you can just use the Wii Remote and nunchuck and stuff.
3839316	3841857	And it's going to be a racing game, which looks like crap.
3843237	3846378	The other one is a brand new channel called the Check Me Out Channel.
3847079	3854021	And it's kind of a combination of a me community as well as a hot or not thing.
3854825	3856707	You basically can search for different me's.
3856827	3859309	I use this example on Saturday.
3859489	3867576	If you're looking for a Chuck Norris me, you can browse through all the people's Chuck Norris me's and check out the one that you think most looks like Chuck Norris.
3867636	3870218	And then you can vote that one high or download it and stuff like that.
3870538	3871238	So that's kind of neat.
3874381	3878224	Yeah, that's pretty much, I think, all the big stuff that they were announcing this year.
3878504	3878925	A lot of it...
3880290	3887855	A lot of it was just kind of like, yeah, we've heard your cry for online gaming and stuff, and we're doing what we want still.
3889776	3893359	Bobby Blackwolf had a really funny comment in chat that I think really sums things up here.
3893399	3896481	It says, Nintendo's press conference summarized by Bobby Blackwolf.
3896841	3898683	This is how we've printed money in the past.
3899043	3903046	Here's a bone we're throwing to hardcore gamers, and here's how we will print money in the future.
3905047	3905067	I...
3905555	3908557	It's kind of a true statement in my mind.
3908577	3910539	All right, let's do the same thing we did for Microsoft.
3910579	3913221	Let's go around what you liked, what you didn't like, rate it.
3913681	3914582	You want to start us off, DarkSakura?
3915203	3915783	For Nintendo?
3916023	3916223	Yes.
3917304	3920327	I think that Wii Fit's redeemed the whole thing, so it gets a nine.
3921528	3923329	So you are really excited about Wii Fit that much?
3923669	3924110	Absolutely.
3924290	3924590	All right.
3926054	3927575	I actually think that they lost some
3955410	3957251	I kind of thought they were a little bit better than that.
3957571	3961132	It was nice to see that they did announce some street dates for some games coming out.
3961612	3966534	Good, because, you know, there's some definite spaces in between some of these better games.
3967415	3976879	And, I don't know, the Wii Fit thing is great, you know, because they're looking for that whole health fitness angle, but I was really disappointed there's not a lot of talk of online.
3976899	3980360	They really seem to skimp that whole part of, was it Super Smash, or
3981047	3982949	Not Super Smash Bros., but Metroid Prime.
3983830	3987975	I know it's not supposed to be online, I guess, so... I don't know.
3988655	3988976	Alright.
3989396	3993961	And then I would rate it probably... Probably a 6, actually.
3994282	4000608	It just wasn't... This was one of those things, I was watching the live feeds of them, I actually turned it off because I got bored.
4000628	4001149	Yeah.
4002156	4003618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4020374	4031256	So I'm a little bit torn because I want to give Nintendo props for sticking to their guns and kind of continuing down this path that they promised they were going to do next year in regards to the new generation of gaming versus the next generation of gaming.
4031556	4038358	So I give them props there, but I am still left with disappointment over the lack of some type of centralized online system.
4038378	4047259	It talks about more details on WiiWare, anything that could compete with the behemoth of Xbox Live as far as online goes.
4047560	4047840	I don't know.
4048000	4049660	I still felt like there was a lot
4050180	4050880	to be desired.
4050920	4052661	But then again, you know, that is for the hardcore gamer.
4052921	4058463	But they're going to win a million points with Soccer Moms, and, you know, they're going to continue to do very well in the next year.
4058923	4059964	So, I don't know.
4060944	4066746	I personally give them a 6, but looking from it, like, if I wasn't so selfish, I would probably give them more of an 8.
4067766	4068847	So, that's that.
4069587	4071348	Let's look at chat and see what the chat says.
4071648	4073989	SSJ100Matt says, I'm giving it a C-D+.
4074269	4077690	They showed their true colors this year that they are careless about hardcore gamers.
4078953	4082957	Actdeft says, Rob D, I think Microsoft was worse.
4082997	4084318	They didn't show anything new.
4085078	4088461	And that was to Rob D's comments that says, I give Nintendo 6 out of 10.
4088641	4089622	It was worse than the other two.
4089662	4092824	They're going in a different direction, but they announced Mario Kart.
4093465	4100790	Rob D also says, Nintendo's press conference was extremely disappointing to me because I think they're showing me that they might be leaving me behind a little bit.
4102431	4102872	Let's see.
4103953	4106495	Zappy asks, was that fitness game for Xbox any good?
4106535	4108316	If you're talking about your self-fitness, no, it wasn't.
4110936	4116278	Weedoo says Wii needs a soccer kicking game to win over the soccer moms.
4116598	4119460	Well, you know, they have the goalie thing in Wii Fit, so who knows.
4119840	4122141	GS191 says, I'll make a bold statement.
4122581	4127203	Nintendo did nothing, I mean nothing, to convince me to buy a Wii between now and Christmas.
4128346	4131910	BlackWolf asks, do you have a source for Wii Fit not coming out in 2007, Loki?
4131930	4133833	Because they did not confirm or deny that on the show floor.
4134033	4135575	I thought it was not on their list.
4135715	4137978	It was on their release list, I believe, for 2008.
4138018	4142743	Because it was supposed to be... God, I don't remember.
4142883	4145026	I know it said not this year, though.
4145266	4145987	I know that for a fact.
4146564	4147965	Alright, two more comments then we'll move on.
4147985	4149565	DJ Tyrant says, I give them an 8 out of 10.
4149605	4152046	They showed why they're in a great position right now.
4152106	4156208	They've got solid titles and a great lineup ahead of them with their regular titles, Mario, Metroid, etc.
4157168	4160490	And Gerardimo says, Just my opinion on Nintendo's online situation.
4160790	4163171	Are there really that many games worth playing online right now?
4163251	4165552	Seriously, Mario Party or Big Brain Academy online?
4165872	4166812	That wouldn't be much fun.
4167573	4167893	I don't know.
4167953	4168473	I disagree.
4168513	4170794	I think Mario Party would actually be a lot of fun online.
4171714	4171974	I don't know.
4171994	4175816	I think multiplayer is the only way to go and sometimes your house just can't accommodate all those people.
4176803	4178324	But that's my opinion, and that's yours.
4178524	4181985	So chat.orangeontradio.com if you ever want to join us in the chat room.
4182065	4191669	And, of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at orangeontradio.com on our live 365 feed, which did not shut down on July 15th, contrary to the rumor about the whole Internet.
4191889	4196470	But, thankfully, there was a little reprieve by Congress, which has given people time more to negotiate the rates.
4196791	4203133	Of course, we encourage you to visit savenetradio.org and learn more about the situation impacting Internet radio that continues to.
4203792	4232534	for now let's move on to some other stories that don't have really to do with press conferences per se but some other things going around around the gaming industry well this is actually pretty cool we mentioned earlier but Paper Mario is going to the European Virtual Console and I think that's pretty cool because it was a really you know cool game I didn't get to play a whole bunch of it but it was you know classic Nintendo 64 stuff it's kind of hard to think of Nintendo 64 stuff as being classic though because you know I remember when it was new but um
4233098	4236801	It is, though, 1,000 points to download.
4238342	4260537	So right now, though, on the European Virtual Console, then the total of Nintendo 64 games, they have now Paper Mario, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Lylat Wars, and F-Zero X. Also coming out on Virtual Console is Airzonk, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, which was sort of okay.
4261297	4261858	And it's a 600-point game.
4264537	4265577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4282773	4283073	GamePolitics.com
4308140	4323227	And of course, we remember we talked previously about the brain training-ish game, or it was actually Mind Quiz was the real game, that had the controversy behind it because it used the word spastic in it, which here in the U.S., not really a big deal of a word.
4323287	4325908	It's not a very controversial word, but in the U.K.
4325968	4331251	carries a lot more meaning and oomph about the mentally handicapped.
4332632	4333512	That's tragic.
4334022	4338844	Interesting that it kind of continues another recall over that word.
4338964	4339544	Very interesting.
4340384	4350608	Well, another thing that's tragic is the fact that the government and government groups feel that they need to step in to protect kids from M-rated games.
4351189	4361613	So the National Institute on Media and Family is building an army of undercover agents or shoppers for their 11th annual video game report card.
4362193	4362673	And, um,
4363334	4374983	They're going to be finding actual miners to go in and attempt to buy M-rated games to see if the actual retailers will prevent them from buying them.
4376264	4377405	I don't know.
4378306	4381328	I think it's good that they're trying to enforce that stuff.
4383270	4383550	I don't know.
4383610	4386432	I still think, though, that parents should be more responsible.
4387133	4390075	Stop giving your kids money if you don't want them buying crap.
4390476	4390696	Well...
4391548	4394789	Let's move on to another segment we like to do every week here on the program.
4394869	4398069	It's called the Website of the Week, and it's brought to you by DarkSakura.
4398109	4403690	She likes to surf the Internet up and down and all over every week and find a website to share with you all out there on the Internet.
4404130	4407071	DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?
4410551	4418893	The Website of the Week is one that will definitely make an impact, I think, on the world at large.
4420811	4433840	It is awfulplasticsurgery.com It's a site taking very famous people and showing just how bad their plastic surgery is.
4433860	4437503	I'm really not joking.
4437883	4441025	It's awfulplasticsurgery.com Is it not for the squeamish?
4441065	4446369	Because I have a feeling a site like this may make you kind of go, No, it's not that bad.
4446409	4448630	It's just, you know, pictures you can find anywhere on the internet.
4449091	4449291	All right.
4450745	4454108	Well, thank you, DarkSakura, for that lovely website of the week.
4454188	4457750	There's also, I think, one that's called goodplasticsurgery.com, too.
4457770	4458891	Interesting.
4458911	4460813	That shows, you know, plastic surgery's done right.
4460833	4467698	Like, an example on here is, like, I find this one funny, Brooke Hogan's boob implants.
4469119	4472681	And who was it?
4473242	4478846	Victoria Beckham, her boobs that just look wrong.
4479927	4480207	All right.
4480686	4482350	it's funny, I think it's hilarious
4483582	4491984	Well, also something I think that is kind of funny and looks like maybe plastic surgery gone wrong is this very interesting peripheral that was announced at E3 2007.
4492445	4493985	It's the Wii Party Station.
4494005	4494845	What?
4495365	4495585	Huh?
4496006	4496226	What?
4496946	4497886	It's the Wii Party Station.
4498266	4502127	Nyko is, you know, they make a lot of these types of interesting peripherals.
4502147	4502567	Well, look at this.
4502868	4504688	They've made this party station.
4504728	4508189	It's a coffee table centerpiece for the Wii games.
4508249	4511230	It's basically got four stations that can hold your Wii remote there.
4511630	4512510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4530151	4533152	So it's a little party station for all your Wii crap.
4533172	4534373	That's kind of smart.
4534573	4535994	You can have a Wii tennis party, yeah.
4536514	4538555	You know, and the price for it?
4538575	4538555	$24.99.
4538635	4541436	Well, that's not bad just as a storage unit.
4541556	4543797	You know, yeah, it's kind of actually not a bad price.
4543817	4544477	I look at it and go, WTF?
4544758	4547239	If they had a coffee table, it'd be great.
4547479	4555362	Yeah, there's a lot of people that are into having the Wii sports parties, and, you know, especially for, again, the casual gamers and the soccer mom parties of the world.
4555442	4557743	And, you know, I keep using them, but you know what I mean.
4557783	4558844	Like, people that aren't really...
4559204	4559905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4579058	4581100	I like having the freezer tray.
4581140	4581860	That's a really good idea.
4582121	4583221	Sure, go ahead and buy this.
4583261	4585763	You're just encouraging them to make more crap like this.
4586264	4587504	That's going to come out later.
4588125	4589586	But it's not that bad, Loki.
4589666	4590086	I don't know.
4590607	4594149	It's better than those little plastic golf clubs that you put your remote into.
4594670	4594950	Is it?
4595590	4596291	Really, is it?
4596951	4600854	If the little golf club held chips and dip in it, would it be better?
4601154	4601575	Shut up.
4602615	4604057	Everything is better with chips and dip.
4605818	4606078	All right.
4607100	4612005	We're going to take a quick break because as GS68 says in the chatroom, Loki's hit his limit break.
4612485	4613987	So he needs to calm down a little bit.
4614007	4618011	He needs to go fag his anger, which by the way, somebody left an iTunes review.
4619724	4620865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4641002	4669800	MGS68 makes a good point here chips equal oily equals oily remote which equals more remotes being thrown into TVs so keep the paper towels nearby shut up alright we're going to take a quick break we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
