2
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,038
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I will have to fight the cat to the death.

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Or then we'll move it to your house.

5
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:58,908
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because the room that the computer's in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of stuff in it.

6
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:00,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Stuff.

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,392
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a laser pointer for the cat.

8
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:04,754
[SPEAKER_13]: You got a laser pointer for the cat?

9
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:06,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Or to point at the cat?

10
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:07,397
[SPEAKER_13]: To point at the cat.

11
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat.

12
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,480
[SPEAKER_13]: They have those.

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.

14
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:14,578
[SPEAKER_13]: That's dangerous.

15
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a cat with a freaking laser on its head.

16
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, come on, let's get back to the gaming news.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody, quick, start us off.

18
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:20,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

19
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:21,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man.

20
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:23,603
[SPEAKER_10]: No Pac-Man.

21
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:29,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's kind of interesting, you know, with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.

22
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,548
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.

23
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, you know,

24
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,395
[SPEAKER_10]: How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?

25
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:40,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea.

26
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.

27
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,668
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as you fall, oh, zero.

28
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe dodging or something.

29
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:11,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

30
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see anything like that.

31
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:19,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be good for just like sports games, like the next SSX game or whatever.

32
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Just have that as an optional control method.

33
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what we all need, a jump roping game.

34
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,096
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

35
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:48,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never done that before.

36
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It's totally by the people that do Flamin' Fingers.

37
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,290
[SPEAKER_13]: No, then it has to be good.

38
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,992
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same soundtrack?

39
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:54,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Similar, similar stuff.

40
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:57,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I love Flamin' Fingers' soundtrack.

41
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,176
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so good.

42
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:00,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, hold on.

43
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:06,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Jumpin' Jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could tie into a role-playing game.

44
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:07,485
[SPEAKER_13]: It just doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,528
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be for your character walking around.

46
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:11,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume it would be.

47
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:35,839
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth Now that I could do Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass Lean left to cast black magic Lean right to cast white magic I don't know, silly

48
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Project Hammer Project Hammer Project Hammer

49
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:04,113
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, Disaster is still under development, speaking about Disaster Day of Crisis.

50
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,754
[SPEAKER_13]: We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.

51
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,735
[SPEAKER_13]: You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.

52
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:14,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there was a report on Digg today that said that Project Hammer was gone.

53
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,799
[SPEAKER_13]: And I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.

54
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you heard anything about Project Hammer, Loki?

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,841
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story because I heard...

56
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:27,922
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.

57
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:33,903
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying, oh my god, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, you know, like an exercise game.

58
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:40,144
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to make a Final Fantasy, you know, health fitness game?

59
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:46,366
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all, no, but we more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.

60
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Then maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.

61
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:53,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my god, they're working on Final Fantasy Fitness, you know.

62
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's sarcasm.

63
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:56,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Look it up, people.

64
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:57,990
[SPEAKER_10]: What's sarcasm?

65
00:04:59,151 --> 00:04:59,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

66
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,552
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it?

67
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,496
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some other stuff?

68
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:07,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, other stuff.

69
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:14,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick the...

70
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:17,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Pants off of the Xbox 360.

71
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:24,169
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 has sold 10.08 million units.

72
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,573
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.

73
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:36,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been out for a shorter amount of time.

74
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,201
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.

75
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:48,898
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s, though.

76
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,599
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, the PSP's been out a long time.

77
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.

78
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:55,342
[SPEAKER_01]: That also makes sense.

79
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:01,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or their own PSP or whatever it is.

80
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Mommy, he won't give me my game!

81
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:05,728
[SPEAKER_01]: That.

82
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:06,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that.

83
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:07,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly that.

84
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:08,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence why I don't breed!

85
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:17,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?

86
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:17,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

87
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already proven.

88
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It all depends.

89
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,467
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably will, just because they keep selling at a consistent rate.

90
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:34,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves, and obviously they're not just going to let them take the top spot.

91
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:42,157
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight decline ever since it reached the peak.

92
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless, of course, they come out, because I don't really think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.

93
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,042
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.

94
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,424
[SPEAKER_01]: The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people.

95
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:58,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really appeals to a much broader demographic, so...

96
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:03,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings, and that's going to be... Yeah, yeah, yeah, next.

97
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:07,018
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, now some comments from our chat room, chat.orangehoundradio.com.

98
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,539
[SPEAKER_13]: We love having the folks talking here.

99
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Foev says, that's not fair.

100
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:14,743
[SPEAKER_13]: If the 360 and PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.

101
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:19,064
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

102
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,446
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of good games.

103
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,544
[SPEAKER_13]: But most of them are like mini-games.

104
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,744
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot, a lot, a lot.

105
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:07,965
[SPEAKER_13]: No, there's actual games.

106
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Like maybe Trauma Center.

107
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:14,147
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's not a lot of long-lasting type games.

108
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Even Cook and Mama lost its thrill for me.

109
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,267
[SPEAKER_13]: It was more of a DS game for me.

110
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,128
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I need to borrow that.

111
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:20,308
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is.

112
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:21,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways.

113
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:27,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have something to brag about.

114
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:35,801
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan than they are Xbox 360s.

115
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:43,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, they've reached their one million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing behind.

116
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:49,412
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies.

117
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to actually be pretty good in Japan, I think.

118
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:54,756
[SPEAKER_13]: See, there's Microsoft's real problem.

119
00:08:54,856 --> 00:09:00,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in that last story, we were looking at the worldwide numbers where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.

120
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:08,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still not cracking the market in Japan.

121
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,793
[SPEAKER_13]: which is interesting because they've had games like Blue Dragon now for a little bit.

122
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?

123
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:15,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it did.

124
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:17,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Trusty Bell or whatever it's called.

125
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,417
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, these games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.

126
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:25,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.

127
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have 2.5 million Wii's in Japan as well.

128
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:34,565
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, whereas they may be outselling the 360, they're still not number one.

129
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,045
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

130
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:45,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market though, and if they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the U.S.

131
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,095
[SPEAKER_10]: and the U.K.

132
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, who knows?

133
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:52,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.

134
00:09:52,727 --> 00:10:04,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big over there in Tokyo as well.

135
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:12,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be in the UK, actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get a UK account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.

136
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:13,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

137
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:45,406
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you crash, you can eject your driver through the windshield.

138
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I might have to try this.

139
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I will download this demo.

140
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the idea of an eject button.

141
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, speaking of eject... Wait, real quick, sorry, Jamie.

142
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:57,553
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the best part about it, Rob.

143
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:06,258
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a whole set of minigames based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump, all sorts of things.

144
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?

145
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:10,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing.

146
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:11,946
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a stack of Twinkies?

147
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.

148
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:17,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

149
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:23,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.

150
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:32,812
[SPEAKER_01]: At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a $1.9 billion loss.

151
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:38,154
[SPEAKER_01]: $1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said,

152
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:39,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what?

153
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,548
[SPEAKER_01]: The Red Ring of Death are bad.

154
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:49,257
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon?

155
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:50,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

156
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

157
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:55,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll drop the price for real?

158
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's what's coming.

159
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:03,531
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think when we talk about that whole sales thing earlier, I think a price drop is coming definitely before Christmas.

160
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably about the time Halo 3 is.

161
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,156
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to bank way too much on Halo 3 pulling in money.

162
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:08,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sad thing is that I think they will.

163
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.

164
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:25,939
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's, you know, Halo 3, Project Arthur Racing 4, Mass Effect, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are... Eternal Sonata is like the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.

165
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,442
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a huge lineup, it's not all just, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.

166
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Carcassonne 2?

167
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:38,227
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, Sony's doing the same thing, they've got, you know, a pretty good lineup for the fall, just...

168
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,224
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't as much.

169
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:43,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it'll get better.

170
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:47,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?

171
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's already impacted them.

172
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,353
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.

173
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're going to have to sell millions more systems.

174
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:57,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That's money out of their pocket.

175
00:12:58,355 --> 00:12:59,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not getting any better for them.

176
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:01,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have done it right the first time, hi!

177
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,359
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to green light Halo 4 now.

178
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:10,898
[SPEAKER_10]: They're facing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue.

179
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, you know, they are to blame for this.

180
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's such a simple fix.

181
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:24,306
[SPEAKER_10]: The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the...

182
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.

183
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?

184
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:34,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's why.

185
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:35,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe because it's a baby.

186
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:37,194
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

187
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:50,020
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people are fascinated by... There's a little mercury switch in there that when you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the ring's always...

188
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:51,872
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

189
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would have been... Or just not shaking your Xbox 360.

190
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:24,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

191
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,444
[SPEAKER_13]: To watch the light tip up and down.

192
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Or take the disc out, if you're going to do that.

193
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:32,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even better, just, you know... I don't know, don't be retarded with it.

194
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,849
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, the chatroom agrees.

195
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Over at chat.orange.com, Blaze says, Well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.

196
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,774
[SPEAKER_13]: And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.

197
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,715
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a pinata, you shake it.

198
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Viva pinata, I get it.

199
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,021
[SPEAKER_13]: You're especially funny tonight, Miklatov.

200
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always funny when I talk.

201
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:02,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.

202
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,651
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.

203
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:10,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that knocked it over.

204
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:11,756
[SPEAKER_13]: He shot a stapler into him 20 times.

205
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:12,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that would hurt.

206
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminds me of that scene in UHF.

207
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,609
[SPEAKER_01]: or he shoots him with a staple gun.

208
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,070
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the thing, though.

209
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand how... Okay, granted, it should have been fixed.

210
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,033
[SPEAKER_10]: The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar.

211
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to fix this thing.

212
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:32,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole dollar.

213
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,635
[SPEAKER_10]: It's less than a dollar, okay?

214
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:36,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to fix this.

215
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:40,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.

216
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:43,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way, though, still, I mean...

217
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't jiggle the machine.

218
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It says in the manual not to do it.

219
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:56,333
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it through your TV, and people do that anyway, so... I guess, you know... And then they want to sue Nintendo.

220
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,935
[SPEAKER_12]: The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.

221
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:02,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess... You know, it's like...

222
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you gotta do.

223
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Walk these people through how to handle their console.

224
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:09,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't shake the console.

225
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:10,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't like it.

226
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,805
[SPEAKER_10]: It will scratch your disc.

227
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:17,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you ever seen those posters like downtown when you're driving or whatever that says, don't shake your baby?

228
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:21,231
[SPEAKER_01]: A message from the... Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work.

229
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:28,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And after talking with some of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaked this...

230
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:30,940
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

231
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:47,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.

232
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you shake them?

233
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:52,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either.

234
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't shake it.

235
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:57,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to work for that company and work in their product test support.

236
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:05,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And see if one day they make a model of a baby that can be shaken.

237
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:10,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, turn off my mic.

238
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:11,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Heart babies.

239
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Love babies.

240
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them when they're quiet.

241
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I like them with a straw in their head.

242
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:18,882
[SPEAKER_08]: To drink.

243
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:20,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so anyways.

244
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,144
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with you?

245
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:23,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So real quick.

246
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:24,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously!

247
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games, Rob.

248
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:27,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to video games.

249
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Is video games what caused you to be so violent?

250
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:33,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.

251
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,010
[SPEAKER_13]: And just don't shake babies.

252
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And don't shake Xbox 360s.

253
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,872
[SPEAKER_13]: And while you're at it, just don't shake people or things in general.

254
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless they're stupid and then throttle them.

255
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:50,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Or unless it's a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.

256
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:50,974
[SPEAKER_13]: That is funny.

257
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:51,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You can shake your booty.

258
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:52,375
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

259
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Watch me shake my ass right now!

260
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:57,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Right in front of my face, no thank you.

261
00:17:58,518 --> 00:18:11,205
[SPEAKER_10]: The plaintiff, I guess, to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrecked copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints Row.

262
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:18,389
[SPEAKER_10]: A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined a Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell disc.

263
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

264
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:43,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, there's no... Once you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.

265
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I shouldn't do that.

266
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,812
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that grinding noise?

267
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.

268
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, it makes the noise again.

269
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, better sue them, because we're out $150.

270
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo fucking hoo.

271
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:04,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.

272
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,867
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we may, let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.

273
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Camera, please.

274
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:12,549
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, thank you.

275
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:19,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Ready, lights, camera, and action.

276
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:29,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox 360.

277
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:36,548
[SPEAKER_13]: because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.

278
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:39,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, please don't shake children.

279
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,791
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the worst public service announcement ever.

280
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:46,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we get back into the stories, please?

281
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:47,894
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

282
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:50,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the next story is mine.

283
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.

284
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360

285
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they just not have E3 happen?

286
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And did they not just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this blah blah blah?

287
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:25,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the official Xbox magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version.

288
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:33,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is just after Kazumi Kitawa said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it as a PlayStation game.

289
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,897
[SPEAKER_13]: But we might have to take some steps.

290
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:41,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the whole reason why people are thinking, again, it's coming to the Xbox 360.

291
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just thinking, let it go!

292
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:44,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it go!

293
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:45,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the other thing, though.

294
00:20:45,850 --> 00:21:00,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told... I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.

295
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:04,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?

296
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:05,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

297
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:18,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming out for Xbox 360 because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual, you know, really good exclusive game coming to their platform.

298
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:20,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

299
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:26,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this.

300
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,856
[SPEAKER_13]: And this comes up like a week after E3.

301
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:32,537
[SPEAKER_13]: When they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.

302
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:38,819
[SPEAKER_13]: If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the releases.

303
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:44,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.

304
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:47,395
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

305
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:14,760
[SPEAKER_13]: 4-5 times across the scope of a couple months just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world.

306
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I get angsty.

307
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:21,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the FUs of the week.

308
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, start us off, please, with the FUs of the week.

309
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.

310
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:40,062
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd like to say F you to laminate flooring.

311
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:43,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, okay, this is how I burnt my ribs, okay?

312
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:47,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.

313
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not even sit down, I just stepped into the tub.

314
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:53,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And my phone rang, so I stepped out, dried off my feet.

315
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure to dry off my feet.

316
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Stepped into the hallway and down I went.

317
00:22:58,185 --> 00:23:04,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and I felt that all I hurt was my knee.

318
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:11,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue, and I hurt quite a bit, so I went to the doctor that day and he put me on a lot of Vicodin.

319
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and I'm fully functional on Vicodin.

320
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:29,719
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can go to my job and do my work, and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing, you know, but when I take it, I can't really do... I'm not the multitasker I normally am, and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at once.

321
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really pay attention to that many things.

322
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:33,722
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um...

323
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,461
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

324
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:05,423
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

325
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended, and I was offended now, you know what I mean?

326
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:42,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions about how they feel.

327
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them first, how do you feel?

328
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:51,474
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're gonna do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to be caused.

329
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:56,097
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.

330
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:25,815
[SPEAKER_01]: don't make assumptions all it does is make an ass out of you and only you okay you know I think that it's just this whole oh I don't want to offend people and I don't want to well then fucking ask you know what's the worst thing they're gonna say oh you know I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want to talk about it they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and respect it you know don't just assume because then I've been you know pissed off now for three days over this

331
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm a good person.

332
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:31,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm a good person.

333
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,362
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't you think I'm a good person?

334
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:35,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

335
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:46,530
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you don't step on them.

336
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,693
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.

337
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Good?

338
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:52,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All finished?

339
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I was fairly, uh...

340
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:56,645
[SPEAKER_01]: F.U.

341
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:57,926
[SPEAKER_01]: to Paper Mario Sucking My F.U.

342
00:25:58,046 --> 00:25:59,127
[SPEAKER_01]: of the week goes to Shane

343
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:17,368
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

344
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Only in the beginning.

345
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:19,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Only in the beginning.

346
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:20,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Made sense.

347
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:21,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Still does.

348
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:22,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Um... I get... Whoa, I get F you, right?

349
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,175
[SPEAKER_13]: F you... Oh crap, I had one.

350
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did it go?

351
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have two FUs.

352
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,693
[SPEAKER_08]: One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.

353
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:50,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I FU to Europe, or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent Hill arcade game, and it looks really sweet, and I want to play it so bad.

354
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:54,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will.

355
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:55,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Someday.

356
00:26:56,405 --> 00:27:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And then FU to next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices.

357
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And that'll be the end of that.

358
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:09,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

359
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

360
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:13,932
[SPEAKER_13]: That's that.

361
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,473
[SPEAKER_13]: All done with the FUs of the week.

362
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:19,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on and back into the gaming news then.

363
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:20,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

364
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:24,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name.

365
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:31,653
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have seen in Famitsu scans named Rosetta.

366
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:36,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Stone instantly because you know the Rosetta Stone was a big translator thing.

367
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:44,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So she gets to hang out with Daisy and Peach and what's-her-face who wasn't even a princess from the first game.

368
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Pauline.

369
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:46,866
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't a princess.

370
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:49,228
[SPEAKER_01]: She was just some hoochie from New York.

371
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So she doesn't need to be with the princesses.

372
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,742
[SPEAKER_13]: She's not good enough to be a princess.

373
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:55,542
[SPEAKER_13]: She's just a hooker.

374
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:59,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Polly wasn't in the Super Mario Bros.

375
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:00,625
[SPEAKER_10]: movie, was she?

376
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:01,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

377
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:03,527
[SPEAKER_10]: She was in Mario Bros.

378
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:04,067
[SPEAKER_10]: First Love.

379
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when he found out that Peach would put out, I guess.

380
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:08,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

381
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's, I guess, pretty.

382
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:16,074
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess.

383
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,375
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know.

384
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:18,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

385
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Fear not, folks.

386
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:32,800
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked a little bit about the Wii balance board in Part A, but Nintendo has come out to promise that they will be making more balance board-based games.

387
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're not going to be buying this thing for only one game.

388
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:38,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

389
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:41,983
[SPEAKER_13]: What else are they developing?

390
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:42,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Have they said anything?

391
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:44,544
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they did not.

392
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:47,446
[SPEAKER_13]: They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.

393
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:52,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of minigames?

394
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:57,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly, and I'm going to guess the next WarioWare game.

395
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God, probably.

396
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:00,255
[SPEAKER_13]: That would make sense.

397
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:02,456
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be fun, though.

398
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.

399
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:07,906
[SPEAKER_13]: A new audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put down.

400
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:38,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier games I enjoyed, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to change on the Wii.

401
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:48,528
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as they had the nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote be your weather paddle, is that what it's called?

402
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:48,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

403
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:51,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I don't see any problem with it, it should be actually pretty fun.

404
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:59,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder how that's going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball, because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the ball that was coming at you, and like the tiny color that surrounded it, so you could tell what's...

405
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:00,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Outro Music

406
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,670
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

407
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I can watch YouTube So guess what?

408
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:46,546
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

409
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:17,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Atari likes horses and people who love horses.

410
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:26,966
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii, DS, and PC that, from what I can understand, it's a horse raising and riding simulation.

411
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:29,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

412
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Ride them horses, huh?

413
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

414
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:45,984
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing the horse enthusiast community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.

415
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:50,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game players?

416
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:53,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but they're the same type that play video games?

417
00:31:53,707 --> 00:32:00,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar Hero Drunk.

418
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:00,909
[SPEAKER_13]: One.

419
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So you know one.

420
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:11,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of all the horse games out there, you should consider this one because the game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.

421
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would play it.

422
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Take that, Final Furlong.

423
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:16,501
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I say to this game?

424
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:17,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Nay.

425
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to get the game.

426
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:22,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think I'll play it.

427
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, have fun.

428
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?

429
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:26,444
[SPEAKER_13]: That might make me change my mind.

430
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:27,425
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be kind of fun.

431
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:31,686
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I can name the horse Britney Spears and I can whip Britney Spears just like it was Derby Owners Club.

432
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Tribuners Club, okay?

433
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you do.

434
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,010
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

435
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,691
[SPEAKER_13]: TheRobD says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate horse physics.

436
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:41,711
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad they listened.

437
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:46,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.

438
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:46,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

439
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:47,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

440
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:53,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar.

441
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:57,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Bully, the scholarship edition, is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.

442
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:05,930
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.

443
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.

444
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:14,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I don't know.

445
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,394
[SPEAKER_10]: It got a teen rating before.

446
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see why it would get any more than a teen rating now.

447
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.

448
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:29,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2 because I was so immersed in my 360 at that time.

449
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:35,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all so I can play it in high def and widescreen and all that good stuff.

450
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it will have new content as well for it.

451
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,770
[SPEAKER_10]: More guys to make out with?

452
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, more guys to make out with.

453
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

454
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:45,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine what you could do with the Wiimote.

455
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Miklatov, what?

456
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:53,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You could write on the chalkboards.

457
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:54,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

458
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:55,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I could.

459
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,317
[SPEAKER_08]: What were you thinking?

460
00:33:59,417 --> 00:33:59,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

461
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:01,458
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I had to ask.

462
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:09,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.

463
00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:12,104
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's the interesting thing.

464
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,826
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not supposed to be a fighting game.

465
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:17,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

466
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:42,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Soul is awesome.

467
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:43,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I love SoulBadGuy.

468
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,323
[SPEAKER_08]: SoulBadGuy is great.

469
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:46,663
[SPEAKER_13]: And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.

470
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:47,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Who looks like Kai.

471
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:51,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Eno.

472
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:52,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a fan of Zappa.

473
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:54,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Love Zappa.

474
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:54,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love Faust.

475
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Faust, of course.

476
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:57,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Venom too.

477
00:34:57,587 --> 00:35:02,128
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my old cosplays though, and I'm sad because this is before I lost all that weight, is I cosplayed Baiken.

478
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:05,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Which Dan didn't like because it's like, you know, boob.

479
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:09,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.

480
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:10,014
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

481
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:11,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he rape you with his scalpel?

482
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:12,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in the game?

483
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:16,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did hit him with the claw by accident.

484
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:21,678
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to give the claw back to Evan because it was part of his toys.

485
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:23,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say anything else.

486
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you off of the show.

487
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, there you go then.

488
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:34,803
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.

489
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:37,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, is it my turn again?

490
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:12,734
[SPEAKER_01]: and Forced and Iron Ox, at least what their names are in the U.S.

491
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,935
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.

492
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:18,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to that.

493
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:20,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the series.

494
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game, because I don't think there was that many characters.

495
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,823
[SPEAKER_10]: But it can't be any worse than the actual Devil Kings game.

496
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:35,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS.

497
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:43,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was interesting because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerrard to comment on it.

498
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.

499
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:56,035
[SPEAKER_10]: People have made, I guess, concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing obviously has come out.

500
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:59,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're saying Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games.

501
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:01,342
[SPEAKER_10]: or license them.

502
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:03,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

503
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:04,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it ever get created?

504
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:05,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows.

505
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:12,055
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.

506
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:15,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what is created as jokes or what?

507
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,961
[SPEAKER_10]: No, like pitching.

508
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh,

509
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:20,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we want to bring Halo 2 to the DS.

510
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what we can do with it.

511
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And then showing them off the game.

512
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:23,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what's the problem?

513
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,421
[SPEAKER_13]: If Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market, what's the problem?

514
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:29,823
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.

515
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:32,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Who says it won't happen at some point?

516
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:33,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be weird.

517
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be very weird.

518
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:43,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of think, though, a little bit like... I don't know if it's a good thing because, I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the Panasonic.

519
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Or not the Panasonic, but the CD-i.

520
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:49,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Mario and the... Oh, yes.

521
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Wanda Gamelin and all that stuff.

522
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:52,167
[SPEAKER_10]: All the games.

523
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:56,972
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that would be pretty awesome.

524
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:06,461
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.

525
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,283
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be pretty cool.

526
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:09,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Good stuff.

527
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:09,644
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

528
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:19,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which of course is where the Halo series will soon show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.

529
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:31,363
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.

530
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's a quote from the person who did it.

531
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I successfully changed the DVD key and region code of the 360, so it's all confirmed.

532
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:44,295
[SPEAKER_13]: All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how to modify and re-sign the KV contents.

533
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:53,478
[SPEAKER_13]: But, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably close this loophole pretty soon.

534
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:53,838
[SPEAKER_13]: They usually do.

535
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:54,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they already have.

536
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:59,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just on some of the older kernels that you can do that.

537
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:03,282
[SPEAKER_13]: TheRobD says, oh, that's all he did?

538
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe I didn't think of that.

539
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:10,493
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier in the program.

540
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:11,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

541
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:12,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

542
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:15,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and then ShadowCharlie says, Brick.

543
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,896
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox 360 is going to be a brick pretty soon.

544
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,757
[SPEAKER_10]: They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack it.

545
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:25,358
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disc.

546
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:32,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know, taint it.

547
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:35,722
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be funny.

548
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2

549
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:07,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

550
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to tie that game that could possibly be good.

551
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just theorizing, Jesus.

552
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:30,767
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in a House of the Dead the movie or something.

553
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:31,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I tie that in?

554
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:35,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.

555
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:39,915
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.

556
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:42,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.

557
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:43,658
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of neat.

558
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Just makes you miss time splitters even more.

559
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:50,977
[SPEAKER_13]: So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in Far Cry 2?

560
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:54,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

561
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crysis, because Crysis looks like such an amazing game.

562
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And Far Cry was pretty good when it came out, originally.

563
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:07,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle.

564
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, just improve upon it.

565
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was a pretty good game to begin with.

566
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:16,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the AI, though, in the first game was a little weird.

567
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:18,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe tune that up a bit.

568
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:25,003
[SPEAKER_10]: But if the AI is good and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty good game.

569
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:32,309
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up because it's dirt cheap now and it's actually pretty fun.

570
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,350
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

571
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:34,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's move on.

572
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:38,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?

573
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:38,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

574
00:41:39,115 --> 00:41:39,655
[SPEAKER_10]: We got one.

575
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:41,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of interesting.

576
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:46,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.

577
00:41:47,064 --> 00:41:54,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had hoped.

578
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:59,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess this is kind of stemming from the showing of Too Human at E3.

579
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:06,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.

580
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.

581
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:14,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that they're not the only company it's been having trouble with.

582
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:19,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.

583
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:25,174
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.

584
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:31,097
[SPEAKER_13]: So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing.

585
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:33,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably, yeah.

586
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:35,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just hard to work with?

587
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:40,618
[SPEAKER_10]: They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.

588
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:42,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised.

589
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Like there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.

590
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:52,487
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers that we can read it for ourselves.

591
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:53,968
[SPEAKER_13]: That'll be exciting.

592
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:58,112
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Janai in our chatroom says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.

593
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:01,474
[SPEAKER_13]: That's old school right there.

594
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:03,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that game.

595
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, but there was the One Muff's Fall Battlegrounds that came out.

596
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:09,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember online?

597
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a battle arena game.

598
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:13,686
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not over yet if you want to play that.

599
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:15,227
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.

600
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:18,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.

601
00:43:18,678 --> 00:43:26,260
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

602
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Who would have thought?

603
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our username.

604
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.

605
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:37,282
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.

606
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:42,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.

607
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:43,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's go to the phones.

608
00:43:44,861 --> 00:43:46,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

609
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:46,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

610
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:48,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Raven's Dolphin.

611
00:43:48,203 --> 00:43:48,744
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

612
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:53,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, and I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical difficulties.

613
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:54,247
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

614
00:43:55,168 --> 00:43:55,968
[SPEAKER_03]: The epic thing?

615
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,509
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things are on my mind, actually.

616
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But the epic thing, really.

617
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:01,652
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the epic thing?

618
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:02,413
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole lawsuit?

619
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:04,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

620
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?

621
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:10,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, according to Loki.

622
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:11,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

623
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't checked my Wikipedia.

624
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:14,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is that it?

625
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.

626
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:22,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion on everything?

627
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:26,283
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.

628
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:39,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that a little, you know, like Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they try to get this engine and I feel, it feels like they're a bunch of, like, you know, how Epic has got this game that's really popular.

629
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.

630
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:45,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, a bunch of people go like, I can't get this to work, damn it, let's just sue them.

631
00:44:46,528 --> 00:44:52,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's, I mean, well, it's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other companies, I mean, that's what you got to do to make money.

632
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:58,057
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you think you can sell them.

633
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:03,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know, they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.

634
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,120
[SPEAKER_13]: You're getting some agreement from our chat room.

635
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.

636
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:11,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.

637
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:13,783
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a first, that's a first.

638
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:16,424
[SPEAKER_13]: And DJ Janai says, Epic has a big ego too.

639
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:19,713
[SPEAKER_03]: They do, you know, but they do make good games.

640
00:45:19,753 --> 00:45:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But it feels like, you know, I'm playing Rainbow Six, which is an Unreal Tournament game.

641
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:26,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, an Unreal Technology game, and it works fine.

642
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're doing.

643
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Sephiroth1215 says, they weren't really a Nintendo developer.

644
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:32,705
[SPEAKER_13]: They just made all the games on GameCube.

645
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:34,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

646
00:45:34,487 --> 00:45:34,687
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

647
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:35,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what else is on your mind?

648
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,728
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is on my mind?

649
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii board.

650
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that the Wii snowboard, not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.

651
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Fit board.

652
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be used as the snowboard, I suppose, in a game.

653
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:47,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.

654
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:47,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember 1080?

655
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:48,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

656
00:45:50,354 --> 00:45:55,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?

657
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:58,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Tricky, SSX Tricky?

658
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:01,360
[SPEAKER_13]: With that theme song I can never get out of my head.

659
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Tricky!

660
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

661
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for that.

662
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:07,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Blaze agrees with you in chat.

663
00:46:07,693 --> 00:46:08,193
[SPEAKER_13]: 1080 for the win.

664
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:12,936
[SPEAKER_13]: So you think they can do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with this board?

665
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,816
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do.

666
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:19,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.

667
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a real snowboarding fan.

668
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.

669
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:28,823
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license the thing.

670
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:32,525
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit boards?

671
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been thinking about it.

672
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:35,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

673
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like rip-off game.

674
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:38,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

675
00:46:38,993 --> 00:46:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the board.

676
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:44,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cast a spell.

677
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do this.

678
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:58,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it'll be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's angels, you know, you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.

679
00:46:58,105 --> 00:46:58,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be fun.

680
00:46:58,605 --> 00:46:59,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't that sound like fun?

681
00:46:59,826 --> 00:46:59,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

682
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: That does sound like fun.

683
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really excited.

684
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.

685
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:07,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And you shouldn't until you get to play it.

686
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:11,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Because a lot of people pass judgment on the Wii but change their minds when they actually get to play it.

687
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:13,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one last thing.

688
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:14,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't sound like Vodafone anymore.

689
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:15,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

690
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't sound like what?

691
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:19,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.

692
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:20,835
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be the new Skype.

693
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:22,576
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the quality has increased slightly.

694
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:24,378
[SPEAKER_08]: What's a VOG?

695
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:26,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I so loud?

696
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:29,301
[SPEAKER_08]: A VOG is what a lady has between... I thought he said VOG.

697
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:30,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what the crap?

698
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:32,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.

699
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:33,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Vonage.

700
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:34,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Vonage.

701
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:36,967
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a VOG is something completely different.

702
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:38,408
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I had a D when I said it.

703
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:39,069
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG.

704
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:40,790
[SPEAKER_13]: A VOG is where the babies come from.

705
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you shake them.

706
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:43,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop it.

707
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta go, so you can pick up some more calls.

708
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I made him uncomfortable.

709
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:52,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you did.

710
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:53,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.

711
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:54,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it again.

712
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:56,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it again?

713
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:56,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Make him uncomfortable again?

714
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to make somebody else uncomfortable.

715
00:47:58,448 --> 00:48:00,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

716
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:00,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

717
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,390
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68.

718
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:03,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, GS68.

719
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:04,332
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

720
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:11,296
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long and Midnight for the PS3, right?

721
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:13,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?

722
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.

723
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:16,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's up?

724
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:20,804
[SPEAKER_06]: There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.

725
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:26,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's, but, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?

726
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:28,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.

727
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it?

728
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:30,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet.

729
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:30,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it fun?

730
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:32,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, actually, I haven't tried it yet.

731
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:36,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just waiting for San Diego Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.

732
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:42,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and, you know, it's a big chain, they get a lot of the hottest games, why not?

733
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:43,748
It,

734
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:47,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let me just post... I'm going to post a link in chat room, so... Alright.

735
00:48:47,346 --> 00:48:48,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people will know.

736
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I am planning on buying it, though.

737
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've decided.

738
00:48:51,571 --> 00:48:52,953
[SPEAKER_10]: You think you are going to import it?

739
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:59,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because... Well, because I just, you know... I only have, like, one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be cool to have an import game.

740
00:48:59,141 --> 00:48:59,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it might be fun.

741
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:03,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Although it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing and then the damn thing doesn't work.

742
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:04,005
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to suck.

743
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:04,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's region free.

744
00:49:05,386 --> 00:49:06,366
[SPEAKER_13]: All the games are region free now.

745
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:07,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I come over and play?

746
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:08,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

747
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell him no.

748
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:12,970
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?

749
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?

750
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:22,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you can pick between the Maximum 2, 1 and 2 soundtrack and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack.

751
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:22,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

752
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:28,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you transfer a certain kind of card, you can get a special...

753
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:32,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongan Midnight game.

754
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:33,213
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

755
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,574
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.

756
00:49:35,634 --> 00:49:36,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Post it again.

757
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:37,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid chat.

758
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.

759
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those forums where you have to register to see it.

760
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Give out your registration information.

761
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it on BugMeNot?

762
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:53,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, no, it's fine.

763
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:56,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.

764
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:56,880
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all good.

765
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,401
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

766
00:49:58,421 --> 00:49:59,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks for the correction.

767
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:00,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

768
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:01,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

769
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:03,585
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm good.

770
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:04,405
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

771
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:07,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.

772
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:08,068
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

773
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:08,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

774
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:09,149
[SPEAKER_13]: You too.

775
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

776
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

777
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:13,892
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go back to the phones.

778
00:50:13,912 --> 00:50:22,338
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.

779
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:26,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype and it's taking a little bit of getting used to.

780
00:50:26,078 --> 00:50:28,279
[SPEAKER_13]: I want these little floating windows to go away.

781
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:28,900
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like that.

782
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Those need to go away.

783
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:31,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Shake them.

784
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:32,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it'll work.

785
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:33,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

786
00:50:33,923 --> 00:50:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I so loud?

787
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:35,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

788
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:36,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

789
00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:37,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

790
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

791
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:38,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

792
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,487
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

793
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:39,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

794
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku.

795
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

796
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:42,969
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

797
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:44,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing much.

798
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to chill this weekend.

799
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going through the drama of DDR Freak, but...

800
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:54,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?

801
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Drama, I said.

802
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:56,331
[SPEAKER_04]: The drama.

803
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:57,491
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is new?

804
00:50:57,511 --> 00:50:59,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think I only moderate two forums?

805
00:50:59,912 --> 00:51:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with the general populace.

806
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,674
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just within our city and digital life this year.

807
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we like drama.

808
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:09,376
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up with digital life this year?

809
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,157
[SPEAKER_04]: The rules, basically.

810
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:14,538
[SPEAKER_04]: How folks are chastising.

811
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:15,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just basically...

812
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:20,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?

813
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:34,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

814
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They're straightforward.

815
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:38,736
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, straight PA match.

816
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:40,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Two out of three.

817
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:43,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Shuffle, I believe, will be on at all times with left and right.

818
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:51,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system where every mod they use would just get you extra points.

819
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: When is Digital Life this year?

820
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:55,185
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of September.

821
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,786
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I have a credit with JetBlue.

822
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:57,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I might be able to come back.

823
00:51:58,607 --> 00:51:58,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh really?

824
00:51:58,808 --> 00:51:59,068
[SPEAKER_04]: 27th to the 30th

825
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:11,135
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's cool.

826
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

827
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:14,778
[SPEAKER_04]: You already know Don, right?

828
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Frequency.

829
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:15,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

830
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space within the booth, perhaps.

831
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

832
00:52:26,905 --> 00:52:27,326
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

833
00:52:27,746 --> 00:52:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.

834
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to go to Digital Life.

835
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.

836
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:38,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully this year will be better than last.

837
00:52:38,293 --> 00:52:38,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know.

838
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:40,095
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

839
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,602
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 grand for Expert Division, and I think $1,500 for Freestyle.

840
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:58,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you like to see my Freestyle, Zaku?

841
00:52:59,004 --> 00:52:59,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

842
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:21,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

843
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:22,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think right now.

844
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:29,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for a partner maybe.

845
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:32,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do a solo like last year where I fucked it up.

846
00:53:33,173 --> 00:53:33,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll think about it.

847
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:38,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for $1,500 because that might bring him out of hiding.

848
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:44,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly the country.

849
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll see.

850
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,502
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Zach, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

851
00:53:48,636 --> 00:53:56,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, pretty much just have to rant about, you know, certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school stuff.

852
00:53:57,664 --> 00:54:03,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the store in the village that I know, they have the gold to mark a $40 for a copy of Punch-Out!!

853
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!

854
00:54:06,752 --> 00:54:10,796
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to, because they had some really expensive stuff there.

855
00:54:10,816 --> 00:54:11,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's Video Games New York.

856
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:12,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

857
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:12,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

858
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:19,407
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.

859
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:20,848
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about where you look.

860
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:21,708
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about looking.

861
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:22,569
[SPEAKER_13]: That type of stuff.

862
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:22,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

863
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.

864
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,871
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Zach, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay?

865
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:27,951
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

866
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,292
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe see you at Digital Life.

867
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:29,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

868
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:30,852
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

869
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:31,793
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll look forward to that.

870
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:32,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope so.

871
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:32,633
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

872
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:32,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

873
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:34,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Peace.

874
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:41,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City, and I do have a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year, so maybe.

875
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:42,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I'm so tempted.

876
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:43,625
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

877
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:45,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if we get any more calls.

878
00:54:45,607 --> 00:54:49,831
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

879
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,413
[SPEAKER_13]: But the phones haven't been ringing that much tonight.

880
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:52,554
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess y'all don't have much to say.

881
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.

882
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:57,539
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

883
00:54:58,019 --> 00:54:58,179
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

884
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you have anything tonight?

885
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:01,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

886
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:06,848
[SPEAKER_10]: As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true.

887
00:55:07,669 --> 00:55:07,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

888
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:17,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a little bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis and stuff is coming sooner than later.

889
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:28,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, Kaz Harai has actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3 controller.

890
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:31,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprise.

891
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:34,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble.

892
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:34,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Rumble.

893
00:55:35,385 --> 00:56:04,957
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's also rumors I guess about Mersion's TouchSense technology which might be touch sensitive stuff goody other interesting things let's see here there was there's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing off of oh hooray as if you need an excuse to buy those let's see

894
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,947
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Maxx, PSP Shooter Game

895
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:36,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on in, B-Rangers!

896
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:37,128
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so cool!

897
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:42,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Project Gotham Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race that everybody does.

898
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:04,613
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome

899
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:22,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, let's see.

900
00:57:22,979 --> 00:57:25,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, GSX-8 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.

901
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:27,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it have jiggle-able boobs?

902
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:29,844
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.

903
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just you can take them down the bra and panties, I guess.

904
00:57:32,566 --> 00:57:34,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this is interesting.

905
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:39,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.

906
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:41,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Not interested.

907
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:42,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

908
00:57:42,033 --> 00:57:44,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to love Wing Commander.

909
00:57:44,175 --> 00:57:45,796
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was original Wing Commander, it'd be great.

910
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:47,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, if it was original Wing Commander, I'd be sold.

911
00:57:49,046 --> 00:58:07,371
[SPEAKER_10]: and this I'd like to plug real quick it's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP in fact earlier today I was using it in the chat room and it works pretty good it works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there um

912
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.

913
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:13,225
[SPEAKER_10]: It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.

914
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:18,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, but they apparently have tested it with the Targets Universal IR Wireless Keyboard.

915
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's used for PDAs.

916
00:58:22,093 --> 00:58:26,918
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't have that, there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower, but still you can do it.

917
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:27,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty easy.

918
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, real quick,

919
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:42,559
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.

920
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:50,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's coming from gonintendo.com, but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.

921
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:51,754
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

922
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:18,925
[SPEAKER_13]: An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.

923
00:59:19,406 --> 00:59:26,168
[SPEAKER_13]: After sequestering him in Sao Paulo, they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours to get his password, which they wanted to sell for $8,000.

924
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,789
[SPEAKER_13]: After five hours, the hostage wasn't talking.

925
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:33,692
[SPEAKER_13]: The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time, but the guy didn't say a word.

926
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:36,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.

927
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:38,756
[SPEAKER_13]: The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects, age 19, 27.

928
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:45,481
[SPEAKER_13]: According to police, the captive was the world leader in Gunbound, is who they kidnapped.

929
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,222
[SPEAKER_13]: That guy was the world leader in Gunbound.

930
00:59:47,603 --> 00:59:50,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, you guys probably know about this game.

931
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:51,846
[SPEAKER_13]: You've probably heard of it, have some friends that play it.

932
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,340
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 Gold Farming is Serious Fucking Business

933
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Frisbee says, tell me your fucking password.

934
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:22,851
[SPEAKER_13]: That must have been a very interesting conversation.

935
01:00:22,891 --> 01:00:24,414
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be like an interesting movie plot.

936
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:28,540
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 says, I should start on Gunbound.

937
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?

938
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:33,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

939
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:34,849
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

940
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:36,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's going to do it.

941
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:38,678
[SPEAKER_13]: The Skype line wasn't really ringing in any more calls.

942
01:00:38,938 --> 01:00:41,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.

943
01:00:41,479 --> 01:00:44,881
[SPEAKER_13]: And to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

944
01:00:45,882 --> 01:00:47,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Mikotov, thank you so much for being here this week.

945
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I stayed through the whole thing.

01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:49,684
[SPEAKER_13]: You really did.

947
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:50,304
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very impressed.

948
01:00:50,324 --> 01:00:51,465
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first time in months.

949
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're not going to catch a train to go home.

950
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:55,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's 834.

951
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:56,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh dang it.

952
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:58,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

953
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I do FUs real quick?

954
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:00,570
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

955
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:01,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

956
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,010

[SPEAKER_13]: Any final thoughts?

01:01:09,812 --> 01:01:11,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Survivor a lot.

963
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,573
[SPEAKER_13]: You're so going to get voted out.

964
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:15,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

965
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:16,074

[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

969
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:25,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3 game.

970
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:26,716
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks fun.

971
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:30,977
[SPEAKER_13]: It better be fun because it's expensive.

972
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,704
