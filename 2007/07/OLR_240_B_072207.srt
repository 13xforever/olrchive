00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,040
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening.

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,080
We are here for this Part B of our show and we're going to get right back into the gaming

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,080
news.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,320
Just a reminder, we won't be here next week because we are relocating to a new place,

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,680
which is code word for I'm moving, and Dark Soccer is going to Disneyland, and Loki's

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,600
just taking a night off because he gets one.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,400
If the studio doesn't have good ventilation, I'm buying a wall unit.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm not even joking.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
I will have to fight the cats in the deck.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
Or then we'll move it to your house.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,360
No, because the room that the computer is in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
stuff in it.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Stuff.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,360
We got a laser pointer for the cat.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,040
You got a laser pointer for the cat?

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
Or to point at the cat?

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
To point at the cat.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,680
Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat's head.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
They have those.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,760
So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
That's dangerous.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,440
You get a cat with a freaking laser on it and say, alright, come on, let's get back

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,680
to the gaming news.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,880
Somebody, quick, start us off.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Anyways.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Pac-Man.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
No Pac-Man.

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Aww.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
So, yeah, it's kind of interesting with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,440
We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,320
Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, say, a snowboarding game or skateboarding

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
or whatnot.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,580
But one company that's looking at possibly doing something with it is actually Square

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Enix.

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,840
And they kind of were saying, they were intrigued by the idea of using weight and balance to

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,100
control games.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,140
So possibly, you know, using that in an upcoming RPG.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,560
So that's kind of interesting.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,000
How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have no idea.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
No.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,920
As soon as you fall, oh, zero.

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,200
Maybe dodging or something.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I don't know.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
I don't see anything like that.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
I think it would be good for just like sports games.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,440
Like the next, you know, SSX game or whatever.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Just have that as an optional control method.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,920
Or what we all need, a jump hoping game.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,500
Oh, God.

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,280
That one game they have at Dave and Buster's.

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,600
That horrible game with the music.

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
That's what they need.

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
That jumping rope.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I can't remember what the name of it is.

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm sure somebody in the chat will yell it out that was there.

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
I want to play.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
It's funny.

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
I don't know.

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
It's not at our Dave and Buster's, is it?

63
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Thank you.

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
SSJ100Matt says jump in jackpot.

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
That's what it's called.

66
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
I want to play something where you jump around to music.

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,800
I've never done that before.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,760
It's totally by the people that do Flame and Finger.

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Oh, then it has to be good.

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
It's the same soundtrack?

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
It's similar.

72
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Similar stuff.

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Oh, my God.

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I love Flame and Finger's soundtrack.

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
It's so good.

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
Well, anyway, hold on.

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Jump in jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
tie into a role-playing game.

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,580
It just doesn't make sense.

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,360
Could be for your character walking around, I would assume.

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,240
But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy.

82
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play.

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,360
Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth.

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Now that I could do.

85
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,960
Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass.

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,240
Lean left to cast black magic.

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
Lean right to cast white magic.

88
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I don't know.

89
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Silly.

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,600
Well, one game that won't be using the Wii Fit board or any Wii peripheral for that matter

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,520
is Project Hammer.

92
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
This is going back and forth, though.

93
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Some people...

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,920
Now, there's an earlier report earlier this week that says Project Hammer is not being

95
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
canceled.

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,400
That people were just kind of blowing it out of proportion.

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,240
There was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, disaster is still under development,

98
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,520
speaking about disaster day of crisis.

99
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,080
We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,200
You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,920
Then there was a report on Dig today that said that Project Hammer was gone.

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,880
I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.

103
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,520
Have you heard anything about Project Hammer?

104
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,400
No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story.

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.

106
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,000
They were saying, oh my God, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, an exercise game,

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,800
make a Final Fantasy Health fitness game?

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,720
They're all, no, but we'd more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.

111
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my God, they're working on Final Fantasy

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Fitness.

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
It's like, no, it's sarcasm.

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
Look it up people, what's sarcasm?

115
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,880
I don't know, what is it?

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
How about some other stuff?

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Other stuff?

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,400
Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,960
the pants off of the Xbox 360.

120
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,640
As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 is sold 10.08 million units.

121
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,920
The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.

122
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,860
I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been

123
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,000
up for a shorter amount of time.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,360
As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,200
I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s though, but then

126
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
again, the PSP has been out a long time.

127
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,920
I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
their own PSP or whatever it is, you know.

130
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Mommy, he won't give me my game.

131
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
That

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Exactly that.

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,120
Hence why I don't breed.

134
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?

135
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yes.

136
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,740
It's already proven.

137
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
It all depends.

138
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,040
It probably will just because they keep selling at a consistent rate, but at the same time,

139
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,920
we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves and obviously they're not just going

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,340
to let them take the top spot.

141
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,040
If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,980
decline ever since it reached the peak unless, of course, they come out because I don't really

143
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,560
think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,140
But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.

145
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,120
The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people and it really

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,320
appeals to much broader demographics.

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,640
Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings and that's going to move us a little bit.

148
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Next.

150
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
We have some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelandtrady.com.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,160
We love having the folks talking here.

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,400
Dr. Foeve says, that's not fair.

153
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,540
If the 360 in PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.

154
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
But it's not.

155
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,600
I mean, that's kind of like part of the charm of the Wii and the reason why a lot of families

156
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,360
and soccer moms are going for it is not just the whole like, oh, my kids can get up and

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
move around and so can I.

158
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
But it's cheap.

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
It's cheap on the market.

160
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm considering the hit for people who care about that, which I'm really not, but people

161
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,680
who care about their graphical quality, the Wii is really not as big of a graphic powerhouse

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,800
as the Xbox 360 or the PS3 will be.

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,440
But then again, the people who are playing the Wii are the people who actually like to

164
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
play a good game.

165
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
Well, I don't know.

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,840
I would say care more about game play than they do about how it looks.

167
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,880
But see, there's very few good games on the Wii.

168
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,600
I mean, you got Zelda, yes, but after that, I mean, there's not a lot of like...

169
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Games.

170
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,760
But most of them are like mini games, a lot, a lot, a lot.

171
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
You know what I mean?

172
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Over and over.

173
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
No, there's actual games.

174
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,360
Like maybe Trauma Center, but there's not a lot of like long-lasting type games.

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Even Cookin' Mama lost its thrill for me.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,280
It was more of a DS game for me.

177
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
By the way, I need to borrow that.

178
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,480
There it is.

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Anyways, well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have

180
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
something to brag about.

181
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,720
Other than that, it would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan

182
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,240
than they are Xbox 360s.

183
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,800
Of course, they've reached their 1 million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,440
behind.

185
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,960
But it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies can actually

186
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,160
be pretty good in Japan, I think.

187
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,040
See there's Microsoft's real problem, because in that last story, we were looking at the

188
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,800
worldwide numbers, where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,280
Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still

190
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,320
not cracking the market in Japan, which is interesting, because they've had games like

191
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,640
Blue Dragon now for a little bit, and did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?

192
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
I think it did, or Trusty Bell, whatever it's called.

193
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,520
These games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.

194
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,280
So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide

195
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,240
numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Well, they have 2.5 million Wiis in Japan as well, so, you know, whereas they may be

197
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
outselling the 360, they're still not number one.

198
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,640
But I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market, though, and if

199
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,240
they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,560
U.S. and the U.K.

201
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,840
Well, who knows, maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.

202
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,400
Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,360
know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big

204
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,080
over there in Tokyo as well.

205
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,960
It's going to be in the U.K., actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,400
a U.K. account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.

207
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, those games are actually, it's funny, because actually the demo for Juiced 2 is

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,520
actually not available in Japan, so that won't move any units over there.

209
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,480
FlatOut Racing, by the way, is only available in Europe, as Loki already referred to.

210
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,920
These are new racing games coming out, because, you know, if there's one thing the Xbox 360

211
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,720
is completely lacking, it's racing games.

212
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,120
Now, now, FlatOut, though, you would like FlatOut, because FlatOut is a little bit like

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,000
Burnout, except it's not as fast, but if you crash, you can eject your driver through the

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
windshield.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Ooh, I might have to try this.

216
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,920
Okay, I will download this demo.

217
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,880
I like the idea of an eject button.

218
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,520
Well, speaking of eject, but here's the best part about it, Rob, they have a whole set

219
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,600
of mini-games based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump,

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
all sorts of things.

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,040
Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?

222
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Uh-huh.

223
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Amazing.

224
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,280
How about a stack of Twinkies?

225
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Ew.

227
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,960
Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.

228
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,620
At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a 1.9 billion

229
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,400
dollar loss.

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:40,160
1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said, hey, guess what, the Red Ring of

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,480
Death are bad.

232
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:51,960
However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon, I don't know, we'll see.

233
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Well...

234
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,880
Maybe they'll drop the price for real?

235
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,520
I think that's what's coming, and I think when we talk about that whole sales thing

236
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,320
earlier, I think a price drop is coming, definitely before Christmas, probably about the time

237
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Halo 3 is.

238
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,200
They're gonna bank way too much on Halo 3, pulling in money, and the sad thing is that

239
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I think they will.

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,400
I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.

241
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,280
But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's Halo 3, Project Author Racing 4, Mass Effect,

242
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are...

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Eternal Sonata is the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.

244
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,640
There's a huge lineup, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.

245
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,920
Carcassonne 2?

246
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,200
But Sonya's doing the same thing, they've got a pretty good lineup for the fall, just

247
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,160
there isn't as much.

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Well how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?

249
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,680
Well, it's already impacted them.

250
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,600
They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.

251
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,760
Yeah, they're gonna have to sell millions more systems.

252
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
That's money out of their pocket.

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Well it's not getting any better for them.

254
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,140
Should've done it right the first time, hi!

255
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,640
They're gonna greenlight Halo 4 now.

256
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,440
They're phasing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue, and really,

257
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,360
you know, they are to blame for this, I mean, it's such a simple fix.

258
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,920
The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the

259
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,300
actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.

260
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,840
Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?

261
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Here's why.

262
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,920
Maybe you think it's a baby.

263
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
A lot of people are fascinated by, there's a little mercury switch in there that when

264
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,680
you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the rings always face, like the

265
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,400
one player ring will stay in the top corner.

266
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,480
Did you say people are fascinated by the mercury switch?

267
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,560
Yes.

268
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,720
People are retarded, okay?

269
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,760
Because anybody that's either knocked this thing over or for whatever reason, just playing

270
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,200
the 360 will not scratch your discs.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,760
You have to be doing something wrong for it to scratch your discs, and what's even worse

272
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,280
about it is the whole thing could've been fixed with just a few little pads of foam

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
in there.

274
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,040
We're just not shaking your Xbox 360 to watch the light tip up and down, or take the disc

275
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,200
out if you're gonna do that.

276
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,640
Or even better, just, you know, I don't know, don't be retarded with it.

277
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,480
And yeah, the chatroom agrees over at chat.orangetalk.com.

278
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,700
Blaze says, well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.

279
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,920
And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.

280
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,880
It's like a pinata, you shake it.

281
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,200
Viva pinata, I get it.

282
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,040
You're especially funny tonight, Miklata.

283
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,560
I'm always funny when I talk, over, over.

284
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,760
Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.

285
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,640
It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.

286
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,480
I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that

287
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
knocked it over.

288
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,760
He shot a stapler into him 20 times.

289
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm thinking that would hurt.

290
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,760
That reminds me of that scene in the UHF where he shoots him with the staple gun.

291
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,080
See, that's the thing, though.

292
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,160
I don't understand how, okay, granted, it should've been fixed.

293
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,000
The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar to fix this thing.

294
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know why...

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
That's a whole dollar.

296
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,260
It's less than a dollar, okay, to fix this.

297
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,720
I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.

298
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,220
Either way, though, still, don't jiggle the machine.

299
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,280
It says in the manual not to do it, but then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it

300
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,160
through your TV, and people do that anyway, so I guess, you know...

301
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,660
They want to sue Nintendo.

302
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,680
The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.

303
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,680
I guess, you know, it's like, I don't know what you got to do.

304
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,160
Walk these people through how to handle their console.

305
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
Don't shake the console.

306
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
It doesn't like it.

307
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
It will scratch your disc.

308
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,000
Have you ever seen those posters like Downtown when you're driving or whatever that says

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
don't shake your baby?

310
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
A message from the...

311
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work, and after talking with some

312
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,960
of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaped this guy's

313
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,200
baby and killed her.

314
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh my God.

315
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I mean, it's sad.

316
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,300
I'm not trying to make light of it, but you have to admit it's fascinating that there

317
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,560
is a headquarters dedicated to not shaking babies.

318
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
It's like, dude, common sense.

319
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,440
You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.

320
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,600
Why would you shake them?

321
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,560
Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either, so don't shake it.

322
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:02,400
I want to work for that company and work in their product test support and see if one

323
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
day they make a model of a baby that can be shaking.

324
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Heart babies.

325
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:15,440
I like them when they're quiet.

326
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I like them with a straw in their head to drink.

327
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,160
What is wrong with you?

328
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
So real quick...

329
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Seriously?

330
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,680
Video games, Rob.

331
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
Back to video games.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is video games what caused you to be so violent?

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,880
I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.

334
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,520
Just don't shake babies, and don't shake Xbox 360s, and while you're at it, just don't

335
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,520
shake people or things in general unless they're stupid and then throttle them, or unless it's

336
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,280
a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.

337
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
That is funny.

338
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Nothing else is.

339
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
You can shake your booty.

340
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,640
Well, yes, and watch me shake my ass right now.

341
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Here's the better part.

342
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
That's the whole thing.

343
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Right in front of my face, though.

344
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Thank you.

345
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,760
The plaintiff to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when

346
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,800
the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrote copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints

347
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Row.

348
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,360
A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell

349
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
disc.

350
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,080
Okay, she purchased it for her son.

351
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
How old is her son?

352
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,760
Because I think those are all M-rated games.

353
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Hmm?

354
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Hmm?

355
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Yeah.

356
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:38,040
Anyways, I'm sorry, assuming that he is the proper age to use or to play those games,

357
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm sorry, wouldn't you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.

358
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

359
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
What's that grinding noise?

360
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.

361
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Hmm, it makes the noise again.

362
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh, we better sue them because we're at $150.

363
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,080
Boo-fucking-hoo.

364
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,240
I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement, so if we may,

365
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,760
let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio Public Service Announcement.

366
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Camera please.

367
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Alright, thank you.

368
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Ready?

369
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Lights, camera, and action.

370
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:29,800
Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:37,200
360 because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Also, please don't shake children.

373
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,960
That was the worst public service announcement ever.

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,720
Can we get back into stories, please?

375
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
No.

376
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Well, the next story is mine.

377
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
Okay, fine.

378
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
Let's talk about Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360.

379
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
That's okay, never mind.

380
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
No, seriously.

381
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Seriously, I know.

382
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,480
I don't know why I'm bringing this up, but Metal Gear Solid 4 again is rumored to go

383
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,640
on the Xbox 360, and I'm thinking, did they just not have E3 happen, and did they not

384
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this, blah, blah,

385
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
blah?

386
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,600
Well, the official Xbox Magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the

387
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,880
Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version, and this is just after Kazumi Kitawe

388
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,040
said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it

389
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,760
as a PlayStation game, but we might have to take some steps, and that's the whole reason

390
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,780
why people are thinking again it's coming to the Xbox 360.

391
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm just thinking, let it go!

392
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Let it go!

393
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Here's the other thing, though.

394
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,240
To argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told...

395
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,120
I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.

396
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,160
Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?

397
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,320
And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming

398
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,760
out for Xbox 360, because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual really

399
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,000
good exclusive game coming to their platform.

400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this, and this comes up a week

401
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,040
after E3, when they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.

402
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,520
If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the

403
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,140
releases, because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved

404
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,120
it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.

405
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
So I don't know.

406
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,440
I just get very bothered by all these constant, like every week there's some new stupid rumor

407
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,520
about Metal Gear Solid 4 around all the different game blogs.

408
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,400
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

409
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,580
But I mean, it's going to be a long time after the release of the initial game, right?

410
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,360
If it does happen, it'll be a long time after, right?

411
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Right.

412
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I think so.

413
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,040
When I have to read the same news story four, five times across the scope of a couple months

414
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,400
just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world, I get angsty.

415
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,460
I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the

416
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,800
FUs of the Week.

417
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,360
Jamie, start us off please with the FUs of the Week.

418
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,800
I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.

419
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,400
First of all, I'd like to say FU to laminate flooring because, okay, this is how I broke

420
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
my ribs.

421
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay.

422
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
I had just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.

423
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,240
I did not even sit down.

424
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
I just stepped into the tub and my phone rang.

425
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,080
So I stepped out, dried off my feet.

426
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,240
I made sure to dry off my feet, stepped into the hallway and down I went.

427
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,600
And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and

428
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
I thought that all I hurt was my knee.

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,440
The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue and I hurt quite a bit.

430
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,400
So I went to the doctor that day and he put me in a lot of Vicodin.

431
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,680
And I'm fully functional on Vicodin.

432
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,640
I can go to my job and do my work and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing.

433
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,860
But when I take it, I can't really do...

434
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm not the multitasker I normally am and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at

435
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
once.

436
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I don't pay attention to that many things.

437
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:40,680
So I was in a conversation with somebody who is a wonderful, funny person, very nice person

438
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,920
who I think takes things a little too personally sometimes.

439
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,160
She linked me to this product that I didn't think was very funny.

440
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,360
It's a bird feeder that flings squirrels off.

441
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,040
That's sad for squirrels.

442
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
I know squirrels.

443
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,200
Well, see, that's what I thought.

444
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,420
I like squirrels better than birds.

445
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,320
And I thought it was funny, I thought it was a good product as long as it doesn't hurt

446
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
the poor squirrels.

447
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,480
How about a bird feeder that flings birds off?

448
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
That would be funny.

449
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
That would be great.

450
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
I like birds though, too.

451
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,080
I used to actually buy bird feeders that squirrels could get on and I would put nuts in it.

452
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Or a bird feeder that kicks them in the nuts.

453
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,320
No, no, let me finish, okay?

454
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,320
And so, it's just like, sorry for offending you and slide off.

455
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm not saying I'm who it is because I'm a nice person.

456
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,760
But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended and I was offended now, you

457
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
know what I mean?

458
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,600
It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions

459
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
about how they feel.

460
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,680
Ask them first, how do you feel?

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,000
All you're going to do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
be caused.

463
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,600
You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.

464
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Don't make assumptions.

465
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,960
All it does is make an ass out of you and only you, okay?

466
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,160
You know, I think that it's just this whole, oh, I don't want to offend people and I don't

467
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,560
want to, well then fucking ask.

468
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,040
You know, what's the worst thing they're going to say?

469
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,800
Oh, you know, I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want

470
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,640
to talk about it, they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and

471
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
respect it.

472
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,240
You know, don't just assume because then I've been, you know, pissed off now for three days

473
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,720
over this and you know, I'm a good, I'm a good person, I think I'm a good person, you

474
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
know.

475
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Don't you think I'm a good person?

476
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Yeah, okay.

477
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,200
But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping

478
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,800
on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you

479
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
don't step on them.

480
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
That's what I think.

481
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Good?

482
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
All finished?

483
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:58,600
I think that I was fairly, um, I had tact in my words, don't you think?

484
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,440
I was going to say tactical, but that's what you're trying to kill people.

485
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,640
Okay, we got to keep it going.

486
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Loki, your FU is the weed.

487
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,480
FU to paper Mario sucking.

488
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,680
Why did I spend $10 on that?

489
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,880
My FU of the week goes to Shane, um, because he was plotting against me in the beginning

490
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,920
of Survivor LJ to get me kicked out and, uh, you're, you're a jerk.

491
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Still does.

492
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Hey, wait a minute.

493
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Wait a minute.

494
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Whoa.

495
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I get FU, right?

496
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Yes.

497
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Your turn.

498
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
F U.

499
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Oh, crap.

500
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
I had one.

501
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Where did it go?

502
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Okay.

503
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I have two FUs.

504
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,920
One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.

505
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,680
FU to Europe or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent

506
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,120
Hill Arcade game and it looks really sweet and I want to play it so bad, um, and I'm

507
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,520
not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will someday.

508
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,440
And then FU to, um, next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be

509
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:10,920
the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices, and that'll be the end of that.

510
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Okay.

511
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,280
That's that.

512
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,640
All done with the FUs of the week.

513
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,760
Let's move on and back into the gaming news, then.

514
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Well, and this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name, but there's

515
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,720
a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have, uh, seen, uh, in Famitsu scans

516
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,060
named Rosetta, and I just want to, I think Stone instantly, because you know the Rosetta

517
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,040
Stone was a big translator thing.

518
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Anyway.

519
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,680
So, she used to hang out with Daisy and Peach and, and, watch your face, who wasn't even

520
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,040
a princess from the first game, Pauline.

521
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,240
She was a princess, she was just some hoochie from New York, so she doesn't need to be

522
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
the princesses.

523
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Pauline.

524
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,920
She's not good enough to be a princess, she's just a hooker.

525
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Pauline wasn't in, uh, the Super Mario Brothers movie, was she?

526
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
She's Donkey Kong.

527
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
I don't think so.

528
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
She's just Donkey Kong.

529
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
She's Mario Brothers First Love.

530
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,960
And that's when he found out his, that Peach would put out, I guess, I don't know.

531
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,800
But, um, she's, she's, I guess, pretty.

532
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,120
If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess, no, I don't know.

533
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,260
Well, fear not, folks, um, we talked a little bit about the Wii Balance Board and Part A,

534
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,640
but, um, Nintendo has come out to promise that there will be, they will be making more

535
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,040
Balance Board based games, so it's, you're not going to be buying this thing for only

536
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
one game.

537
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Hooray!

538
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
What else are they developing?

539
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Have they said anything?

540
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
No!

541
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
They did not.

542
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,760
They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.

543
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,600
Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of mini games?

544
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,480
Possibly, and I'm going to guess, uh, the next WarioWare game.

545
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
Oh, God, probably.

546
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
That would make sense.

547
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,440
That might be fun, though.

548
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,360
I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.

549
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,200
Well, this might be kind of fun on the Wii as well, even though I already own this game

550
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,760
on the Xbox 360, but Rockstar Table Tennis is coming out for the Wii.

551
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400
Rockstar has confirmed that the game is coming out, but that's really about it.

552
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,840
It's just saying that the game is coming, it will take full advantage of the Wii Remote

553
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,280
and everything that comes with that, and, uh, there's another quote here, quote, a new

554
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,240
audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put

555
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
down.

556
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,480
Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier

557
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,120
games I enjoy, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to

558
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
change on the Wii.

559
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,520
As long as they had the Nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote beard, with a paddle,

560
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
is that what it's called?

561
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Yeah.

562
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Then I don't see any problem with it.

563
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
It should be actually pretty fun.

564
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,280
I wonder how this is going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball,

565
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,480
because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the

566
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,360
ball that was coming at you, and the tiny color that surrounded it so you could tell

567
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,720
what way it was spinning, and then you counter with different types of spins.

568
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,800
Maybe hold down an A button when you do it, or the this button back here that you guys

569
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
can see me pointing at with my imaginary Wiimote.

570
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,320
I don't know which one this is called anymore because I don't own a Wii anymore.

571
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Why did you get rid of your Wii?

572
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Because I didn't play it.

573
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
I let it stay broken for like five months.

574
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Who'd you sell it to?

575
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
How'd you sell it?

576
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,440
I had a friend of a friend that wanted one, so I was like, give me money, I'll give you

577
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
this Wii.

578
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
But wasn't it a broken Wii?

579
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Like you had to send it back to Nintendo?

580
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
I sent it back to Nintendo.

581
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
They gave me a brand new one completely.

582
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Oh, okay.

583
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
So.

584
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
So you sold your friend a brand new Wii?

585
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Yes.

586
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Amazing.

587
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,720
Just like how I sold my friend my 360 one time, and like a month later it got the Red

588
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Rings of Death.

589
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,640
I felt really happy about that because I avoided it.

590
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
You are evil.

591
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Yes.

592
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
All right.

593
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,840
Well, I'll definitely check out the game when it comes to the Wii, but I don't know if I

594
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,200
want to spend all that money on it.

595
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,480
That's why I wish the Wii had demos.

596
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,280
But if they had demos, then how would they get you to buy $10 games for Nintendo 64 on

597
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,760
it?

598
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Good question.

599
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,200
Maybe you should have played them when they originally came out, then you would know if

600
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,160
they sucked or not.

601
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,000
But I can get videos on Nintendo.com.

602
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Great.

603
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,720
I can watch YouTube.

604
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,200
So guess what?

605
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
What?

606
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,920
Atari likes horses, and people who love horses.

607
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,800
They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii DS and PC that, from what I

608
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,320
can understand, it's a horse-raising and riding simulation.

609
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,800
Ride them horses, huh?

610
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,360
Well, they're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing

611
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,440
the horse-enthusiastic community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take

612
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,280
care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.

613
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,480
Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game

614
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
players?

615
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,400
I know, but they're the same type that play video games?

616
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,680
I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar

617
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Hero Drunk.

618
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
One.

619
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
So you know one.

620
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,280
Out of all the horse games, though, out there, you should consider this one, because the

621
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,800
game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.

622
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,480
I think I would play it.

623
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,360
Take that, Final Furlong.

624
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,080
You know what I say to this game?

625
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Nay.

626
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,480
I think I'm going to get the game.

627
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I really think I'll play it.

628
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,040
Well, have fun.

629
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,440
Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?

630
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
That might make me change my mind.

631
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
That might be kind of fun.

632
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Maybe.

633
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,800
And then I can name the horse Britney Spears, and I can whip Britney Spears, just like it

634
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,280
was Derby Owners Club.

635
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,600
I love Derby Owners Club, okay?

636
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I know you do.

637
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
There you go.

638
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,940
The Rob D says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate

639
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
horse physics.

640
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,940
I'm glad they listened.

641
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,120
I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.

642
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I don't know.

643
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Possibly.

644
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,280
Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar, Bully.

645
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,720
The scholarship edition is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.

646
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,520
So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft

647
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,480
Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.

648
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,240
Hopefully you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.

649
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,080
But I don't know.

650
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
It got a teen rating before.

651
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,640
I don't see why we get any more than a teen rating now.

652
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,520
I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.

653
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,540
Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2, because I was

654
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,760
so immersed in my 360 at that time.

655
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,700
I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all, so I can play it in high

656
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,800
def and widescreen and all that good stuff.

657
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,680
And I believe it will have new content as well for it, so...

658
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,480
More guys to make out with?

659
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,760
Yes, more guys to make out with.

660
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Hooray!

661
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,160
Imagine what you could do with the Wii mode.

662
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
I don't know, Miklotov.

663
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
What?

664
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
You could write on the chalkboards.

665
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Oh, okay.

666
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
You could.

667
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,280
What were you thinking?

668
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
I don't know.

669
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Geez.

670
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
That's why I had to ask.

671
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:10,720
Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.

672
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,480
But here's the interesting thing.

673
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,840
It's not supposed to be a fighting game.

674
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,280
Basically in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine, Guilty Gear 2 Overture was revealed to be

675
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,960
a game a lot more like Soul Calibur Legends.

676
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,160
It's an action title and also has a little bit of adventure thrown in for good measure.

677
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,320
It's not a fighting game, but who cares?

678
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,480
I'm sure a lot of fans of Guilty Gear are going to eat this up anyway, right?

679
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,320
It does our soul bad guy.

680
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Soul is awesome.

681
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
I love Soul Bad Guy.

682
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Soul Bad Guy is great.

683
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,000
And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.

684
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,800
Who looks like Kai, but who to that?

685
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,720
I liked Eno.

686
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,280
I was a fan of Zappa, love Zappa.

687
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
And I love Faust.

688
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Oh, yeah.

689
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Faust, of course.

690
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I like Venom too.

691
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,960
And I'm sad though, because this is before I lost all that weight, as I cosplayed Biken,

692
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
which Dan didn't like because of like, you know, boob.

693
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,120
But I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.

694
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
That's awesome.

695
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,480
Did he rape you with his scalpel, like in the game?

696
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,760
I actually did hit him with the claw by accident, but I had to give the claw back to Evan because

697
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,320
it was part of his toys.

698
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,360
I won't say anything else.

699
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,960
I'll tell you off of the show.

700
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Okay.

701
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
There you go then.

702
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Ah!

703
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.

704
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm kind of disappointed.

705
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
Hey, is it my turn again?

706
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,680
Yes, it is your turn again.

707
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,720
Speaking of all things devilish, there is a Capcom 2D fighting game called Sengoku Basara

708
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:55,960
X, or I should say pronounced as Cross, but it's a Devil Kings fighting game.

709
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,840
It is actually based on, well Devil Kings is the name it's known by in North America.

710
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:12,000
You get the Devil Kings, Scorpio, Azure Dragon, Forced, and Iron Ox, at least what their names

711
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
are in the U.S.

712
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,840
But the game's supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.

713
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm looking forward to that.

714
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I know the series.

715
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,360
I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game.

716
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,800
I don't think there was that many characters, but it can't be any worse than the actual

717
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,680
Devil Kings game.

718
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,320
So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS, and it was interesting

719
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:43,720
because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerard to comment on it.

720
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,820
Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.

721
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,640
People have made concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing, obviously,

722
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
has come out.

723
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,600
So they're saying, Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games or license them.

724
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,200
So I don't know, will it ever get created?

725
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Who knows.

726
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:13,800
But, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.

727
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,440
Like what is created as jokes or what?

728
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,160
Like pitching, like, hey, we want to bring Halo to the DS.

729
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
Here's what we can do with it, and then showing them off again.

730
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,120
What's the problem if Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market?

731
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
What's the problem?

732
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,120
There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.

733
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,240
Who says it won't happen at some point?

734
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
It'd be weird.

735
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,000
It'd be very weird.

736
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,920
I kind of think, though, a little bit like, I don't know if it's a good thing because

737
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,200
I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the CDI, remember the Mario

738
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
and the...

739
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Oh, yes.

740
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,640
Wanda Gamelan and all that stuff.

741
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
All the games.

742
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Yeah.

743
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,040
But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that'd be pretty awesome.

744
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,240
You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher

745
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,520
end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.

746
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,360
That'd be pretty cool.

747
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Good stuff.

748
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
All right.

749
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,400
Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which, of course, is where the Halo series will soon

750
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,720
show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.

751
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,880
The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can

752
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,440
now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.

753
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,800
Here's a quote from the person who did it, I successfully changed the DVD key and region

754
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,160
code of a 360, so it's all confirmed.

755
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,520
All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how

756
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,320
to modify and re-sign the KV contents, but, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might

757
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,040
be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably

758
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,560
close this loophole pretty soon.

759
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
They usually do.

760
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I think they already have.

761
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,040
I think it's just on some of the older kernels they can do that.

762
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,920
The Rob D says, oh, that's all he did?

763
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,880
I can't believe I didn't think of that.

764
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,040
I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier

765
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
in the program.

766
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
I don't know.

767
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Maybe.

768
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
All right.

769
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,120
And then Shadow Charlie says, brick, the Xbox 360's going to be a brick pretty soon.

770
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,760
They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack

771
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
it.

772
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,200
It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disk.

773
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:32,640
Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know,

774
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
taint it.

775
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,800
That'd be funny.

776
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,160
Well, there is actually just a little bit more information that I have that some people

777
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
might be happy about.

778
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,520
Me, I don't really give two shits about.

779
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,520
But Far Cry 2 will be coming out.

780
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,560
I'm really, I don't know, I never played the first one enough to care about it.

781
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
I don't know anything about it.

782
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,440
I'm surprised that they did announce Far Cry 2 coming out, because I always thought Crisis

783
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
was Far Cry 2, and I guess I was wrong.

784
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,200
Doesn't it seem like it's been a long time since the first one came out?

785
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
2004, wasn't it?

786
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,040
Yeah, it just seems kind of weird that they would wait that long to announce a second

787
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
game.

788
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,940
Well, it's scheduled for a 2008 release.

789
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,360
Could it be the movie and all?

790
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,520
You want to tie a game that could possibly be good.

791
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Right.

792
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm just theorizing.

793
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Jesus.

794
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,160
That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in House of the Dead the movie

795
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
or something.

796
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Should I tie that in?

797
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,800
Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.

798
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,480
No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.

799
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,960
I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.

800
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,540
That was kind of neat.

801
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,140
Just makes me miss time splitters even more.

802
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,520
So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in

803
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,720
Far Cry 2?

804
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I don't know.

805
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,240
I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crisis, because Crisis

806
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,400
looks like such an amazing game, and Far Cry was pretty good when it came out originally.

807
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,600
Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle, I don't know, just improve

808
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
upon it.

809
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,880
It was a pretty good game to begin with.

810
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,440
Some of the AI though in the first game was a little weird, so maybe tune that up a bit,

811
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,560
but if the AI is good, and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty

812
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,080
good game.

813
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,200
If you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up, because it's dirt cheap now

814
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,040
and it's actually pretty fun.

815
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,280
Alright, well, let's move on.

816
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,680
Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?

817
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes, we got one, and it's kind of interesting.

818
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,100
Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.

819
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:54,440
Apparently they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had

820
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
hoped.

821
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,400
This is kind of stemming from the showing of 2Human at E3.

822
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,840
Apparently some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.

823
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,600
Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.

824
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,640
I know that they're not the only company that's been having trouble with it.

825
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,560
I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.

826
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,560
In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.

827
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:34,200
So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing, maybe.

828
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,280
Is it just hard to work with?

829
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,560
They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.

830
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,000
It sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised, about this whole, like,

831
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,240
there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.

832
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,680
But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers so we

833
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
can read it for ourselves.

834
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
That'll be exciting.

835
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,600
DJ Jenai in our chat room says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.

836
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,200
That's old school right there.

837
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
I love that game.

838
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,580
There was the One Must Fall Battlegrounds that came out, remember online, it was like

839
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,080
a battle arena game.

840
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,780
It's not over yet if you want to play that.

841
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
You never know.

842
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,720
All right, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.

843
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,340
If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name is Orange

844
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
Lounge Radio.

845
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
Who would have thought?

846
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,920
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our user name.

847
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,360
And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.

848
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,320
And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.

849
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,680
I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.

850
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,960
So let's go to the phones.

851
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

852
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
Who's this?

853
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Raven's Dolphin.

854
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
How are you?

855
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Good.

856
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
And I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical

857
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
difficulties.

858
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,240
What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

859
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
The Epic thing.

860
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,800
A lot of things are on my mind actually, but the Epic thing really.

861
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
What about the Epic thing?

862
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
The whole lawsuit?

863
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Yeah.

864
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,000
Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?

865
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,080
Yes, according to Loki.

866
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
I don't know.

867
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,200
I haven't checked my Wikipedia.

868
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Is that it?

869
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Yeah.

870
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.

871
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Oh.

872
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,680
Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion and everything?

873
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Because now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.

874
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,600
Do you find that Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they

875
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,880
try to get this engine?

876
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,760
It feels like they're a bunch of... You know how Epic has got this game that's really popular?

877
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,560
I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.

878
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
A bunch of people go, I can't get this to work.

879
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Damn it.

880
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Let's just sue them.

881
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,640
Well, that's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other

882
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,000
companies, that's what you got to do to make money.

883
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,360
If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you

884
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,680
think you can sell them.

885
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,520
Yeah, and they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.

886
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,320
You're getting some agreement from our chat room.

887
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,480
Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.

888
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,640
Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.

889
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
That's a first.

890
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
That's a first.

891
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,720
All right, and DJ Genai says Epic has a big ego too.

892
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,200
They do, but they do make good games, but it feels like... I'm playing Rainbow Six,

893
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,280
which is an Unreal Tournament game, an Unreal technology game, and it works fine.

894
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,880
I don't know what they're doing.

895
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,160
Sephiroth1215 says they weren't really a Nintendo developer, they just made all the games on

896
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
GameCube.

897
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Okay.

898
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,760
All right, well what else is on your mind?

899
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,420
What else is on my mind?

900
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,120
The Wii board, you said that the Wii snowboard... Not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.

901
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,840
Fit board could be used as a snowboard, I suppose, in a game.

902
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,600
Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.

903
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Remember 1080?

904
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
Yeah.

905
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:56,240
Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?

906
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,520
Or tricky, SSX tricky, with that theme song I can never get out of my head.

907
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
It's tricky.

908
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Yeah.

909
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,160
I can't wait for that.

910
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,120
Blaze agrees with you in chat, 1080 for the win.

911
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,440
So you think they could do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with

912
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
this board?

913
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,440
Snowboarding.

914
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
I really do.

915
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,240
Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.

916
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,720
I'm a real snowboarding fan.

917
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,520
I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.

918
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,440
How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license

919
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,560
the thing?

920
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,960
What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit board?

921
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,160
I've been thinking about it.

922
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
I don't know.

923
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,440
It would probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like ripoff game.

924
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
I don't know.

925
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,040
I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the

926
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,720
board, yeah, cast a spell, yeah, do this.

927
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,440
Maybe it would be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's Angels, you know,

928
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,960
you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.

929
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
It would be fun.

930
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Doesn't that sound like fun?

931
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,840
That does sound like fun, but I'm really excited, you know.

932
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,960
I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.

933
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,320
Well, and you shouldn't until you get to play it, because a lot of people pass judgment

934
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,840
on the Wii, but change their minds when they actually get to play it.

935
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,080
Oh, one last thing.

936
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,040
You don't sound like Vodafin anymore.

937
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,040
Good for you.

938
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,240
I don't sound like what?

939
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,440
You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.

940
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,880
That might be the new Skype.

941
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,600
I think the quality has increased slightly, so.

942
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
What's a Vodge?

943
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Why am I so loud?

944
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,840
A Vodge is what a lady has between...

945
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
I thought he said Vodge.

946
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
I was like, what the crap?

947
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,840
It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.

948
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Vonage.

949
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
Vonage.

950
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,560
No, a Vodge is something completely different.

951
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,840
No, I said, I had a D when I said it.

952
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,840
Vodge.

953
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
A Vodge is where the babies come from.

954
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,200
And then you shake them.

955
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
Stop it.

956
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
All right.

957
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,120
I got to go, so you can pick up some more calls.

958
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
All right, you got it, Ravis Dolphin.

959
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Talk to you later.

960
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,680
I think I made him uncomfortable.

961
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,680
I think you did.

962
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
That was fun.

963
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
Let's do it again.

964
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
Do it again?

965
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Make him uncomfortable again?

966
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,680
I want to make somebody else uncomfortable.

967
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
All right.

968
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

969
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Who's this?

970
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,880
Hi, GS68.

971
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,800
Hi GS68, what's on your mind?

972
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,360
You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long Gun Midnight for

973
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
the PS3, right?

974
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,200
I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?

975
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Yeah.

976
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
All right, what's up?

977
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,960
There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.

978
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
Well, that's...

979
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,240
But, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?

980
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,820
Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.

981
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
How is it?

982
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
I haven't played it yet.

983
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,000
Actually, I haven't tried it yet.

984
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm just waiting for Sanibel Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.

985
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,240
Ah, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and then, you know, it's a big chain.

986
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,680
They get a lot of the hottest games.

987
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Why not?

988
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
Yeah, let me just post...

989
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
I'm going to post a link in chat room, so...

990
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
All right.

991
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
Just so you all know.

992
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,400
I am planning on buying it, though.

993
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I think I've decided.

994
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,720
You think you are going to import it?

995
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
You know why I checked out first?

996
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Yeah, because...

997
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,000
Well, because I just, you know, I only have like one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be

998
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,240
cool to have an import game.

999
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Yeah, it might be fun.

1000
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,400
Although, it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing, and then the damn thing doesn't

1001
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
work.

1002
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
That's going to suck.

1003
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
It's region-free.

1004
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,400
All right.

1005
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
All the games are region-free now.

1006
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Can I come over and play?

1007
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Yeah.

1008
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
Tell him no.

1009
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,040
GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?

1010
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,760
Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?

1011
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,180
I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you pick between the Maximum 2 1 and 2 soundtrack

1012
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:26,920
and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack, and then if you transfer a certain kind of card,

1013
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,800
you can get a special soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongdon Midnight game.

1014
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
That's cool.

1015
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,680
Now, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.

1016
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
Post it again.

1017
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Stupid chat.

1018
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,280
Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.

1019
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,240
It's one of those forums where you have to register to see any...

1020
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,240
Give out your registration information.

1021
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,560
Is it on bug me not?

1022
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
All right.

1023
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,120
No, it's fine.

1024
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,480
I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.

1025
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,480
It's all good.

1026
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Okay.

1027
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
All right.

1028
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
Well, thanks for the correction.

1029
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Appreciate it.

1030
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1031
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
No, I'm good.

1032
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
All right.

1033
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,480
All right.

1034
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.

1035
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
All right.

1036
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
Take care.

1037
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
All right.

1038
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
You too.

1039
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Bye-bye.

1040
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
All right.

1041
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
We'll go back to the phones.

1042
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,520
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

1043
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,600
and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.

1044
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,620
Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype, and it's taken a little bit of getting

1045
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,620
used to.

1046
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,360
I want these little floating windows to go away.

1047
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
I don't like that.

1048
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,200
Those need to go away.

1049
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Shake them.

1050
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
Maybe it'll work.

1051
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Stop it.

1052
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Why am I so loud?

1053
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
I don't know.

1054
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Hi.

1055
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Oh, snap.

1056
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Hello.

1057
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Oh, snap.

1058
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Hi.

1059
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Hi.

1060
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1061
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Who's this?

1062
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Legend of Zaku.

1063
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1064
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
What's on your mind?

1065
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Nah, nothing much.

1066
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Just trying to chill this weekend.

1067
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,040
Just going through the trauma of DDR Freak, but that's another story.

1068
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,320
Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?

1069
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,600
Drama, I said.

1070
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,600
The drama.

1071
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
What else is new?

1072
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Why haven't you left?

1073
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Why do you think I only moderate two forums?

1074
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,720
No, it has nothing to do with the general populace.

1075
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,240
It's just within our city and digital life this year.

1076
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
We like drama.

1077
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,920
What's up with digital life this year?

1078
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:22,840
The rules, basically how folks are chastising, they're just having arguments over the rules

1079
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,720
this year instead of having a point system for every mod, they actually got adapted two

1080
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,980
out of three, straight perfect attack.

1081
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,720
I'm just going to ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?

1082
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Not really.

1083
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,720
They're straight four.

1084
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:42,600
As I said, straight PA match, two out of three shuffle I believe will be on at all times

1085
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,920
with left and right, but yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system

1086
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,000
where every mod they used would just get you extra points.

1087
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,340
When is digital life this year?

1088
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,480
At the end of September.

1089
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,080
You know I have a credit with JetBlue, I might be able to come back.

1090
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Oh really?

1091
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,440
Yes, something happened with JetBlue last time I have a credit.

1092
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,760
27th through 30th.

1093
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,800
Thinking about it, because I know I'd have a place to stay if I went, so we'll see.

1094
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,680
No, that's cool.

1095
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,720
Think about it.

1096
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
You already know Don, right?

1097
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
You know frequency.

1098
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
Yep.

1099
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,680
Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space

1100
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,560
within the booth, perhaps, so he can set up his solo.

1101
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,800
I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.

1102
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,160
I would love to go to digital life.

1103
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,540
I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.

1104
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,560
Hopefully this year will be better than last.

1105
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:46,200
Besides all the drama, these new rules hopefully, from what I've been hearing, will draw most

1106
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,920
of the good players from the country.

1107
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
What is he giving away?

1108
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,920
He's giving away a big prize.

1109
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,920
He's giving away the DDR tournament this year.

1110
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Three grand.

1111
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
Huh?

1112
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Three grand for expert division.

1113
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Shit.

1114
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Three grand?

1115
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
I might want to enter that.

1116
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,920
My God.

1117
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
And I think 1,500 for freestyle.

1118
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
Oh my God.

1119
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
1,500 bucks for freestyle?

1120
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,520
You know the price is regular.

1121
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,160
You could totally get a new PS3 with that, and that's it.

1122
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,720
I could pay off some credit card bills with that.

1123
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,720
Come on.

1124
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
What are you talking about?

1125
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
That's great.

1126
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,720
I'll have to think about that.

1127
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,720
Maybe I should come up with a new freestyle.

1128
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,720
Wouldn't you like to see my freestyle, Zaku?

1129
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
I don't know.

1130
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,720
I'm trying to think right now.

1131
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,640
I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for another for a partner

1132
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,120
maybe, and I want to do a solo, like last year where I fucked it up.

1133
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
I'll think about it.

1134
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
You know what?

1135
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,880
I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for 1,500 because that might

1136
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,880
bring him out of hiding.

1137
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,120
Oh yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly

1138
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,120
the country.

1139
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah, we'll see.

1140
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
All right, Zaku.

1141
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,600
Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

1142
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:56,320
Pretty much just have the rant about certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school

1143
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
stuff.

1144
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,000
Like the store in the Village that I know, they have the gold to mark up $40 for a copy

1145
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,720
of Punch Out, Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

1146
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,400
I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to because they had some really expensive

1147
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
stuff.

1148
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah, that's Video Games New York.

1149
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Yeah.

1150
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,800
But the thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.

1151
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,100
It's all about where you look.

1152
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,100
It's all about looking.

1153
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,100
That type of stuff.

1154
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,100
I know.

1155
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.

1156
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,100
All right, Zaku.

1157
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,100
We've got to let you go.

1158
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
But have a good one, okay?

1159
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
All right.

1160
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,100
And maybe see you at Digital Life.

1161
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Maybe.

1162
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,100
All right.

1163
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
We'll look forward to that.

1164
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,100
I hope so.

1165
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,100
We'll see you.

1166
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Bye.

1167
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,100
Peace.

1168
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City and I do have

1169
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,720
a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year.

1170
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,720
So maybe.

1171
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,720
Ooh, I'm so tempted.

1172
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,720
We'll see.

1173
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Let's see if we get any more calls.

1174
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,480
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE RADIO but the phones haven't

1175
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
been ringing that much tonight.

1176
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,840
I guess you all don't have much to say.

1177
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,440
I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.

1178
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
No.

1179
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
No?

1180
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,720
Loki, you have anything tonight?

1181
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,920
Yeah.

1182
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:09,040
As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true and here's a little

1183
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,480
bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis

1184
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,320
and stuff is coming sooner than later.

1185
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:29,400
Anyways, Kaz Horizon actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3

1186
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
controller.

1187
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Surprise.

1188
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,560
And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble and there's also rumors I guess

1189
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:44,200
about Immersion's touch-sensitive technology which might be touch-sensitive stuff.

1190
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,320
Goodie.

1191
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,760
Other interesting things.

1192
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,040
Let's see here.

1193
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,560
There's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing

1194
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,840
off of.

1195
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,680
Oh, hooray.

1196
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,660
As if you need an excuse to buy those.

1197
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,660
Let's see.

1198
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:14,120
Now, you may remember Sonic and Mario at the Olympics is going to come out later this year.

1199
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,460
Also though, that's not the only Olympics games being released.

1200
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,040
In the UK, Asterix at the Olympics is also going to be making its way out there.

1201
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,800
So that should be pretty interesting.

1202
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,920
And then this one also looks very interesting to me.

1203
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:38,320
The DJ Maxx developers are announcing a brand new PSP shooter game called S4 Portable.

1204
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:45,120
And no word on, it's a stylish shooting sports game I guess.

1205
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,840
And it's also going to feature some of the characters from DJ Maxx in it as well.

1206
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
So that's pretty awesome.

1207
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,960
Come on and be Rangers.

1208
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,680
They're so cool.

1209
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,600
Another thing, Project Anthem Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race

1210
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,800
that everybody does.

1211
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,760
They're actually going to have a database online where you can upload every single race

1212
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
you race.

1213
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,560
Is that like what they do for Halo?

1214
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,760
Possibly.

1215
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,120
Very interesting.

1216
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Quick comments from chatroom on these various stories.

1217
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,200
GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome.

1218
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,920
So GS68 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.

1219
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,440
Does it have jiggleable boobs?

1220
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,200
No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.

1221
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,300
You can just take them down the broad in panties I guess.

1222
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,460
This is interesting.

1223
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:40,740
Next week we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.

1224
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,740
Not interested.

1225
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,740
Sorry.

1226
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,160
I used to love Wing Commander.

1227
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,180
If it was original Wing Commander I'd be sold.

1228
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,020
And this I'd like to plug real quick.

1229
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:57,880
It's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP.

1230
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,040
In fact, earlier today I was using it in the chatroom and it works pretty good.

1231
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:08,240
It works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there.

1232
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,320
So check it out.

1233
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,640
It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.

1234
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,000
I didn't.

1235
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,160
But they apparently have tested it with the Targis universal IR wireless keyboard.

1236
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,200
I guess it's used for PDAs.

1237
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,720
But if you don't have that there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower

1238
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,000
but still you can do it.

1239
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,900
It's pretty easy.

1240
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:36,760
And then real quick, there's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be

1241
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:44,560
published by Nintendo or published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.

1242
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:50,560
It's coming from gonintendo.com but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.

1243
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,600
Well I have one last minute story that was sent to me from Tigerclaw in chat and it's

1244
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:00,840
a story that comes from gizmodo.com and it has to do with how a gang of folks actually

1245
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:07,040
kidnapped a gamer to get his password using a date request on Orkut.

1246
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,960
This is crazy.

1247
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,740
This again is coming from gizmodo.com.

1248
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:14,560
An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's

1249
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,740
girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.

1250
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,560
That's Google's social network by the way.

1251
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,680
After sequestering him in Sao Paulo they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours

1252
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,820
to get his password which they wanted to sell for $8,000.

1253
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,200
After five hours the hostage wasn't talking.

1254
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,720
The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time but the guy didn't say a

1255
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,720
word.

1256
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,400
Finally the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.

1257
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,200
The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects aged 19, 27.

1258
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,480
According to police the captive was the world leader in Gunbound is who they kidnapped.

1259
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,320
That was the world leader in Gunbound and of course you guys probably know about this

1260
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
game.

1261
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
You've probably heard of it.

1262
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,200
Have some friends that play it and so this guy's like the world leader and so the game

1263
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,480
is so popular these gangsters decided to make some quick money off of it by sending him

1264
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,480
an online date through Orkut and then kidnapping him instead.

1265
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,480
Crazy.

1266
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,820
There you go.

1267
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,320
I like how they gave up.

1268
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
I know.

1269
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,320
It's kind of interesting.

1270
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
Eh, forget it.

1271
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,320
Wow.

1272
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:19,480
GS68 says gold farming is serious fucking business.

1273
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,040
Frisbee says tell me your fucking password.

1274
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,000
That must have been a very interesting conversation.

1275
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,520
That would be like an interesting movie plot.

1276
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,880
GS68 says I should start on Gunbound.

1277
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,560
Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?

1278
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,560
Ugh.

1279
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,560
Alright.

1280
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,560
Well, that's going to do it with the Skype line, I wasn't really ringing in any more

1281
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
calls.

1282
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,880
So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight and to do that we have to go around

1283
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,000
and get everybody's final thoughts.

1284
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,600
Miklotov, thank you so much for being here this week.

1285
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,120
I stayed through the whole thing.

1286
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
You really did.

1287
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,120
I'm very impressed.

1288
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
That's the first time in months.

1289
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,000
And now you're not going to catch your train to go home.

1290
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It's 834.

1291
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Gosh dang it.

1292
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's alright.

1293
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,480
Can I do an FUs real quick?

1294
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
No.

1295
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,480
Dang it.

1296
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,480
Alright, but thank you for being here.

1297
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,480
You're welcome.

1298
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,600
Thank you for making me lose money.

1299
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Sorry.

1300
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,720
Any final thoughts?

1301
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,420
I love Survivor a lot.

1302
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,800
You're so going to get voted out.

1303
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
I don't care.

1304
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,800
I'm having fun.

1305
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,800
Alright.

1306
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,160
Loki, your final thought?

1307
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
I don't know.

1308
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,360
I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3 game.

1309
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,360
Looks fun.

1310
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,360
It better be fun.

1311
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,360
It's expensive.

1312
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
Alright.

1313
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,000
And, Jamie, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?

1314
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,320
Uh, what?

1315
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,600
That's your final thought is what?

1316
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,600
What?

1317
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,600
What?

1318
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
What?

1319
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Alright.

1320
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,360
Do they speak English and what?

1321
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:54,920
And I also have a final thought for tonight.

1322
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,800
My vote tonight is for Shane.

1323
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
What?

1324
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,040
Shane, you're a real fucking duplicitous asshole and you were plotting against me in the very

1325
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,880
beginning of this game.

1326
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,560
That you must leave the island tonight.

1327
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,560
Whatever.

1328
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,560
I win.

1329
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
Take that.

1330
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,560
Alright.

1331
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,320
Anyway, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting

1332
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,280
and independent internet radio.

1333
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,180
Of course, without your support, we would never be here in the first place, so thank

1334
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,180
you very much.

1335
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,180
We really mean it.

1336
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:27,000
And until next time, in two weeks, we'll be back with another new episode of Orange

1337

Lounge Radio from our brand new studio.

1338
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,200
Big thanks to this old apartment for the many memories we've had here.

1339
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:39,200
You know, we got our TV story that's on YouTube was filmed here in this place and

1340
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,000
Jamie won't miss the ventilation though, that's for sure, so we will see you in a

1341
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,880
couple weeks from our brand new location here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1342
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,880
