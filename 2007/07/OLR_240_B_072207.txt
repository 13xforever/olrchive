DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I will have to fight the cat to the death.
Or then we'll move it to your house.
No, because the room that the computer's in also has poor ventilation and a bunch of stuff in it.
Stuff.
We got a laser pointer for the cat.
You got a laser pointer for the cat?
Or to point at the cat?
To point at the cat.
Oh, I thought maybe you were going to strap a laser pointer onto the cat.
They have those.
So you can get a cat with a freaking laser on it.
That's dangerous.
You get a cat with a freaking laser on its head.
Alright, come on, let's get back to the gaming news.
Somebody, quick, start us off.
Anyways.
Pac-Man.
No Pac-Man.
So yeah, it's kind of interesting, you know, with the whole announcement with the Wii Fit board.
We kind of talked about this a little bit last week.
Possible other usage for the board, actually, like in, you know,
How exactly would you use weight and balance in an RPG?
I have no idea.
Maybe the longer you stand on one foot, the more health you have.
As soon as you fall, oh, zero.
Maybe dodging or something.
I don't know.
I don't see anything like that.
I think it would be good for just like sports games, like the next SSX game or whatever.
Just have that as an optional control method.
Or what we all need, a jump roping game.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I've never done that before.
It's totally by the people that do Flamin' Fingers.
No, then it has to be good.
It's the same soundtrack?
Similar, similar stuff.
Oh my god, I love Flamin' Fingers' soundtrack.
It's so good.
Anyway, hold on.
Jumpin' Jackpot is not a role-playing game, so I'm trying to figure out how this could tie into a role-playing game.
It just doesn't make sense.
It could be for your character walking around.
I would assume it would be.
But I don't want to stand when I play a game like Final Fantasy Final Fantasy is a game for me to sit on my big butt on the couch and play Maybe you could sit on the Wii Fit board and lean back and forth Now that I could do Plant the Wii Fit board firmly under your large ass Lean left to cast black magic Lean right to cast white magic I don't know, silly
Project Hammer Project Hammer Project Hammer
And there was a spokesperson that was actually at E3 that said, Disaster is still under development, speaking about Disaster Day of Crisis.
We've shifted development resources from Project Hammer.
You may hear about it in the future, but it's off the schedule for now.
And then there was a report on Digg today that said that Project Hammer was gone.
And I couldn't tell if it was a misinterpretation of the story or what was going on.
Have you heard anything about Project Hammer, Loki?
No, but it's impossible that they misinterpreted the story because I heard...
There was one also about that Wii Fit board story.
They were saying, oh my god, they're going to make Final Fantasy Fit, you know, like an exercise game.
But they were being sarcastic in the interview because they're like, are you guys going to make a Final Fantasy, you know, health fitness game?
They're all, no, but we more likely use it for an upcoming RPG or something.
Then maybe after that, then we'll work on Final Fantasy Fitness.
Being sarcastic and people took it as like, oh my god, they're working on Final Fantasy Fitness, you know.
No, it's sarcasm.
Look it up, people.
What's sarcasm?
I don't know.
What is it?
How about some other stuff?
Alright, other stuff.
Well, for those who are keeping track of the numbers, well, the Wii is about ready to kick the...
Pants off of the Xbox 360.
As far as sales go worldwide, Xbox 360 has sold 10.08 million units.
The Wii is at 9.05 million and PS3 is at 3.63 million.
I think it's great that the Wii is just a million short of the Xbox 360 for having been out for a shorter amount of time.
As far as the DS, it's 44.97 million units versus the PSP's 22.15 million.
I wouldn't have thought there's more PSPs out there than Xbox 360s, though.
But then again, the PSP's been out a long time.
Well, more people are going to want to go for the handhelds anyway.
That also makes sense.
I guess I forget about families and stuff where every kid has to have their own DS or their own PSP or whatever it is.
Mommy, he won't give me my game!
That.
Yes, that.
Exactly that.
Hence why I don't breed!
Well, do you think that the Wii is going to overtake the 360 very soon?
Yes.
It's already proven.
It all depends.
They probably will, just because they keep selling at a consistent rate.
But at the same time, we don't know what Microsoft has up their sleeves, and obviously they're not just going to let them take the top spot.
If you look at it this way, the Xbox 360, as I'm aware, should already be on a slight decline ever since it reached the peak.
Unless, of course, they come out, because I don't really think that the new units are going to be much of a reason to go buy a new one.
But the Wii, however, it's really, really sort of a wildfire kind of thing.
The more people that are getting it, the more they're telling other people.
And it really appeals to a much broader demographic, so...
Well, Microsoft does have Halo 3 in the wings, and that's going to be... Yeah, yeah, yeah, next.
All right, well, now some comments from our chat room, chat.orangehoundradio.com.
We love having the folks talking here.
Dr. Foev says, that's not fair.
If the 360 and PlayStation 3 was $249, it would destroy the Wii's numbers.
DarkSakura.com
There's a ton of good games.
But most of them are like mini-games.
A lot, a lot, a lot.
No, there's actual games.
Like maybe Trauma Center.
But there's not a lot of long-lasting type games.
Even Cook and Mama lost its thrill for me.
It was more of a DS game for me.
By the way, I need to borrow that.
There it is.
Anyways.
Well, PlayStation 3 may be dead last in the whole thing, but at least they have something to brag about.
And that would be that they're selling twice as many PlayStation 3s in Japan than they are Xbox 360s.
Of course, they've reached their one million mark in Japan, and Microsoft is still trailing behind.
But, you know, it's only going to get stronger, I guess, with releases from both companies.
It's going to actually be pretty good in Japan, I think.
See, there's Microsoft's real problem.
Because in that last story, we were looking at the worldwide numbers where the Wii is starting to overtake the 360.
Well, the reason why the 360 has not had a further gap on the Wii is because it's still not cracking the market in Japan.
which is interesting because they've had games like Blue Dragon now for a little bit.
Did Eternal Sonata come out there finally?
I think it did.
Or Trusty Bell or whatever it's called.
You know, these games are not moving as many units as folks thought it would.
So I think that's the 360's biggest problem when you're going to look at the worldwide numbers is that they still cannot crack Japan.
Well, they have 2.5 million Wii's in Japan as well.
So, you know, whereas they may be outselling the 360, they're still not number one.
But...
I don't know, Japan is an important market, it's not the largest market though, and if they're looking for numbers, I mean, I still think they need to focus, I guess, on the U.S.
and the U.K.
Well, who knows?
Maybe these will help move some Xboxes, but probably not.
Some new demos are out on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and the demos are for Juiced 2, because you know the Japanese love their Juiced, and FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, because I think that's big over there in Tokyo as well.
It's going to be in the UK, actually, the FlatOut one, which reminds me, I need to get a UK account so I can download that, because I love me some FlatOut.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But if you crash, you can eject your driver through the windshield.
Ooh, I might have to try this.
Okay, I will download this demo.
I like the idea of an eject button.
Well, speaking of eject... Wait, real quick, sorry, Jamie.
But here's the best part about it, Rob.
They have a whole set of minigames based around ejecting the driver out, including basketball, bowling, high jump, all sorts of things.
Can I eject him into a wall of pillows?
Amazing.
How about a stack of Twinkies?
Instead of a cream filling, it's a blood filling.
Whatever.
Well, Xbox, poor, poor Microsoft.
At the report for the end of their fiscal year for June 30th, they reported a $1.9 billion loss.
$1.2 billion was from the fourth quarter when they said,
Hey, guess what?
The Red Ring of Death are bad.
However, they're expecting to hopefully redeem themselves soon?
I don't know.
We'll see.
Maybe they'll drop the price for real?
I think that's what's coming.
And I think when we talk about that whole sales thing earlier, I think a price drop is coming definitely before Christmas.
Probably about the time Halo 3 is.
They're going to bank way too much on Halo 3 pulling in money.
And the sad thing is that I think they will.
I know, I'm like, it's actually probably what's best for them.
But they're not just banking on Halo 3, there's, you know, Halo 3, Project Arthur Racing 4, Mass Effect, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4, all those big titles that are... Eternal Sonata is like the game I'm most excited about, sadly, out of everything.
There's a huge lineup, it's not all just, they're not all banking just on Halo 3.
Carcassonne 2?
But, I mean, Sony's doing the same thing, they've got, you know, a pretty good lineup for the fall, just...
There isn't as much.
Hopefully it'll get better.
Well, how does this whole Red Rings thing ultimately impact Microsoft?
Well, it's already impacted them.
They're having to extend all those warranties on top of it, you know.
Yeah, they're going to have to sell millions more systems.
That's money out of their pocket.
Well, it's not getting any better for them.
Should have done it right the first time, hi!
They're going to green light Halo 4 now.
They're facing a second class action lawsuit regarding the scratched disc issue.
And really, you know, they are to blame for this.
I mean, it's such a simple fix.
The issue comes from people jiggling the Xbox 360 while the disc is spinning, causing the...
Actual laser to scratch a nice little ring into the disc.
Why would you pick up your Xbox 360 and shake it while the disc is moving?
Here's why.
Maybe because it's a baby.
No.
A lot of people are fascinated by... There's a little mercury switch in there that when you tilt your 360, whether it's upright or laying flat, the ring's always...
and DarkSakura.com
And that would have been... Or just not shaking your Xbox 360.
Exactly.
To watch the light tip up and down.
Or take the disc out, if you're going to do that.
Or even better, just, you know... I don't know, don't be retarded with it.
And yeah, the chatroom agrees.
Over at chat.orange.com, Blaze says, Well, people shouldn't be dumb shits and do stupid things like that.
And Son of Dad thinks it happens because there's candy inside.
It's like a pinata, you shake it.
Viva pinata, I get it.
You're especially funny tonight, Miklatov.
I'm always funny when I talk.
Blaze says, I've had my 360 get knocked over on me.
It looked like a stapler got shot into the disc 20 times.
I thought when I first read that, I thought he said that's what he did to the person that knocked it over.
He shot a stapler into him 20 times.
I'm thinking that would hurt.
That reminds me of that scene in UHF.
or he shoots him with a staple gun.
See, that's the thing, though.
I don't understand how... Okay, granted, it should have been fixed.
The foam in there couldn't have cost less than a dollar.
I mean, to fix this thing.
That's a whole dollar.
It's less than a dollar, okay?
I mean, to fix this.
I don't know why they didn't, but for whatever reason, they didn't.
Either way, though, still, I mean...
Don't jiggle the machine.
It says in the manual not to do it.
But then again, the Wii manual says not to throw it through your TV, and people do that anyway, so... I guess, you know... And then they want to sue Nintendo.
The Wii broke my TV because it doesn't bounce.
I guess... You know, it's like...
I don't know what you gotta do.
Walk these people through how to handle their console.
Don't shake the console.
It doesn't like it.
It will scratch your disc.
Have you ever seen those posters like downtown when you're driving or whatever that says, don't shake your baby?
A message from the... Actually, the headquarters for that is right by where I work.
And after talking with some of those people, no, because the whole thing started because a nanny shaked this...
and DarkSakura.
You're dealing with somebody who is not fully developed.
Why would you shake them?
Well, the Xbox 360 is not fully developed either.
So don't shake it.
I want to work for that company and work in their product test support.
And see if one day they make a model of a baby that can be shaken.
Oh wait, turn off my mic.
Heart babies.
Love babies.
I like them when they're quiet.
I like them with a straw in their head.
To drink.
Okay, so anyways.
What is wrong with you?
So real quick.
Seriously!
Video games, Rob.
Back to video games.
Is video games what caused you to be so violent?
I would, however, like to encourage our listeners to go to DontShakeYourBaby.com.
And just don't shake babies.
And don't shake Xbox 360s.
And while you're at it, just don't shake people or things in general.
Unless they're stupid and then throttle them.
Or unless it's a can of Coke that you're about to hand to your friend to watch them open.
That is funny.
You can shake your booty.
That's funny.
Watch me shake my ass right now!
Right in front of my face, no thank you.
The plaintiff, I guess, to this whole case, Christine Moskowitz, she says she was displeased when the Xbox 360 she purchased for her son wrecked copies of Gears of War, Crackdown, and Saints Row.
A second plaintiff, Dan Wood, claimed that his system ruined a Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell disc.
Thank you for watching!
I'm sorry, there's no... Once you learn, hmm, shaking it broke one of my games.
Maybe I shouldn't do that.
What's that grinding noise?
Instead, he's like, hmm, I'll put a different disc in there.
Hmm, it makes the noise again.
Oh, better sue them, because we're out $150.
Boo fucking hoo.
I think this calls for an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.
So if we may, let's bring on an Orange Lounge Radio public service announcement.
Camera, please.
All right, thank you.
Ready, lights, camera, and action.
Hi, this is Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you not to shake your Xbox 360.
because if you do, then you deserve to have your $60 games broke down on you.
Also, please don't shake children.
That was the worst public service announcement ever.
Can we get back into the stories, please?
No.
Well, the next story is mine.
Okay, fine.
Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360
Did they just not have E3 happen?
And did they not just reconfirm that the game is going to be a PS3 exclusive and all this blah blah blah?
Well, the official Xbox magazine comes out and says that it's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 a few months after the PlayStation 3 version.
And this is just after Kazumi Kitawa said at E3, since Metal Gear Solid was born for the PlayStation, we'd like to keep it as a PlayStation game.
But we might have to take some steps.
And that's the whole reason why people are thinking, again, it's coming to the Xbox 360.
I'm just thinking, let it go!
Let it go!
Here's the other thing, though.
I mean, to argue for it coming to the 360, hasn't everything that Sony's basically told... I know this is not Sony, but they're speaking for the Sony platform, I guess.
Hasn't everything that they've denied come true anyways?
I mean...
And granted, they probably don't want to make an announcement that it's actually coming out for Xbox 360 because then that pretty much shoots their chance for an actual, you know, really good exclusive game coming to their platform.
I don't know.
I'm just bothered by the fact that they can't get away from this.
And this comes up like a week after E3.
When they got up there and reaffirmed it's coming out for PlayStation 3 only.
If they do have plans for the Xbox 360, it's going to be a huge time difference in the releases.
Because I don't think they'll bring it out until the PlayStation 3 has proved it can't sell the copies that Konami wants it to sell.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4-5 times across the scope of a couple months just because some stupid rumor ignites all the blogs around the world.
I get angsty.
I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems like no better time to bring out the FUs of the week.
Jamie, start us off, please, with the FUs of the week.
I actually have a two-part one because one's related to the other.
First of all, I'd like to say F you to laminate flooring.
Because, okay, this is how I burnt my ribs, okay?
I just got back from the gym and I stepped into the tub.
I did not even sit down, I just stepped into the tub.
And my phone rang, so I stepped out, dried off my feet.
I made sure to dry off my feet.
Stepped into the hallway and down I went.
And I fell sort of skewed with my elbow into my side and I banged my knee really hard and I felt that all I hurt was my knee.
The next morning I woke up and my ribs were blue, and I hurt quite a bit, so I went to the doctor that day and he put me on a lot of Vicodin.
So, um, and I'm fully functional on Vicodin.
You know, I can go to my job and do my work, and I'm fine as long as I'm focused on one thing, you know, but when I take it, I can't really do... I'm not the multitasker I normally am, and Rob, you know how I do 50 million things at once.
I can't really pay attention to that many things.
So, um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But it's, I was like, dude, if I wasn't, I wasn't offended, and I was offended now, you know what I mean?
It's like, first of all, everybody, when you're dealing with people, don't fucking make assumptions about how they feel.
Ask them first, how do you feel?
All you're gonna do is piss them off and, you know, cause drama that doesn't need to be caused.
You need to not, people need to not be afraid to ask someone how they feel.
don't make assumptions all it does is make an ass out of you and only you okay you know I think that it's just this whole oh I don't want to offend people and I don't want to well then fucking ask you know what's the worst thing they're gonna say oh you know I don't feel all that great about it right now and if they don't want to talk about it they'll fucking tell you I don't want to talk about it right now and respect it you know don't just assume because then I've been you know pissed off now for three days over this
And, you know, I'm a good person.
I think I'm a good person.
You know, don't you think I'm a good person?
Yeah, okay.
But I just think that, you know, instead of worrying about, you know, kid gloves and stepping on toes, if you don't want to step on toes, ask them where their toes are so that you don't step on them.
That's what I think.
Good?
All finished?
I think that I was fairly, uh...
F.U.
to Paper Mario Sucking My F.U.
of the week goes to Shane
What?
Only in the beginning.
Only in the beginning.
Made sense.
Still does.
Um... I get... Whoa, I get F you, right?
F you... Oh crap, I had one.
Where did it go?
Okay, I have two FUs.
One I can remember, then I'll come up with the other one in a second.
I FU to Europe, or the UK or whatever, because they got that location test for the Silent Hill arcade game, and it looks really sweet, and I want to play it so bad.
And I'm not going to fly over there to play it, but maybe I will.
Someday.
And then FU to next, not this coming Tuesday, but next Tuesday, because it'll be the final day of the Konami San Francisco offices.
And that'll be the end of that.
Alright.
Okay.
That's that.
All done with the FUs of the week.
Let's move on and back into the gaming news then.
Well...
And this makes me kind of laugh because it's kind of a stupid name.
But there's a new princess for Super Mario Galaxies that they have seen in Famitsu scans named Rosetta.
And I think Stone instantly because you know the Rosetta Stone was a big translator thing.
So she gets to hang out with Daisy and Peach and what's-her-face who wasn't even a princess from the first game.
Pauline.
She wasn't a princess.
She was just some hoochie from New York.
So she doesn't need to be with the princesses.
She's not good enough to be a princess.
She's just a hooker.
Polly wasn't in the Super Mario Bros.
movie, was she?
I don't think so.
She was in Mario Bros.
First Love.
And that's when he found out that Peach would put out, I guess.
I don't know.
But she's, I guess, pretty.
If you like, you know, dumb blondes, I guess.
No, I don't know.
Well...
Fear not, folks.
We talked a little bit about the Wii balance board in Part A, but Nintendo has come out to promise that they will be making more balance board-based games.
So you're not going to be buying this thing for only one game.
Hooray!
What else are they developing?
Have they said anything?
No, they did not.
They just said, yeah, we're working on stuff.
Gee, could it possibly be, I don't know, another game that involves a lot of minigames?
Possibly, and I'm going to guess the next WarioWare game.
Oh, God, probably.
That would make sense.
That might be fun, though.
I did like WarioWare on the Wii, I'll give you that.
A new audience can now experience a game that is beautifully designed and impossible to put down.
Rockstar Table Tennis was kind of one of those early hits on the Xbox 360, one of the earlier games I enjoyed, but it would be interesting to see how the game mechanics are going to change on the Wii.
As long as they had the nunchuck part actually move you, and the Wiimote be your weather paddle, is that what it's called?
Yeah.
Then I don't see any problem with it, it should be actually pretty fun.
I wonder how that's going to work with the different spins that you put on your ball, because that was a big part of the game, was that you had to look at the tiny little, the ball that was coming at you, and like the tiny color that surrounded it, so you could tell what's...
Outro Music
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I can watch YouTube So guess what?
What?
Atari likes horses and people who love horses.
They're coming out with a game called My Horse and Me for Wii, DS, and PC that, from what I can understand, it's a horse raising and riding simulation.
Yeah.
Ride them horses, huh?
Well...
They're basically, and there's a quote on here saying, we're looking forward to providing the horse enthusiast community with a rich and authentic game that allows gamers to take care of and complete a variety of challenges with their horse.
Is there a big cross-section of the population that are horse enthusiasts and video game players?
I know, but they're the same type that play video games?
I know a person who's a horse enthusiast who loves video games, and she likes playing Guitar Hero Drunk.
One.
So you know one.
Out of all the horse games out there, you should consider this one because the game features the most accurate horse models and animations yet realized in a video game.
I think I would play it.
Take that, Final Furlong.
You know what I say to this game?
Nay.
I think I'm going to get the game.
I really think I'll play it.
Well, have fun.
Can you whip the horse with a Wiimote?
That might make me change my mind.
That might be kind of fun.
And then I can name the horse Britney Spears and I can whip Britney Spears just like it was Derby Owners Club.
I love Tribuners Club, okay?
I know you do.
There you go.
TheRobD says, you know, I've always been begging the video game industry for accurate horse physics.
I'm glad they listened.
I have a feeling that might be some of that sarcasm thing somebody was talking about earlier.
I don't know.
Possibly.
Anyways, another game coming out by Take-Two and Rockstar.
Bully, the scholarship edition, is now coming to the Xbox 360 and the Wii.
So, you know, you thought before that you may be able to get your, you know, Grand Theft Auto on on the Wii with Manhunt 2.
Hopefully, you'll be able to get your Bully on, I guess, with the Wii sooner than that.
But, I don't know.
It got a teen rating before.
I don't see why it would get any more than a teen rating now.
I'm looking forward to maybe picking this up on the 360.
Yeah, I'm kind of glad I missed it the last round on the PlayStation 2 because I was so immersed in my 360 at that time.
I'm kind of glad they are going to put it on 360 after all so I can play it in high def and widescreen and all that good stuff.
And I believe it will have new content as well for it.
More guys to make out with?
Yes, more guys to make out with.
Hooray!
Imagine what you could do with the Wiimote.
I don't know, Miklatov, what?
You could write on the chalkboards.
Oh, okay.
I could.
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
That's why I had to ask.
Well, also coming out for the Xbox 360 is Guilty Gear 2 Overture.
But here's the interesting thing.
It's not supposed to be a fighting game.
Thank you for watching!
Soul is awesome.
I love SoulBadGuy.
SoulBadGuy is great.
And Soul's going to be in there with a newcomer named Sin.
Who looks like Kai.
I liked Eno.
I was a fan of Zappa.
Love Zappa.
And I love Faust.
Oh yeah, Faust, of course.
I like Venom too.
One of my old cosplays though, and I'm sad because this is before I lost all that weight, is I cosplayed Baiken.
Which Dan didn't like because it's like, you know, boob.
I found a Faust cosplayer that same year.
That's awesome.
Did he rape you with his scalpel?
Like in the game?
I actually did hit him with the claw by accident.
But I had to give the claw back to Evan because it was part of his toys.
I won't say anything else.
I'll tell you off of the show.
Okay, there you go then.
I'm glad you didn't say that on a mic.
Hey, is it my turn again?
and Forced and Iron Ox, at least what their names are in the U.S.
The game is supposed to hit arcades in Japan this winter.
I'm looking forward to that.
I know the series.
I'm surprised to see that they're actually making that into a fighting game, because I don't think there was that many characters.
But it can't be any worse than the actual Devil Kings game.
So yeah, there's this rumor going around before about Halo on the DS.
And it was interesting because I believe they did get Bungie's Brian Gerrard to comment on it.
Apparently, there is such a thing, I guess, in concept.
People have made, I guess, concept versions of the game to pitch to them, but nothing obviously has come out.
So they're saying Microsoft, of course, doesn't publish any DS games.
or license them.
I don't know.
Will it ever get created?
Who knows.
But, you know, argument's sake, there are a few different versions of Halo for the DS out there.
Like what is created as jokes or what?
No, like pitching.
Like, uh,
Hey, we want to bring Halo 2 to the DS.
Here's what we can do with it.
And then showing them off the game.
Well, what's the problem?
If Microsoft never plans to get into the handheld market, what's the problem?
There's 44 million DSs out there to sell product to.
Who says it won't happen at some point?
It'd be weird.
It'd be very weird.
I kind of think, though, a little bit like... I don't know if it's a good thing because, I mean, look at the last time they tried something like that with the Panasonic.
Or not the Panasonic, but the CD-i.
Remember the Mario and the... Oh, yes.
Wanda Gamelin and all that stuff.
All the games.
But, I mean, hey, I wish that that would kind of happen because that would be pretty awesome.
You know, have Nintendo developing games for the Xbox 360 that are a little bit higher end and then have Microsoft developing stuff for the DS.
That would be pretty cool.
Good stuff.
All right.
Well, moving back over to the Xbox 360, which of course is where the Halo series will soon show up, what's going on is that there is actually a new hack out there.
The Xbox hacker forums have stated that the Xbox 360's DVD key and game region code can now be altered to break down the region locks for some games.
Here's a quote from the person who did it.
I successfully changed the DVD key and region code of the 360, so it's all confirmed.
All I did towards this was to reverse the plain text KV signature to figure out how to modify and re-sign the KV contents.
But, okay, so, you know, hooray, now you might be able to reverse your 360 to play games from other regions, but Microsoft will probably close this loophole pretty soon.
They usually do.
I think they already have.
I think it's just on some of the older kernels that you can do that.
TheRobD says, oh, that's all he did?
I can't believe I didn't think of that.
I think that might be a little more of that sarcasm thing somebody was referring to earlier in the program.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Alright, and then ShadowCharlie says, Brick.
The Xbox 360 is going to be a brick pretty soon.
They should just have a code in there when you try to do something like that and hack it.
It'll just carve a nice little circle into your disc.
Like your Xbox 360 commits seppuku when it figures out that you're trying to, you know, taint it.
That'd be funny.
Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2 Far Cry 2
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I want to tie that game that could possibly be good.
I'm just theorizing, Jesus.
That's like if they would have promoted House of the Dead 3 in a House of the Dead the movie or something.
Should I tie that in?
Nobody would have played House of the Dead 3 at all.
No, I think, I don't know, it was a good first person shooter game.
I like how you can make your own levels and stuff in it.
That was kind of neat.
Just makes you miss time splitters even more.
So since Jamie and I both don't play Far Cry, you tell us, what would you want to see in Far Cry 2?
I don't know.
I would like to see some of the stuff that they're showing off in Crysis, because Crysis looks like such an amazing game.
And Far Cry was pretty good when it came out, originally.
Maybe some different settings, maybe not all in the jungle.
I don't know, just improve upon it.
I mean, it was a pretty good game to begin with.
Some of the AI, though, in the first game was a little weird.
So maybe tune that up a bit.
But if the AI is good and the game stays kind of how it was, it should be a pretty good game.
And if you don't have it on the 360, I'd recommend picking it up because it's dirt cheap now and it's actually pretty fun.
All right.
Well, let's move on.
Any more stories before we open up the Skype line, which I believe is coming up very soon?
Yes.
We got one.
And it's kind of interesting.
Silicon Knights, they're actually going to be suing Epic over the Unreal 3 engine.
Apparently, they've had some difficulties programming in it, and it's not performing as they had hoped.
And I guess this is kind of stemming from the showing of Too Human at E3.
Apparently, some people weren't too happy about it, but I don't know.
Should be interesting to see what's happening with it.
I know that they're not the only company it's been having trouble with.
I know for the PlayStation 3 side, Koei has been having trouble with Fatal Inertia.
In fact, that game has been postponed indefinitely now.
So some problems arising with this fantastic engine that everybody's been licensing.
Probably, yeah.
Is it just hard to work with?
They might just not have all of the documentation for it or something.
Sounds like they weren't getting everything they were promised.
Like there's going to be an update in six months and then it never came or whatever.
But it's hard to say until we get the smoking gun publishing the full court papers that we can read it for ourselves.
That'll be exciting.
DJ Janai in our chatroom says, Sue Epic for ditching One Must Fall 2097.
That's old school right there.
I love that game.
Hey, but there was the One Muff's Fall Battlegrounds that came out.
Remember online?
It was like a battle arena game.
So it's not over yet if you want to play that.
You never know.
Alright, anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line now.
If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
Who would have thought?
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype is our username.
And I also want to put out there that there is a brand new version of Skype available.
And this is our first night using it and they've changed the interface a little bit.
I don't anticipate any problems, but you never know what might go wrong here on the program.
So let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven's Dolphin.
How are you?
Good, and I'm so happy that the phone picked up this time and we're not having those technical difficulties.
What's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
The epic thing?
A lot of things are on my mind, actually.
But the epic thing, really.
What about the epic thing?
The whole lawsuit?
Yeah.
Didn't Silicon Knights used to be like a Nintendo company?
Yes, according to Loki.
I don't know.
I haven't checked my Wikipedia.
Oh, is that it?
Yeah, Silicon Knights did Eternal Darkness.
Okay, so what does that have to do with your opinion on everything?
because, you know, now they're doing games for the 360 and PS3.
Do you find that a little, you know, like Nintendo cut them loose and now they're doing too human and then they try to get this engine and I feel, it feels like they're a bunch of, like, you know, how Epic has got this game that's really popular.
I feel like they're just trying to milk money out of them.
Like, a bunch of people go like, I can't get this to work, damn it, let's just sue them.
Well, that's, I mean, well, it's not just the sue part, but as far as the company making games for other companies, I mean, that's what you got to do to make money.
If you don't have an exclusive agreement with one anymore, you make games for wherever you think you can sell them.
Yeah, and you know, they're trying to make a whole new engine, so I wish them luck with that.
You're getting some agreement from our chat room.
Rob D says, I actually agree with Raven's Dolphin.
Like he's never agreed with you before, so there you go.
That's a first, that's a first.
And DJ Janai says, Epic has a big ego too.
They do, you know, but they do make good games.
But it feels like, you know, I'm playing Rainbow Six, which is an Unreal Tournament game.
I mean, an Unreal Technology game, and it works fine.
I don't know what they're doing.
Sephiroth1215 says, they weren't really a Nintendo developer.
They just made all the games on GameCube.
Okay.
All right.
Well, what else is on your mind?
What else is on my mind?
The Wii board.
You said that the Wii snowboard, not the snowboard, the Wii Fit board.
Fit board.
Could be used as the snowboard, I suppose, in a game.
Yeah, this is what I was thinking about.
Remember 1080?
Yeah.
Okay, wouldn't that be the hottest thing if they put 1080 on the Wii Fit board?
Or Tricky, SSX Tricky?
With that theme song I can never get out of my head.
It's Tricky!
Yeah.
I can't wait for that.
Blaze agrees with you in chat.
1080 for the win.
So you think they can do more types of games than just fitness games and mini games with this board?
I really do.
Like the next Tony Hawk and the 1080 game, I would cream my pants for that.
I'm a real snowboarding fan.
I don't like sports games, but I love snowboarding games.
How do you think they would do this whole Square Enix is saying they want to license the thing.
What kind of Square Enix game do you think would incorporate the Wii Fit boards?
I've been thinking about it.
I don't know.
It'll probably be a Final Fantasy kind of like rip-off game.
I don't know.
I don't think the kind of like Final Fantasy aerobic game going like, yeah, step on the board.
Yeah, cast a spell.
Yeah, do this.
Maybe it'll be Final Fantasy X-3 or something where, you know, the Yuna's angels, you know, you can actually do a little dance on the Wii Fit board and change into different outfits.
It'll be fun.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
Yep.
That does sound like fun.
But I'm really excited.
I'm not going to pass judgment on the board yet.
And you shouldn't until you get to play it.
Because a lot of people pass judgment on the Wii but change their minds when they actually get to play it.
Oh, one last thing.
You don't sound like Vodafone anymore.
Good for you.
I don't sound like what?
You don't sound like you're on Vonage at all.
It might be the new Skype.
I think the quality has increased slightly.
What's a VOG?
Why am I so loud?
A VOG is what a lady has between... I thought he said VOG.
I was like, what the crap?
It doesn't sound like you're on that, I guess.
Vonage.
Vonage.
No, a VOG is something completely different.
No, I had a D when I said it.
VOG.
A VOG is where the babies come from.
And then you shake them.
Stop it.
I gotta go, so you can pick up some more calls.
I think I made him uncomfortable.
I think you did.
That was fun.
Let's do it again.
Do it again?
Make him uncomfortable again?
I don't want to make somebody else uncomfortable.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
GS68.
Hi, GS68.
What's on your mind?
You know how you said Maximum 2 and 3 will come out along with Long and Midnight for the PS3, right?
I did, and I bet you're calling in to correct me, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Alright, what's up?
There's already a few Maximum 2 and 3 machines in Northern California.
Well, that's, but, okay, so it's not simultaneous, but it's been about the same time, right?
Yeah, there's already a machine in Hayward.
How is it?
I haven't played it yet.
Is it fun?
Uh, actually, I haven't tried it yet.
I'm just waiting for San Diego Golf Land and Milpitas Golf Land to get it.
Uh, so some of the local golf lands, sure, and, you know, it's a big chain, they get a lot of the hottest games, why not?
It,
Yeah, let me just post... I'm going to post a link in chat room, so... Alright.
Those people will know.
I am planning on buying it, though.
I think I've decided.
You think you are going to import it?
Yeah, because... Well, because I just, you know... I only have, like, one game for the PS3 now, and it'd be cool to have an import game.
Yeah, it might be fun.
Although it's not going to be fun if you buy the thing and then the damn thing doesn't work.
That's going to suck.
It's region free.
All the games are region free now.
Can I come over and play?
Yeah.
Tell him no.
GS68, do you know if the soundtrack on the third one is as cool as the second one?
Like, did Yuzo Koshiro do it again?
I don't know yet, but from what I've read, you can pick between the Maximum 2, 1 and 2 soundtrack and the new Maximum 2 and 3 soundtrack.
Huh.
And if you transfer a certain kind of card, you can get a special...
Soundtrack that's from an earlier Wongan Midnight game.
That's cool.
No, I just got disconnected from chat, so I missed your link.
Post it again.
Stupid chat.
Actually, someone just said that you have to register to see it.
It's one of those forums where you have to register to see it.
Give out your registration information.
Is it on BugMeNot?
Alright, no, it's fine.
I'll wait for the information to hit Wikipedia.
It's all good.
All right.
Well, thanks for the correction.
Appreciate it.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No, I'm good.
All right.
Well, then we'll talk to you later, my friend.
All right.
Take care.
You too.
Bye-bye.
All right.
We'll go back to the phones.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, and hopefully we can actually answer the calls tonight.
Again, we've upgraded to a new version of Skype and it's taking a little bit of getting used to.
I want these little floating windows to go away.
I don't like that.
Those need to go away.
Shake them.
Maybe it'll work.
Stop it.
Why am I so loud?
I don't know.
Oh, snap.
Hello.
Oh, snap.
Hi.
You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Hi, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much.
Just trying to chill this weekend.
Just going through the drama of DDR Freak, but...
Wait, the trauma of DDR Freak?
Drama, I said.
The drama.
What else is new?
Why do you think I only moderate two forums?
It has nothing to do with the general populace.
It's just within our city and digital life this year.
Well, we like drama.
What's up with digital life this year?
The rules, basically.
How folks are chastising.
They're just basically...
I'm just gonna ask you straight up, are the rules bullshit this year, Zaku?
Not really.
They're straightforward.
As I said, straight PA match.
Two out of three.
Shuffle, I believe, will be on at all times with left and right.
But yeah, it's a far cry from last year's challenge point system where every mod they use would just get you extra points.
When is Digital Life this year?
At the end of September.
You know, I have a credit with JetBlue.
I might be able to come back.
Oh really?
27th to the 30th
No, that's cool.
Think about it.
You already know Don, right?
You know Frequency.
Yep.
Let him know, since he's running the tournament, he might be able to hook you up with space within the booth, perhaps.
Hmm.
All right.
I will give it some serious consideration after I get past this move stuff.
I would love to go to Digital Life.
I keep hearing about it and I never get to go, so maybe.
Hopefully this year will be better than last.
I mean, you know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3 grand for Expert Division, and I think $1,500 for Freestyle.
Wouldn't you like to see my Freestyle, Zaku?
Um...
I don't know.
I'm trying to think right now.
I do want to do a routine this year, but I might be looking for a partner maybe.
I don't want to do a solo like last year where I fucked it up.
I'll think about it.
I'll give Dr. Dick a call and see if he wants to do a freestyle for $1,500 because that might bring him out of hiding.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll be up against all the other folks from within the city and possibly the country.
All right, we'll see.
All right, Zach, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
Um, pretty much just have to rant about, you know, certain stores just jacking up the prices on old school stuff.
Like the store in the village that I know, they have the gold to mark a $40 for a copy of Punch-Out!!
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
I wonder if that's that same store I got taken to, because they had some really expensive stuff there.
Yeah, that's Video Games New York.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The thing is that I managed to find a $15 copy in a flea market in Coney Island.
It's all about where you look.
It's all about looking.
That type of stuff.
I know.
I could probably go to the farmer's market here and get similar deals.
All right, Zach, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay?
All right.
And maybe see you at Digital Life.
Maybe.
All right.
We'll look forward to that.
I hope so.
We'll see.
Bye.
Peace.
Now I'm really tempted to go because you all know I love New York City, and I do have a credit on JetBlue I have to use within a year, so maybe.
Ooh, I'm so tempted.
We'll see.
Let's see if we get any more calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But the phones haven't been ringing that much tonight.
I guess y'all don't have much to say.
I guess we'll go around and ask if there's any last minute stories.
No.
No?
Loki, you have anything tonight?
Yeah.
As I mentioned earlier, all those rumors from Sony end up becoming true.
And...
Here's a little bit of something else we were talking about earlier, how the whole rumbling of the 6-axis and stuff is coming sooner than later.
Anyways, Kaz Harai has actually admitted that the 6-axis is not the final PlayStation 3 controller.
Surprise.
And that they're working with Immersion on Rumble.
Rumble.
and there's also rumors I guess about Mersion's TouchSense technology which might be touch sensitive stuff goody other interesting things let's see here there was there's a DOA toy that you can buy out there now that you can actually remove the clothing off of oh hooray as if you need an excuse to buy those let's see
DJ Maxx, PSP Shooter Game
Come on in, B-Rangers!
They're so cool!
Project Gotham Racing 4 actually has the ability to save every single race that everybody does.
GS68 agrees the NB Rangers are awesome
Um, let's see.
Also, GSX-8 wants to know about the Dead or Alive figures.
Does it have jiggle-able boobs?
No, it doesn't really make them fully naked.
It's just you can take them down the bra and panties, I guess.
Um, this is interesting.
Next week, we're going to get Wing Commander Arena on Xbox Live Arcade for 800 points.
Not interested.
Sorry.
I used to love Wing Commander.
If it was original Wing Commander, it'd be great.
Yes, if it was original Wing Commander, I'd be sold.
and this I'd like to plug real quick it's a PSP IRC version 1.01 and it's an IRC client for the PSP in fact earlier today I was using it in the chat room and it works pretty good it works on a firmware 1.5 as well as those custom firmwares out there um
Check it out.
It does support an IR keyboard as well if you happen to have one of those.
I didn't, but they apparently have tested it with the Targets Universal IR Wireless Keyboard.
I guess it's used for PDAs.
But if you don't have that, there's another text entry method that's a little bit slower, but still you can do it.
It's pretty easy.
And then, real quick,
There's an interesting rumor going around that Manhunt 2 might be published for the Nintendo Wii despite the AO rating.
And that's coming from gonintendo.com, but no word if that's been confirmed yet or not.
DarkSakura.com
An armed gang of four kidnapped one of the world's top RPG gamers after one criminal's girlfriend lured him into a fake date using Orkut.
After sequestering him in Sao Paulo, they held a gun against the victim's head for five hours to get his password, which they wanted to sell for $8,000.
After five hours, the hostage wasn't talking.
The group leader had a gun against his head at all that time, but the guy didn't say a word.
Finally, the crooks gave up and decided to let him go.
The Brazilian police then caught the four suspects, age 19, 27.
According to police, the captive was the world leader in Gunbound, is who they kidnapped.
That guy was the world leader in Gunbound.
And, of course, you guys probably know about this game.
You've probably heard of it, have some friends that play it.
GS68 Gold Farming is Serious Fucking Business
Frisbee says, tell me your fucking password.
That must have been a very interesting conversation.
That would be like an interesting movie plot.
GS68 says, I should start on Gunbound.
Why would that story make you want to start playing Gunbound?
Ugh.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it.
The Skype line wasn't really ringing in any more calls.
So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight.
And to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Mikotov, thank you so much for being here this week.
I stayed through the whole thing.
You really did.
I'm very impressed.
That's the first time in months.
And now you're not going to catch a train to go home.
Oh, it's 834.
Gosh dang it.
It's all right.
Can I do FUs real quick?
No.
Dang it.
All right.
But thank you for being here.
You're welcome.
Thank you for making me lose money.
Sorry.
Any final thoughts?
I love Survivor a lot.
You're so going to get voted out.
I don't care.
I'm having fun.
All right.
Loki, your final thought.
I don't know.
I kind of want to play this Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3 game.
It looks fun.
It better be fun because it's expensive.
Jamie, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
What?
That's your final thought is what?
What?
What?
What?
All right.
Do they speak English and what?
And I also have a final thought for tonight.
My vote tonight is for Shane.
Shane, you're a real fucking duplicitous asshole and you were plotting against me in the very beginning of this game that you must leave the island tonight whatever, I win take that alright, anyway, thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting independent podcasting and independent internet radio
