0	26560	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here live on this Sunday evening, July the 15th of 2007.
26560	29200	We're going through the E3 wrap-up, of course.
29200	33040	Now, I know you guys have probably been reading about it on the various blogs, but maybe there's
33040	36840	some things that we caught that maybe slipped off your radars, off the cracks.
36840	40160	And of course, you know, we didn't get to go to E3 this year, so we're just kind of
40160	42600	like a lot of you guys on the outside looking in.
42600	44120	And so we're kind of collecting our thoughts.
44120	46000	What do the people who weren't there think about it?
46000	49440	What are the gaming fans who didn't get to go to E3 this year really think about it?
49440	50440	Because hey, it's our money.
50440	51440	We're spending it.
51440	55040	So we're going to talk tonight about what we thought of the various news there from
55040	56040	E3.
56040	59080	And we talked about Nintendo and Microsoft and Part A. Let's go on to the last press
59080	60800	conference, which was Sony.
60800	61800	Yes.
61800	65320	And one of the big things coming from the Sony press conference, which some might say
65320	71200	is not really surprising, is a new PSP coming in September.
71200	74520	Not necessarily the PSP 2, but a redesigned PSP.
74520	79200	I guess people are kind of dubbing it PlayStation Portable Slim.
79200	87160	It's supposed to be 33% lighter, 19% slimmer, has a longer battery life, and is also going
87160	91600	to be having a video out on it as well, which is kind of cool.
91600	96720	We'll be retailing for $169.99, so the same price as a normal PSP now.
96720	99040	And we'll eventually replace those as well.
99040	107240	And it will be loaded with the 3.6 firmware, so probably seeing goodbye to homebrew with
107240	108640	that at least.
108640	111600	That's their hopes.
111600	116040	Other interesting things, it will be offered in three different colors, black, silver,
116040	120880	and white, all a little bit glossy, kind of like the DS Lite.
120880	125400	And also, the ice silver will be a part of a $1.99 entertainment package that's going
125400	132160	to be with a 1GB memory stick, Daxter, and Family Guy's freaking suite collection on
132160	133160	UMD.
133160	139600	Also, they're going to be releasing a white Star Wars themed PSP that will retail for
139600	140600	$1.99.
140600	147000	And also, it will be packaged with Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron.
147000	150760	So that is coming in September.
150760	151760	Looks interesting.
151760	157180	I might actually sell my second PSP to get one of these as well, because I like the idea
157180	158840	of video out.
158840	162200	Video out does sound pretty cool, and I know a lot of people kind of wrote it off, like
162200	164680	whoop-de-doo, video out, you know, who cares.
164680	168760	But you know, it does make those UMDs at least a little more usable that you can have them
168760	172640	on your TV, but also, just getting to play, you know, some of these games, like the Final
172640	175240	Fantasy remake and stuff like on my big TV.
175240	180240	If you think about it, if you're looking at, you know, possibly just using this as like
180240	186400	even, you know, portable and stand-alone video player at home, if you don't want to buy DVDs,
186400	191480	a lot of these UMDs are going for like dirt cheap, and you can pick them up, you know,
191480	194580	probably use pretty, under five bucks, so.
194580	196720	How are they going to look when blown up to a big screen though?
196720	200360	They will be 480p, so it will look like a DVD.
200360	201360	It's not bad.
201360	206720	I guess they're encoded at DVD bit rates, it's just, it's shrunken down to the PSP screen,
206720	207720	so.
207720	208720	Really sharp.
208720	210160	It will be pretty sharp, I guess, on normal screen.
210160	212080	It shouldn't be too bad, I don't know.
212080	213960	Maybe it might be letterbox or something.
213960	217960	Yeah, I'm kind of excited about the video out, but the problem is I already own a PSP,
217960	221840	so I don't really want to buy a whole new one just for video out.
221840	225200	I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't on the first, but I guess this
225200	226680	is how they get you to buy another one, I don't know.
226680	227680	Here's the thing though.
227680	232920	The video out uses the serial port that's on the bottom of the PSP.
232920	234560	Supposedly this one's redesigned.
234560	239480	I'm not sure if that's actually the case, but they're seeing it's redesigned.
239480	244800	So it's possible with this new firmware update 3.6 that maybe with the current ones you can
244800	245800	do that, but.
245800	247680	Please let that be the case.
247680	252120	It would be not, it wouldn't be too surprising if they don't mention that until later on.
252120	255440	Much like certain other stories we'll get into later, where they don't mention certain
255440	256800	aspects of things.
256800	258400	Alright, fair enough.
258400	262120	So do you think you'll pick up a PSP redesign?
262120	265320	I think I will just because I have two of them right now and I want to sell one of them
265320	268360	or at least get rid of it because I have no use for it right now, and that'd be a good
268360	272960	excuse to buy one of those because it wouldn't really cost me much.
272960	276800	The other thing though about it though, this is kind of a trend you'll see at the Sony
276800	281080	press conference, something that they've been denying and denying, yet people are saying
281080	287160	it's going to be happening and we've heard rumors and lo and behold, it's true.
287160	289400	Kind of a trend that's going along with it.
289400	293400	We shall see as we continue throughout the press conference stories here.
293400	301440	Well there is something that I have to say that I actually expected this.
301440	307800	You know with all of the rumors going around about exclusive game this and exclusive game
307800	317960	but I honestly, this is what I expected, is that Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be exclusive
317960	320080	to the PS3.
320080	321360	Reaffirmed.
321360	323000	Not buying it.
323000	324000	Not buying it.
324000	325000	And this is why.
325000	329500	Okay, it may be a PS3 exclusive when it comes out.
329500	334340	I do not doubt that it's going to come to the 360 eventually because it would be dumb
334340	341560	for them to ignore the entire Xbox 360 user base.
341560	346240	It's not because they're plain sides or anything, it's just about money.
346240	349040	They want to sell as many copies of this as possible.
349040	352600	I wouldn't be surprised if we see a release on the Xbox 360 maybe later on.
352600	356400	I will be surprised.
356400	357400	I don't think it's going to happen.
357400	359720	I think it's going to stay on PS3.
359720	362940	I think it really all depends on sales.
362940	369800	I can totally see how it could happen where one of the Metal Gears ended up coming out
369800	371600	for GameCube later on.
371600	375920	I think the first Metal Gear was redone.
375920	379400	I could see something like that happening and this seems to happen a lot with the Metal
379400	383200	Gear series where it shows up on the Sony platform first and then kind of mutates into
383200	389000	a special edition thing that comes out on Xbox or whatever later on but a year later.
389000	393920	I could see something like that happening if the sales aren't strong enough on its own.
393920	399880	So it's really going to depend but a year is such a long wait that it's not going to
399880	404360	have a huge impact as far as the fanboys are concerned.
404360	410320	I think what you can count on, you can count on them not announcing another platform until
410320	411960	well after the game is out.
411960	414440	I think that is something that will be a given.
414440	421960	Unless, for whatever reason, Sony has a really shitty fourth quarter and they don't sell
421960	426880	that many units or whatever and it's looking like, hey, we're not going to sell that many
426880	431840	units of Metal Gear Solid 4, maybe we should rethink this exclusive thing because exclusives
431840	433600	change all the time.
433600	437640	I'm thinking Konami has not only done this with the Metal Gear series but Silent Hill
437640	438640	as well.
438640	441600	Silent Hill 2 was out on the PlayStation 2 first and the Wrestle Streams came out on
441600	443020	Xbox.
443020	444600	Little things like that happen.
444600	448400	Hit Stunt says, I wouldn't doubt if Konami is contractually obligated to say it's not
448400	452760	coming to any other system until the PlayStation 3 version comes out, just like the standard
452760	457600	six month delay like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Virtua Fighter 5.
457600	458600	But you know what?
458600	462600	It's good for them that they do have this because at least this is something, hey, maybe
462600	465360	this will sell a few systems for them.
465360	467120	They need all they can take.
467120	473880	Well, we'll see where that leads but nevertheless the Xbox 360 folks who were convinced it was
473880	477160	coming to their platform get a little bit of a setback.
477160	481560	I suppose hope is never lost but hope has been diminished quite a bit.
481560	485080	Speaking of exclusives, another exclusive that was announced on the PlayStation 3 is
485080	486680	Unreal Tournament 3.
486680	490200	Now it was only affirmed as a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 3 but that does mean if
490200	494480	you're a Sony fan and you got your PlayStation, you're going to get it first on the PlayStation
494480	495480	3.
495480	498120	As far as the timed thing, I could care less.
498120	501760	I think this is the much cooler part about it is that you're going to be able to use
501760	505800	mods on the PlayStation 3 and the PC version.
505800	509520	Now the PC version will come out a little later but that's kind of cool for the modding
509520	513920	community of which a game like Unreal gets a lot of this stuff is that the mods you make
513920	516400	for PC you're going to be able to use on PS3 as well.
516400	517400	That's cool.
517400	521400	And they're saying everything from just weapon mods to total conversions for it are going
521400	522400	to be available.
522400	527920	So that's tons of extra content for it which is awesome.
527920	532720	Now we need Duke Nukem 3D with mods and stuff and that'd be cool too.
532720	533760	We shall see.
533760	538400	What's pretty interesting about the whole Unreal Tournament 3 thing is as of May it
538400	544200	was actually going to be exclusive to the 360 so kind of flip-flopped there.
544200	546840	Amazing what money can do.
546840	551600	Something very interesting, probably a little bit surprising would be that NCSoft has actually
551600	556960	pledged support for the PlayStation 3 platform and are going to be releasing exclusive PlayStation
556960	558880	3 online games.
558880	563880	So not sure if they're actually going to be bringing their current titles over like
563880	569600	Lineage, Guild Wars, City of Heroes and stuff like that but they will be making at least
569600	573720	some of their current IPs and new IPs available for the platform.
573720	577920	So that's pretty awesome.
577920	582000	I think NCSoft is a pretty rad company and I like games like Guild Wars and so that's
582000	585240	pretty exciting that they're going to be bringing some more stuff to the consoles and if they
585240	587240	want to go with PlayStation 3 then good for them.
587240	589600	I'm sure Sony's very happy with that announcement.
589600	596600	I'm still waiting on those online games that they were talking about at E3 the year before.
596600	600380	Do you think that maybe some of those are being now ported to PlayStation 3?
600380	605400	I don't see why they weren't all that big graphic monsters.
605400	608520	Maybe if they did all of them at once but I think that their whole intention was having
608520	615200	a big service available to people just to come in and play.
615200	616320	That's what I want to see.
616320	619080	Do you think we might see Guild Wars 2 on the PlayStation 3?
619080	620080	I hope not.
620080	621080	Shit.
621080	622640	I hate MMOs on consoles.
622640	623640	Really?
623640	629200	MMOs should stick to freaking PCs unless they are specifically made for a console.
629200	634660	I disagree on Guild Wars because I believe since the whole format of Guild Wars is you
634660	638720	buy the game and you go online for free.
638720	643160	That really works for a console because they pay those monthly fees and stuff and then
643160	647160	maybe a little bit more casual and later on when they offer their expansions or whatever
647160	651080	you can download those as a microtransaction or whatever.
651080	657920	That would actually work very well for consoles whereas an MMO like Final Fantasy XI or something,
657920	662000	not as good as normal.
662000	663000	Interesting points.
663000	664000	We shall see what ends up happening.
664000	675000	Well, as far as other stuff, for people who wanted the 60GB PS3, it actually will get
675000	677800	it while you can because we're not going to be getting any more.
677800	681400	So yeah, let's cut the price and then get rid of them.
681400	684640	Seems to me like a clearance option.
684640	686200	Like Overstock, you know?
686200	687560	Buy all this.
687560	689280	It's a bait and switch is what it is.
689280	692360	Yeah, because the 80GB is going to be coming out for $600 next.
692360	696600	And it costs Sony less to make because they put the cheaper emulation thing in it.
696600	701160	That's a nasty fucking trick they played on the hardcore audience.
701160	705840	Most casual gamers aren't going to figure it out, but in my mind that was a bit of a
705840	706840	nasty trick.
706840	708760	They did the same thing though with the 20GB system.
708760	711320	It was only available until about December.
711320	715480	Despite what they say, it was unavailable to buy after about December.
715480	721920	And it's just to give you the impression that you really want that 20GB one, but you can't
721920	725040	find it and you really, really want the system so you're going to spend the extra hundred
725040	728480	dollars on it because you get this free game now and all that stuff.
728480	731680	But I don't know, I'm not surprised.
731680	735160	You know what sucks for our friends in Europe is that they're not getting a price cut.
735160	742480	Instead, what they're getting is a bundle with some first party titles and another six
742480	749360	axis controller for 115 pounds.
749360	752040	Which in my mind just reaffirms why Sony's doing this.
752040	756000	It's not so much about, oh, we're going to give the US a price cut.
756000	759640	It's about, oh, we need to stop losing so much money on the systems, so we're going
759640	762920	to give the US the system we've been putting out in Europe that costs us less to make.
762920	768200	Well, they'll be getting a choice to pick from Resistance Fall of Man, Motorstorm, Genji,
768200	772800	Days of the Blade, Formula One, Championship Edition, Ridge Racer 7, two of those plus
772800	776720	the two six axis controllers and it'll be available.
776720	784280	It's actually due on sale on the 18th of July for the UK and starting in Europe on the first
784280	785840	of August.
785840	792040	Well, if you want to get a PlayStation 3 and emulation is of a concern to you, maybe you
792040	797240	don't have a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1, this would probably be the time to get
797240	798240	it.
798240	800640	I mean, honestly, if there's one positive thing you could say about this is that it
800640	803760	does give you the chance to snatch up that system while you still can.
803760	805240	Be sure to read the labels carefully.
805240	807520	The new systems will show you.
807520	812120	It has a little warning about the emulation on the new box that says not all games are
812120	813120	actually playable.
813120	819160	Now, you know, it wouldn't be fair to mention this and then not mention, well, you know,
819160	824240	the Xbox 360 uses software emulation as well, so to rag Sony for cutting back on the emulation
824240	827760	may be a little bit unfair, I don't know, but however, I don't know.
827760	832360	You do still feel like the sense of loss with this whole little switch going on and the
832360	836240	fact that they're, you know, maybe I don't want to dig out my PlayStation 2 and I'm
836240	838440	going to go through all this to hook up my PlayStation 3.
838440	839440	I don't know.
839440	840440	All right.
840440	843400	Well, anyhow, let's go on to another game that was announced by Sony.
843400	847960	Now, this is something original and this is good because Sony needs to have more original
847960	853400	fun stuff, more original IPs to really differentiate themselves from Microsoft, and so they came
853400	855480	up with a game called Echo Chrome.
855480	859280	This is something that was introduced by Phil Harrison, and what's very interesting about
859280	862120	Echo Chrome is that the graphics are very simplistic.
862120	867320	They're black and white MC Escher-style drawings, and what's kind of cool, I watched a video
867320	871740	of this game in motion, is that the way you rotate the screen around will affect the way
871740	875960	the painting looks, thusly affecting the little runner that runs around the painting.
875960	880440	Now, there's little holes and little launch pads and little gaps that as you rotate the
880440	883620	screen become filled because of your perspective.
883620	886440	It's a very interesting type of thing for a puzzle game.
886440	890140	It's certainly not going to push the envelope as far as next-gen graphics are concerned,
890140	896380	but the graphics are crisp, according to folks that have seen it, crisp, clean, sharp graphics
896380	898520	that might actually be kind of fun.
898520	902520	But I look at this and I kind of go, this looks like it better be a download title.
902520	905200	I could not see myself paying 60 bucks for something like this.
905200	906440	It's going to be a download title.
906440	907440	Thank God.
907440	908440	It's also coming with a PSP.
908440	909440	Okay, cool.
909440	912920	Well, it's a download title that looks pretty rad.
912920	916440	That's right up there with some of the classics on Xbox Live Arcade.
916440	918260	It could be pretty awesome.
918260	922680	So good for them with something original that gets people going, oh, something new as opposed
922680	926100	to a sequel to the same old thing.
926100	930640	Other things that they're showing off there, one other thing for the redesigned PSP is
930640	935840	it's going to actually have an improved UMD slot there, so you're not going to have any
935840	938800	launched UMDs from dropping the system on the ground.
938800	942720	Also it's going to have double the RAM, so it's going to load those UMDs a little bit
942720	943720	faster.
943720	947320	Plus, it's supposed to make web browsing a little bit easier, be able to load some of
947320	950840	the larger pages out there and stuff.
950840	954240	Other things they were showing off, Gran Turismo 5.
954240	958920	It's going to be coming out, of course, next year at some point.
958920	963760	They're going to be releasing a Gran Turismo 5 prologue to the PlayStation Network.
963760	969480	That's going to be just like Gran Turismo HD, a little bit of a demo taste of it as
969480	970480	you will.
970480	974560	Also, they were showing home and some of the improvements done to that.
974560	976960	They've redesigned the whole lobby system for it.
976960	979960	It looks almost like an outdoor mall.
979960	988120	Also you'll be able to jump into multiplayer games with people as well.
988120	992960	That's pretty much the big stuff they were showing off on their network.
992960	997920	My only gripe with them, remember last week how we were talking about, oh yeah, they're
997920	1002840	going to be bringing demos and videos to the PlayStation Network.
1002840	1005080	It's going to be just like the Xbox Live thing.
1005080	1007880	They're going to be bringing it home and stuff.
1007880	1008880	No they didn't.
1008880	1009880	They brought videos.
1009880	1014020	Great, because I can watch those all over the internet and stuff.
1014020	1016760	Not a single demo.
1016760	1019960	Bobby Blackwolf has asked why you're not mentioning Chewbacca.
1019960	1026800	Okay, Chewbacca announced the PSP redesign thing with Darth Vader.
1026800	1027800	Great.
1027800	1034200	At least that guy is still getting work.
1034200	1037720	Same thing we've done before for all of the other three conferences.
1037720	1039920	Chat room, I ask for your opinion as well.
1039920	1042320	What did you think of the Sony press conference?
1042320	1043320	Rate it on scale.
1043320	1044320	Tell me what you thought.
1044320	1047320	Who wants to go first?
1047320	1049020	Well right, Dark Soccer without resounding yawn.
1049020	1050020	Is that your summary?
1050020	1051020	Yeah.
1051020	1052020	Okay.
1052020	1053020	Short and sweet.
1053020	1054020	Loki.
1054020	1059480	I think their whole theme of promises, promises and not following through has kind of shown
1059480	1061680	through again this year.
1061680	1067500	The price cut, they made it look like a price cut but it's actually not a price cut which
1067500	1068840	is fucked up.
1068840	1072480	Not to mention some other stuff we'll get into a little bit later on that's also fucked
1072480	1075720	up especially if you buy a system now.
1075720	1079200	And just this whole, oh look at all these games that are coming out and not mentioning,
1079200	1081240	oh by the way they're not coming out until next year.
1081240	1084280	I do have to give them props on Killzone 2 though.
1084280	1085580	That looks fucking amazing.
1085580	1087240	And that is about the only thing.
1087240	1089240	Thank you for satisfying a chat comment before I read it.
1089240	1091880	Tigerclaw was just complaining, we forgot to mention the new Killzone 2 trailer.
1091880	1093520	I didn't forget to mention it.
1093520	1095120	I didn't mention it on purpose.
1095120	1100640	It looks really good and it's actually, it's a game I want to buy now because it looks
1100640	1102160	kind of like Resistance a bit.
1102160	1106120	You know, Resistance with a little bit of Gears of War thrown in there and I think that's
1106120	1107120	pretty awesome.
1107120	1109120	It impressed me a lot more than Halo 3 did.
1109120	1113680	So you know, props to them for that but the problem is it's not coming out this year.
1113680	1119360	So once again you're show me shit that, you know, I'm not going to buy your Playstation
1119360	1121680	3 for these games that are coming out next year.
1121680	1126240	At least I wouldn't be buying it if I didn't have one right now this holiday season which
1126240	1128680	is really where it's going to count for you guys.
1128680	1133120	It's, I'll be buying it when it comes out, you know, actually in the summer of next year
1133120	1134260	or whatever.
1134260	1136380	So it doesn't do them any good for this holiday.
1136380	1140840	Once again, if they don't come out with something amazing, they're going to lose out on another
1140840	1141840	holiday.
1141840	1143800	It's really going to hurt them.
1143800	1147240	The only thing I really care about coming out of there is, of course, Silent Hill 5
1147240	1151200	and I really want Metal Gear Solid 4.
1151200	1157240	As far as my thoughts on Sony's press conference, you know, I said before last week that Nintendo
1157240	1160520	had the most to lose going into E3 and Sony had the most to gain.
1160520	1161960	Getting a new Civ game?
1161960	1165440	Well, yeah, but that's, well it's also coming on Xbox 360 though.
1165440	1167680	I downloaded the trailer and I'm pretty excited about that.
1167680	1169240	But that's different.
1169240	1174040	You know, I think Sony did a way better job than they did last year.
1174040	1179680	I think, you know, they certainly changed the tone of their press conference and had
1179680	1183720	it a little well oiled and got the kinks a little better, worked out this year.
1183720	1189040	But I still walked away from it being more excited about the PSP than the Playstation
1189040	1190040	3.
1190040	1192280	And I don't know if that's a good sign.
1192280	1194640	This whole bait and switch leaves a real bad taste to my mind.
1194640	1195640	Here's the problem.
1195640	1198480	Last year, remember, last year it was all, oh, Gran Turismo 5, it's going to be like
1198480	1202560	Gran Turismo HD and stuff, but better and all this stuff.
1202560	1204440	No Gran Turismo 5 this year.
1204440	1209200	And then this, you know, the E3, ooh, Gran Turismo 5, it's so awesome and stuff.
1209200	1216840	You know, and it does look really good, but Project Gotham 4 also looks really good.
1216840	1221600	And if this game is going to take, you know, until Summer 08 to come out, they're going
1221600	1225400	to have Project Gotham Racing 5, which is going to look even more amazing.
1225400	1231720	And it's just, it's all this promising of really good games that are coming out way
1231720	1232720	later.
1232720	1233720	That's the problem.
1233720	1237360	It's not like Microsoft where it's like, here's these great games, they're coming out this
1237360	1238360	Fall.
1238360	1242920	You know, get excited for them because they're right around the corner, whereas this stuff
1242920	1244720	is coming way later on.
1244720	1247280	Yeah, I kind of feel the same way as that.
1247280	1250520	You know, it sounds like I'll have a lot more to get excited about with the Playstation 3
1250520	1251520	at next year's E3.
1251520	1252520	Exactly.
1252520	1256200	Like Final Fantasy XIII is there, but is it going to be too late?
1256200	1257200	I don't know.
1257200	1260360	Or remember, like, you know, they're showing LittleBigPlanet, that's next year.
1260360	1263200	They're talking about Home, which I hope that's this year.
1263200	1265760	I mean, it's, yeah, I don't know.
1265760	1270160	So it's just disappointing in that sense.
1270160	1271160	I don't know.
1271160	1274960	Part of me on a scale of 1 to 10 wants to give Sony a question mark for, I just don't
1274960	1275960	know.
1275960	1278680	Like, their press conference looks like the town of Silent Hill.
1278680	1281640	There's too much haze around everything for me.
1281640	1288000	I will give them, I will reward them for their PSP redesign, even though, you know, they're
1288000	1290440	taking the old ones away or whatever's supposed to be happening.
1290440	1297960	You know, I give that good points, but the Playstation 3, although some games look cool,
1297960	1299980	I'm not completely blown away, but I give them credit.
1299980	1302760	I give them the most improved player award.
1302760	1305740	I would give their conference a 6.
1305740	1306740	Explain this to me.
1306740	1312360	Why should I get a PS3 with a larger hard drive when there's nothing to download for
1312360	1313360	it?
1313360	1319440	There's trailers for movies, there's trailers for games, there's literally less than ten
1319440	1326000	demos online, and there's a handful of, you know, Playstation download titles.
1326000	1332920	So am I buying this larger hard drive system for, you know, so I can dump some of my games
1332920	1336560	stuff to the hard drive so it can cache the system and make it run faster since the Blu
1336560	1337840	Ray drive's too slow?
1337840	1342720	I mean, it's, they haven't really shown me why we need to buy a system with a larger
1342720	1344640	hard drive in the first place.
1344640	1350040	They're really pushing, trust me, hard drive space is not what's holding people back from
1350040	1353160	buying your system.
1353160	1357440	Black Wolf says, going to chat room, all three companies pretty much surrendered the press
1357440	1358880	conferences.
1358880	1362040	Flora Dean says, Sony fails three.
1362040	1365540	Dark Tetsuya says, I liked everything I saw except the new Ratchet and Clank, which should
1365540	1368400	just be released on Playstation 2 if it's not already.
1368400	1374000	SSJ100Matt says, Sony, they showed everyone what they wanted, games, Killzone 2, Unreal
1374000	1375000	3, etc.
1375000	1380280	They showed that the Playstation 3 has real future, solid B+, A-.
1380280	1383200	You know what, I will give them credit for this and maybe, actually, maybe I'll bump
1383200	1388580	up my score to a seven for this sole reason, the eye of judgment was nowhere to be seen.
1388580	1391440	So I will bump up Sony's score to seven for scrapping that piece of shit.
1391440	1395000	They showed it on the show floor, so that was there.
1395000	1398560	We're great in the conference, so I'll give them the bonus point.
1398560	1405080	I will give them the same as I gave Nintendo a six, just because it's promises, and I think
1405080	1410080	there's going to be, you know, where the disappointments were with the whole...
1410080	1411880	Black Wolf says, eye of judgment was not on the floor.
1411880	1415240	Well, I saw a video of it, so I know that it was there in some...
1415240	1416520	Maybe behind a door that maybe...
1416520	1417520	Bobby didn't look behind.
1417520	1424280	Well, it was there, they were showing it, but, you know, I just...
1424280	1425600	I think people are going to get...
1425600	1430920	It's going to be a whole line of disappointments with Sony, and that's just...
1430920	1434080	As we go through the fourth quarter, it's just going to be disappointment after disappointment.
1434080	1438900	I think the PlayStation 3 is really set to go the same way as the PSP.
1438900	1443840	It's not going to get really, really cool until like three years later, or two or three
1443840	1444840	years later.
1444840	1445840	Yeah, unfortunately.
1445840	1446840	Kind of interesting.
1446840	1448360	All right.
1448360	1451620	Black Wolf says it might have been in their invite-only hotel suite.
1451620	1455680	He wanted to ask about the copying of cards just for you, about going to Kinko's and making
1455680	1457800	your own cards.
1457800	1459920	Here's their reasoning behind it.
1459920	1461840	They're saying...
1461840	1464740	They basically didn't give a reason.
1464740	1468480	There's no copy protection on the cards, but their thing was, you know, it would be like
1468480	1471440	playing Magic the Gathering with someone with photocopied cards.
1471440	1474340	Like you'd really play someone with photocopied cards.
1474340	1476080	That was their reasoning behind it.
1476080	1480480	So in other words, yes, you can copy the cards or download images off the internet instead
1480480	1485440	of buying booster packs and copying the card stock, and it'll work just fine.
1485440	1488880	The Rob D. asks, the PSP is really, really cool?
1488880	1490720	I might buy a PSP for the emulation.
1490720	1493000	All right, maybe less of the really, really.
1493000	1497040	But you know, the PSP has never been solely a gaming system.
1497040	1500380	I do respect the system for everything else it can do, like being kind of a little mini
1500380	1502480	media kit.
1502480	1507240	But yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff that have come out for it in the past year.
1507240	1508660	I think they can't be ignored.
1508660	1512320	But did you notice, though, that they're kind of making the PSP out now to be almost like
1512320	1514360	more of an iPod or a Zune or something?
1514360	1517920	Because now it has a video out thing on it, and you're going to be able to charge it using
1517920	1520000	the USB cable on there as well.
1520000	1523200	So if you're on the go, you can charge it and stuff.
1523200	1526740	And then of course, memory stick prices are coming down quite a bit.
1526740	1529380	So I don't know.
1529380	1530380	It's interesting.
1530380	1542000	Their PR department is so horrible, so horrible, and their upper management needs to shut the
1542000	1543240	hell up.
1543240	1544240	It's not helping them.
1544240	1548880	And I know Ken Kutaragi's gone now because he was making dumb statements before and stuff.
1548880	1552560	But my god, Kazurai is not any better.
1552560	1554440	It's not any better with him.
1554440	1556960	All right, well, there you have it.
1556960	1560160	Our thoughts on the Sony press conference.
1560160	1564880	Let's go now to some more listener feedback via the email bag, because we love to get
1564880	1565880	emails.
1565880	1567920	And if you weren't in our chat room tonight and you want to give your two cents to the
1567920	1573360	press conferences or anything you saw at E3, send us an email, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com,
1573360	1577200	because Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and reads a few of her favorite pieces
1577200	1578960	of email here with us.
1578960	1579960	So Dark Sakura?
1579960	1581920	Hee hee hee, Captain Crayola.
1581920	1589200	Jump in the mailbag and pull something out for us, will you?
1589200	1590200	Email.
1590200	1591200	Hi, OLR crew.
1591200	1595280	I guess this is where I should say I'm a long time listener, but a first time emailer.
1595280	1597200	I first heard about your show from Bobby Black Wolf.
1597200	1600680	He's an old friend of mine from the days when we were moderators on the forums for a TV
1600680	1605600	channel that are left unmentioned and have been listening to the podcast on and off for
1605600	1606600	about a year.
1606600	1609820	I always find the show enjoyable and you've become one of my mainstays for relatively
1609820	1614560	unbiased or biased in a way that matches my own opinions at gaming news.
1614560	1618360	Recently I listened to the podcast of your five year plus one episode and I have a bone
1618360	1621120	to pick with Loki and Rob regarding the Harvest Moon series.
1621120	1626040	Loki is on record as enjoying sandbox games and the Harvest Moon series fits this description
1626040	1630240	to a T. The games have something for everyone.
1630240	1634560	Real time strategy fans can strategize to get the most crops each season, those who
1634560	1640760	enjoy dating sims can and most of the games date the NPCs, culminating in creating a family.
1640760	1645280	Action fans can have fun catching fish, chopping down trees and planting endless fields of
1645280	1649840	grass, RPG fans can engage in as many tedious and pointless quests as have ever been found
1649840	1651340	in one game.
1651340	1654480	There are no expectations and certainly no requirements for the manner in which one plays
1654480	1656440	the game, what's not to love.
1656440	1660300	Not liking the series because farming isn't for you makes more sense than disliking them
1660300	1662680	because all the games are the same.
1662680	1665240	After all doesn't Halo do the same thing?
1665240	1668120	Anyway my husband and I love the show and are looking forward to listening for years
1668120	1669120	to come.
1669120	1670120	Thanks for brightening up our week.
1670120	1671120	Yours the black monster.
1671120	1674200	P.S. this email was written on a G4 titanium power book.
1674200	1679280	I'll address this.
1679280	1682020	It's not a sandbox game, it's a sim for one.
1682020	1686840	It's a farming sim and granted yeah it has RPG elements and stuff like that, much like
1686840	1689840	Animal Crossing is also like a sim.
1689840	1693680	It's basically you're doing tasks and stuff.
1693680	1694680	Same kind of thing.
1694680	1695680	Let's go for the game.
1695680	1702580	My problem with it, and you may want to compare it to Halo I guess, yeah Microsoft isn't releasing
1702580	1704720	eight copies of the game a year.
1704720	1709840	I mean seriously there are so many Harvest Moon games they're saying that are different
1709840	1711560	but aren't really different.
1711560	1715320	Like there's the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls which I'm going to take a wild guess and say
1715320	1720440	it's probably just like the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls on the GameCube and stuff like that.
1720440	1725560	There's the whole innocent life of futuristic Harvest Moon or something like that which
1725560	1733040	was just like a futuristic setting, still farming and still all the same stuff.
1733040	1735180	Great if that's for you, awesome.
1735180	1736180	It's not a sandbox game.
1736180	1738040	This is not Grand Theft Auto farming.
1738040	1742120	See this is the problem is that this game doesn't involve guns and violence.
1742120	1743560	That's where your problem is.
1743560	1745640	The problem is it doesn't change.
1745640	1747320	It's not innovating any.
1747320	1749120	I mean it's farming.
1749120	1750120	Okay great.
1750120	1751280	Are there different crops this time?
1751280	1752280	Oh goody.
1752280	1759040	I mean it's not like you have a crop or something and you have to fight off the man who's trying
1759040	1762840	to steal your property to build a mall or something on it.
1762840	1767240	I think what's going on here is that sandbox is kind of being seen as a very general term
1767240	1774760	where Loki likes a very specific type of sandbox game like the 3D jump, shoot, find, destroy
1774760	1777400	rape type of sandbox game.
1777400	1781320	Sandbox games are basically games you can go in there and do whatever you want and tackle
1781320	1782320	it however you want.
1782320	1784520	This is a farming, this is a sim game.
1784520	1791880	You start off with crops, you tend to the crops and stuff and it's a farming sim with
1791880	1793560	RPG elements.
1793560	1796480	From my perspective I've tried Harvest Moon.
1796480	1801360	I played the one on the GameCube and I just couldn't get into it.
1801360	1805680	I think for me there was just kind of like too much going on at once.
1805680	1810480	It didn't have that kind of simplicity that Animal Crossing had but I don't know.
1810480	1814160	I guess maybe I need to give the series another look because if I like Animal Crossing I should
1814160	1819560	like something like Harvest Moon but I just wasn't feeling it.
1819560	1821280	There was nothing to keep me coming back.
1821280	1828680	What they need to do is instead of releasing four or five titles a year of Harvest Moon,
1828680	1833720	just release one good title of Harvest Moon each year and do it that way.
1833720	1837640	Put some more effort into the game instead of just rehashing the same thing and giving
1837640	1838640	a new coat of paint.
1838640	1842880	A devil's advocate, I have to, I may not agree with what I'm about to say but devil's advocate
1842880	1843880	I have to.
1843880	1845160	Doesn't DDR do the same damn thing?
1845160	1846160	Yes it does.
1846160	1850320	It does the same damn thing and that's another reason why that series is starting to go downhill.
1850320	1854920	It's because that's all they do is just give it a new fresh coat of paint, change the colors
1854920	1859240	of the menu or something and then just add some new songs and that's it and expect you
1859240	1860240	to buy it.
1860240	1864000	Can we talk about something other than Harvest Moon now?
1864000	1865000	Absolutely.
1865000	1866720	This next email is super cool.
1866720	1870220	Dear OLR crew, this is Rama the Blind from Indonesia.
1870220	1873520	I finally wrote my second email to you and I hope I could share some video game related
1873520	1877600	contents that might interest you all and all of your listeners.
1877600	1879920	First of all, I would like to announce that I finally bought a Wii.
1879920	1883840	That's because I've got nostalgia for old Nintendo systems so I wish I could play some
1883840	1888840	of the old classic games via virtual console or perhaps I could hear my friends play the
1888840	1892600	games as my condition makes me impossible to play all the games.
1892600	1896100	I tried experimenting with the Wiimote and discovered that Wii bowling is actually playable
1896100	1897100	by the blind.
1897100	1900520	Even though I cannot control the ball accurately, the game is still fun for the blind.
1900520	1905200	By measuring the distance between both sides, left and right TV screen, I can move my Wii
1905200	1909160	mote within the range and that's how Wii bowling becomes playable as I don't need to see the
1909160	1911620	screen.
1911620	1916220	Right now, I'm still trying some other Wii titles and I hope I could discover more games
1916220	1917480	for blinds to play.
1917480	1922400	I wish that Nintendo could make a research about this and perhaps create accessible contents
1922400	1923400	for the blind to purchase.
1923400	1928640	So you guys, do you have any comments about this?
1928640	1932240	Well I appreciate hearing back because it's always interesting to hear from this kind
1932240	1937080	of like perspective that doesn't often get enough recognition at large in gaming blogs
1937080	1938080	and things.
1938080	1939400	There were sound games on the Saturn back in the day.
1939400	1940480	Why can't Nintendo do that?
1940480	1942640	I'm actually going to turn around and ask another question.
1942640	1946040	I'm really curious because I bet this email was sent in before Nintendo's press conference
1946040	1947040	this week.
1947040	1949600	I'm really curious what this emailer thinks about some of these other new innovations
1949600	1954720	like Wii Fit and some of these other directions that Nintendo's going that has a little more
1954720	1956600	to do with movement.
1956600	1957600	That makes sense.
1957600	1962520	Well, email us back, actually I'm going to have to ask him to email us back because of
1962520	1963520	the next part.
1963520	1964520	Did you have a comment?
1964520	1971440	Oh, I was just going to say that unfortunately blind gamers are such a small percentage of
1971440	1975600	their demographic that I don't think you're ever going to see anything that's really dedicated
1975600	1980800	to it unless you get some independent company out there that's really gearing towards that.
1980800	1984440	There's no reason for them to make sound based games unless they can do something pretty
1984440	1988000	innovative because there was some stuff on the Game Boy Advance that was just part of
1988000	1993840	that bit generation series but it's just unfortunately blind handicapped and stuff.
1993840	1999320	It is such a small area for them that there's unfortunately not going to see much publishers
1999320	2000720	out there focusing on that.
2000720	2003960	What about something that would make the existing games more accessible to the audience?
2003960	2005680	That's great if they can do something like that.
2005680	2011040	I sort of think about how Windows has the zoom feature and those other types of accessibility
2011040	2012840	options.
2012840	2014800	Could a game console adapt something similar?
2014800	2015800	That's possible.
2015800	2016800	I don't know.
2016800	2019800	World Combat Armageddon though would probably be a lot easier to play.
2019800	2022240	You can waggle the thing around and throw...
2022240	2023240	Broadcalibur!
2023240	2024240	Anyhow, sorry.
2024240	2027040	Let the email finish.
2027040	2030480	The next part is another thing I would like to share is a Final Fantasy concert held in
2030480	2031480	my country.
2031480	2036040	Actually, this is the second one as the concert was also held last year but it was still enjoyable
2036040	2041080	especially in Indonesia where video game music is rare to find and game music concert is
2041080	2043080	like a distant dream.
2043080	2046680	You did say you uploaded pictures and videos from the concert.
2046680	2051520	I want your permission before I make that public to chat.
2051520	2055720	Or if you would like to go into our forum at orangelesradio.com and make a thread about
2055720	2059400	it then we would appreciate you sharing it with everybody that way.
2059400	2063140	I wish in the future another video game music concert will again be held here perhaps by
2063140	2066920	video game music live or play a video game symphony.
2066920	2068080	I think that's all for now.
2068080	2096800	Take care and have a good show.
2248080	2253960	Thanks for the show and let you guys know that you have yet another developer listening.
2253960	2256640	Feel free to write if you have any questions or issues I can help with.
2256640	2260600	I'm just going to use the nickname hero antagonist.
2260600	2261600	You know, it's funny.
2261600	2265920	I heard back from the developer that emailed us previously and he was willing to do an
2265920	2267840	ask a developer type segment.
2267840	2271400	So maybe we can get this guy in on it too and have some type of like round table thing
2271400	2272400	on a later show.
2272400	2275720	That might be kind of fun especially during the next few months.
2275720	2279000	It might be a little bit slow before we get into the fall rush of game news.
2279000	2281560	It might be kind of fun to do an ask a developer round table.
2281560	2283960	So please write us back if you'd be willing to participate.
2283960	2287600	You can contact me directly or send back the email back, whatever, because we're going
2287600	2289620	to try definitely doing something like that in the future.
2289620	2290620	This one's short.
2290620	2291620	Hey, OLR.
2291620	2294480	I know I'm kind of late with this one, but happy belated birthday, OLR.
2294480	2296040	You guys are awesome and keep it up.
2296040	2297040	Ron.
2297040	2298040	Thank you, Ron.
2298040	2299040	Thank you.
2299040	2300480	Did you bring us a present?
2300480	2301480	I'm sorry.
2301480	2303760	You said Ron and I think of Potter Puppet Pals.
2303760	2304760	Stop.
2304760	2305760	It's Snape.
2305760	2306760	Let's bother him.
2306760	2307760	No.
2307760	2308760	This last one.
2308760	2309760	Hey, guys.
2309760	2313360	I just want to say I love the show and what do you think about young gamers on online
2313360	2316080	games that they really shouldn't play?
2316080	2318080	I'm 14, so I really shouldn't be talking.
2318080	2319280	I just wanted your opinion.
2319280	2320280	Sincerely, Christian.
2320280	2322960	Who says you shouldn't talk if you're 14?
2322960	2323960	I mean age.
2323960	2324960	Age is a number.
2324960	2325960	Age is a number.
2325960	2327520	Maturity is everything.
2327520	2334680	I think if you can play a game maturely and that doesn't mean you have to play adult or
2334680	2335680	act adult.
2335680	2340040	You can have fun but still be mature and by that I mean you don't go onto Xbox Live and
2340040	2346140	yell NNNFFF and all those words that people scream on Xbox Live.
2346140	2352880	If you can have fun and have that self-deprecating humor and laugh and have a good time, then
2352880	2356160	fun doesn't have an age limit.
2356160	2360080	I am totally supportive of 14-year-olds playing online games.
2360080	2364720	If your parents are aware and if you're getting all your homework and all your other life
2364720	2370280	obligations done, it's not cutting into that, I think it's just like watching Nickelodeon
2370280	2371280	or whatever else is on TV.
2371280	2372280	I do have a suggestion.
2372280	2373280	What?
2373280	2374280	Use periods when you type.
2374280	2375280	He's 14.
2375280	2378200	Give him a break.
2378200	2383320	I had perfect grammar when I was 14.
2383320	2385680	Let's dig up some of your high school papers and check.
2385680	2386680	Honestly?
2386680	2389520	No, I really don't care that much.
2389520	2391160	I can say it because I can prove it.
2391160	2392160	I can back it up.
2392160	2404640	If you're typing on an MMO and you have something to say, something my granddaddy used to always
2404640	2409560	say, I will quote a bit of wisdom, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.
2409560	2414600	In this case, put brain in gear before typing, I guess.
2414600	2418720	Kevin DDR in chat would like to point out, I am a 14-year-old playing online games so
2418720	2419720	you're not alone.
2419720	2420720	Well, you're not alone.
2420720	2421720	There we go.
2421720	2428520	It's just a matter of just thinking before you do something.
2428520	2434160	I was playing online games at 14 only when I was 14 the online games we had to play were
2434160	2440880	Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars, The Pit, and so on and so on and if you catch
2440880	2443680	my references, you're a winner.
2443680	2446360	Is that it?
2446360	2447360	That's it.
2447360	2448360	All right.
2448360	2451640	If you'd like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2451640	2456480	By the way, I give everybody a hard time for their grammar so don't worry about it.
2456480	2458480	Mine's really not all that great.
2458480	2461200	Well, it's really better than Rob's on AIM though.
2461200	2462200	I will say that.
2462200	2463200	All right.
2463200	2464760	Anyhow, shut up.
2464760	2470880	We will get on to some other news coming out of E3 that didn't necessarily have to do with
2470880	2471880	the press conferences.
2471880	2476880	Actually, I want to spend a little time talking about music games because that's how we started.
2476880	2477880	That's our roots.
2477880	2481380	We need to talk about some of the music games that were going on at E3 and some of the events
2481380	2483240	that happened this week outside of E3.
2483240	2489360	Let's start with a game that was coming out from EA.
2489360	2490640	It's called Boogie.
2490640	2494240	EA announced the soundtrack to the game called Boogie.
2494240	2499400	It comes with a karaoke microphone and it's actually on the Wii.
2499400	2504960	They were trying to put together basically a lot of generations of hits.
2504960	2509640	In this game, you're supposed to be able to dance, sing, and make music videos using the
2509640	2510960	Wii controls.
2510960	2512280	That should be interesting.
2512280	2519240	Some of the songs that will be in this game, ABC by the Jackson 5, Brick House by the Commodores,
2519240	2524400	Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Love Roller Coaster by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Let's Get It
2524400	2529720	Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Love Shack by the B-52s, Milkshake by Kelis.
2529720	2531120	That's so rad.
2531120	2532120	One Way.
2532120	2533240	That's the song we got to get Loki to play.
2533240	2537520	One Way or Another by Blondie, Groove is in the Heart by Delight, Girls Just Want to Have
2537520	2542360	Fun, Cyndi Lauper, Get the Party Started by P!nk, Fergalicious by Fergie.
2542360	2543760	There's another Loki song.
2543760	2551080	YMCA by the Village People, Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, SOS by Rihanna, Oops I Did It
2551080	2552360	Again by Britney Spears.
2552360	2557920	It's a pretty fun list that brings across all generations there, so very cool.
2557920	2564440	If you want to see the full list, it's there at ea.com slash ea-tracks.
2564440	2568560	Another game coming out from EA, Rock Band.
2568560	2569560	Should be pretty interesting.
2569560	2573560	They announced some tracks at E3.
2573560	2581640	Let's see, we've got The Who with Won't Get Fooled Again, Mountain with Mississippi Queen,
2581640	2590960	David Bowie, Looks Like a Suffragette City, Black Sabbath Paranoid, Blue Oyster Cult Don't
2590960	2602280	Fear the Reaper, The Ramones, Rockaway Beach, Rush with Tom Sawyer, Bon Jovi with Wanted
2602280	2613520	Dead or Alive, Nirvana in Bloom, Stone Temple Pilots Vaseline, Weezer Say It Ain't So, Foo
2613520	2622040	Fighters Learn to Fly, Metallica Enter Sandman, The Hives, Main Offender, The Strokes, Reptilia,
2622040	2624680	and Queens of the Stone Age Go with Flow.
2624680	2629600	Now I heard in this game you'll be able to use the microphone as claps or a tambourine,
2629600	2635040	so I demand this mix have Stevie Nicks somewhere in it, Fleetwood Mac, whatever you have to
2635040	2636040	do to do it.
2636040	2639860	But you cannot have a game where you play the tambourine and not represent Miss Stevie
2639860	2642860	Nicks because that would just be awesome.
2642860	2643860	All kinds of awesome.
2643860	2646160	But the sound list sounds pretty neat so far.
2646160	2647160	It does.
2647160	2650720	And some other really cool things that they're going to be doing with the download content
2650720	2657640	is you'll be able to download whole albums at a time when you're playing this game.
2657640	2662720	One of the albums that they're going to have available is going to be for Metallica, and
2662720	2668360	I believe they're also announcing the Who's Who's Next album is also going to be available.
2668360	2671400	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
2671400	2674760	That has the possibility of being a pretty awesome game.
2674760	2676960	That's one reason I'm sad I didn't go to E3.
2676960	2677960	I would have liked to play that.
2677960	2680640	They also promise new content every week.
2680640	2683220	For how long?
2683220	2685760	If it takes off, I'd say probably a year.
2685760	2686760	For a year?
2686760	2687760	Oh my gosh.
2687760	2689200	That's something that could just keep going, though.
2689200	2690640	I think that's great.
2690640	2692880	That's going to be very interesting to see what that does.
2692880	2693880	Quite ambitious.
2693880	2696320	Harmonix gets it, you guys.
2696320	2697540	They get it.
2697540	2699720	Rock Band teams with MTV, I'm sorry.
2699720	2701640	It's going to take off.
2701640	2705960	It's kind of interesting to see what's going to happen to Guitar Hero this year because
2705960	2707640	they've almost got them beat at their own game.
2707640	2712680	I realize there's a guitar and drum element in this game that makes this...
2712680	2717720	I hope somehow poppy songs can... because I love poppy songs as well as rock songs.
2717720	2722840	I hope somehow they can be integrated into this game one way or another.
2722840	2723840	I don't know.
2723840	2727540	There's just a weird side of me that would like to be able to sing just the weird songs
2727540	2728920	you wouldn't expect in this game.
2728920	2732120	I want Rock Band 2 or whatever to have different instruments.
2732120	2733120	Yeah.
2733120	2734120	Rock Band 2 Electric Boogaloo.
2734120	2737200	Hopefully Rock Band 2 gives us a little more so we can sing different songs.
2737200	2739640	It would be damn hard to do a keyboard-style thing, though.
2739640	2741120	Please give me keyboard.
2741120	2743600	Please give me keyboard.
2743600	2747340	The format that they have set up for that, I doubt very seriously that would be possible
2747340	2748340	unless it's like...
2748340	2749340	I don't care.
2749340	2750340	...seven keys.
2750340	2751340	It's USB.
2751340	2752880	How hard could it be?
2752880	2755200	I'm talking about screen format.
2755200	2756200	Oh, screen format.
2756200	2762880	Yeah, especially when you've got the voice track, guitar, all this other business going
2762880	2765900	on on the screen and your animation going on.
2765900	2768240	Doing keyboard mode is not going to be...
2768240	2775900	I'm trying to think of the way that they have the Guitar Hero-style play going in.
2775900	2777520	They're not going to be able to do keyboard that way.
2777520	2781960	They could do it with keyboard mania because you had a full screen.
2781960	2785000	It was something that you could spread out, something that required the whole screen.
2785000	2789580	You couldn't have it coming at you and have it lay out to the keyboard format.
2789580	2792460	Dark Sakura, Destroyer of Dreams, everybody.
2792460	2794080	I'm just being realistic, Rob.
2794080	2795080	I understand.
2795080	2798440	Rob, there is no Easter Bunny.
2798440	2800280	I hate you.
2800280	2805240	There was no bunny hanging out at Easter.
2805240	2808040	Can we please move on?
2808040	2809040	Yes, please.
2809040	2811200	Hey, it's my turn, isn't it?
2811200	2812440	I have good news.
2812440	2818040	Well, it would be good news if it was still 1991, wouldn't it?
2818040	2820440	Oh, please read the story now.
2820440	2821440	I know what's coming.
2821440	2831680	Which, our curly-haired, top-hat-wearing hero of Guns N' Roses, currently a velvet revolver,
2831680	2833680	is a boss in Guitar Hero 3.
2833680	2836120	Buckethead is cooler!
2836120	2838040	I'm done.
2838040	2844120	I absolutely agree this news would have been ten times cooler in 1991, but it's still kind
2844120	2845120	of cool.
2845120	2849440	You have to admit, having Slash in the game, that is kind of cool because, you know, those
2849440	2853200	of us that remember Slash from our high school days are a little bit more grown-up now and
2853200	2857360	can spend the money on things like Guitar Hero 3, and there is a certain cool factor
2857360	2859000	to having Slash in the game.
2859000	2862680	You know, Guitar Hero 3 knows they're going to really have it in for them with this whole
2862680	2867040	rock band thing coming out, but I think it could be pretty cool.
2867040	2869900	Again, it all boils down to Songlist for me.
2869900	2873080	It's almost like this year's lineup, EA has it in for Activision.
2873080	2878880	I mean, they've got Skate coming out with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground coming out later.
2878880	2885520	Rock band and, I don't know, I guess with licensed games, you know, The Simpsons and
2885520	2886520	stuff.
2886520	2891800	Activision has a lot to lose if they don't innovate.
2891800	2897960	Could you imagine, though, the kind of Guitar Hero that they would have in 1991, like for
2897960	2898960	the Nintendo?
2898960	2901440	Super Nintendo was out at that time.
2901440	2903160	Something like that, though, would be a Genesis game.
2903160	2905640	It would be on Sega CD.
2905640	2907360	I want to say there was something like it, but there really wasn't.
2907360	2910880	I think the closest thing we had was Chris Cross's Make Your Own Music video.
2910880	2914680	And then we also had the CD plus G karaoke discs.
2914680	2915680	Exactly.
2915680	2916680	Anyway.
2916680	2919240	I have the Marky Mark 1, Rob.
2919240	2924520	GK128 says, Fuck Slash, Guitar Hero needs a college rock edition featuring Frank Black
2924520	2926840	from the Pixies and Jay Mascis from Dinosaur Jr.
2926840	2930920	I love you, officially.
2930920	2931920	You know what we need?
2931920	2938480	We need like late 70s, early 80s rock like Enitho and some Joy Division for me.
2938480	2939480	That'd be great.
2939480	2940480	And some Bauhaus.
2940480	2944520	Well, speaking of music games and going over to Konami, kind of talking about what they're
2944520	2948880	up to, Supernova 2 was tested this week, and some of the news has been a little bit lost
2948880	2952400	in the shuffle of all the E3 news, but if you head over to a site like BomaniStyle.com
2952400	2956320	that dedicates themselves to all the music game news, you can get some of the latest
2956320	2959600	wrap ups from the fans out there playing the location test.
2959600	2962480	And the whole list of those extra songs that are in the game has shown up.
2962480	2967340	There's some interesting covers in it, including Come Clean, which if I remember right was
2967340	2970520	like a Hilary Duff song, I think.
2970520	2973400	One of those little girls from the Disney Channel.
2973400	2977120	Faint, which if I'm not mistaken is a Linkin Park cover, is in there.
2977120	2978120	That should be interesting.
2978120	2979120	Waiting for Tonight.
2979120	2980300	Me Against the Music.
2980300	2981960	Some interesting covers there.
2981960	2985440	It's very interesting that Konami sticks with all these covers, not the real things.
2985440	2986440	I don't know.
2986440	2990200	Well, anyway, some other reports that come in from the updates.
2990200	2994560	Marvelous ratings in Supernova 2 don't seem to award more points than perfects, and for
2994560	2998200	some reason seemed easier to obtain than usual.
2998200	3002440	Strings of perfect ratings will by no means hamper a great song rating.
3002440	3008520	Konami finally has spelled Marvelous the right way, with one L, and it's a solid silver
3008520	3009520	color.
3009520	3010520	Let's see.
3010520	3014080	If a player is able to receive all perfects or better, the triple A rating on the results
3014080	3017240	screen will feature the text, full perfect combo.
3017240	3018680	Interesting.
3018680	3019680	Some other news there.
3019680	3024680	There's an extra stage that has a background video with Black Roses, people and other things
3024680	3025680	that are going on.
3025680	3028160	I guess the song is called Unreal.
3028160	3030680	There's an introduction video to DDR Has Returned.
3030680	3032460	There hasn't been one of those in a little while.
3032460	3035600	They say since 4th Mix there.
3035600	3038440	But they say some of the songs feel a little off sync.
3038440	3042600	People were complaining that some of the older songs from DDR Extreme and DDR Supernova didn't
3042600	3043600	feel quite right.
3043600	3046240	It wasn't off sync by much, but they were bitching it was off sync.
3046240	3049520	It should also be noted that they were also bitching that the pads being used on the location
3049520	3054400	test machine were not perfect, which might be a good point to reiterate that maybe it's
3054400	3058960	time for Konami to come out with some new pads that are a little better with the technology
3058960	3059960	that's a little newer.
3059960	3066600	Not to mention, if you guys remember the original Supernova Beta test, same issues, that stuff
3066600	3067600	was off sync.
3067600	3071260	It's just because it's a test.
3071260	3074720	Gerardimo says Me Against the Music by Helen is better than the original.
3074720	3078240	Gerardimo also says that that actually was not the extra stage.
3078240	3079840	I guess there's a little bit of confusion going on there.
3079840	3083240	I did hear that there was actually a song called No that was the extra stage, and there
3083240	3086360	was one other one, I think, called Kano or something as well.
3086360	3092080	Let's see, Black Wolf says only in DDR is perfect and not good enough.
3092080	3094760	Nice.
3094760	3099600	For DDR fans who are looking to get back into arcades, also the rumor is EMUs is coming
3099600	3103580	with Supernova 2, which you might remember from the Japanese Bomani games, it never really
3103580	3107840	came over here, but the rumor is the test machine had the EMUs set up on it.
3107840	3109840	So that's kind of interesting.
3109840	3110840	We'll see where that goes.
3110840	3114120	It could make up for lack of memory cards.
3114120	3116120	Maybe.
3116120	3118120	Hopefully.
3118120	3121480	I don't know.
3121480	3124280	So I don't know.
3124280	3129560	This is, I guess, cool that there's new content coming out for Guitar Hero 2 for the Xbox
3129560	3138040	360, and the new pack actually is going to have a few more songs in there, but at the
3138040	3144360	same time, I want to be sedated, smoke on the water, and you've got another thing coming.
3144360	3150080	It's still going to be 500 Microsoft points, or $6.25, and guess what?
3150080	3157760	Because people that did download it before, the first pack, over 300,000 of you, they
3157760	3161540	just showed Activision that, guess what?
3161540	3167000	That price point is still good, so we're not lowering the price.
3167000	3171380	So if you want them to lower the price, don't buy it.
3171380	3175380	So in other words, those prices aren't coming down anytime soon because too many people
3175380	3178120	actually supported the old packs, even though we told them not to.
3178120	3179120	Yes.
3179120	3182220	Well, I don't know about you guys, but that news that the prices are not coming down for
3182220	3186600	this old shit from Guitar Hero 1 makes me a little bit angsty, and you know what that
3186600	3197860	means.
3197860	3199160	Time for the FUs of the week.
3199160	3204160	Dark Sakura, please do us the honors and start us off.
3204160	3209720	My FU goes to my stomach, because I haven't, well, technically myself I should say, because
3209720	3218200	I haven't put anything in it since 12 o'clock today, and I'm very hungry.
3218200	3224000	So FU on the human dependency on food for sustenance.
3224000	3225000	Loki.
3225000	3232840	You know, I was going to have something petty to complain about, but I just realized something.
3232840	3238080	DDR hasn't had another download pack since the launch of the fucking universe game.
3238080	3239480	Where the fuck are the downloads?
3239480	3243760	Shit, universe 2 is right around the corner, where the hell is my goddamn downloads for
3243760	3244760	universe 1?
3244760	3249800	Or did you just forget to do that, kind of like the carry of your revolution pen discs?
3249800	3250800	Want to know my theory?
3250800	3255280	They ain't coming because the song packs were all already on the disc, and that's all they
3255280	3256280	made.
3256280	3258760	That's my theory.
3258760	3260400	Fuck them for that.
3260400	3263400	That's it.
3263400	3266320	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to move in two weeks and I still don't
3266320	3268320	have a place to live.
3268320	3272640	That's a little bit frustrating, but hopefully all will be better very soon and I'll have
3272640	3277360	a place, because that would be nice, because otherwise I'm going to cry.
3277360	3281320	Let's move on to some other news.
3281320	3284320	Now we're going to get into some news that, you know, some other things picked up around
3284320	3285320	this week.
3285320	3287760	Not necessarily at E3, but some of them are, some of them aren't.
3287760	3288760	Dark Soccer?
3288760	3293600	Well, there is some other stuff.
3293600	3299840	Disney has actually purchased War Inspector, their Junction Point Studios, so now we'll
3299840	3312280	be getting some new games and Disney is going to have some stuff coming to the new consoles.
3312280	3324200	War Inspector brought us the Deus Ex, Thief, Deadly Shadows, System Shock.
3324200	3325720	I really don't know how to feel about this.
3325720	3332280	I'm hoping that it's going to be good for getting the new games, and I mean, maybe it'll
3332280	3336840	mean that we get a Tron game, can I beg?
3336840	3339720	Besides the old recycled ones we're getting on Xbox Live?
3339720	3340720	Seriously.
3340720	3345120	Well, there's a quote on here saying, War Inspector's unique talents as leading creative
3345120	3350520	forces in the world of video games, his knowledge and passion for Disney, his legacy of storytelling
3350520	3354960	and character development adds a unique creative dimension to our portfolio, and it's from
3354960	3359400	the Executive VP of Disney Interactive.
3359400	3361920	So maybe, maybe we'll get some good.
3361920	3364980	Well, Disney's been up to a lot of wheeling and dealing lately.
3364980	3371080	They at E3 announced a new online service that will be on all of their DS titles.
3371080	3375480	It's called D Gamer, and it's going to be first in the Chronicles of Narnia game that's
3375480	3379520	coming out for the DS, and basically what D Gamer's going to do is it's going to turn
3379520	3383440	your Nintendo DS into Xbox Live of sorts.
3383440	3388440	There will be avatars, you can chat with other people, and you can look at the achievements
3388440	3390600	that your friends have unlocked.
3390600	3393600	Interesting that it took a third party to do this.
3393600	3398040	So the system is more than capable of handling this type of technology, it's just that Nintendo
3398040	3399920	doesn't want to do it.
3399920	3405360	Interesting, and interesting that somebody has decided to step up and do it, if not just
3405360	3406360	for their own games.
3406360	3410960	But let's face it, there's a certain audience that gets a lot of these Disney games that
3410960	3415080	come out, you know, the Hannah Montana games and the That's So Raven game, that will benefit
3415080	3419480	from this, whereas the rest of us hardcore gamers that are too cool to go out and buy
3419480	3424520	a Chronicles of Narnia video game, are going to be sitting here going, gosh, I wish I had
3424520	3429560	something like that when I was playing, you know, the games I'm playing, like Pokemon,
3429560	3431760	even though that's not much cooler.
3431760	3432760	Anyway.
3432760	3437960	Because Rob really likes Hannah Montana.
3437960	3438960	Sad.
3438960	3445560	Another disappointment, well, still rumors that the 6-axis controller is going to be
3445560	3451000	rumbling soon, in fact, it's been confirmed by a few different places, one of which is
3451000	3458460	supposedly a Sony employee, apparently, I guess, Sony employee confirmed directly to
3458460	3462560	Kotaku that the 6-axis will be rumbling soon.
3462560	3468920	Of course, shortly afterwards, immersion comes out saying, hey, we're making a TouchSense
3468920	3473540	rumble controller for the Playstation 3 in September.
3473540	3478700	So if a third-party company is making it for the Playstation 3 in September, because why
3478700	3483680	the hell would you add rumble to your controllers if, I don't know, there wasn't rumble coming,
3483680	3488800	because that would be kind of stupid, I don't know, that's very interesting.
3488800	3494840	But Sony is still denying it, saying, hey, yeah, it's not coming, you know, this is all
3494840	3499160	rumor, blah blah blah blah, but then again, last week, they were also saying, hey, we
3499160	3505400	have no plans on cutting the Playstation 3 price, or, you know, hey, the 60-gig system
3505400	3508520	is going to be $4.99 and we're going to be still producing them, you know, that kind
3508520	3509520	of stuff.
3509520	3516240	Let me put it this way, rumble isn't so last gen after all, oh yeah, exactly, I'm going
3516240	3519600	to take a wild guess and say it's probably coming this fall.
3519600	3524200	And so when you buy your Playstation 3 systems, guess what, you get to buy new controllers,
3524200	3527520	much like the Playstation 1, if you remember.
3527520	3532000	Devil's advocate, could the rumble in these controllers be for the backwards compatible
3532000	3533580	games?
3533580	3538520	It would be weird to see them, it could possibly, I guess, for that, but right now, as far as
3538520	3544560	I'm aware, I don't think the rumble, like, stuff is in there, I don't know.
3544560	3548160	I guess it's possible, it just, but they'd be kind of weird to buy a controller just
3548160	3549840	for the backwards compatible games.
3549840	3552840	Yeah, because that would imply that somebody bought a Playstation 3, you would totally
3552840	3556120	skip the Playstation 2, and I can't think that that's a very large audience.
3556120	3560240	And I can't imagine that that, like, programming or whatever would be built into the emulation
3560240	3568200	either, you know what I mean, so, I don't know, it'd be an interesting theory, but I
3568200	3569200	think it's coming.
3569200	3573520	Alright, well we shall see what Sony does in the upcoming months.
3573520	3578680	Sony's going to eat crayon pie is what they're going to do, well, except this, this is redemption
3578680	3590360	I think, they did a point that hinted to a coming of something, ok, I'm just going to
3590360	3595720	say it, Silent Hill 5 has been announced for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, which I'll
3595720	3600640	probably get it on PS3, I'm happy.
3600640	3604800	Oh my god, that's such a surprise, a Silent Hill game coming soon!
3604800	3608800	It is Silent Hill 5 and I don't care, so, gimme.
3608800	3613280	Here we go though, how would you feel, now we all know that Akira Yomoka is doing the
3613280	3616400	music and that's all sorts of rad because that's some of the best part of the Silent
3616400	3621080	Hill games, but Dark Sakura, how would your inner fangirl feel if I told you that Silent
3621080	3625820	Hill 5 is not being developed by Team Silent, but in fact is being developed by the team
3625820	3630480	that brought you Mark Echo's Getting Up and the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer game on
3630480	3631480	the Xbox.
3631480	3632640	The first Buffy game was really good.
3632640	3636880	Alright, so your inner fangirl may give this a chance?
3636880	3638840	As long as my man does the music.
3638840	3644560	Alright, yeah, so Akira Yomoka, they did announce is doing the music, so, alright, there you
3644560	3645560	go.
3645560	3647100	That's too much metal for one hand.
3647100	3650720	There was lots of Silent Hill news this week, because you know, Origins looks like they've
3650720	3653480	completely redone it from the time you and I saw it.
3653480	3655840	Yeah, it actually looks really good now.
3655840	3658360	That's why it's getting pushed back from the end of last year.
3658360	3659360	Thank god, see, you know.
3659360	3663080	They completely redid that stuff, and then of course Silent Hill Arcade, which I had
3663080	3667560	my fangasm over in part A. Seriously, if you haven't seen the videos, it's so rad.
3667560	3672120	I don't want to spoil what happens, but like the battle with Pyramid Head ends in like
3672120	3673920	the raddest way.
3673920	3677640	Oh my god, like, fangasm all over.
3677640	3678640	It's awesome.
3678640	3683400	And yes, I am a fanboy for Pyramid Head and Silent Hill, I will admit it.
3683400	3688200	Anyhow, I'm also a fanboy for price drops, and I was kind of hoping, like many of you,
3688200	3690760	that Microsoft would announce one this week at E3.
3690760	3692760	Well, you know what?
3692760	3698480	There was an interview from 1UP with Shane Kim, and they were talking to him.
3698480	3700700	He's of course the corporate VP at Microsoft Game Studios.
3700700	3706760	They were asking him about the whole, you know, what does Xbox 360 need to win, and
3706760	3708520	where's the price drop?
3708520	3715320	Well, Shane Kim doesn't completely count out a price drop.
3715320	3717200	In fact, he says, stay tuned.
3717200	3718600	We didn't announce anything here.
3718600	3719600	Didn't feel the need to.
3719600	3722360	July is a very odd time to announce a price reduction.
3722360	3726960	I'm not even sure Sony announced a price reduction anyway, because, you know, the whole bait
3726960	3729080	and switch thing going on.
3729080	3733060	So they said we didn't feel the need to do it at E3.
3733060	3734620	So they're not cutting it out of the picture.
3734620	3738040	It might just not be, you know, coming for a little while, kind of like was speculated
3738040	3739360	earlier in the show.
3739360	3742040	So very interesting.
3742040	3749720	Of course, I should say there's a huge rumor going around about the August 1st price drop.
3749720	3750720	I don't know.
3750720	3751720	That seems a little soon.
3751720	3755360	If they were going to do it then, they might as well have announced it at PlayStation 3.
3755360	3756880	Black Wolf has an interesting thought.
3756880	3759320	He says they might announce it at Penny Arcade Expo.
3759320	3760320	They might announce it.
3760320	3761320	Take it directly to the fans.
3761320	3762320	They'll love it.
3762320	3766360	Announce it at PAX or now there's X07, you know.
3766360	3767640	I heard they canceled it.
3767640	3768640	Oh, well.
3768640	3769640	No, no, no.
3769640	3774120	I'm thinking of their event over in Europe.
3774120	3775120	Is that it?
3775120	3776120	Yeah, it's X07.
3776120	3777120	I don't think that's happening this year.
3777120	3778120	Okay, what about Tokyo Game Show then?
3778120	3779120	That could be.
3779120	3780120	I don't know.
3780120	3781120	You never know.
3781120	3785120	They have plenty of time to do it and especially, you know, waiting until closer to Halo and
3785120	3786120	stuff.
3786120	3787120	I don't know.
3787120	3788120	I don't think they're in trouble.
3788120	3792160	Another thing I was going to mention real quick though, there was also Capcom was saying
3792160	3797200	that they speculate that the PlayStation 3 will drop price again and there's also speculation
3797200	3802600	that I know Europe was supposed to be getting that 120 gig PlayStation 3 and can you imagine
3802600	3806640	if they do the same thing here and so it's going to be every few months or so you're
3806640	3810760	going to get price drop, clearance, new system come out.
3810760	3820280	Anyways, so GamePro on top of their game apparently did a little article of seven games that mysteriously
3820280	3826400	were missing from E3, which is full of inaccuracies, so let's just go down the list, shall we?
3826400	3832680	Grand Theft Auto IV, God, where was Grand Theft Auto IV other than the PlayStation press
3832680	3838280	conference, the Xbox press conference, the Take-Two press conference where they did a
3838280	3843520	walk-through demo of the thing, yeah, it wasn't there.
3843520	3847480	Spore, no, Spore was there.
3847480	3852800	They showed off a few more things on it and had a little press demo for it.
3852800	3857640	God of War III, okay, that wasn't there, I'll give them that.
3857640	3860180	Let's see what other stuff they're talking about here.
3860180	3863480	I'm surprised there was no God of War III, but I guess they always have Heavenly Sword
3863480	3864480	on account.
3864480	3865480	It's probably so far off in development.
3865480	3866480	Yeah, true.
3866480	3871320	So was Halo 3 when they first started cockteasing us with it.
3871320	3881280	I don't know, a new Rainbow Six game, they're like saying the successor to Rainbow Six Vegas,
3881280	3886200	I don't know, I mean the last game just came out, what, a few weeks ago, I don't think
3886200	3890720	they need to be teasing the new one yet, especially if it goes the way of Splinter Cell Conviction,
3890720	3895160	that was another thing out of the Microsoft conference, it's exclusive to Xbox 360.
3895160	3901440	Uh oh, Prince of Persia IV, I don't really think we need a new Prince of Persia game
3901440	3905760	since we have like kind of Assassin's Creed kind of fills that void there for a little
3905760	3906760	bit.
3906760	3912160	Have you seen Prince of Persia games since, you know, what, 1994 at all, ever?
3912160	3915360	I don't know, the new ones are okay.
3915360	3922320	Peter Jackson's Halo, I mean, that's just, because they didn't have enough Halo content
3922320	3926080	what with the gift cards and the 360 and everything else.
3926080	3930200	And Final Fantasy XIII, well they announced it wasn't going to be there anyways, so I
3930200	3934960	don't know, you know, how about some other stuff, how about, was it that new Rygar game
3934960	3938040	that was supposed to be out there, why didn't they show that, because that was pretty cool.
3938040	3939680	Where the fuck is Animal Crossing Wii?
3939680	3943240	Oh actually, Rygar was Tecmo and I don't believe Tecmo was there, so that's probably why that
3943240	3944880	wasn't there.
3944880	3946200	Where the fuck is Animal Crossing on the Wii?
3946200	3948440	It's still being worked on.
3948440	3950920	Work faster!
3950920	3954680	Done by the guy apparently who did the Mii Channel.
3954680	3960400	How much you want to bet there's no Mii support in the game whatsoever, oh the irony.
3960400	3965000	Black Wolf would like to point out there were no console games for Squeenix, it was all
3965000	3967520	DS and PSP, so nothing on the console.
3967520	3970240	Where the hell is that Final Fantasy game on the Wii then?
3970240	3973800	Wasn't there a Crystal Chronicles game coming out at launch?
3973800	3974800	Hello?
3974800	3976360	What happened?
3976360	3978880	Where's the Dragon Quest slashy slash game?
3978880	3980160	Who cares about Crystal Chronicles?
3980160	3984400	I think Crystal Chronicles, I don't know, I've seen their fall lineup so far and it's
3984400	3987260	all DS and PSP games.
3987260	3990360	Very interesting, that's all.
3990360	3996480	Okay, well, that's about all we have to say on this year's E3 and all the stories.
3996480	4000040	We'll get into some last minute stories in just a little bit, but we are going to open
4000040	4003240	up the Skype line if you wish to give us a call.
4003240	4009240	The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4009240	4013720	We always encourage folks to interact with us, whether it be through Skype or phone or
4013720	4014720	whatever.
4014720	4015720	So let's go to the phones, they're already ringing.
4015720	4018520	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4018520	4022040	I'm coming with my Wii sapper right for you, Loki.
4022040	4023040	Well hello, Bobby Blackpool.
4023040	4027600	Well that's okay, you won't be able to hit me because it's going to suck.
4027600	4030320	It's just like Princess Leia shooting mode or something.
4030320	4034880	Yeah, you better hope that the Wii sensor bar can completely read where you're pointing
4034880	4035880	that damn thing.
4035880	4040480	Well, so you actually got to go to E3, you lucky bastard, how was it?
4040480	4047920	It was surprisingly very good except for the physical location of everything going on.
4047920	4052800	It was basically, it's like they moved the time waster to something else.
4052800	4057120	Last year and the year before, the time waster was waiting in line to play the games.
4057120	4060920	This year, the time waster was waiting in traffic to get to your next appointment or
4060920	4063680	get to the more games.
4063680	4067840	That's right, because last year we were in Santa Monica because of the whole all games
4067840	4073440	arena thing that was going on and driving to E3 was a bitch every day, seriously.
4073440	4081360	Yeah, and I mean the traffic around was really horrible, two miles from all the hotels and
4081360	4086960	the show floor and there were no press rooms at the Barker Hanger, so you couldn't get
4086960	4089120	on the internet, you couldn't report anything from there.
4089120	4093660	You had to go back to the Fairmont Hotel, which was probably the farthest hotel away
4093660	4097000	because that's where the press room was.
4097000	4101720	So if you were on a line like for the working press, like newspapers and other internet
4101720	4107140	sites had deadlines, they had to spend a lot of time going back and forth, back and forth
4107140	4108560	just so they could do their work.
4108560	4113160	So the ESA knows that the physical location was really the only downside.
4113160	4118280	I think if they consolidated it more and still only invited about 3,000 or 4,000 people,
4118280	4120240	it'd still be a great show.
4120240	4123320	Couldn't they just rent one small part of the LA Convention Center or find another?
4123320	4126900	I have a hard time believing LA Convention Center is the only place in the area.
4126900	4130120	Couldn't they find another convention center in an LA suburb to do it in?
4130120	4138320	I think Lawrence Young was telling me like Long Beach Convention Center maybe, but LA
4138320	4141840	Convention Center is too expensive for what they were trying to do.
4141840	4143320	It's all about saving the money.
4143320	4146080	Now Vegas would be great.
4146080	4151340	Yeah, Vegas is convention heaven, it'd be awesome.
4151340	4154680	We could go to E3 and then go see strippers, it would be incredible.
4154680	4158440	Exactly, but I don't know how many of the game journalists would get sloshed after that
4158440	4161160	and how well they'd work.
4161160	4165640	All I know is that you're going to have to bring us as your crew next year, Bobby.
4165640	4168720	That loophole will probably be very close next year.
4168720	4170200	We shall see what happens.
4170200	4173480	Maybe they can open it up a little more in Vegas, who knows.
4173480	4174620	Really quickly, what were your thoughts?
4174620	4176120	You got to walk the show floor.
4176120	4177260	What impressed the hell out of you?
4177260	4179600	What disappointed the hell out of you?
4179600	4182440	What impressed me was Burnout Paradise.
4182440	4187320	In fact, on my show, since it's not your five-year anniversary, I'm going to plug my show.
4187320	4188320	That's fine.
4188320	4189320	It's a podcast.
4189320	4191320	You might as well say it.
4191320	4193560	I interviewed the producer for Burnout Paradise.
4193560	4196920	They're really doing some really interesting things with the online multiplayer and they
4196920	4201960	have added enough to the game itself that it's going to be a great game for communities
4201960	4202960	to play.
4202960	4204520	It's going to be a great game to play online.
4204520	4206720	I'm really hyped for Burnout Paradise.
4206720	4208920	I was already hyped for Burnout before you said that.
4208920	4209920	Now I'm even more hyped.
4209920	4211440	That's great.
4211440	4214360	They're doing seamless online multiplayer.
4214360	4215360	There's no lobby.
4215360	4219240	It's an open world and people just drop in on the open world and the host says, hey,
4219240	4220240	you want to race?
4220240	4221240	Yeah.
4221240	4222240	Okay.
4222240	4223240	Boom.
4223240	4224240	He starts the race.
4224240	4225240	It's like Test Drive Unlimited.
4225240	4226240	It's crashing.
4226240	4227240	Right.
4227240	4228240	Rad.
4228240	4230220	Now, Rock Band.
4230220	4233920	Let's talk a little bit about Rock Band because I did get to play it.
4233920	4238920	I played it four times on the drums just to make sure that all my rants about the drum
4238920	4242920	peripheral were founded or unfounded or whatever.
4242920	4247760	I still don't like the placement of the pads.
4247760	4252720	Everything else is fine and it does feel like you're playing a drum set except for the
4252720	4255200	fact that your arms are in the wrong place.
4255200	4256200	Interesting.
4256200	4261840	Now, the thing is I was the only one there who had a problem with the drum set because
4261840	4266820	the harmonics people and the MTV people, which were extremely nice to me, they were very
4266820	4269200	receptive to me, they're like, oh, you're a drummer.
4269200	4271040	Yeah, you like that drum peripheral, huh?
4271040	4272040	Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it?
4272040	4273760	I go, not really.
4273760	4276520	They're like, what?
4276520	4277580	Good for you.
4277580	4279480	I talked to the marketing manager at EA.
4279480	4280920	I talked to a guy who works for MTV.
4280920	4284920	I talked to one of the harmonics developers and I said, you know, the pads are great.
4284920	4285920	The hardware is great.
4285920	4287160	The UI is fine.
4287160	4289080	The placement sucks of the pads.
4289080	4291960	I heard that they were adjustable though.
4291960	4294240	Well, it's not just that.
4294240	4299180	It's the fact that the note chart has the high hat on the second drum from the left
4299180	4303480	and usually you have to cross your arms for that.
4303480	4309400	My biggest issue was the far right drum, which they used as the symbol a lot of times.
4309400	4311440	All the drums could change at any time.
4311440	4316240	They weren't really married to one thing, but having to pull back on your arm instead
4316240	4321060	of go forward, which is the natural motion of your arm, that took a while to get used
4321060	4323920	to and so I would overshoot the pad all the time.
4323920	4328320	Also, they have the Xbox guide button right in the center and I hit it like three times
4328320	4331200	bringing up the guide while playing.
4331200	4332600	You pulled the Peter Moore.
4332600	4333600	I did.
4333600	4337880	I pulled the Peter Moore three times and the game didn't pause.
4337880	4342080	Notes were still going up and the guide had come up, but it's a pre-alpha thing.
4342080	4347720	That'll be fixed, but I played two games on medium with the drum set, two games on hard
4347720	4353360	and even electronic arts people were coming over to watch me play Tom Sawyer on hard because
4353360	4354640	I wasn't failing it.
4354640	4357560	You have good taste in song choices too.
4357560	4358560	Yes.
4358560	4359560	Nobody else wanted to do it.
4359560	4363300	They're like, I don't want to sing that high and so finally one of the harmonics chicks
4363300	4364560	was like, I'll sing Tom Sawyer.
4364560	4367000	Come on, let's go.
4367000	4368280	It was fun.
4368280	4374080	I will still get it because I'm a whore for that stuff, but I still don't like the placement
4374080	4377640	and I'm going to be very vocal about the placement of the pads.
4377640	4382280	Let me ask you real quick, I don't want to take up too much time, but since you were there,
4382280	4385080	I do want to pick your brain on some of these things.
4385080	4389840	How did it compare to last year's E3 and how did it seem to be received by the audience
4389840	4390880	as a whole?
4390880	4394340	Were people enjoying the fact that it was more of an exclusive event or did people miss
4394340	4398480	the glitz and glamour in the booth babes of yonder past?
4398480	4405080	Everybody I spoke to that attended E3 loved the new E3.
4405080	4410200	The people who didn't like E3, some of them had good reasons.
4410200	4415600	The more indie games scene, they didn't like it because they were shut out.
4415600	4420200	They kind of used the lack of the booth babes, the lack of the glitz as part of it, but really
4420200	4422440	it was about they couldn't be a part of it.
4422440	4424500	They were not invited to even exhibit.
4424500	4429560	The ESA wouldn't even let them there, but everybody that was there loved the fact that
4429560	4432340	you could have a conversation with people on the show floor.
4432340	4435160	You could walk up to anything and play it.
4435160	4438760	Square Enix might not have liked it because every time I walked by their set of kiosks,
4438760	4446280	nobody was playing the games, but other than that, everybody loved it except for the physical
4446280	4448240	distance between things.
4448240	4450600	I missed a few appointments because I couldn't get there in time.
4450600	4454300	I did not get to see Fallout 3 because I was 20 minutes late because of traffic.
4454300	4455800	Question from Rob D in chat.
4455800	4462340	Ask Bobby if he thinks that E3 can stay alive this way.
4462340	4466740	I think it did its job.
4466740	4468860	It did its job admirably.
4468860	4474340	Whether the ESA will actually continue doing it in this way, that I don't know.
4474340	4480020	I don't know if they made enough money doing it this way or not.
4480020	4481020	Very interesting.
4481020	4484920	Anyone else have a question for Bobby who got to go there and actually be at E3?
4484920	4490020	I guess it was kind of bad that I didn't accept my invite.
4490020	4493880	You could have had a cameraman and a sound guy.
4493880	4496640	Damn it.
4496640	4498920	He's making pouty face at Jamie right now.
4498920	4500840	I wish we were a TV show.
4500840	4504160	However, I did get to sleep a lot, so that was good.
4504160	4505160	Not really, I had to work.
4505160	4509960	Yeah, and the day when you all were at E3, I was on jury duty, so I had one of the websites
4509960	4513880	mobile version on refresh on my cell phone to follow the press conferences.
4513880	4515340	It was sad and pathetic.
4515340	4516640	That was my E3.
4516640	4518280	I did that at work.
4518280	4523000	I actually left my desk to the open computer and sat there and watched the streaming Nintendo
4523000	4528200	conference because no one really pays attention to what I do.
4528200	4533640	What would you say to the folks, because I've heard a lot of folks that didn't go to E3
4533640	4536840	say worst E3 ever.
4536840	4539160	Is that true?
4539160	4542640	They'd only say that because it didn't have the glitz, it didn't have the glamour, and
4542640	4546000	really to be honest, the press conferences, everybody surrendered.
4546000	4550040	Usually E3 is about who had the best press conference, and all of them said, we don't
4550040	4552660	want the best press conference this year.
4552660	4553880	They're not going for that.
4553880	4558600	That might be where a part of that came from, but no, in terms of seeing things, getting
4558600	4564560	things done, getting contacts, networking, all that stuff, this E3 was the best out of
4564560	4566280	the 11 that I went to.
4566280	4570000	I even said that on the Xbox Life Marketplace video that I'm apparently all over.
4570000	4574200	I was going to say a perfect example of that would have been the Konami press conference
4574200	4581200	where it's like, yeah, two DDRs, Silent Hill 5, go get your press kit.
4581200	4586000	What's up with that, Bobby?
4586000	4591760	Now since there are less people at E3, you have a bigger chance of being a media whore,
4591760	4595800	and Bobby, you really got some media whoring done this year.
4595800	4600240	I understand you're on a banner ad for game trailers.
4600240	4602920	What video on Xbox Life Marketplace are you on?
4602920	4608940	The On10.net E3 show floor wrap-up video, because I was with the TV channel that should
4608940	4612200	be renamed Nameless, and I was with all games even before then.
4612200	4616240	I've known Laura Foy for many, many years, so when she saw me in the empty square on
4616240	4621000	Wednesday, she came over and asked me a few questions, and apparently we have more air
4621000	4624440	time than a frag doll on this thing.
4624440	4625440	But I was on that.
4625440	4630520	MTV Latin America made me sign a waiver because they filmed me playing Tom Sawyer on the drums.
4630520	4635460	And then Hudson, their video crew, the same ones that made the Bomberman video that's
4635460	4639720	on YouTube that says, Act Zero sucked ass and we know it.
4639720	4642940	They came around and did something, and it was really stupid.
4642940	4646800	If they used my thing, the question was, it was this chick, and she goes, okay, here's
4646800	4650060	the question, games or girls?
4650060	4655040	And I look at her, because it's the most absurd question I've ever heard in my life, coming
4655040	4658680	out of something like that, but it's going to come across as, he's actually thinking
4658680	4662720	games or girls, oh my God.
4662720	4666160	You got to love creative editing.
4666160	4671280	Rob D says a great summary here, for not getting invited to E3, Bobby did a good job of being
4671280	4672280	at E3.
4672280	4674400	Yeah, that loophole ruled.
4674400	4677640	Excellent job of being an E3 stowaway, that's up to you.
4677640	4681720	I would have answered back to her, if you're talking about Act Zero, I'll take girls for
4681720	4683720	sure.
4683720	4692240	No, I think my response was, games have pause buttons.
4692240	4694960	Our soccer, I can't rebuttal.
4694960	4698560	Yeah, I have something that involves a butt and my foot kicking in.
4698560	4701280	Or even better, you just go, what, you're offering?
4701280	4702280	Heart, Bobby.
4702280	4706160	All right, well, Bobby, thanks so much for the call and for the perspective from someone
4706160	4710580	who was actually there, and congrats on, I'm sure, what was going to end up being a lot
4710580	4713840	of exposure for you and your show and all that good stuff, so congratulations.
4713840	4715520	Yeah, thank you.
4715520	4718360	All right, until next time, my friend.
4718360	4719360	Yep.
4719360	4720360	All right, later.
4720360	4721360	See you.
4721360	4722360	Bye.
4722360	4723360	All right.
4723360	4724360	Very good call.
4724360	4725360	We always like hearing from Bobby.
4725360	4726360	More calls, please.
4726360	4728040	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4728040	4729040	Who's this?
4729040	4730920	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
4730920	4734000	This is a guy who's disappeared for far too long.
4734000	4737080	Ah, is this VX JasonXV?
4737080	4738080	That would be me.
4738080	4740000	Howdy, how are you?
4740000	4745600	I'm busy and chilling in Colorado in more ways than one.
4745600	4750560	But our website is still up, despite all of that, so you are the best webmaster in the
4750560	4753920	world, and I hope you heard our shout-out in the five-year anniversary special.
4753920	4758920	I listened to the whole thing while I was working way too many damn hours at work.
4758920	4759920	Well done.
4759920	4760920	So, what's up?
4760920	4763520	What do we owe this call to tonight?
4763520	4768200	Belated happy birthday to Orange Lounge Radio, belated happy birthday to you, Rob, and belated
4768200	4771940	happy birthday to myself, because I am a whore for that kind of stuff.
4771940	4772940	Thank you.
4772940	4773940	Where's my present?
4773940	4774940	I don't know.
4774940	4775940	Where's mine?
4775940	4776940	All right, fair enough.
4776940	4781400	So, for real reason, Ace Combat 6.
4781400	4782400	Holy cow.
4782400	4784440	Ah, here's the game we didn't talk about yet.
4784440	4786560	Yeah, no kidding.
4786560	4793960	The last Monday, I do believe it is, I got a new monitor for my birthday, and I have
4793960	4797720	a nice little consolidation thing going on, because it's my computer monitor for two different
4797720	4803560	computers as well as my Xbox 360 screen, and it does high-definition.
4803560	4808520	So I'm finally running my 360 in 720p, and a lot of things are looking a hell of a lot
4808520	4812960	better than standard component.
4812960	4818400	And I finally managed to get a hold of the demo from the E3 category, and I played it,
4818400	4823000	and holy cow, that game looks beautiful.
4823000	4827960	I don't know if it's satellite imagery, high-resolution satellite imagery, or low-level aircraft imagery
4827960	4832320	of the landscapes, but oh, man, they're doing a beautiful job with that.
4832320	4837760	That game was so fun just to look at, and it played so well still.
4837760	4843200	I've loved that series ever since Air Combat on the PlayStation.
4843200	4845960	Why you're making me want to go check it out myself, even though I'm not usually into the
4845960	4847240	flying games, so...
4847240	4850520	I don't like simulations like Flight Simulator.
4850520	4856280	I love arcade-style games, and Air Combat and Ace Combat have always been that, and
4856280	4858880	they are doing a good job continuing the series.
4858880	4861200	Like old-school After Burner, right?
4861200	4862200	Yeah.
4862200	4868120	It's not as free, it's kind of teetering towards the more realistic flying, but still arcade
4868120	4869120	dogfighting.
4869120	4870120	It's fun.
4870120	4874000	I don't have anything else to say, I am buying that game the day it comes out.
4874000	4876960	Well thank you for bringing up a game we neglected to bring up earlier in the show.
4876960	4878200	Yeah, shame on you guys.
4878200	4879200	Oh, sorry.
4879200	4881880	You know, there's just so damn much that comes out of E3, that's why we rely on you guys
4881880	4882880	to help us out.
4882880	4883880	Yeah.
4883880	4889920	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4889920	4892080	Anything else out of E3 got you excited?
4892080	4897360	I watched a couple of the trailers, Skate looks pretty boring, but I think that goes
4897360	4901680	back to the whole simulation vs. arcade thing.
4901680	4902680	The project...
4902680	4903680	Prove yourself!
4903680	4904680	Crap.
4904680	4905680	Tony Hawk game.
4905680	4908600	Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.
4908600	4909600	Proving Ground, thank you!
4909600	4912300	I'm mixing all those words up.
4912300	4916640	Proving Ground seems to be going right down the same path, again, expanding on a few more
4916640	4922160	elements, and it looks like it's a very true-to-form continuation of the series.
4922160	4923160	What else did I look at?
4923160	4928920	Beautiful Katamari told me absolutely nothing new, but I don't know yet whether I'm going
4928920	4931640	to like it if it's the same thing all over again or not.
4931640	4936840	The music was kind of, I don't know how to describe it, but the music is kind of making
4936840	4943680	me teeter on the side that I might not be caring for that game too much.
4943680	4948160	Bomberman Live, oh man, I haven't played a Bomberman game in forever.
4948160	4954040	The trailers and all of the media that Microsoft posted was really fun to look at, and hopefully
4954040	4957200	the rest of the year and into the first half of the next year when all this stuff is going
4957200	4962400	to really all be coming out is going to not be too much of a drain on my banking account,
4962400	4963400	but you know.
4963400	4967380	Jason, I know you've been a music game fan for a long time, obviously, because you've
4967380	4971880	been with OLR for a long time, and Act Deaf brings up a very interesting question in chat.
4971880	4977120	I wonder if Jason will talk about Rock Band, what do you think about Rock Band?
4977120	4981360	We went over this over a little bit in the forums, so all you people who aren't a part,
4981360	4982360	go read.
4982360	4986240	It's always great to do that in between shows.
4986240	4992860	The aesthetics of cramming everything in for multiple person play seems to be really, really
4992860	4993960	off.
4993960	4998600	The lyrics are probably going to be the most underused portion of that game, and for good
4998600	5004320	reason, less people sing than sit there and play a guitar or a drum or anything else.
5004320	5008440	I don't really know too much about the drum, four versus five is kind of funny, you know,
5008440	5012960	Guitar Hero goes to five while Guitar Freaks is three, the drum peripheral is going to
5012960	5016840	be four while Drummania was five.
5016840	5022180	I didn't like, I've never liked console Drummania, I'll play it because I like Drummania in general,
5022180	5027560	but I've played the arcade version of MGL, console version wasn't very faithful, I don't
5027560	5030680	like cramming my arms that close together.
5030680	5033880	What Bobby was saying was just kind of driving that point home again.
5033880	5041940	Bass, I don't know, I don't think I've got enough hands on with it on Guitar Hero 2,
5041940	5044680	but the vocals are going to be the lowest point.
5044680	5048200	Other than that, I'm still recognizing a couple of the songs, which makes me happy enough
5048200	5052720	that I'll actually have something to play, and it looks like it's going to be fun.
5052720	5056320	For a game that's changing companies, it looks like it's still going down a very good path
5056320	5059400	for the general make-up and play of the game.
5059400	5061280	And fun is really what it's all about, right?
5061280	5062280	Hell yeah.
5062280	5063680	Good music, good game.
5063680	5064680	All right.
5064680	5067160	Well, Jason, we've got to let you go to get probably about one more call in here, but
5067160	5069040	thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?
5069040	5070040	Yep.
5070040	5071040	All right, take care, buddy.
5071040	5072040	See you guys.
5072040	5073040	Bye.
5073040	5075880	All right, we always appreciate Jason when he gives us a call.
5075880	5078440	We'll do about one more call, I know we've got a lot of people trying to get through
5078440	5082520	tonight, but we also want to wrap up pretty soon here, so let's do at least one more call.
5082520	5085600	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5085600	5086600	It's GS68.
5086600	5087600	Hi, GS68.
5087600	5088600	What's on your mind?
5088600	5095520	Basically, I read about Ghost Squad coming out for the Wii, and it just reminded me about
5095520	5097720	the arcade version.
5097720	5099960	I'm sorry, you heard about what coming out for the Wii?
5099960	5101960	Ghost Squad for the Wii.
5101960	5103520	Oh, okay.
5103520	5108600	And one thing that's always bugging me about the arcade version is that I went to the Philippines,
5108600	5114960	and most of the Ghost Squad machines there have card slots, but here in California, none
5114960	5120400	of the machines have card slots, so I can only go up to level four on the machines,
5120400	5131440	and I don't get a whole lot of stuff as much as on the card slots and machines.
5131440	5136000	I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit there, so I'm sorry, what was the question out of
5136000	5137000	that?
5137000	5148120	One thing that's bugging me about the arcade game is that in the U.S., none of the machines
5148120	5155000	in the U.S. have card slots, but if I go to any other country with that game, the machines
5155000	5156000	usually have card slots.
5156000	5165120	I went to the Philippines earlier this year, and most of their machines there had card
5165120	5173840	slots, and I get to have more levels and features and stuff, and I'm just wondering, for games
5173840	5183400	like that, and why don't, oh, sorry.
5183400	5189100	I think if you're talking about as far as the arcade scene goes, and why is it that
5189100	5195120	they have the cards in some places and not in others, I think it just has to do with
5195120	5196320	the arcade scene in general here.
5196320	5199840	I don't think there's enough of a scene to support that type of technology here, and
5199840	5203680	obviously Konami and DDR is one thing that comes to my mind like that, and everything
5203680	5206040	they're doing with EMUs overseas and things.
5206040	5210920	I think it's just that Japanese has more of an arcade culture that supports that, whereas
5210920	5214700	here, it's all about the tickets, and taking in the tickets and redeeming them for cash
5214700	5215700	and prizes.
5215700	5216700	You know what I mean?
5216700	5223160	Yeah, I look at Asian arcades, and they have a lot of cool stuff, like...
5223160	5224880	Like Pachinko, which they don't have here.
5224880	5225880	Yeah, and...
5225880	5228520	There are Pachinko places in the US, by the way.
5228520	5231400	But it's not the Nor- it's a novelty thing here.
5231400	5232400	I agree.
5232400	5233400	Yeah.
5233400	5237680	All right, well, hey, anything you want to share about your thoughts with E3?
5237680	5239560	Was there anything that really got you excited about E3?
5239560	5244280	I didn't really catch- I wasn't really caught up with E3, I didn't read much about it.
5244280	5248560	Well, hopefully you learned stuff here tonight by listening to the show.
5248560	5249920	I hope we can educate some folks.
5249920	5252400	All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call, GS68.
5252400	5254040	We really appreciate it, okay?
5254040	5255040	You're welcome.
5255040	5257040	All right, take care, buddy.
5257040	5258040	You too.
5258040	5259040	All right.
5259040	5262360	I think that's going to about do it, because we're running almost an hour 40 for this segment,
5262360	5265440	so we really need to switch back over and wrap things up.
5265440	5268720	So I'm sorry to those calls we didn't get to tonight, but we'll also take more calls
5268720	5269840	next week, I'm sure.
5269840	5271160	We always do.
5271160	5275060	So we're going to go around now and ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.
5275060	5276960	Any last minute stories?
5276960	5279000	I have a couple, actually.
5279000	5280000	Go for it.
5280000	5282080	This is more European news.
5282080	5286880	Coming to Xbox Live Arcade, there was Bomberman and Yaya Kung Fu on the 18th.
5286880	5290000	It'll be out in July.
5290000	5298600	Also the fifth Harry Potter game demo is on Xbox Live Arcade in the UK.
5298600	5300080	Just for the record, it is out here as well.
5300080	5310240	All right, but it's actually supposed to take up 2.55% of the 20 gig hard drive, yay.
5310240	5314360	And the Lost Planet PC is getting Mega Man.
5314360	5315360	That's kind of neat.
5315360	5318600	A Mega Man patch for Lost Planet PC.
5318600	5324400	Does it let you play as Mega Man?
5324400	5326320	It actually doesn't say.
5326320	5328800	It just says some type of Mega Man patch.
5328800	5331240	I imagine it's probably a suit or something silly.
5331240	5334240	That's what they need in Dead Rising.
5334240	5335240	It's a character.
5335240	5336240	It's a playable character.
5336240	5340040	You can play as Joe from Lost Planet, Mega Man, or Frank West from Dead Rising.
5340040	5341760	Oh, Frank West is awesome.
5341760	5344520	Yeah, you can get the costume and the gun.
5344520	5345520	Really?
5345520	5346520	And you can get the hat.
5346520	5347520	You can get the whole thing in Dead Rising.
5347520	5349520	Oh, rad.
5349520	5354200	Anyway, if that's it, then Loki, anything you want to share?
5354200	5355480	Yeah, there's some interesting stuff.
5355480	5361520	IGN just did their Week in Review podcast, I guess, and one of the things that they mentioned
5361520	5365560	is Rock Band coming to the Wii in 2008.
5365560	5367440	So that's interesting.
5367440	5374320	Another interesting thing, Cotton, I guess, trailer for Smash Bros. Brawl is, I guess,
5374320	5381920	Bulbin from the Zelda series is going to be either a trophy assist or assist trophy character
5381920	5383640	or a playable character.
5383640	5384640	So that's kind of neat.
5384640	5385640	Who's this?
5385640	5386640	I'm sorry?
5386640	5387640	Bulbin.
5387640	5393120	It's like one of those, I don't know if they're elves or what, some sort of enemy
5393120	5395120	from the game.
5395120	5401440	Anywho, other interesting things, the simple series, one of my favorite things to talk
5401440	5407560	about, D3's lineup there, they're releasing their first two volumes on the Wii.
5407560	5413600	The first one, Volume 1, looks like a kart racing game, I guess, and the other one looks
5413600	5418480	like a frog jumping game, so that's kind of interesting.
5418480	5421680	Hopefully those make their way out over here at some point.
5421680	5427240	Of course, one thing we can't forget, I know my wife might be looking forward to this,
5427240	5433440	Nitro Bike was announced for the Wii by Ubisoft and it's being developed by Left Field Productions,
5433440	5439720	the creators of the classic Excitebike 64, and it's kind of like a, I guess, Excite
5439720	5445240	Truck but with bikes, so, Excitebike.
5445240	5453320	Some other interesting things, one game we've talked about here before, Tomiki Fighters,
5453320	5459240	which now is being called Blastworks, which is coming to the Wii later on this year, it's
5459240	5462080	going to have other games in that as well.
5462080	5469040	Blastworks will not only feature Tomiki Fighters, as well as some other games created by Kent
5469040	5475720	at show, including Our Rootage, which has been confirmed, and looks like Gunroar and
5475720	5479280	Taurus Trooper are also being looked into, and those are other shooter games that he's
5479280	5482240	developed for free.
5482240	5483240	Looks pretty cool.
5483240	5488240	I think it's only going to be about 30 bucks when it comes out, too.
5488240	5492240	And I believe, yeah, that's it.
5492240	5494680	All right, lots of news this week.
5494680	5498060	It will be hard to top it next week, but of course we'll be back with another episode
5498060	5503280	of Orange Lounge Radio next week, and maybe catching a lot more of your opinions and fallout
5503280	5507320	from E3, and I'm sure as we start to kick into the fall months, it's just going to be
5507320	5512520	oodles and oodles of news as we get into, because now E3 was in July and not May, so
5512520	5515600	there's a little less time before the fall rush, so we'll be looking forward to sharing
5515600	5516600	that all with you.
5516600	5520320	And speaking of the fall, we hit our 250th episode this fall, if you can believe that,
5520320	5523160	so lots of fun stuff in store.
5523160	5526600	But we're not going to do anything special for it, because we did the 200th show last
5526600	5528560	year and the fifth year for the anniversary of this show.
5528560	5532100	We don't want to celebrate ourselves too much, but it certainly is a milestone that's interesting.
5532100	5534640	Every day is a celebration.
5534640	5539560	Every day is a new celebration of life.
5539560	5542800	So I noticed Loki's watching the Silent Hill arcade videos on YouTube.
5542800	5543800	It looks nice.
5543800	5544800	Doesn't it look hot?
5544800	5547800	Did you see the pyramid head thing?
5547800	5549680	Watch the beginning of part B. It's awesome.
5549680	5553040	Yeah, I'm watching the beginning of part two right now.
5553040	5554040	It's in there then.
5554040	5555040	You'll see it.
5555040	5561560	Pyramid head goes slice, you're going to die, and then he goes slice, and then right when
5561560	5566880	it's about to hit the guy's head, it switches back to the day, or whatever you want to call
5566880	5567880	it.
5567880	5569520	I thought you said you weren't spoiling it for our listeners.
5569520	5571520	Sorry, I did.
5571520	5572520	Rob you meanie bud.
5572520	5573520	You need to watch it.
5573520	5574520	I didn't spoil anything.
5574520	5575520	It's just awesome.
5575520	5576520	It's about IGN.
5576520	5577520	I'll watch it.
5577520	5578520	It would be cool, though, if they brought it to the Wii.
5578520	5582760	I mean, it looks like these gun games are going to be taken off, or at least...
5582760	5585320	You know, Dan and I had an idea a while back.
5585320	5586840	Point blank, Wii.
5586840	5590760	Hey, you remember the Biohazard Gun Survivor, right?
5590760	5594960	And we got it over here as Resident Evil Gun Survivor, and they took out the gun support.
5594960	5596640	You had to play it with the controller.
5596640	5602640	We were thinking back in the day how with the Dreamcast, you remember the Dreamcast
5602640	5605360	gun had a controller on it, right?
5605360	5606360	Mm-hmm.
5606360	5613640	Couldn't they do something like that with the Wii, use the controller on it to do your
5613640	5616200	motion, move back and forth, and then shoot with the gun?
5616200	5620680	They could easily do those games.
5620680	5622400	I mean, it's kind of what the way they used the range.
5622400	5627120	In Resident Evil 2 Arcade, you used your actual gun as your direction.
5627120	5629120	That was kind of cool, too.
5629120	5631280	And then you got to shoot people dead.
5631280	5634900	Here's one other game that came out of E3 I didn't hear any other news on, but there's
5634900	5637600	a new Trauma Center game that's going to come out for the Wii, and this one actually supports
5637600	5639880	widescreen and looks pretty and has new characters.
5639880	5643000	I'm very excited about a new Trauma Center game for the Wii, because Trauma Center is
5643000	5644000	awesome.
5644000	5645880	All right, what are you laughing about?
5645880	5652200	They should have a game for Silent Hill.
5652200	5654280	Konami, hear me on this.
5654280	5656320	I think you've got a hit with this.
5656320	5661760	You know how these sim games and stuff, like pets and dogs and cats and stuff, are all
5661760	5666560	really popular, they should have a Pyramid Head game, where you take care of Pyramid
5666560	5673280	Head, or you are Pyramid Head, and you feed him corpses, and he can feed him, let him
5673280	5676880	rape stuff, and you can slice people with a blade.
5676880	5680240	Sometimes I think we take our Pyramid Head love a little bit too far on this program.
5680240	5681720	I don't know if it's just me.
5681720	5684160	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5684160	5688000	Loki, go ahead and start us off tonight.
5688000	5693320	My final thought is, there's going to be more announcements coming out.
5693320	5695560	Not everything gets announced at E3.
5695560	5701120	God's sake, most people nowadays have their own gamer days and shit.
5701120	5704800	My final thought is, I twisted my ankle earlier, and it kind of hurts.
5704800	5705800	Owie.
5705800	5706800	Ice it.
5706800	5707800	I know I need to.
5707800	5711080	Dr. Sakura.
5711080	5715080	Reject false conventions.
5715080	5716600	On that note, we'll see you next time.
