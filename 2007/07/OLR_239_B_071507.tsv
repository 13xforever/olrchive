487	19080	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20987	26088	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here live on this Sunday evening, July the 15th of 2007.
26488	28849	We're going through the E3 wrap-up, of course.
29329	36270	Now, I know you guys have probably been reading about it on the various blogs, but maybe there's some things that we caught that maybe slipped off your radars, off the cracks.
36750	42431	And, of course, we didn't get to go to E3 this year, so we're just kind of like a lot of you guys on the outside looking in.
42671	44012	And so we're kind of collecting our thoughts.
44052	45912	What do the people who weren't there think about it?
45932	49333	What do the gaming fans who didn't get to go to E3 this year really think about it?
49353	50113	Because, hey, it's our money.
50153	50693	We're spending it.
51033	52214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
79140	90790	It's supposed to be 33% lighter, 19% slimmer, has a longer battery life, and is also going to be having a video out on it as well, which is kind of cool.
91530	98556	We'll be retailing for $169.99, so the same price as the normal PSP now, and we'll eventually replace those as well.
99497	102199	And we'll be loaded with the 3.6 firmware, so...
104881	105942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
133476	134657	Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron
158581	164146	Video Out does sound pretty cool, and I know a lot of people kind of wrote it off, like, whoop-dee-doo, Video Out, you know, who cares?
164506	175015	But, you know, it does make those UMDs at least a little more usable, that you can have them on your TV, but also, just getting to play, you know, some of these games, like the Final Fantasy remake and stuff, like, on my big TV!
175135	183822	And if you think about it, if you're looking at, you know, possibly just using this as, like, even, you know, portable and standalone video player at home,
184670	185110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
214286	221810	Yeah, I'm kind of excited about the Video Out, but the problem is I already own a PSP, so I don't really want to buy a whole new one just for Video Out.
222251	226633	I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't on the first, but I guess this is how they get you to buy another one.
226653	227914	Here's the thing, though.
227934	231836	Video Out uses the serial port that's on the bottom of the PSP.
232537	234138	Supposedly, this one's redesigned.
234618	238040	I'm not sure if that's actually the case, but they're saying it's redesigned.
239454	245197	So it's possible with this new firmware update 3.6 that maybe with the current ones you can do that.
245297	247358	Please let that be the case.
247699	256404	It wouldn't be too surprising if they don't mention that until later on, much like certain other stories we'll get into later where they don't mention certain aspects of things.
256844	257725	Alright, fair enough.
258345	261507	So do you think you'll pick up a PSP redesign?
262336	288489	I think I will just because I have two of them right now and I want to sell one of them or at least get rid of it because I have no use for it right now and that would be a good excuse to buy one of those because it wouldn't really cost me much the other thing though about it though this is kind of a trend you'll see at the Sony press conference something that they've been denying and denying yet people are saying it's going to be happening we've heard rumors and lo and behold it's true kind of a trend that's going along with it
289366	292007	We shall see as we continue throughout the press conference stories here.
293168	300631	Well, there is something that I... I have to say that I actually expected this.
301392	318360	You know, with all of the rumors going around about exclusive game this and exclusive game that, I honestly, this is what I expected, is that Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be exclusive to the PS3.
319998	320618	Reaffirmed.
321259	321799	Not buying it.
322860	324340	Not buying it, and this is why.
325481	328763	Okay, it may be a PSA exclusive when it comes out.
329743	340289	I do not doubt that it's going to come to the 360 eventually, because it would be dumb for them to ignore the entire Xbox 360 user base.
341029	345031	And it's not because they're playing sides or anything, it's just about money.
345658	348500	and they want to sell as many copies of this as possible.
349140	352482	I wouldn't be surprised if we see a release on the Xbox 360 maybe later on.
352682	353483	I will be surprised.
354804	354904	Oh.
356444	357165	I don't think it's going to happen.
357225	358826	I think it's going to stay on PS3.
360147	362008	I think it really all depends on sales.
362028	371253	Like, I'm not, I can totally see how it could happen where like, kind of like how the first Metal Gear, no, one of the Metal Gears ended up coming out for GameCube later on.
371493	373875	You know, like, I think it was the first Metal Gear was redone.
373915	374035	Yeah.
374981	402692	and you know I could see something like that happening and this seems to happen a lot with the Metal Gear series where it shows up on the Sony platform first and then kind of mutates into a special edition thing that comes out on Xbox or whatever later on but like a year later I could see something like that happening if the sales aren't strong enough on its own so it's really going to depend but I mean that a year is such a long wait that you know it's it's not going to have a huge impact as far as the fanboys are concerned I don't know
404139	411623	I think what you can count on, you can count on them not announcing another platform until well after the game is out.
412043	414864	I think that is something that will be a given.
415024	424288	Unless, for whatever reason, that Sony has a really shitty fourth quarter, and they don't sell that many units or whatever, and...
425697	434925	And I'm thinking, Konami kind of does this.
435285	438127	Konami's not only done this with the Metal Gear series, but Silent Hill as well.
438408	442271	Remember Silent Hill 2 was out on the PlayStation 2 first, then the WrestleStreams came out on Xbox, you know.
442871	443872	Little things like that happen.
444553	445273	Hitstunt says,
449717	455663	until the PlayStation 3 version comes out, just like the standard six-month delay like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Virtua Fighter 5.
456523	456864	Hmm.
457504	458085	But you know what?
458265	464310	It's good for them that they do have this, because at least this is something, hey, maybe this will sell a few systems for them.
465311	466452	They need all they can take.
468014	469835	All right, well, we'll see where that leads.
470196	474920	But nevertheless, the Xbox 360 folks who were convinced it was coming to their platform...
475761	476882	Get a little bit of a setback.
476922	481086	I mean, I suppose hope is never lost, but hope has been diminished quite a bit.
481386	485930	Well, speaking of exclusives, another exclusive that was announced for the PlayStation 3 is Unreal Tournament 3.
486610	492195	Now, it was only affirmed as a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 3, but that does mean if you're a Sony fan and you got your PlayStation,
492515	494377	You're going to get it first on the PlayStation 3.
494997	498060	Now, as far as the time thing, I could care less.
498261	505407	I think this is the much cooler part about it, is that you're going to be able to use mods on the PlayStation 3 and the PC version.
505768	516117	Now, the PC version will come out a little later, but that's kind of cool for the modding community, of which a game like Unreal gets a lot of this stuff, is that the mods you make for PC you're going to be able to use on PS3 as well.
516198	516658	That's cool.
516738	522221	And they're saying everything from weapon mods to total conversions for it are going to be available.
522281	527024	So that's tons of extra content for it, which is awesome.
527864	530886	Now we need Duke Nukem 3D with mods and stuff.
530946	532026	That'd be cool too.
532667	533047	We shall see.
533607	540311	What's pretty interesting about the whole Unreal Tournament 3 thing is as of May, it was actually going to be exclusive to the 360.
540991	542672	So kind of flip-flopped there.
543846	545067	Amazing what money can do.
546447	557813	Something very interesting, probably a little bit surprising, would be that NCSoft has actually pledged support for the PlayStation 3 platform and are going to be releasing exclusive PlayStation 3 online games.
558774	572701	So, not sure if they're actually going to be bringing their current titles over, like Lineage, Guild Wars, City of Heroes, and stuff like that, but they will be making at least some of their current IPs and new IPs available for the platform.
573629	579511	I'm still waiting on those online games that they were talking about at E3 the year before.
579551	581772	Do you think that maybe some of those are being now ported to PlayStation 3?
600498	604399	I don't see why they weren't all that big graphic monsters.
605260	606700	Maybe if they did all of them at once.
606740	611542	But I think their whole intention was having a big service available to people just to come in and play.
612462	616023	So that's what I want to see.
616283	618744	Do you think we might see Guild Wars 2 on the PlayStation 3?
619144	619804	I hope not.
619924	620264	Shit.
620744	622365	I hate MMOs on consoles.
623245	650309	MMOs should stick to freaking PCs unless they are specifically made for a console I disagree on Guild Wars because I believe since the whole format of Guild Wars is you buy the game and you go online for free that really works for a console because then you don't have to pay those monthly fees and stuff and then maybe a little bit more casual and later on when they offer their expansions or whatever you can download those as a microtransaction or whatever
650976	653057	That would actually work very well for consoles.
653878	659881	Whereas an MMO like Final Fantasy XI or something, not as good as normal.
661742	662382	Interesting points.
662462	663683	We shall see what ends up happening.
664103	677190	Well, as far as other stuff, for people who wanted the 60GB PS3, get it while you can because we're not going to be getting any more.
677730	680011	So yeah, let's cut the price and then get rid of them.
681152	682452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
711204	714646	Despite what they say, it was unavailable to buy after about December.
715286	728252	And it's just, you know, they give you the impression that, you know, oh, well, you really want that 20 gig one, but, you know, you can't find it and you really, really want the system, so you're going to spend the extra $100 on it because you get this free game now and all that stuff.
728332	731333	But, I don't know, I'm not surprised.
731513	734715	Well, you know what sucks for our friends in Europe is that they're not getting a price cut.
735655	738997	Instead, what they're getting is a bundle with...
739949	747937	Some first party titles and another six axis controller for 115 pounds.
749258	751881	Which in my mind just reaffirms why Sony's doing this.
751961	755364	It's not so much about, you know, oh, we're going to give the U.S.
755405	755905	a price cut.
755945	758888	It's about, oh, we need to stop losing so much money on the systems.
759248	760410	So we're going to give the U.S.
760450	762692	the system we've been putting out in Europe that costs us less to make.
763100	774208	Well, they'll be getting a choice to pick from Resistance, Fall of Man, Motorstorm, Genji, Days of the Blade, Formula 1, Championship Edition, Ridge Racer 7, two of those plus the two 6-axis controllers.
774548	775509	And they'll be available.
776649	784715	It's actually due on sale on the 18th of July for the UK and starting in Europe on the 1st of August.
786437	797379	Well, if you want to get a PlayStation 3 and emulation is of a concern to you, maybe you don't have a PlayStation 2 or a PlayStation 1, this would probably be the time to get it.
797459	803340	I mean, honestly, if there's one positive thing you could say about this is that it does give you the chance to snatch up that system while you still can.
803700	805161	Be sure to read the labels carefully.
805201	806821	The new systems will show you.
807461	813002	It has a little warning about the emulation on the new box that says not all games are actually playable.
813582	814983	Now, it wouldn't be fair to...
817395	821456	mention this and then not mention, well, you know, the Xbox 360 uses software emulation as well.
821496	825777	So to rag Sony for cutting back on the emulation may be a little bit unfair.
826177	826477	I don't know.
826497	827517	But however, I don't know.
827697	831858	You do still feel like this sense of loss with this whole little switch going on.
832218	837979	And the fact that they're, you know, maybe I don't want to dig out my PlayStation 2 when I'm going to go through all this to hook up my PlayStation 3.
838440	838740	I don't know.
839720	839940	All right.
839960	840400	Well, anyhow.
841113	842054	Thank you for watching!
857805	861949	and what's very interesting about Echo Chrome is that the graphics are very simplistic.
861989	875924	They're black and white MC Escher style drawings and what's kind of cool, I watched a video of this game in motion, is that the way you rotate the screen around will affect the way the painting looks, thusly affecting the little runner that runs around the painting.
875944	876885	Now there's little holes
877225	883207	and little launch pads and little gaps that as you rotate the screen become filled because of your perspective.
883547	886008	It's a very interesting type of thing for a puzzle game.
886368	893310	It's certainly not going to push the envelope as far as next-gen graphics are concerned, but the graphics are crisp according to folks that have seen it.
893697	895238	Thanks for watching!
918194	918895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
943442	948766	Plus, it's supposed to make web browsing a little bit easier and be able to load some of the larger pages out there and stuff.
950747	953349	Other things they were showing off, Gran Turismo 5.
954189	958452	It's going to be coming out, of course, next year at some point.
958752	963295	And they're going to be releasing a Gran Turismo 5 prologue to the PlayStation Network.
963636	966318	That's going to be kind of just like Gran Turismo HD.
967018	969860	A little bit of a demo taste of it, as you will.
970946	974409	Also, they were showing home and some of the improvements done to that.
974429	976891	They've redesigned the whole kind of lobby system for it.
976931	978632	It looks almost like an outdoor mall.
979653	983716	And also, you'll be able to jump into multiplayer games with people as well.
986118	986718	Let's see.
987979	992082	That's pretty much, I think, the big stuff they were kind of showing off on their network.
992927	1002696	My only gripe with them, remember last week how we were talking about, oh yeah, they're going to be bringing demos and videos to the PlayStation Network.
1002796	1004978	It's going to be just like the Xbox Live thing.
1004998	1006539	They're going to be bringing it home and stuff.
1007861	1008401	No, they didn't.
1008801	1009782	They brought videos.
1010543	1013406	Great, because I can watch those all over the internet and stuff.
1013826	1015568	Not a single demo.
1016749	1019311	Bobby Blackwolf has asked why you're not mentioning Chewbacca.
1021042	1026747	Okay, Chewbacca announced the PSP redesign thing with Darth Vader.
1027587	1028148	Great.
1028608	1030530	At least that guy's still getting work.
1033993	1037115	Same thing we've done before for all of the other three conferences.
1037555	1039497	Chatroom, I ask for your opinion as well.
1039837	1041979	What did you think of the Sony press conference?
1042179	1043040	Rate it on a scale.
1043120	1043841	Tell me what you thought.
1044461	1045162	Who wants to go first?
1045182	1048985	You all right, DarkSakura, with that resounding yawn?
1049045	1049865	Is that your summary?
1050086	1050346	Yeah.
1052598	1053559	Short and sweet, Loki.
1053819	1060663	I think their whole theme of promises, promises, and not following through has kind of shown through again this year.
1061823	1068207	The price cut, they made it look like a price cut, but it's actually not a price cut, which is fucked up.
1068767	1073930	Not to mention some other stuff we'll get into a little bit later on that's also fucked up, especially if you buy a system now.
1075655	1080778	and just this whole oh look at all these games that are coming out and not mentioning oh by the way they're not coming out until next year.
1081399	1083960	I do have to give them props on Killzone 2 though.
1084180	1085301	That looks fucking amazing.
1085501	1087062	And that is about the only thing.
1087102	1089203	Thank you for satisfying a chat comment before I read it.
1089223	1091945	TigerClaw was just complaining we forgot to mention the new Killzone 2 trailer.
1091965	1093086	I didn't forget to mention it.
1093626	1094627	I didn't mention it on purpose.
1095107	1101971	It looks really good and it's actually it's a game I want to buy now because it looks kind of like Resistance a bit.
1102091	1104433	You know Resistance with a little bit of Gears of War thrown in there.
1105073	1105153	And
1105763	1106684	I think that's pretty awesome.
1106764	1108785	It impressed me a lot more than Halo 3 did.
1109045	1111207	So, you know, props to them for that.
1111367	1113388	But the problem is, it's not coming out this year.
1113608	1121673	So, once again, you're showing me shit that, you know, I'm not going to buy your PlayStation 3 for these games that are coming out next year.
1122234	1128037	At least I wouldn't be buying it if I didn't have one right now this holiday season, which is really where it's going to count for you guys.
1128558	1133361	I'll be buying it when it comes out, you know, actually in the summer of next year or whatever.
1134202	1136164	So it doesn't do them any good for this holiday.
1136304	1141188	Once again, if they don't come out with something amazing, they're going to lose out on another holiday.
1141689	1142930	That's really going to hurt them.
1143750	1149275	The only thing I really care about coming out of there is, of course, Silent Hill 5, and I really want Metal Gear Solid 4.
1151217	1160685	As far as my thoughts on Sony's press conference, I said before last week that Nintendo had the most to lose going into E3, and Sony had the most to gain.
1160825	1161746	Getting a new Civ game?
1163367	1165448	Well, it's also coming on Xbox 360, though.
1165468	1167289	I downloaded the trailer, and I'm pretty excited about that.
1167930	1168390	But that's different.
1168930	1173573	I think Sony did a way better job than they did last year.
1174114	1183320	I think they certainly changed the tone of their press conference and had it a little well-oiled and got the kinks a little better worked out this year.
1183640	1188923	But I still walked away from it being more excited about the PSP than the PlayStation 3.
1189764	1191125	And I don't know if that's a good sign.
1192015	1194457	and this whole bait and switch leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.
1194477	1201723	Here's the problem, last year, remember last year, it was all, oh, Gran Turismo 5, it's going to be like Gran Turismo HD and stuff, but better and all this stuff.
1202524	1203885	No Gran Turismo 5 this year.
1204365	1208809	And then this, you know, the E3, ooh, Gran Turismo 5, it's so awesome and stuff.
1209149	1220679	You know, and it does look really good, but Project Gotham 4 also looks really good, and if this game is going to take, you know, until Summer 08 to come out...
1221408	1225189	They're going to have Project Gotham Racing 5, which is going to look even more amazing.
1225769	1231931	And it's just, it's all this promising of really good games that are coming out way later.
1232451	1233351	That's the problem.
1233471	1237652	It's not like Microsoft where it's like, here's these great games, they're coming out this fall.
1238072	1241353	You know, get excited for them because they're right around the corner.
1241393	1244314	Whereas, this stuff's coming way later on.
1245151	1247473	Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.
1247833	1251435	It sounds like I'll have a lot more to get excited about with the PlayStation 3 at next year's E3.
1251495	1254057	Or hopefully Final Fantasy XIII is there.
1254858	1256158	But is it going to be too late?
1256278	1256719	I don't know.
1257039	1259881	Or remember, they're showing LittleBigPlanet, that's next year.
1260261	1263043	They're talking about Home, which I hope that's this year.
1263223	1265104	I mean, it's, yeah, I don't know.
1265705	1269027	So, it's just disappointing.
1270215	1270535	I don't know.
1270595	1274017	Part of me on a scale of 1 to 10 wants to give Sony a question mark.
1274437	1274997	I just don't know.
1275037	1278538	Their press conference looks like the town of Silent Hill.
1278558	1281119	There's too much haze around everything for me.
1281439	1290062	But I will reward them for their PSP redesign even though they're taking the old ones away or whatever is supposed to be happening.
1291343	1292403	I give that
1293869	1299232	Good points, but the PlayStation 3, although some games look cool, I'm not completely blown away.
1299252	1299953	But I give them credit.
1300053	1302294	I give them the most improved player award.
1302894	1304936	I would give their conference a 6.
1305436	1306296	Explain this to me.
1306537	1312400	Why should I get a PS3 with a larger hard drive when there's nothing to download for it?
1312860	1314922	There's trailers for movies.
1315422	1316903	There's trailers for games.
1317383	1320565	There's literally less than 10 demos online.
1321406	1325168	and there's a handful of, you know, PlayStation download titles.
1325949	1337676	So, am I buying this larger hard drive system for, you know, so I can dump some of my game's stuff to the hard drive so it can cache the system and make it run faster since the Blu-ray drive's too slow?
1337916	1343900	I mean, it's... They haven't really shown me why we need to buy a system with a larger hard drive in the first place.
1344540	1350864	They're really pushing... Trust me, hard drive space is not what's holding people back from buying your system.
1353111	1358113	BlackWolf says, going to chat room, all three companies pretty much surrendered the press conferences.
1358794	1360494	Floridine says, Sony fails 3.
1361975	1367897	DarkTetsuya says, I liked everything I saw except the new Ratchet and Clank, which should just be released on PlayStation 2 if it's not already.
1368658	1371739	SSJ100Matt says, Sony, they showed everyone what they wanted.
1372139	1374560	Games, Killzone 2, Unreal 3, etc.
1374860	1376941	They showed that the PlayStation 3 has real future.
1377261	1378782	Solid B plus, A minus.
1380210	1380591	You know what?
1380691	1381812	I will give them credit for this.
1381872	1385415	And maybe, actually, maybe I'll bump up my score to a 7 for this sole reason.
1385895	1387617	The Eye of Judgment was nowhere to be seen.
1388498	1391380	So I will bump up Sony's score to 7 for scrapping that piece of shit.
1391420	1393963	They showed it on the show floor, so that was there.
1394523	1395784	But we're grading the conference.
1396204	1397966	So I'll give them the bonus point.
1398667	1401149	I will give them the same as I gave Nintendo a 6.
1401809	1404171	And just because it's promises.
1404352	1405713	And I think there's going to be...
1406860	1411623	Where the disappointments were with the whole... Blackwell says Eye of Judgment was not on the floor.
1412263	1414524	Well, I saw a video of it, so I know that it was there.
1415065	1417326	Maybe behind a door that Bobby didn't look behind.
1417546	1418346	Well, it was there.
1418586	1421888	They were showing it.
1422428	1428612	I think it's going to be a whole line of disappointments with Sony.
1430873	1433935	As we go through the fourth quarter, it's just going to be disappointment after disappointment.
1434215	1434595	I think...
1435365	1438446	The PlayStation 3 is really set to go the same way as the PSP.
1438826	1442107	It's not going to get really, really cool until like three years later.
1442507	1443147	Yeah, unfortunately.
1443167	1443987	Or two or three years later.
1444428	1445108	Kind of interesting.
1446108	1446388	All right.
1448369	1451369	BlackWolf says it might have been in their invite-only hotel suite.
1451590	1456171	He wanted to ask about the copying of cards just for you, about going to Kinko's and making your own cards.
1457191	1459772	Here's their reasoning behind it.
1459852	1460412	They're saying...
1461801	1463522	They basically didn't give a reason.
1463562	1471287	There's no copy protection on the cards, but their thing was it would be like playing Magic the Gathering with someone with photocopied cards.
1471367	1473828	Like you'd really play someone with photocopied cards.
1474248	1475969	That was their reasoning behind it.
1476049	1484814	So in other words, yes, you can copy the cards or download images off the internet instead of buying booster packs and whatnot and copying the card stock and it'll work just fine.
1485407	1488856	TheRobD asks, The PSP is really, really cool?
1488936	1491101	I might buy a PSP for the emulation.
1491201	1492845	Alright, maybe less of the really, really.
1492906	1493768	But, you know, the PSP...
1495015	1497036	is never been solely a gaming system.
1497096	1501217	I do respect the system for everything else it can do, like being kind of a little mini media kit.
1502258	1507199	But yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff that have come out for it in the past year.
1507259	1508480	I think they can't be ignored.
1508600	1514202	But did you notice, though, that they're kind of making the PSP out now to be almost like more of an iPod or a Zune or something?
1514222	1515923	Because now it has a video out thing on it.
1516363	1519804	You're going to be able to charge it using the USB cable on there as well.
1519944	1522305	So if you're on the go, you can charge it and stuff.
1523125	1551720	and then of course memory stick prices are coming down quite a bit so I don't know it's interesting and the problem is though their PR department is so horrible so horrible and they really their upper management needs to shut the hell up it's not helping them and I know Ken Kutaragi's gone now because he was making dumb statements before but my god Kazurai is not any better it
1552429	1553549	It's not any better with him.
1555310	1556851	Alright, well, there you have it.
1556911	1559191	Our thoughts on the Sony press conference.
1559972	1564933	Let's go now to some more listener feedback via the email bag, because we love to get emails.
1565213	1569455	And if you weren't in our chat room tonight and you want to give your two cents to the press conferences or anything you saw at E3...
1570445	1578770	Send us an email, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com, because DarkSakura opens up the mailbag every week and reads a few of her favorite pieces of email here with us.
1578870	1579830	So, DarkSakura?
1579970	1581591	He, he, he, Captain Crayola.
1581671	1584493	Jump in the mailbag and pull something out for us, will you?
1588955	1589875	First email.
1590096	1591056	Hi, OLR crew.
1591436	1594558	I guess this is where I should say I'm a long-time listener but a first-time emailer.
1595313	1597054	I first heard about your show from Bobby Blackwolf.
1597094	1602178	He's an old friend of mine from the days when we were moderators on the forums for a TV channel, but are left unmentioned.
1603399	1606161	And have been listening to the podcast on and off for about a year.
1606302	1613227	I always find the show enjoyable, and you've become one of my mainstays for relatively unbiased or biased in a way that matches my own opinions at Gaming News.
1614488	1620633	Recently, I listened to the podcast of your five-year plus-one episode, and I have a bone to pick with Loki and Rob regarding the Harvest Moon series.
1621093	1623615	Loki is on record as enjoying sandbox games.
1623939	1626640	and the Harvest Moon series fits this description to a tee.
1627320	1629420	The games have something for everyone.
1630160	1633901	Real-time strategy fans can strategize to get the most crops each season.
1634301	1640183	Those who enjoy dating sims can, in most of the games, date the NPCs, culminating in creating a family.
1640743	1645704	Action fans can have fun catching fish, chopping down trees and planting endless fields of grass.
1646144	1650605	RPG fans can engage in as many tedious and pointless quests as have ever been found in one game.
1651235	1654937	There are no expectations and certainly no requirements for the manner in which one plays the game.
1655057	1655777	What's not to love?
1656377	1661880	Not liking the series because farming isn't for you makes more sense than disliking them because all the games are the same.
1662520	1664281	After all, doesn't Halo do the same thing?
1665181	1668523	Anyway, my husband and I love the show and are looking forward to listening for years to come.
1668603	1669723	Thanks for brightening up our week.
1669843	1670824	Yours, TheBlackMonster.
1670924	1671224	P.S.
1671244	1673305	This email was written on a G4 Titanium Power Book.
1674685	1675146	Grats.
1675826	1676526	Alright, you start.
1676546	1677527	I'll address this.
1679110	1680412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1700709	1704391	Yeah, Microsoft isn't releasing eight copies of the game a year.
1704611	1711035	I mean, seriously, there are so many Harvest Moon games that they're saying that are different, but aren't really different.
1711415	1720040	Like, there's the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls, which I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's probably just like the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls on the GameCube and stuff like that.
1720180	1726163	There's the whole, was it Innocent Life of Futuristic Harvest Moon or something like that, which was just...
1727131	1730112	Like a futuristic setting, still farming.
1730572	1731952	And still all the same stuff.
1732812	1733072	Great.
1733152	1734673	If that's for you, awesome.
1735073	1736033	It's not a sandbox game.
1736053	1737754	This is not Grand Theft Auto farming.
1737974	1739154	See, this is the problem.
1739514	1741754	Is that this game doesn't involve guns and violence.
1741855	1743095	That's where your problem is.
1743495	1745295	The problem is, is it doesn't change.
1745515	1747116	It's not innovating any.
1747296	1748876	I mean, it's farming.
1748956	1749416	Okay, great.
1749496	1751117	Okay, are there different crops this time?
1751237	1751737	Ooh, goody.
1752077	1756438	I mean, it's not like, you know, you have a crop or something and you have to...
1757658	1762661	Fight Off, the man who's trying to steal your property to build a mall or something on it.
1763001	1776549	I think what's going on here is that sandbox is kind of being seen as a very general term where Loki likes a very specific type of sandbox game like the 3D jump, shoot, find, destroy, rape type of sandbox game.
1776569	1781933	Well, the sandbox games are basically games you can go in there and do whatever you want and tackle it however you want.
1782193	1784414	This is a farming... This is a sim game.
1784474	1785775	You start off with crops...
1786155	1792979	You tend to the crops and stuff, and it's a farming sim with RPG elements.
1793440	1796101	From my perspective, I've tried Harvest Moon.
1796261	1798643	You know, I played the one on the GameCube, and I just...
1799491	1800811	I just couldn't get into it.
1800891	1801492	I don't know what it was.
1801512	1805593	I think for me there was like just kind of like too much going on at once.
1805653	1808613	It didn't have that kind of simplicity that Animal Crossing had.
1808974	1810514	But, you know, I don't know.
1810554	1815395	I guess maybe I need to give the series another look because if I like Animal Crossing, I should like something like Harvest Moon.
1815675	1816936	But I just wasn't feeling it.
1817556	1821117	There was just, there was nothing to keep me coming back.
1821197	1825478	What they need to do is instead of releasing, like,
1826108	1828450	4 or 5 titles a year of Harvest Moon.
1828711	1833535	Just release one good title of Harvest Moon each year and do it that way.
1833595	1838479	Put some more effort into the game instead of just rehashing the same thing and giving it a new coat of paint.
1839500	1840761	Devil's Advocate, I have to.
1840841	1843243	I may not agree with what I'm about to say, but Devil's Advocate, I have to.
1843564	1845045	Doesn't DDR do the same damn thing?
1845185	1845766	Yes, it does.
1845986	1847287	It does the same damn thing.
1847467	1850189	And that's another reason why that series is starting to go downhill.
1850510	1857796	It's because that's all they do is just give it a new fresh coat of paint, change the colors of the menu or something, and then just add some new songs.
1857856	1858317	And that's it.
1858737	1859698	And expect you to buy it.
1860699	1860959	All right.
1861119	1861600	Fair enough.
1861620	1862040	Take it or leave it.
1862060	1863481	Can we talk about something other than Harvest Moon now?
1863561	1864042	Absolutely.
1864882	1866184	This next email though is super cool.
1866344	1866544	Okay.
1867105	1869987	Dear OLR crew, this is Ranma the Blind from Indonesia.
1870287	1876170	I finally wrote my second email to you and I hope I could share some video game related contents that might interest you all and all of your listeners.
1877410	1879471	First of all, I would like to announce that I finally bought a Wii.
1879772	1886075	That's because I've got nostalgia for old Nintendo systems, so I wish I could play some of the old classic games via virtual console.
1886195	1892178	Or perhaps I could hear my friends play the games as my eye condition makes me impossible to play all the games.
1892705	1893505	Thank you for watching!
1911463	1917030	Right now, I'm still trying some other Wii titles, and I hope I can discover more games for blinds to play.
1917671	1923277	I wish that Nintendo could make research about this, and perhaps create accessible contents for the blind to purchase.
1923838	1925460	So you guys, do you have any comments about this?
1925820	1927983	And I'll pause here if you guys have any comments.
1928496	1937280	Well, I appreciate hearing back because it's always interesting to hear from this kind of perspective that doesn't often get enough recognition at large in gaming blogs and things.
1937300	1939321	There were sound games on the Saturn back in the day.
1939341	1940382	Why can't Nintendo do that?
1940702	1942583	I'm actually going to turn around and ask another question.
1942783	1946285	I'm really curious because I bet this email was sent in before Nintendo's press conference this week.
1946825	1957050	I'm really curious what this emailer thinks about some of these other new innovations like Wii Fit and some of these other directions that Nintendo's going that has a little more to do with movement, if that makes sense.
1958171	1959572	Well, email us back.
1959592	1962994	Actually, I'm going to have to ask him to email us back because of the next part.
1963014	1964055	But did you have a comment?
1964815	1970159	Oh, I was just going to say that, you know, unfortunately, you know, blind gamers are such a small...
1970663	1979951	percentage of their demographic that I don't think you're going to ever see anything that's really dedicated to it, unless you get some independent company out there that's really gearing towards, you know, that.
1980631	1983294	There's no reason for them to make sound-based games.
1983394	1995284	Unless they could do something pretty innovative, because there was some stuff on the Game Boy Advance that was just sound, part of that bit generation series, but it's just unfortunately, you know, blind handicap and stuff, it is such a small market, you know,
2000622	2004004	What about something that would make the existing games more accessible to the audience?
2004364	2005645	Great, if they can do something like that.
2005725	2011609	I sort of think about how Windows has the Zoom feature and those other types of accessibility options.
2012709	2014550	Could a game console adapt something similar?
2014730	2016331	It's possible, I don't know.
2016752	2020634	Mortal Kombat Armageddon would probably be a lot easier to play and waggle the thing around.
2020654	2022935	Broad caliber!
2023836	2025617	Alright, anyhow, sorry, let the email finish.
2026562	2031004	So, the next part is, another thing I would like to share is a Final Fantasy concert held in my country.
2031524	2042128	Actually, this is the second one as the concert was also held last year, but it was still enjoyable, especially in Indonesia where video game music is rare to find, and game music concert is like a distant dream.
2043069	2046370	You did say you uploaded pictures and videos from the concert.
2046790	2050992	I want your permission before I make that public to chat, so...
2051502	2058305	or if you would like to go into our forum at OrangeDodgeRadio.com and make a thread about it, then we would appreciate you sharing it with everybody that way.
2059546	2066569	I wish in the future another video game music concert will again be held here, perhaps by Video Game Music Live or Play, a video game symphony.
2067069	2067969	I think that's all for now.
2067989	2069270	Take care and have a good show.
2070931	2071231	All right.
2071531	2071891	Very cool.
2071911	2072391	Thanks for the email.
2072411	2073512	Okay, this one.
2073803	2074583	Hey guys, how's it going?
2074643	2075344	It's me, Nim.
2075544	2078285	I haven't been listening lately because of the fact that my iPod was stolen.
2078605	2084048	I usually listen to the downloadable version, but more than likely I'll be tuning in more often and jumping in chat.
2084348	2090151	Lately I've been playing a lot of Bimani, Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution, Parapara, and I just heard Poppin' for the first time last week.
2090291	2096674	I'm pretty sure you've answered this question before, but knowing that you used to be nothing but a show about Bimani, which out of the line are your favorites?
2098959	2100520	Out of the entire Bomani series?
2101140	2101841	Is that what the question?
2101861	2102621	I'm assuming.
2106523	2107444	Well, that's a tough question.
2107504	2109965	I want to say 2DX, but the series has gotten really stale.
2112306	2113587	God, the same goes for DDR.
2113627	2117970	The problem is most of the Konami Bomani series has gotten a little bit stale.
2118010	2120191	There's not been a lot of innovation within the games.
2121251	2124653	I would say, I guess, back in the day, it was definitely Beatmania, 2DX.
2125014	2125554	Keyboard Mania?
2126175	2128477	Oh yeah, oh fuck, I loved Keyboard Mania.
2128778	2129979	Yeah, Keyboard Mania is my answer.
2129999	2146634	I loved Drum Mania a whole lot, and my drum pads were, unfortunately they're just not as strong as how I like to play, because I'm used to the arcade, but I still like to get out and shake my booty on Parapara, that's always fun.
2148696	2149797	I like Dance Maniacs.
2151019	2152480	Oh, I didn't like Dance Maniacs.
2152760	2153040	It was okay.
2153160	2154160	I love Dance Maniacs.
2154220	2154861	I love Marathon Road.
2155021	2164705	I, you know, personally, I would love to see another Bomani game that was using the Parapara control system, but with non-Parapara music.
2165285	2167246	You know, just like another, like, dancing game.
2168006	2178271	Hell, they can do another dancing game like that and have, like, you know, the, almost like the Wii Fit board on the bottom or something, have, like, pressure sensors or something to do something like that.
2178291	2178871	That'd be pretty cool.
2180700	2182081	Alright, any more emails?
2182881	2183401	Well, yeah.
2183581	2184702	Alright, let's hear them.
2186083	2187223	Let's move forward.
2187684	2191425	Hey all, just wanted to chime in as another developer that listens to your show each week.
2191846	2197308	Technically, I'm an associate producer, which, if you enjoy abbreviations, turns into ass prod.
2198509	2198969	That's great.
2201871	2204592	I love people that can be self-deprecating in their humor.
2205653	2206273	So, um...
2206963	2211266	You can tell by my email address where I work now.
2211806	2216589	And before this, I ran my own indie studio and developed a little strategy game for PC called Land of Legends.
2216990	2218691	And I'm not going to say where.
2218871	2223434	I'm not going to say either, because I read the email beforehand, so I know where this person is from from the email address.
2223814	2224575	And I will say...
2225800	2237987	I want to say that it's a company that I know takes a lot of crap from the hardcore community sometimes, but I think they really do some awesome things for the non-hardcore audience.
2239608	2242850	I think they've done a lot, especially in the past year, and a lot of stuff that I really enjoy.
2244631	2247213	And I'm not just saying that because you emailed.
2248154	2252056	Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for the show and let you guys know that you have
2252674	2253837	Yet another developer listening.
2253857	2256304	Feel free to write if you have any questions or issues I can help with.
2256324	2259492	I'm just going to use the nickname HeroAntagonist.
2260538	2267443	You know, it's funny, I heard back from the developer that emailed us previously and he was willing to do an Ask a Developer type segment.
2267763	2272246	So maybe we can get this guy in on it too and have some type of roundtable thing on a later show.
2272266	2275108	That might be kind of fun, especially during the next few months.
2275429	2279331	It might be a little bit slow before we get into the fall rush of game news.
2279351	2281453	It might be kind of fun to do an Ask a Developer roundtable.
2281513	2284075	So please write us back if you'd be willing to participate.
2284095	2286376	You can contact me directly or send back the email bag, whatever.
2287157	2289318	Because we're going to try definitely doing something like that in the future.
2289558	2290099	This one's short.
2290479	2291099	Hey, OLR.
2291119	2294120	I know I'm kind of late with this one, but happy belated birthday, OLR.
2294400	2295640	You guys are awesome and keep it up.
2295780	2296020	Ron.
2296540	2297160	Thank you, Ron.
2297720	2298361	Thank you.
2298741	2299521	Did you bring us a present?
2300541	2300941	I'm sorry.
2300981	2303402	You said, Ron, I think of Potter Puppet House.
2304162	2304522	Stop.
2304602	2305162	It's Snape.
2305182	2306022	Let's bother him.
2306622	2308043	No.
2308183	2308803	This last one.
2308863	2309183	Hey, guys.
2309223	2310463	I just want to say I love the show.
2310803	2316044	And what do you think about young gamers on online games that they really shouldn't play?
2316144	2318065	I'm 14, so I really shouldn't be talking.
2318105	2319085	I just wanted your opinion.
2319225	2320005	Sincerely, Christian.
2320660	2321685	Who says you shouldn't talk if you're 14?
2321765	2322971	I mean, age...
2324483	2325104	Age is a number.
2325164	2325764	Age is a number.
2325804	2327406	Maturity is everything.
2327446	2335572	And I think if you can play a game maturely, and that doesn't mean you have to play adult or act adult.
2335612	2337614	You can have fun but still be mature.
2337674	2345761	And by that, I mean you don't go on to Xbox Live and yell, you know, N, N, N, F, F, F, and all those words that people scream on Xbox Live.
2346121	2352146	If you can have fun and have that self-deprecating humor and laugh and have a good time, then, you know,
2352888	2354690	I do have a suggestion.
2354730	2355810	Use periods when you type.
2356491	2358633	I had perfect grammar when I was fourteen.
2383223	2385124	Let's dig up some of your high school papers and check.
2385484	2385884	Honestly?
2387025	2388625	No, I really don't care that much.
2388645	2391166	I can say, because I can prove it.
2391227	2392387	I can back it up.
2392707	2409154	But no, seriously, it's just a matter of how you... If you're typing on an MMO and you have something to say, think... Something my granddaddy used to always say, I will quote a bit of wisdom, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.
2409535	2410155	In this case...
2411109	2413510	Put brain in gear before typing, I guess.
2414571	2417833	Kevin DDR in chat would like to point out, I am a 14-year-old playing online games.
2417853	2418613	See?
2418653	2419233	So you're not alone.
2419734	2420334	There we go.
2421795	2428318	It's just a matter of, you know, just thinking before you do something.
2428699	2430079	I was playing online games at 14.
2430780	2438164	Only when I was 14, the online games we had to play were Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars, The Pit...
2439306	2440346	and so on and so on.
2440366	2442987	And if you catch my references, you're a winner.
2445327	2445667	Is that it?
2446187	2446547	That's it.
2446807	2447107	All right.
2448688	2451948	If you'd like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2453109	2455729	And by the way, I give everybody a hard time for their grammar, so don't worry about it.
2456369	2457409	Mine's really not all that great.
2458630	2461110	Well, it's really better than Rob's on AIM, though.
2461210	2461690	I will say that.
2462470	2462750	All right.
2462830	2464271	Anyhow, shut up.
2464691	2465651	We will get on to...
2467671	2471933	Some other news coming out of E3 that didn't necessarily have to do with the press conferences.
2472033	2475174	Actually, I want to spend a little time talking about music games.
2475194	2476675	Because, you know, that's how we started.
2476715	2477455	That's our roots.
2477775	2482758	We need to talk about some of the music games that were going on at E3 and some of the events that happened this week outside of E3.
2483098	2488720	Let's start with a game that was coming out from EA.
2489281	2490161	It's called Boogie.
2491194	2493817	EA announced the soundtrack to the game called Boogie.
2494218	2497982	It comes with a karaoke microphone and it's actually on the Wii.
2498582	2504149	And they were trying to put together basically a lot of generations of hits.
2504829	2510455	And in this game you're supposed to be able to dance, sing, and make music videos using the Wii controls.
2510656	2511817	So that should be interesting.
2512157	2513599	Some of the songs that will be in this game.
2514240	2515582	ABC by the Jackson 5.
2516944	2518586	Brick House by the Commodores.
2518966	2520789	Canned Heat by Jamiroquai.
2521610	2523652	Love Roller Coaster by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
2524053	2525815	Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas.
2525895	2527337	Love Shack by the B-52s.
2528078	2529520	Milkshake by Khalees.
2529560	2530261	That's so rad.
2531074	2532775	One Way, that's the song we gotta get Loki to play.
2533176	2556871	One Way or Another by Blondie, Groove is in the Heart by D. Light, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Cindy Lauper, Get the Party Started by Pink, Fergalicious by Fergie, there's another Loki song, YMCA by The Village People, Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, SOS by Rihanna, Oops I Did It Again, Britney Spears, that's a pretty fun list that brings across all generations there, so.
2557349	2558009	Black Sabbath Paranoid
2589494	2612595	Blue Oyster Cult, Don't Fear the Reaper, The Ramones, Rockaway Beach, Rush with Tom Sawyer, Bon Jovi with Wanted Dead or Alive, Nirvana in Bloom, Stone Temple Pilots, Vaseline, Weezer, Say It Ain't So,
2613437	2624001	Foo Fighters, Learn to Fly, Metallica, Enter Sandman, The Hives, Main Offender, The Strokes, Reptilia, and Queens of the Stone Age go with Flow.
2624621	2628903	Now I heard in this game you'll be able to use the microphone as claps or a tambourine.
2629543	2633404	So I demand this mix have Stevie Nicks somewhere in it.
2633664	2635605	Fleetwood Mac, whatever you have to do to do it.
2635905	2640767	But you cannot have a game where you play the tambourine and not represent Miss Stevie Nicks because...
2641576	2642837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2671244	2674186	That has the possibility of being a pretty awesome game.
2674346	2676947	That's one reason I'm sad I didn't go to E3.
2676967	2677727	I would have liked to play that.
2677807	2679648	They also promise new content every week.
2680589	2681089	For how long?
2683210	2686132	If it takes off, I'd say probably for a year.
2686152	2687192	Oh my gosh.
2687212	2689093	That's something that could just keep going, though.
2689293	2690154	I think that's great.
2690494	2692755	That's going to be very interesting to see what that does.
2692815	2693615	Quite ambitious.
2694456	2696177	Harmonix gets it, you guys.
2696277	2696897	They get it.
2697457	2698598	Rock Band teams with MTV.
2698638	2698998	I'm sorry.
2699038	2700719	It's going to take off.
2701303	2707445	and it's kind of interesting to see what's going to happen to Guitar Hero this year because they've almost got to beat their own game.
2707786	2721291	I realize there's a guitar and drum element in this game that makes this, but I hope somehow poppy songs can, you know, because I love poppy songs as well as rock, so I hope somehow they can be integrated into this game one way or another.
2722881	2723261	I don't know.
2723441	2728902	There's just a weird side of me that would like to be able to sing, you know, just the weird songs you wouldn't expect in this game, you know?
2728922	2732103	And I want Rock Band 2 or whatever to have different instruments.
2732283	2732603	Yeah.
2732683	2734003	Rock Band 2, Electric Boogaloo.
2734023	2737123	Hopefully Rock Band 2 gives us a little more, you know, so we can sing different songs.
2737183	2739504	It would be damn hard to do a keyboard style thing, though.
2739684	2740764	Please give me keyboard.
2741884	2742864	Please give me keyboard.
2743564	2749485	The format that they have set up for that, I doubt very seriously that would be possible unless it's like seven keys.
2750246	2751126	It's USB.
2751306	2752286	How hard could it be?
2753982	2755943	I'm talking about screen format.
2756363	2765325	Yeah, especially when you've got the voice track, guitar, all this other business going on on the screen, and your animation going on.
2765725	2775488	Doing keyboard mode is not going to be... I'm trying to think of the way that they have the Guitar Hero style play going in.
2775928	2777448	They're not going to be able to do keyboard that way.
2777488	2780329	They could do it with Keyboard Mania because you had a full screen.
2781068	2791455	DarkSakura, Destroyer of Dreams, everybody.
2792576	2794077	I'm just being realistic, Rob.
2794177	2796619	I understand, but... Rob, there is no Easter Bunny!
2798500	2799061	I hate you.
2800182	2804645	There was no bunny hanging out at Easter.
2806586	2807507	Can we please move on?
2807607	2808167	Yes, please.
2809588	2810549	Hey, it's my turn, isn't it?
2811303	2812044	I have good news.
2813305	2815847	Well, it would be good news if it was still 1991, wouldn't it?
2818270	2819331	Oh, please read the story now.
2820452	2820912	I know what's coming.
2820932	2832944	Slash, our curly-haired, top-hat-wearing hero of Guns N' Roses, currently a Velvet Revolver, is a boss in Guitar Hero 3.
2834905	2836007	Buckethead is cooler!
2838150	2841312	I absolutely agree this news would have been ten times cooler in 1991.
2842313	2845215	But it's still kind of cool, you have to admit.
2845615	2847797	Having Slash in the game, that is kind of cool.
2847857	2854842	Because, you know, those of us that remember Slash from our high school days are a little bit more grown up now and can spend the money on things like Guitar Hero 3.
2855723	2858525	And there is a certain cool factor to having Slash in the game.
2858965	2864069	You know, Guitar Hero 3 knows they're going to really have it in for them with this whole rock band thing coming out, but...
2865149	2866990	I think it could be pretty cool.
2867170	2868751	Again, it all boils down to song list for me.
2869831	2873393	It's almost like this year's lineup, EA has it in for Activision.
2873413	2885759	I mean, they've got Skate coming out with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground coming out later, Rock Band, and I don't know, I guess with licensed games, you know, The Simpsons and stuff.
2889260	2891001	Activision has a lot to lose if they don't innovate.
2891795	2893476	Innovate or Die GK128 says Fuck Slash
2921309	2926832	Guitar Hero needs a college rock edition featuring Frank Black from the Pixies and Jay Maskis from Dinosaur Jr.
2926992	2927793	I love you.
2928473	2929113	Officially.
2929133	2931735	You know what we need?
2931795	2938318	We need like late 70s, early 80s rock like Enid Tho and some Joy Division for me.
2938538	2939098	That'd be great.
2939419	2940119	And some Bauhaus.
2940697	2959081	Well, speaking of music games and going over to Konami, kind of talking about what they're up to, Supernova 2 was tested this week, and some of the news has been a little bit lost in the shuffle of all the E3 news, but if you head over to a site like BomaniStyle.com that dedicates themselves to all the music game news, you can get some of the latest wrap-ups from the fans out there playing the location test.
2959522	2962322	A whole list of the extra songs that are in the game has shown up.
2962342	2969724	There's some interesting covers in it, including Come Clean, which if I remember right was like a Hilary Duff song, I think.
2970199	2971441	Faint, Me Against the Music
2981920	2985342	It's very interesting that Konami sticks with all these covers, not the real things.
2985662	2986142	I don't know.
2986523	2989104	Well, anyway, some other reports that come in from the updates.
2989764	2997068	Marvelous ratings in Supernova 2 don't seem to award more points than perfects, and for some reason seemed easier to obtain than usual.
2998129	3001811	Strings of perfect ratings will by no means hamper a great song rating.
3002431	3008595	Konami finally has spelled Marvelous the right way with one L, and it's a solid silver color.
3010035	3010316	Let's see.
3010356	3016419	If a player is able to receive all perfects or better, the AAA rating on the results screen will feature the text, Full Perfect Combo.
3017199	3017639	Interesting.
3018600	3019480	Some other news there.
3019540	3025544	There's an extra stage that has a background video with Black Roses, people, and other things that are going on.
3025584	3027064	I guess the song is called Unreal.
3027985	3030946	There's an introduction video to DDR has returned.
3031046	3032407	It hasn't been one of those in a little while.
3032427	3033668	They say since 4th Mix there.
3035529	3037590	But they say some of the songs feel a little off sync.
3038243	3043566	People were complaining that some of the older songs from DDR Extreme and DDR Supernova didn't feel quite right.
3043846	3046227	It wasn't off-sync by much, but they were bitching it was off-sync.
3046487	3059614	But it should also be noted they were also bitching that the pads being used on the location test machine were not perfect, which might be a good point to reiterate that maybe it's time for Konami to come out with some new pads that are a little better with the technology that's a little newer.
3059774	3067298	Not to mention, I mean, but if you guys remember the original Supernova beta test, same issues, you know, that stuff was off-sync.
3067418	3067858	It's just...
3068567	3071968	BlackWolf says only in DDR is perfect, not good enough.
3072008	3072108	Nice.
3093973	3103158	So for DDR fans who are looking to get back into arcades, also the rumor is EMUs is coming with Supernova 2, which you might remember from the Japanese Pomona games.
3103198	3107460	It never really came over here, but the rumor is the test machine had the EMUs set up on it.
3107780	3109201	So that's kind of interesting.
3109802	3110482	We'll see where that goes.
3111262	3112683	Could make up for lack of memory cards.
3113864	3114264	Maybe.
3115785	3116265	Hopefully.
3116285	3117686	I don't know.
3119847	3123689	Anyways, so I don't know.
3124141	3130504	This is, I guess, cool that there's new content coming out for Guitar Hero 2 for the Xbox 360.
3132165	3135107	And the new pack actually is going to have a few more songs in there.
3137628	3143331	But at the same time, you know, it's got... I want to be sedated, smoke on the water, and you've got another thing coming.
3144271	3147693	It's still going to be 500 Microsoft points, or $6.25.
3148534	3149274	And guess what?
3149634	3153236	Because, you know, people that did download it before the first pack
3154327	3155127	Yes, of course.
3178956	3179416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3206718	3209761	I was going to have something petty to complain about, but I just realized something.
3232796	3237597	DDR hasn't had another download pack since the launch of the fucking, you know, Universe game.
3237957	3239397	Where the fuck are the downloads?
3239617	3241758	Shit, Universe 2 is right around the corner.
3242018	3244258	Where the hell is my goddamn downloads for Universe 1?
3244858	3246498	Or did you just forget to do that?
3246538	3249399	Kind of like the karaoke revolution append discs.
3249679	3250579	Want to know my theory?
3251139	3254780	They ain't coming because the song packs were all already on the disc and that's all they made.
3255460	3256020	That's my theory.
3258600	3259361	Fuck them for that.
3261881	3262181	That's it.
3263358	3267179	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to move in two weeks and I still don't have a place to live.
3268119	3269219	That's a little bit frustrating.
3269440	3274261	But hopefully I will be better very soon and I'll have a place because that would be nice.
3274541	3275721	Because otherwise I'm going to cry.
3277181	3279362	Let's move on to some other news.
3281262	3284703	Now we're going to get into some news that, you know, some other things picked up around this week.
3284743	3287384	Not necessarily at E3, but some of them are, some of them aren't.
3287604	3288124	DarkSakura?
3289264	3292405	Well, there is some other stuff.
3293537	3298379	Disney has actually purchased War Inspector, their Junction Point Studios.
3299120	3308083	So now we'll be getting some new games, and Disney is going to have some stuff coming to the new consoles.
3312145	3319128	War Inspector brought us the Deus Ex, Thief, Deadly Shadows, System Shock.
3320569	3320649	Um...
3324266	3325667	I really don't know how to feel about this.
3340775	3353839	There's a quote on here saying, Warren Spector's unique talents as leading creative forces in the world of video games, his knowledge and passion for Disney, his legacy of storytelling and character development adds a unique creative dimension to our portfolio.
3354560	3357641	And it's from the executive VP of Disney Interactive.
3359321	3361382	So maybe we'll get some good.
3361892	3364894	Well, Disney's been up to a lot of wheeling and dealing lately.
3364935	3370499	They, at E3, announced a new online service that will be on all of their DS titles.
3371000	3376544	It's called D-Gamer, and it's going to be first in the Chronicles of Narnia game that's coming out for the DS.
3376624	3382889	And basically what D-Gamer's going to do is it's going to turn your Nintendo DS into Xbox Live of sorts.
3383370	3389635	There will be avatars, you can chat with other people, and you can look at the achievements that your friends have unlocked.
3390541	3393122	Interesting that it took a third party to do this.
3393542	3398804	So the system is more than capable of handling this type of technology, it's just that Nintendo doesn't want to do it.
3399524	3400024	Interesting.
3401564	3406266	And interesting that somebody has decided to step up and do it, if not just for their own games.
3406306	3413788	But let's face it, there's a certain audience that gets a lot of these Disney games that come out, you know, the Hannah Montana games and the That's So Ravens game.
3414175	3430859	that will benefit from this, whereas the rest of us hardcore gamers that are too cool to go out and buy a Chronicles of Narnia video game are going to be sitting here going, gosh, I wish I had something like that when I was playing, you know, the games I'm playing, like Pokemon, even though that's not much cooler.
3434279	3434540	Anyway.
3435800	3437520	Because Rob really likes Hannah Montana.
3437920	3438460	Shut up.
3439001	3440141	Another disappointment.
3440681	3440921	Well...
3441798	3446543	Still rumors that the 6-axis controller is gonna be rumbling soon.
3446803	3452869	In fact, it's been confirmed by a few different places, one of which is supposedly a Sony employee.
3453670	3454771	Apparently, I guess...
3456108	3461890	Sony employee confirmed directly to Kotaku that the 6-axis will be rumbling soon.
3462530	3472653	Of course, shortly afterwards, Immersion comes out saying, hey, we're making a TouchSense rumble controller for the PlayStation 3 in September.
3473493	3484937	So if a third-party company is making it for the PlayStation 3 in September, because why the hell would you add rumble to your controllers if, I don't know, there wasn't rumble coming, because that would be kind of stupid.
3487254	3488694	I don't know, that's very interesting.
3488734	3495937	But Sony is still denying it, saying, hey, yeah, it's not coming, you know, this is all rumor, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3495997	3501620	But then again, last week, they were also saying, hey, we have no plans on cutting the PlayStation 3 price.
3502360	3508782	Or, you know, hey, the 60 gig system is going to be $4.99 and we're going to be still producing them, you know, that kind of stuff.
3510203	3510723	Let me put it this way.
3511544	3514205	Rumble isn't so last gen after all.
3514325	3515105	Oh, yeah, exactly.
3516039	3518180	I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's probably coming this fall.
3519481	3522783	And so when you buy your PlayStation 3 systems, guess what?
3522803	3523923	You get to buy new controllers.
3524163	3526285	Much like the PlayStation 1, if you remember.
3527465	3532088	Devil's Advocate, could the rumble in these controllers be for the backwards compatible games?
3533568	3535069	It would be weird to see them.
3535510	3537210	It could possibly, I guess, for that.
3537270	3543334	But right now, as far as I'm aware, I don't think the rumble stuff is in there.
3543374	3543734	I don't know.
3544659	3545620	I guess it's possible.
3546100	3549582	But it'd be kind of weird to buy a controller just for the backwards compatible games.
3549982	3556085	Yeah, because that would imply that somebody bought a PlayStation 3 would totally skip the PlayStation 2, and I can't think that that's a very large audience.
3556105	3560468	And I can't imagine that programming or whatever would be built into the emulation either.
3561048	3561489	You know what I mean?
3561829	3563370	So, I don't know.
3564650	3568753	It'd be an interesting theory, but I think it's coming.
3569693	3572895	Alright, well we shall see what Sony does in the upcoming months.
3573291	3575632	Sony's gonna eat crayon pie is what they're gonna do.
3576393	3577293	Well, except this.
3577394	3579075	This is redemption, I think.
3581516	3587880	They did a poem that hinted to a coming of something.
3589681	3590521	Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
3590822	3596745	Silent Hill 5 has been announced for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which I'll probably get it on PS3.
3596785	3598126	I'm happy.
3598867	3599427	I'm happy.
3600646	3610412	DarkSakura, how would your inner fangirl feel if I told you that Silent Hill 5 is not being developed by Team Silent, but in fact is being developed by the team that brought you Mark Echo's Getting Up?
3628479	3630664	and the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer game on the Xbox.
3630704	3632108	The first Buffy game was really good.
3632809	3633090	All right.
3633511	3635415	So your inner fangirl may give this a chance?
3636839	3638182	As long as my man does music.
3640424	3640965	Akira Yamaoka
3661127	3673251	and then, of course, Silent Hill Arcade, which I had my fangasm over in Part A. Seriously, if you haven't seen the videos, it's so... I don't want to spoil what happens, but, like, the battle with Pyramid Head ends in, like, the raddest way.
3674031	3674652	Oh, my God.
3674692	3676472	Like, fangasm all over.
3677533	3678073	It's awesome.
3679273	3681434	And, yes, I am a fanboy for Pyramid Head and Silent Hill.
3681474	3682014	I will admit it.
3683315	3690097	Anyhow, I'm also a fanboy for Price Drops, and I was kind of hoping, like many of you, that Microsoft would announce one this week at E3.
3690925	3691845	Well, you know what?
3692686	3698369	There was an interview from 1UP with Shane Kim and they were talking to him.
3698429	3700650	He's of course the corporate VP at Microsoft Game Studios.
3700670	3707633	They were asking him about the whole, you know, what does Xbox 360 need to win and where's the price drop?
3707933	3713356	Well, Shane Kim doesn't completely count out a price drop.
3715288	3716808	In fact, he says, stay tuned.
3717128	3718349	We didn't announce anything here.
3718429	3719409	Didn't feel the need to.
3719589	3722049	July is a very odd time to announce a price reduction.
3722389	3728031	I'm not even sure Sony announced a price reduction anyway, because, you know, the whole bait and switch thing going on.
3729011	3732871	So they said we didn't feel the need to do it at E3.
3733011	3734552	So they're not cutting it out of the picture.
3734592	3738773	It might just not be coming for a little while, kind of like was speculated earlier in the show.
3739293	3740853	So very interesting.
3744283	3749346	Of course, I should say there's a huge rumor going around about the August 1st price drop.
3749887	3750267	I don't know.
3750327	3751288	That seems a little soon.
3751308	3755050	If they were going to do it then, they might as well have announced it at PlayStation 3.
3755170	3756811	Blackwolf has an interesting thought.
3756871	3758812	He says they might announce it at Penny Arcade Expo.
3759293	3761454	They might announce it... Take it directly to the fans.
3761514	3761974	They'll love it.
3762154	3765857	Announce it at PAX or now there's X07, you know.
3766457	3767318	I heard they canceled it.
3767658	3768458	Oh, well... No, no, no.
3768598	3771000	Maybe I'm thinking... I'm thinking they're...
3772802	3773903	Event over in Europe.
3774103	3774463	Is that it?
3774624	3775544	Yeah, it's Exo 7.
3775624	3776545	I don't think that's happening this year.
3776565	3777706	Okay, what about Tokyo Game Show then?
3777946	3778367	That could be.
3779047	3779308	I don't know.
3779528	3779868	You never know.
3780268	3781610	They have plenty of time to do it.
3782030	3785353	Especially waiting until closer to Halo and stuff.
3786114	3786394	I don't know.
3786414	3787695	I don't think they're in trouble.
3788255	3793520	Another thing I was going to mention real quick though, there was also Capcom was saying that they speculate that
3794116	3795957	The PlayStation 3 will drop price again.
3796078	3801141	And there's also speculation that I know Europe was supposed to be getting the 120 gig PlayStation 3.
3801862	3803923	And can you imagine if they do the same thing here?
3804524	3809608	And so it's going to be every few months or so you're going to get price drop, clearance, new system come out.
3810268	3810508	Hmm.
3811009	3811329	Anyways.
3812390	3821076	So GamePro, on top of their game apparently, did a little article of seven games that mysteriously were missing from E3.
3821096	3821277	Okay.
3822256	3824137	which is full of inaccuracies.
3824297	3825777	So let's just go down the list, shall we?
3826337	3827678	Grand Theft Auto 4.
3828178	3840782	God, where was Grand Theft Auto 4 other than the PlayStation press conference, the Xbox press conference, the Take-Two press conference where they did a walkthrough demo of the thing?
3841743	3842483	Yeah, it wasn't there.
3843463	3844043	Spore.
3846264	3847284	No, Spore was there.
3847465	3851706	They showed off a few more things on it and had a little press demo for it.
3852757	3853197	God of War 3.
3853698	3854598	Okay, that wasn't there.
3854899	3856520	I'll give them that.
3857501	3859422	Let's see what other stuff they're talking about here.
3860222	3863545	I'm surprised there was no God of War 3, but I guess they always have Heavenly Sword.
3863725	3865586	It's probably so far off in development.
3865867	3866547	Yeah, true.
3867908	3870690	So was Halo 3 when they first started cock-teasing us with it?
3871491	3871811	I don't know.
3872712	3873892	A new Rainbow Six game?
3875634	3878075	They're saying the successor to Rainbow Six Vegas?
3878656	3878696	No.
3881278	3881518	No.
3882915	3885677	I mean, the last game just came out, what, a few weeks ago?
3885837	3887778	I don't think they need to be teasing the new one yet.
3888679	3890901	Especially if it goes the way of Splinter Cell Conviction.
3890921	3892622	That was another thing out of the Microsoft conference.
3892702	3894403	It's exclusive to Xbox 360.
3895164	3895604	Uh-oh.
3896725	3898146	Um, Prince of Persia 4.
3899867	3905791	I don't really think we need a new Prince of Persia game since we have, like, kind of, uh, Assassin's Creed kind of fills that void there for a little bit.
3905911	3909093	We haven't needed a Prince of Persia game since, you know, what, 1994?
3909193	3909533	At all, ever.
3912339	3912699	I don't know.
3913120	3915161	The new ones are okay.
3915301	3916822	Peter Jackson's Halo.
3920631	3925632	Because they didn't have enough Halo content with the gift cards and the 360 and everything else.
3925992	3927293	And Final Fantasy XIII.
3927353	3929293	Well, they announced it wasn't going to be there anyways.
3929813	3931634	So, I don't know.
3931834	3932974	How about some other stuff?
3933014	3936115	How about, was it that new Rygar game that was supposed to be out there?
3936275	3937055	Why didn't they show that?
3937075	3937935	Because, I mean, that was pretty cool.
3937955	3939576	Where the fuck is Animal Crossing Wii?
3939816	3942356	Oh, actually, Rygar was Tecmo, and I don't believe Tecmo was there.
3942416	3943797	So, that's probably why that wasn't there.
3944797	3946017	Where the fuck is Animal Crossing on the Wii?
3946137	3947178	It's still being worked on.
3948278	3948998	Work faster!
3950774	3952575	Done by the guy apparently who did the Mii Channel.
3953175	3953395	Hmm.
3953415	3954596	Interesting.
3954616	3957057	How much do you want to bet there's no Mii support in the game whatsoever?
3957457	3958117	Oh, the irony.
3960399	3964020	Blackwolf would like to point out there were no console games for Squeenix.
3964080	3965761	It was all DS and PSP.
3966361	3967382	So nothing on the console.
3967402	3969883	Where the hell's that Final Fantasy game on the Wii then?
3970603	3973305	Wasn't there a Crystal Chronicles game coming out at launch?
3974025	3974525	Hello?
3974925	3975426	What happened?
3976206	3978427	Where's the Dragon Quest slashy slash game?
3978857	3980177	Who cares about Crystal Chronicles?
4003166	4004247	1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio
4030578	4031419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4057000	4062144	This year, the time waster was waiting in traffic to get to your next appointment or get to more games.
4063465	4069229	That's right, because last year we were in Santa Monica because of the whole, you know, all games arena thing that was going on.
4069530	4072071	And driving to E3 was a bitch every day.
4072412	4073072	Seriously.
4074333	4077456	Yeah, and I mean, the traffic around was really horrible.
4077896	4081959	You know, two miles from all the hotels and the show floor.
4082708	4085871	and there were no press rooms at the Barker Hangar.
4086211	4087592	So you couldn't get on the internet.
4087632	4089033	You couldn't report anything from there.
4089073	4096098	You had to go back to the Fairmont Hotel which was probably the farthest hotel away because that's where the press room was.
4096939	4108468	So if you were on a deadline like for the working press like newspapers and other internet sites had deadlines, they had to spend a lot of time going back and forth, back and forth just so they could do their work.
4108528	4108648	So
4109349	4113170	The ESA knows that the physical location was really the only downside.
4113210	4119292	I think if they consolidated it more and still only invited about 3,000 or 4,000 people, it'd still be a great show.
4119612	4122833	I mean, couldn't they just rent one small part of the LA Convention Center?
4123073	4126694	I have a hard time believing LA Convention Center is the only place in the area.
4126774	4129455	Couldn't they find another convention center in an LA suburb to do it in?
4130355	4132976	Or move it to Vegas, like I've heard suggested?
4133696	4136177	Well, Lawrence Young was telling me Long Beach Convention Center, maybe.
4137066	4139428	All I know is that you're going to have to bring us as your crew next year, Bobby.
4139448	4139528	Yeah.
4165529	4168191	That loophole will probably be very closed next year.
4168691	4169811	We shall see what happens.
4170072	4172313	Maybe they can open it up a little more in Vegas.
4172333	4172633	Who knows?
4173353	4174534	Really quickly, what were your thoughts?
4174554	4175715	You got to walk the show floor.
4176035	4177156	What impressed the hell out of you?
4177176	4178376	What disappointed the hell out of you?
4179517	4181858	What impressed me was Burnout Paradise.
4182459	4187141	In fact, on my show, Plug Plug, since it's not your five-year anniversary, I'm going to plug my show.
4187181	4187602	That's fine.
4187882	4188942	Everyone has a podcast.
4188982	4189943	You might as well say it.
4191438	4193379	I interviewed the producer for Burnout Paradise.
4193459	4202343	They're really doing some really interesting things with the online multiplayer, and they have added enough to the game itself that it's going to be a great game for communities to play.
4202383	4204163	It's going to be a great game to play online.
4204563	4206224	I'm really hyped for Burnout Paradise.
4206844	4208845	I was already hyped for Burnout before you said that.
4208885	4209725	Now I'm even more hyped.
4209745	4210146	That's great.
4210986	4214167	Yeah, they're doing seamless online multiplayer.
4214247	4215128	There's no lobby.
4215228	4218569	It's an open world, and people just drop in on the open world, and then the host says...
4219025	4219905	Hey, you want a race?
4220125	4220365	Yeah.
4220686	4221926	Okay, boom, and he starts the race.
4221986	4224047	It's like Test Drive Unlimited.
4224187	4224387	Right.
4225187	4225647	Rad.
4227788	4228808	Now, Rock Band.
4230069	4233830	Let's talk a little bit about Rock Band because I did get to play it.
4234050	4241913	I played it four times on the drums just to make sure that all my rants about the drum peripheral were founded or unfounded or whatever.
4243013	4245994	I still don't like the placement of the pads.
4247435	4248615	Everything else is fine.
4249389	4254772	and it does feel like you're playing a drum set except for the fact that your arms are in the wrong place.
4255733	4256073	Interesting.
4256093	4268901	Now, the thing is, I was the only one there who had a problem with the drum set because the harmonics people and the MTV people, which were extremely nice to me, they were very receptive to me, they're like, oh, you're a drummer.
4269181	4270962	Yeah, you like that drum peripheral, huh?
4271062	4272042	Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it?
4272062	4273123	And I go, not really.
4274164	4274584	What?
4276411	4276911	Good for you.
4277671	4279472	I talked to the marketing manager at EA.
4279512	4280893	I talked to a guy who works for MTV.
4280933	4284554	I talked to one of the Harmonix developers, and I said, you know, the pads are great.
4284894	4285795	The hardware is great.
4285815	4286835	The UI is fine.
4287115	4289136	The placement sucks of the pads.
4289176	4290516	I heard that they were adjustable, though.
4292297	4294078	Well, it's not just that.
4294178	4302901	It's the fact that the note chart has the hi-hat on the second drum from the left, and usually you have to cross your arms for that.
4303447	4309169	My biggest issue was the far right drum, which they used as the symbol a lot of times.
4309349	4311069	All the drums could change at any time.
4311389	4313110	They weren't really married to one thing.
4313570	4323172	But having to pull back on your arm instead of go forward, which is the natural motion of your arm, that took a while to get used to, and so I would overshoot the pad all the time.
4324473	4330294	And also, they have the Xbox guide button right in the center, and I hit it like three times bringing up the guide while playing.
4330855	4332175	Uh-oh, you pulled a Peter Moore.
4332785	4333806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4361587	4365011	and so finally one of the harmonics chicks was like, I'll sing Tom Sawyer, come on, let's go.
4365631	4367734	So it was fun.
4368414	4376483	I will still get it because I'm a whore for that stuff, but I still don't like the placement and I'm going to be very vocal about the placement of the pads.
4377584	4383891	Let me ask you real quick, I don't want to take up too much time, but since you were there, I do want to pick your brain on some of these things.
4385015	4390518	How did it compare to last year's E3, and how did it seem to be received by the audience as a whole?
4390818	4397001	Were people enjoying the fact that it was more of an exclusive event, or did people miss the glitz and glamour and the booth babes of yonder past?
4398281	4403683	Everybody I spoke to that attended E3 loved the new E3.
4405024	4408646	The people who didn't like E3, some of them had good reasons.
4408906	4413888	The more indie games scene, they didn't like it because they were shut out.
4414971	4422315	and they kind of used the lack of the booth babe, the lack of the glitz as part of it, but really it was about they couldn't be a part of it.
4422395	4424416	They were not invited to even exhibit.
4424456	4425976	The ESA wouldn't even let them there.
4427137	4431939	But everybody that was there loved the fact that you could have a conversation with people on the show floor.
4432280	4434100	You could walk up to anything and play it.
4435161	4440223	Square Enix might not have liked it because every time I walked by their set of kiosks, nobody was playing the games.
4441344	4441544	But
4442401	4447906	Other than that, everybody loved it except for the physical distance between things.
4448446	4450568	I missed a few appointments because I couldn't get there in time.
4450648	4453431	I did not get to see Fallout 3 because I was 20 minutes late because of traffic.
4453991	4455392	Question from Rob D in chat.
4455653	4458435	Ask Bobby if he thinks that E3 can stay alive this way.
4462499	4464881	I think it did its job.
4465861	4466202	It did.
4466696	4468296	It did its job admirably.
4468677	4474138	Whether the ESA will actually continue doing it in this way, that I don't know.
4474438	4476839	I don't know if they made enough money doing it this way or not.
4479880	4480420	Very interesting.
4480460	4484741	Anyone else have a question for Bobby who got to go there and actually be at E3?
4484981	4488142	I guess it was kind of bad that I didn't accept my invite.
4489963	4492103	You could have had a cameraman and a sound guy.
4494244	4494604	Damn it.
4496407	4498628	Loki's making pouty face at Jamie right now.
4499108	4500169	I wish we were a TV show.
4500509	4503470	However, I did get to sleep a lot, so that was good.
4504070	4504711	Not really, I had to work.
4504751	4513854	Yeah, and the day you all were at E3, I was on jury duty, so I had one of the website's mobile version on refresh on my cell phone to follow the press conferences.
4513894	4515215	It was sad and pathetic.
4515275	4516495	That was my E3.
4516756	4517556	I did that at work.
4518436	4519757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4538283	4545545	They'd only say that because it didn't have the glitz, it didn't have the glamour, and really, to be honest, like the press conferences, everybody surrendered.
4546005	4551606	Usually E3 is about who had the best press conference, and all of them said, we don't want the best press conference this year.
4552567	4555447	They're not going for that, and so that might be where a part of that came from.
4555927	4565810	But no, I mean, in terms of seeing things, getting things done, getting contacts, networking, all that stuff, this E3 was the best out of the 11 that I went to.
4566192	4569875	and I even said that on the Xbox Live Marketplace video that I'm apparently all over.
4570956	4578944	I was going to say, a perfect example of that would have been the Konami press conference where it's like, yeah, two DDRs, Silent Hill 5, go get your press kit.
4583799	4585461	Yeah, what's up with that, Bobby?
4585681	4595590	Like, now since there's less people at E3, you have a bigger chance of being a media whore, and Bobby, you really got some media whoring done this year.
4595930	4598713	I understand you're on a banner ad for, what, game trailers?
4599013	4599213	Yeah.
4599253	4601936	You show up in Xbox, what video in Xbox Live Marketplace are you on?
4602877	4629587	the on10.net E3 show floor wrap up video because I was with the TV channel that should be renamed Name Nameless and I was with All Games even before then I've known Laura Foy for many many years so when she saw me in the empty square on Wednesday she came over and asked me a few questions and apparently I get more air time than a frag doll on this thing but I was on that MTV Latin America made me sign a waiver because they filmed me playing Tom Sawyer on the drums huh
4630471	4638839	and then Hudson, their video crew, the same ones that made the Bomberman video that's on YouTube that says Act Zero sucked ass and we know it.
4639700	4642142	They came around and did something and it was really stupid.
4642242	4649649	If they used my thing, the question was, it was this chick and she goes, okay, here's the question, games or girls?
4650029	4653973	And I look at her because it's the most absurd question I've ever heard in my life
4654730	4655611	Act Zero, I'll Take Girls, For Sure
4685714	4688314	No, I think my response was games have pause buttons.
4692095	4694156	DarkSakura, care to rebuttal?
4695976	4697436	Yeah, I have something that involves a button.
4697716	4700157	Or even better, you just go, what, you're offering?
4700237	4700937	Heart, Bobby.
4702737	4706918	All right, well, Bobby, thanks so much for the call and for the perspective from someone who was actually there.
4707198	4713019	And congrats on, I'm sure, what was going to end up being a lot of exposure for you and your show and all that good stuff.
4713059	4713839	So congratulations.
4714468	4715068	Yeah, thank you.
4715468	4715788	Alright.
4716669	4717989	Until next time, my friend.
4718629	4718789	Yep.
4719009	4719469	Alright, later.
4720170	4720450	See ya.
4722110	4722610	Alright.
4723210	4723910	Very good call.
4724051	4725011	We always like hearing from Bobby.
4725051	4726211	More calls, please.
4726831	4727992	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4728012	4728432	Who is this?
4729212	4731072	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
4731112	4733513	This is a guy who's disappeared for far too long.
4734373	4736194	Ah, is this VXJasonXV?
4736834	4737894	That would be me.
4738134	4739235	Howdy, how are you?
4740335	4740915	I'm, uh...
4741514	4746217	I listen to the whole thing while I was working way too many damn hours at work
4763016	4771479	Uh, belated happy birthday to Orange Lounge Radio, belated happy birthday to you, Rob, and belated happy birthday to myself, because I am a whore for that kind of stuff.
4771739	4772819	Thank you, where's my present?
4773760	4774740	Um, I don't know, where's mine?
4774940	4775800	Alright, fair enough.
4777481	4781982	So, real reason, Ace Combat 6, holy cow.
4782482	4783783	Ah, here's the game we didn't talk about yet.
4785003	4786044	The, uh, yeah, no kidding.
4786504	4787044	The, um...
4788261	4802904	Last Monday I do believe it is I got a new monitor for my birthday and I have a nice little consolidation thing going on because it's my computer monitor for two different computers as well as my Xbox 360 screen and it does high definition.
4803504	4810426	So I'm finally running my 360 in 720p and a lot of things are looking a hell of a lot better than standard components.
4812797	4842289	and I finally managed to get a hold of the demo from the E3 category and I played it and holy cow that game looks beautiful I don't know if it's satellite imagery high resolution satellite imagery or low level aircraft imagery of the landscapes but oh man they're doing a beautiful job with that that game was so fun just to look at and it played so well still I've loved that series ever since Air Combat on the Playstation
4843594	4850398	I don't like simulations like Flight Simulator.
4850658	4859423	I love arcade-style games, and Air Combat and Ace Combat have always been that, and they are doing a good job continuing the series.
4859803	4860243	Yeah.
4862084	4863665	Not as free.
4863805	4868708	It's kind of teetering towards the more realistic flying, but still arcade dogfighting.
4869224	4869724	It's fun.
4870145	4871465	I don't have anything else to say.
4871485	4873426	I am buying that game the day it comes out.
4873907	4874487	Yeah, shame on you guys.
4874507	4874587	Yeah.
4874607	4875047	Uh, I don't know.
4875067	4876188	I watched a couple of the trailers, uh,
4895578	4899380	Skate looks pretty boring, but I think that goes back to the whole simulation versus arcade thing.
4899400	4905523	The project, Prove Yourself, crap, Tony Hawk game.
4906763	4907784	Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.
4908344	4909585	Proving Ground, thank you.
4910105	4910925	Mixing all those words up.
4912106	4920770	Proving Ground seems to be going right down the same path, again, expanding on a few more elements, and it looks like it's a very true-to-form continuation of the series.
4922058	4922919	What else did I look at?
4923099	4931142	Beautiful Katamari told me absolutely nothing new, but I don't know yet whether I'm going to like it if it's the same thing all over again or not.
4931602	4940706	The music was kind of... I don't know how to describe it, but the music is kind of making me teeter on the side that I might not be caring for that game too much.
4943647	4946868	Bomberman Live... Oh man, I haven't played a Bomberman game in forever.
4948130	4962775	The trailers and all of the media that Microsoft posted was really fun to look at and hopefully the rest of the year and into the first half of the next year when all this stuff is going to really all be coming out is going to not be too much of a drain on my banking account.
4964456	4971878	Jason, I know you've been a music game fan for a long time obviously because you've been with OLR for a long time and Actdeft brings up a very interesting question in chat.
4971958	4973499	I wonder if Jason will talk about Rock Band.
4973519	4974459	What do you think about Rock Band?
4975800	4975820	I...
4977068	4981689	We went over this over a little bit in the forums, so all you people who aren't a part, go read.
4981989	4983790	It's always great to do that in between shows.
4987891	4993372	The aesthetics of cramming everything in for multiple person play seems to be really, really off.
4993892	4998973	The lyrics are probably going to be the most underused portion of that game, and for good reason.
4999033	5003054	Less people sing than sit there and play a guitar or a drum or anything else.
5004394	5005975	I don't really know too much about the drum.
5006196	5007917	Four versus five is kind of funny.
5008237	5010659	Guitar Hero goes five while Guitar Freaks is three.
5011839	5015062	The drum peripheral is going to be four while Drum Mania was five.
5017783	5019705	I've never liked console Drum Mania.
5019885	5025088	I'll play it because I like Drum Mania in general, but I've played the arcade version of MGL.
5025209	5027310	The console version wasn't very faithful.
5027350	5030212	I don't like cramming my arms that close together.
5030632	5033094	What Bobby was saying was just kind of driving that point home again.
5037063	5061003	bass I don't know I don't think I've got enough hands on with it on guitar here too but the vocals are going to be the lowest point other than that I'm still recognizing a couple of the songs which makes me happy enough that I'll actually have something to play and it looks like it's going to be fun you know for a game that's changing companies it looks like it's still going down a very good path for the general makeup and play of the game and fun is really what it's all about right?
5061023	5063965	hell yeah good music good game all right
5064281	5067784	Well, Jason, we've got to let you go to get probably about one more call in here, but thanks so much for the call.
5067824	5068584	We appreciate it, okay?
5069285	5069445	Yep.
5069685	5070346	All right, take care, buddy.
5070926	5071286	See you, guys.
5071567	5071827	Bye.
5073428	5075489	All right, we always appreciate Jason when he gives us a call.
5075770	5076951	We'll do about one more call.
5076971	5082295	I know we've got a lot of people trying to get through tonight, but we also want to wrap up pretty soon here, so let's do at least one more call.
5082835	5084136	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
5084156	5084496	Who's this?
5085877	5086478	It's GS68.
5086638	5087398	Hi, GS68.
5087418	5087839	What's on your mind?
5089180	5089240	Um...
5090749	5096533	Basically, I read about Ghost Squad coming out for the Wii, and that just reminded me about the arcade version.
5097754	5099595	I'm sorry, you heard about what coming out for the Wii?
5100335	5101616	Ghost Squad for the Wii.
5101876	5102276	Oh, okay.
5103457	5117246	And one thing that's always bugged me about the arcade version is that, like, I went to the Philippines, and most of the Ghost Squad machines there have card slots, but, like, here in California, like, none of the machines have card slots, so I
5118226	5126189	I can only, like, go up to level 4 on the missions and only get... And I don't get a whole lot of stuff as much as on the card slots and machines.
5127329	5136192	And, like... I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit there, so I'm sorry, what was the question out of that?
5137732	5144975	Uh, like, yeah, like... One thing that's bugged me about that game, the arcade game, is that... Like, in the US, the...
5145990	5148571	Like, almost none of the machines in the U.S.
5148611	5155852	have car slots, but if I go to any other country with that game, like, the machines usually have car slots.
5155872	5175216	Like, I went to the Philippines earlier this year, and most of their machines there had car slots, which is nice, because, like, I get to have, like, more levels and features and stuff, and I just don't wonder why they don't, like, for games like that and the
5177219	5180105	Why... Like, why don't...
5182996	5196283	I think if you're talking about as far as the arcade scene goes and why is it that they have the cards in some places and not in others, I think it just has to do with the arcade scene in general here.
5196303	5199305	I don't think there's enough of a scene to support that type of technology here.
5199665	5205988	And obviously Konami and DDR is one thing that comes to my mind like that and everything they're doing with EMUs overseas and things.
5206008	5208830	I think it's just that Japanese has more of an arcade culture now
5209250	5213574	Yeah, I look at Asian arcades and they have a lot of cool stuff like... There are pachinko places in the US, by the way.
5213594	5213754	I agree.
5213794	5213934	Yeah.
5234124	5234324	All right.
5234564	5237307	Well, hey, anything you want to share about your thoughts with E3?
5237587	5239328	Was there anything that really got you excited at E3?
5239348	5240069	I didn't really catch.
5240489	5242511	I wasn't really caught up with E3.
5242551	5243652	I didn't read much about it.
5244873	5247375	Well, hopefully you learned stuff here tonight by listening to the show.
5248656	5249837	I hope we could educate some folks.
5250277	5250518	All right.
5250558	5252539	Well, hey, thanks so much for the call, GS60.
5252579	5253560	We really appreciate it, okay?
5254501	5254961	You're welcome.
5255382	5255602	All right.
5255622	5256042	Take care, buddy.
5256643	5257003	You too.
5258024	5258384	All right.
5259136	5287539	I think that's going to about do it because we're running almost an hour 40 for this segment so we really need to switch back over and wrap things up so I'm sorry to those calls we didn't get to tonight but we'll also take more calls next week I'm sure we always do so we're going to go around now and ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio any last minute stories I have a couple actually go for it this is more European news coming to Xbox Live Arcade there was Bomberman and Yaya Kung Fu on the 18th it'll be out July
5289779	5297200	Also, the fifth Harry Potter game demo is on Xbox Live Arcade in the UK.
5298481	5299901	Just for the record, it is out here as well.
5301261	5308222	Alright, but it's actually supposed to take up 2.55% of the 20 gig hard drive.
5308802	5309142	Yay.
5310083	5312803	And the Lost Planet PC is getting Mega Man.
5314183	5315744	That's kind of neat.
5315964	5317564	A Mega Man patch for Lost Planet PC.
5318510	5319671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5350231	5353454	Anyway, if that's it, then Loki, anything you want to share?
5354135	5355356	Yeah, there's some interesting stuff.
5355776	5363603	IGN just did their Week in Review podcast, I guess, and one of the things that they mentioned is Rock Band coming to the Wii in 2008.
5363643	5366406	So that's interesting.
5367166	5372171	Another interesting thing caught in, I guess, a trailer for Smash Bros.
5372231	5375154	Brawl is, I guess, Bulbin from...
5376101	5383083	The Zelda series is going to be either a assist trophy character or a playable character.
5384603	5385023	Who's this?
5385324	5385644	I'm sorry?
5385924	5386324	Bulbin.
5386404	5391865	It's like one of those... I don't know if they're elves or what.
5391985	5393626	Some sort of enemy from the game.
5395406	5397887	Anywho, other interesting things...
5399062	5401844	Simple Series, one of my favorite things to talk about.
5402404	5403565	D3's lineup there.
5404086	5408249	They're releasing their first two volumes on the Wii.
5408329	5411531	Volume 1 looks like a kart racing game, I guess.
5412152	5415694	And the other one looks like a frog jumping game.
5416114	5417435	So that's kind of interesting.
5418436	5421358	Hopefully those make their way out over here at some point.
5422079	5423560	Of course, one thing we can't forget.
5424040	5426282	I know my wife might be looking forward to this.
5427212	5435619	Nitro Bike was announced for the Wii by Ubisoft, and it's being developed by Leftfield Productions, the creators of the classic Excitebike 64.
5435999	5440963	And it's kind of like, I guess, Excite Truck, but with bikes.
5441064	5442485	So, Excitebike.
5445167	5446488	Some other interesting things.
5447729	5451712	One game we've talked about here before, 2 Mickey Fighters.
5453194	5453754	and DarkSakura.com
5482153	5482713	and DarkSakura.com.
5509446	5514092	As we get into, because, you know, now E3 was in July and not May, so there's a little less time before the fall rush.
5514492	5516174	So I'll be looking forward to sharing that all with you.
5516194	5520159	And speaking of the fall, you know, we hit our 250th episode this fall, if you can believe that.
5521027	5528213	Lots of fun stuff in store, but we're not going to do anything special for it because, you know, we did the 200th show last year and the 5th year anniversary of this show.
5528493	5531856	We don't want to celebrate ourselves too much, but it certainly is a milestone that's interesting.
5531936	5533637	Every day is a celebration.
5534478	5538881	Every day is a new celebration of life.
5539542	5542764	So, Loki, I noticed Loki's watching the Silent Hill Arcade videos on YouTube.
5542804	5543244	It looks nice.
5543485	5544145	Doesn't it look hot?
5544185	5545386	Did you see the pyramid head thing?
5545406	5546367	Uh...
5547708	5549789	Watch the beginning of Part B. It's awesome.
5549869	5552229	Yeah, I'm watching the beginning of Part 2 right now.
5552309	5553549	Oh, it's in there then.
5553569	5554010	You'll see it.
5554490	5554670	See?
5555050	5556310	Pyramid Head goes, Slice.
5556630	5557450	You're gonna die.
5559731	5560831	And then he goes, Slice.
5560891	5565892	And then right when it's about to hit the guy's head, it switches back to the day.
5566172	5567052	Or whatever you want to call it.
5567072	5569493	I thought you said you weren't spoiling it for our listeners.
5569553	5570113	Sorry, I did.
5571428	5572388	Robbie Meany, bud.
5572408	5573349	You need to watch it.
5573389	5574249	I didn't spoil anything.
5574309	5575609	It's on IGN.
5575649	5576190	I'll watch it.
5576450	5577950	It would be cool, though, if they brought it to the Wii.
5578130	5581011	I mean, it looks like these gun games are going to be taken off.
5583172	5585132	Dan and I had an idea a while back.
5585333	5586173	Point blank Wii.
5586553	5590214	Hey, you remember the Biohazard Gun Survivor, right?
5590714	5594035	And we got it over here as Resident Evil Gun Survivor and they took out the gun support.
5594876	5596036	You had to play it with a controller.
5596636	5599237	We were thinking back in the day how would the Dreamcast...
5599775	5604299	You remember the Dreamcast gun had a controller on it, right?
5605059	5605319	Mm-hmm.
5606680	5610624	Couldn't they do something like that with the Wii?
5611284	5616148	Use the controller on it to do your motion, move back and forth, and then shoot with the gun?
5616168	5617429	They could easily do those games.
5620551	5622313	I mean, it's kind of the way they did it.
5622373	5626296	Resident Evil 2 Arcade, you used your actual gun as your direction.
5626316	5626396	Yeah.
5627017	5645645	that was kind of cool too and then you got to shoot people dead here's one other game that came out of E3 I didn't hear any other news on but there's a new Trauma Center game that's going to come out for the Wii and this one actually supports widescreen and looks pretty and has new characters I'm very excited about a new Trauma Center game for the Wii because Trauma Center is awesome alright, what are you laughing about?
5645825	5655369	they should have a game they should have like a game for Silent Hill Konami, hear me out on this I think you've got a hit with this
5656280	5662622	You know how these sim games and stuff like, you know, pets and dogs and cats and stuff's all really popular?
5662662	5669163	They should have a Pyramid Head game where you just, you know, you take care of Pyramid Head or you are Pyramid Head and you feed him corpses.
5669183	5676565	You feed him corpses and you can, you know, feed him, let him rape stuff, you know, and you can slice people with the blade.
5676805	5680186	Sometimes I think we take our Pyramid Head love a little bit too far on this program.
5680206	5681106	I don't know if it's just me.
5682046	5684227	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5684647	5685887	Loki, go ahead and start us off tonight.
5687970	5692993	My final thought is there's going to be more announcements coming out.
5693173	5695095	Not everything gets announced at E3.
5696095	5699117	God's sake, most people nowadays have their own gamer days and shit.
5701118	5704501	My final thought is I twisted my ankle earlier and it kind of hurts.
5704741	5704981	Owie.
5705621	5707303	I know I need to.
5708603	5710465	DarkSakura?
5711065	5712186	Reject false conventions.
