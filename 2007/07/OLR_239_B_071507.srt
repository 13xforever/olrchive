[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:26,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here live on this Sunday evening, July the 15th of 2007.

3
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:28,849
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going through the E3 wrap-up, of course.

4
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:36,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know you guys have probably been reading about it on the various blogs, but maybe there's some things that we caught that maybe slipped off your radars, off the cracks.

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, we didn't get to go to E3 this year, so we're just kind of like a lot of you guys on the outside looking in.

6
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're kind of collecting our thoughts.

7
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: What do the people who weren't there think about it?

8
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:49,333
[SPEAKER_05]: What do the gaming fans who didn't get to go to E3 this year really think about it?

9
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:50,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, hey, it's our money.

10
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:50,693
[SPEAKER_05]: We're spending it.

11
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,214
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:30,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be 33% lighter, 19% slimmer, has a longer battery life, and is also going to be having a video out on it as well, which is kind of cool.

13
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be retailing for $169.99, so the same price as the normal PSP now, and we'll eventually replace those as well.

14
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:42,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be loaded with the 3.6 firmware, so...

15
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,942
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:14,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron

17
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:44,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Out does sound pretty cool, and I know a lot of people kind of wrote it off, like, whoop-dee-doo, Video Out, you know, who cares?

18
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:55,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it does make those UMDs at least a little more usable, that you can have them on your TV, but also, just getting to play, you know, some of these games, like the Final Fantasy remake and stuff, like, on my big TV!

19
00:02:55,135 --> 00:03:03,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about it, if you're looking at, you know, possibly just using this as, like, even, you know, portable and standalone video player at home,

20
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:41,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm kind of excited about the Video Out, but the problem is I already own a PSP, so I don't really want to buy a whole new one just for Video Out.

22
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't on the first, but I guess this is how they get you to buy another one.

23
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:47,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

24
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:51,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Video Out uses the serial port that's on the bottom of the PSP.

25
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, this one's redesigned.

26
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that's actually the case, but they're saying it's redesigned.

27
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:05,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's possible with this new firmware update 3.6 that maybe with the current ones you can do that.

28
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Please let that be the case.

29
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:16,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be too surprising if they don't mention that until later on, much like certain other stories we'll get into later where they don't mention certain aspects of things.

30
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:17,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

31
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:21,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think you'll pick up a PSP redesign?

32
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I will just because I have two of them right now and I want to sell one of them or at least get rid of it because I have no use for it right now and that would be a good excuse to buy one of those because it wouldn't really cost me much the other thing though about it though this is kind of a trend you'll see at the Sony press conference something that they've been denying and denying yet people are saying it's going to be happening we've heard rumors and lo and behold it's true kind of a trend that's going along with it

33
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see as we continue throughout the press conference stories here.

34
00:04:53,168 --> 00:05:00,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is something that I... I have to say that I actually expected this.

35
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:18,360
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with all of the rumors going around about exclusive game this and exclusive game that, I honestly, this is what I expected, is that Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be exclusive to the PS3.

36
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:20,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Reaffirmed.

37
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:21,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Not buying it.

38
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Not buying it, and this is why.

39
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it may be a PSA exclusive when it comes out.

40
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:40,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not doubt that it's going to come to the 360 eventually, because it would be dumb for them to ignore the entire Xbox 360 user base.

41
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not because they're playing sides or anything, it's just about money.

42
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: and they want to sell as many copies of this as possible.

43
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if we see a release on the Xbox 360 maybe later on.

44
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:53,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be surprised.

45
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:54,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

46
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:57,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to happen.

47
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to stay on PS3.

48
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it really all depends on sales.

49
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:11,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm not, I can totally see how it could happen where like, kind of like how the first Metal Gear, no, one of the Metal Gears ended up coming out for GameCube later on.

50
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,875
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I think it was the first Metal Gear was redone.

51
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

52
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:42,692
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know I could see something like that happening and this seems to happen a lot with the Metal Gear series where it shows up on the Sony platform first and then kind of mutates into a special edition thing that comes out on Xbox or whatever later on but like a year later I could see something like that happening if the sales aren't strong enough on its own so it's really going to depend but I mean that a year is such a long wait that you know it's it's not going to have a huge impact as far as the fanboys are concerned I don't know

53
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:51,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what you can count on, you can count on them not announcing another platform until well after the game is out.

54
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:54,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is something that will be a given.

55
00:06:55,024 --> 00:07:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless, for whatever reason, that Sony has a really shitty fourth quarter, and they don't sell that many units or whatever, and...

56
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:14,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking, Konami kind of does this.

57
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:18,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's not only done this with the Metal Gear series, but Silent Hill as well.

58
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Silent Hill 2 was out on the PlayStation 2 first, then the WrestleStreams came out on Xbox, you know.

59
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Little things like that happen.

60
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstunt says,

61
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:35,663
[SPEAKER_05]: until the PlayStation 3 version comes out, just like the standard six-month delay like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Virtua Fighter 5.

62
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

63
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

64
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:44,310
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for them that they do have this, because at least this is something, hey, maybe this will sell a few systems for them.

65
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,452
[SPEAKER_06]: They need all they can take.

66
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,835
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see where that leads.

67
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:54,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But nevertheless, the Xbox 360 folks who were convinced it was coming to their platform...

68
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a little bit of a setback.

69
00:07:56,922 --> 00:08:01,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I suppose hope is never lost, but hope has been diminished quite a bit.

70
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:05,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of exclusives, another exclusive that was announced for the PlayStation 3 is Unreal Tournament 3.

71
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it was only affirmed as a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 3, but that does mean if you're a Sony fan and you got your PlayStation,

72
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,377
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get it first on the PlayStation 3.

73
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:18,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as far as the time thing, I could care less.

74
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is the much cooler part about it, is that you're going to be able to use mods on the PlayStation 3 and the PC version.

75
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the PC version will come out a little later, but that's kind of cool for the modding community, of which a game like Unreal gets a lot of this stuff, is that the mods you make for PC you're going to be able to use on PS3 as well.

76
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:36,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

77
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:42,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying everything from weapon mods to total conversions for it are going to be available.

78
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:47,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's tons of extra content for it, which is awesome.

79
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:50,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we need Duke Nukem 3D with mods and stuff.

80
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool too.

81
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,047
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see.

82
00:08:53,607 --> 00:09:00,311
[SPEAKER_06]: What's pretty interesting about the whole Unreal Tournament 3 thing is as of May, it was actually going to be exclusive to the 360.

83
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of flip-flopped there.

84
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:05,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing what money can do.

85
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:17,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Something very interesting, probably a little bit surprising, would be that NCSoft has actually pledged support for the PlayStation 3 platform and are going to be releasing exclusive PlayStation 3 online games.

86
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So, not sure if they're actually going to be bringing their current titles over, like Lineage, Guild Wars, City of Heroes, and stuff like that, but they will be making at least some of their current IPs and new IPs available for the platform.

87
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:39,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting on those online games that they were talking about at E3 the year before.

88
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that maybe some of those are being now ported to PlayStation 3?

89
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:04,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why they weren't all that big graphic monsters.

90
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if they did all of them at once.

91
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think their whole intention was having a big service available to people just to come in and play.

92
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I want to see.

93
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we might see Guild Wars 2 on the PlayStation 3?

94
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:19,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope not.

95
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.

96
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate MMOs on consoles.

97
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:50,309
[SPEAKER_06]: MMOs should stick to freaking PCs unless they are specifically made for a console I disagree on Guild Wars because I believe since the whole format of Guild Wars is you buy the game and you go online for free that really works for a console because then you don't have to pay those monthly fees and stuff and then maybe a little bit more casual and later on when they offer their expansions or whatever you can download those as a microtransaction or whatever

98
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:53,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That would actually work very well for consoles.

99
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas an MMO like Final Fantasy XI or something, not as good as normal.

100
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:02,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting points.

101
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see what ends up happening.

102
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:17,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as far as other stuff, for people who wanted the 60GB PS3, get it while you can because we're not going to be getting any more.

103
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, let's cut the price and then get rid of them.

104
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:22,452
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:54,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite what they say, it was unavailable to buy after about December.

106
00:11:55,286 --> 00:12:08,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, you know, they give you the impression that, you know, oh, well, you really want that 20 gig one, but, you know, you can't find it and you really, really want the system, so you're going to spend the extra $100 on it because you get this free game now and all that stuff.

107
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:11,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know, I'm not surprised.

108
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what sucks for our friends in Europe is that they're not getting a price cut.

109
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:18,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, what they're getting is a bundle with...

110
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:27,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Some first party titles and another six axis controller for 115 pounds.

111
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Which in my mind just reaffirms why Sony's doing this.

112
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:35,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not so much about, you know, oh, we're going to give the U.S.

113
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:35,905
[SPEAKER_05]: a price cut.

114
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:38,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about, oh, we need to stop losing so much money on the systems.

115
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to give the U.S.

116
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,692
[SPEAKER_05]: the system we've been putting out in Europe that costs us less to make.

117
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:54,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they'll be getting a choice to pick from Resistance, Fall of Man, Motorstorm, Genji, Days of the Blade, Formula 1, Championship Edition, Ridge Racer 7, two of those plus the two 6-axis controllers.

118
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:55,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll be available.

119
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:04,715
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually due on sale on the 18th of July for the UK and starting in Europe on the 1st of August.

120
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:17,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want to get a PlayStation 3 and emulation is of a concern to you, maybe you don't have a PlayStation 2 or a PlayStation 1, this would probably be the time to get it.

121
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, if there's one positive thing you could say about this is that it does give you the chance to snatch up that system while you still can.

122
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Be sure to read the labels carefully.

123
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,821
[SPEAKER_05]: The new systems will show you.

124
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a little warning about the emulation on the new box that says not all games are actually playable.

125
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it wouldn't be fair to...

126
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:41,456
[SPEAKER_05]: mention this and then not mention, well, you know, the Xbox 360 uses software emulation as well.

127
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:45,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So to rag Sony for cutting back on the emulation may be a little bit unfair.

128
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:46,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

129
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:47,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But however, I don't know.

130
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:51,858
[SPEAKER_05]: You do still feel like this sense of loss with this whole little switch going on.

131
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:57,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that they're, you know, maybe I don't want to dig out my PlayStation 2 when I'm going to go through all this to hook up my PlayStation 3.

132
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

133
00:13:59,720 --> 00:13:59,940
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

134
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow.

135
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

136
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:21,949
[SPEAKER_05]: and what's very interesting about Echo Chrome is that the graphics are very simplistic.

137
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:35,924
[SPEAKER_05]: They're black and white MC Escher style drawings and what's kind of cool, I watched a video of this game in motion, is that the way you rotate the screen around will affect the way the painting looks, thusly affecting the little runner that runs around the painting.

138
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:36,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's little holes

139
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:43,207
[SPEAKER_05]: and little launch pads and little gaps that as you rotate the screen become filled because of your perspective.

140
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:46,008
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very interesting type of thing for a puzzle game.

141
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:53,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly not going to push the envelope as far as next-gen graphics are concerned, but the graphics are crisp according to folks that have seen it.

142
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

143
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:18,895
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:48,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, it's supposed to make web browsing a little bit easier and be able to load some of the larger pages out there and stuff.

145
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Other things they were showing off, Gran Turismo 5.

146
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:58,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be coming out, of course, next year at some point.

147
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:03,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be releasing a Gran Turismo 5 prologue to the PlayStation Network.

148
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:06,318
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be kind of just like Gran Turismo HD.

149
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,860
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of a demo taste of it, as you will.

150
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:14,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they were showing home and some of the improvements done to that.

151
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,891
[SPEAKER_06]: They've redesigned the whole kind of lobby system for it.

152
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks almost like an outdoor mall.

153
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:23,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, you'll be able to jump into multiplayer games with people as well.

154
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:26,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

155
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:32,082
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much, I think, the big stuff they were kind of showing off on their network.

156
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:42,696
[SPEAKER_06]: My only gripe with them, remember last week how we were talking about, oh yeah, they're going to be bringing demos and videos to the PlayStation Network.

157
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be just like the Xbox Live thing.

158
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,539
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be bringing it home and stuff.

159
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:48,401
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they didn't.

160
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,782
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought videos.

161
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, because I can watch those all over the internet and stuff.

162
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a single demo.

163
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf has asked why you're not mentioning Chewbacca.

164
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:06,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Chewbacca announced the PSP redesign thing with Darth Vader.

165
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

166
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,530
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that guy's still getting work.

167
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:17,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing we've done before for all of the other three conferences.

168
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:19,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatroom, I ask for your opinion as well.

169
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,979
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of the Sony press conference?

170
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Rate it on a scale.

171
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me what you thought.

172
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants to go first?

173
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: You all right, DarkSakura, with that resounding yawn?

174
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:29,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your summary?

175
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

176
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:33,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Short and sweet, Loki.

177
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:40,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I think their whole theme of promises, promises, and not following through has kind of shown through again this year.

178
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:48,207
[SPEAKER_06]: The price cut, they made it look like a price cut, but it's actually not a price cut, which is fucked up.

179
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:53,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention some other stuff we'll get into a little bit later on that's also fucked up, especially if you buy a system now.

180
00:17:55,655 --> 00:18:00,778
[SPEAKER_06]: and just this whole oh look at all these games that are coming out and not mentioning oh by the way they're not coming out until next year.

181
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to give them props on Killzone 2 though.

182
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks fucking amazing.

183
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is about the only thing.

184
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for satisfying a chat comment before I read it.

185
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw was just complaining we forgot to mention the new Killzone 2 trailer.

186
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't forget to mention it.

187
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mention it on purpose.

188
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks really good and it's actually it's a game I want to buy now because it looks kind of like Resistance a bit.

189
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Resistance with a little bit of Gears of War thrown in there.

190
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:25,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And

191
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:26,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's pretty awesome.

192
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:28,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It impressed me a lot more than Halo 3 did.

193
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, props to them for that.

194
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,388
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem is, it's not coming out this year.

195
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:41,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So, once again, you're showing me shit that, you know, I'm not going to buy your PlayStation 3 for these games that are coming out next year.

196
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:48,037
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I wouldn't be buying it if I didn't have one right now this holiday season, which is really where it's going to count for you guys.

197
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be buying it when it comes out, you know, actually in the summer of next year or whatever.

198
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't do them any good for this holiday.

199
00:18:56,304 --> 00:19:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, if they don't come out with something amazing, they're going to lose out on another holiday.

200
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:02,930
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really going to hurt them.

201
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,275
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I really care about coming out of there is, of course, Silent Hill 5, and I really want Metal Gear Solid 4.

202
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as my thoughts on Sony's press conference, I said before last week that Nintendo had the most to lose going into E3, and Sony had the most to gain.

203
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:21,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a new Civ game?

204
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's also coming on Xbox 360, though.

205
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the trailer, and I'm pretty excited about that.

206
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,390
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's different.

207
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Sony did a way better job than they did last year.

208
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:43,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they certainly changed the tone of their press conference and had it a little well-oiled and got the kinks a little better worked out this year.

209
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,923
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still walked away from it being more excited about the PSP than the PlayStation 3.

210
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:51,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that's a good sign.

211
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: and this whole bait and switch leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.

212
00:19:54,477 --> 00:20:01,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the problem, last year, remember last year, it was all, oh, Gran Turismo 5, it's going to be like Gran Turismo HD and stuff, but better and all this stuff.

213
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:03,885
[SPEAKER_06]: No Gran Turismo 5 this year.

214
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:08,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this, you know, the E3, ooh, Gran Turismo 5, it's so awesome and stuff.

215
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:20,679
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it does look really good, but Project Gotham 4 also looks really good, and if this game is going to take, you know, until Summer 08 to come out...

216
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:25,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have Project Gotham Racing 5, which is going to look even more amazing.

217
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:31,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, it's all this promising of really good games that are coming out way later.

218
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:33,351
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.

219
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:37,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like Microsoft where it's like, here's these great games, they're coming out this fall.

220
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:41,353
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, get excited for them because they're right around the corner.

221
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:44,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, this stuff's coming way later on.

222
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.

223
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like I'll have a lot more to get excited about with the PlayStation 3 at next year's E3.

224
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:54,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Or hopefully Final Fantasy XIII is there.

225
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it going to be too late?

226
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:56,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

227
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Or remember, they're showing LittleBigPlanet, that's next year.

228
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:03,043
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking about Home, which I hope that's this year.

229
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, yeah, I don't know.

230
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:09,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's just disappointing.

231
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:10,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

232
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:14,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of me on a scale of 1 to 10 wants to give Sony a question mark.

233
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:14,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know.

234
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:18,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Their press conference looks like the town of Silent Hill.

235
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,119
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too much haze around everything for me.

236
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:30,062
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will reward them for their PSP redesign even though they're taking the old ones away or whatever is supposed to be happening.

237
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:32,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I give that

238
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:39,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Good points, but the PlayStation 3, although some games look cool, I'm not completely blown away.

239
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:39,953
[SPEAKER_05]: But I give them credit.

240
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I give them the most improved player award.

241
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:44,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I would give their conference a 6.

242
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Explain this to me.

243
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:52,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should I get a PS3 with a larger hard drive when there's nothing to download for it?

244
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,922
[SPEAKER_06]: There's trailers for movies.

245
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,903
[SPEAKER_06]: There's trailers for games.

246
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,565
[SPEAKER_06]: There's literally less than 10 demos online.

247
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:05,168
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's a handful of, you know, PlayStation download titles.

248
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:17,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So, am I buying this larger hard drive system for, you know, so I can dump some of my game's stuff to the hard drive so it can cache the system and make it run faster since the Blu-ray drive's too slow?

249
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:23,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's... They haven't really shown me why we need to buy a system with a larger hard drive in the first place.

250
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really pushing... Trust me, hard drive space is not what's holding people back from buying your system.

251
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:38,113
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says, going to chat room, all three companies pretty much surrendered the press conferences.

252
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:40,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Floridine says, Sony fails 3.

253
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, I liked everything I saw except the new Ratchet and Clank, which should just be released on PlayStation 2 if it's not already.

254
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,739
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, Sony, they showed everyone what they wanted.

255
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Games, Killzone 2, Unreal 3, etc.

256
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,941
[SPEAKER_05]: They showed that the PlayStation 3 has real future.

257
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:58,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Solid B plus, A minus.

258
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:00,591
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

259
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give them credit for this.

260
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:05,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, actually, maybe I'll bump up my score to a 7 for this sole reason.

261
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:07,617
[SPEAKER_05]: The Eye of Judgment was nowhere to be seen.

262
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:11,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will bump up Sony's score to 7 for scrapping that piece of shit.

263
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,963
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed it on the show floor, so that was there.

264
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:15,784
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're grading the conference.

265
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:17,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll give them the bonus point.

266
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give them the same as I gave Nintendo a 6.

267
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And just because it's promises.

268
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:25,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's going to be...

269
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the disappointments were with the whole... Blackwell says Eye of Judgment was not on the floor.

270
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:34,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I saw a video of it, so I know that it was there.

271
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe behind a door that Bobby didn't look behind.

272
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:38,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was there.

273
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:41,888
[SPEAKER_06]: They were showing it.

274
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:48,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a whole line of disappointments with Sony.

275
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,935
[SPEAKER_06]: As we go through the fourth quarter, it's just going to be disappointment after disappointment.

276
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:54,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

277
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:58,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation 3 is really set to go the same way as the PSP.

278
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to get really, really cool until like three years later.

279
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, unfortunately.

280
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:03,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Or two or three years later.

281
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting.

282
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:06,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

283
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,369
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says it might have been in their invite-only hotel suite.

284
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,171
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted to ask about the copying of cards just for you, about going to Kinko's and making your own cards.

285
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's their reasoning behind it.

286
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:20,412
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying...

287
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,522
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically didn't give a reason.

288
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:31,287
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no copy protection on the cards, but their thing was it would be like playing Magic the Gathering with someone with photocopied cards.

289
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:33,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'd really play someone with photocopied cards.

290
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:35,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That was their reasoning behind it.

291
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:44,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, yes, you can copy the cards or download images off the internet instead of buying booster packs and whatnot and copying the card stock and it'll work just fine.

292
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,856
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD asks, The PSP is really, really cool?

293
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I might buy a PSP for the emulation.

294
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, maybe less of the really, really.

295
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:53,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the PSP...

296
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,036
[SPEAKER_05]: is never been solely a gaming system.

297
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:01,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I do respect the system for everything else it can do, like being kind of a little mini media kit.

298
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:07,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff that have come out for it in the past year.

299
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they can't be ignored.

300
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you notice, though, that they're kind of making the PSP out now to be almost like more of an iPod or a Zune or something?

301
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now it has a video out thing on it.

302
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:19,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be able to charge it using the USB cable on there as well.

303
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:22,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're on the go, you can charge it and stuff.

304
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:51,720
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course memory stick prices are coming down quite a bit so I don't know it's interesting and the problem is though their PR department is so horrible so horrible and they really their upper management needs to shut the hell up it's not helping them and I know Ken Kutaragi's gone now because he was making dumb statements before but my god Kazurai is not any better it

305
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:53,549
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not any better with him.

306
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, there you have it.

307
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Our thoughts on the Sony press conference.

308
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:04,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go now to some more listener feedback via the email bag, because we love to get emails.

309
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:09,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you weren't in our chat room tonight and you want to give your two cents to the press conferences or anything you saw at E3...

310
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:18,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us an email, mailbag at orangelauntradio.com, because DarkSakura opens up the mailbag every week and reads a few of her favorite pieces of email here with us.

311
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura?

312
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: He, he, he, Captain Crayola.

313
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump in the mailbag and pull something out for us, will you?

314
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:29,875
[SPEAKER_08]: First email.

315
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:31,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, OLR crew.

316
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess this is where I should say I'm a long-time listener but a first-time emailer.

317
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I first heard about your show from Bobby Blackwolf.

318
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:42,178
[SPEAKER_08]: He's an old friend of mine from the days when we were moderators on the forums for a TV channel, but are left unmentioned.

319
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And have been listening to the podcast on and off for about a year.

320
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:53,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I always find the show enjoyable, and you've become one of my mainstays for relatively unbiased or biased in a way that matches my own opinions at Gaming News.

321
00:26:54,488 --> 00:27:00,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently, I listened to the podcast of your five-year plus-one episode, and I have a bone to pick with Loki and Rob regarding the Harvest Moon series.

322
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:03,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is on record as enjoying sandbox games.

323
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,640
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Harvest Moon series fits this description to a tee.

324
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The games have something for everyone.

325
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Real-time strategy fans can strategize to get the most crops each season.

326
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:20,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Those who enjoy dating sims can, in most of the games, date the NPCs, culminating in creating a family.

327
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:25,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Action fans can have fun catching fish, chopping down trees and planting endless fields of grass.

328
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:30,605
[SPEAKER_08]: RPG fans can engage in as many tedious and pointless quests as have ever been found in one game.

329
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:34,937
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no expectations and certainly no requirements for the manner in which one plays the game.

330
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:35,777
[SPEAKER_08]: What's not to love?

331
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:41,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Not liking the series because farming isn't for you makes more sense than disliking them because all the games are the same.

332
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,281
[SPEAKER_08]: After all, doesn't Halo do the same thing?

333
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:48,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, my husband and I love the show and are looking forward to listening for years to come.

334
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:49,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for brightening up our week.

335
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:50,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yours, TheBlackMonster.

336
00:27:50,924 --> 00:27:51,224
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

337
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:53,305
[SPEAKER_08]: This email was written on a G4 Titanium Power Book.

338
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:55,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Grats.

339
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:56,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you start.

340
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:57,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll address this.

341
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,412
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

342
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Microsoft isn't releasing eight copies of the game a year.

343
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:31,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, there are so many Harvest Moon games that they're saying that are different, but aren't really different.

344
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:40,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls, which I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's probably just like the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls on the GameCube and stuff like that.

345
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:46,163
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the whole, was it Innocent Life of Futuristic Harvest Moon or something like that, which was just...

346
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:50,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a futuristic setting, still farming.

347
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:51,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And still all the same stuff.

348
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:53,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

349
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:54,673
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's for you, awesome.

350
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:56,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a sandbox game.

351
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:57,754
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not Grand Theft Auto farming.

352
00:28:57,974 --> 00:28:59,154
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is the problem.

353
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that this game doesn't involve guns and violence.

354
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where your problem is.

355
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, is it doesn't change.

356
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not innovating any.

357
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:08,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's farming.

358
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:09,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

359
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:11,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, are there different crops this time?

360
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:11,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, goody.

361
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:16,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not like, you know, you have a crop or something and you have to...

362
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:22,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Fight Off, the man who's trying to steal your property to build a mall or something on it.

363
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:36,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's going on here is that sandbox is kind of being seen as a very general term where Loki likes a very specific type of sandbox game like the 3D jump, shoot, find, destroy, rape type of sandbox game.

364
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the sandbox games are basically games you can go in there and do whatever you want and tackle it however you want.

365
00:29:42,193 --> 00:29:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a farming... This is a sim game.

366
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,775
[SPEAKER_06]: You start off with crops...

367
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:52,979
[SPEAKER_06]: You tend to the crops and stuff, and it's a farming sim with RPG elements.

368
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,101
[SPEAKER_05]: From my perspective, I've tried Harvest Moon.

369
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I played the one on the GameCube, and I just...

370
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:00,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I just couldn't get into it.

371
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it was.

372
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me there was like just kind of like too much going on at once.

373
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:08,613
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't have that kind of simplicity that Animal Crossing had.

374
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I don't know.

375
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:15,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe I need to give the series another look because if I like Animal Crossing, I should like something like Harvest Moon.

376
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:16,936
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wasn't feeling it.

377
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just, there was nothing to keep me coming back.

378
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:25,478
[SPEAKER_06]: What they need to do is instead of releasing, like,

379
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:28,450
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 or 5 titles a year of Harvest Moon.

380
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Just release one good title of Harvest Moon each year and do it that way.

381
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:38,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Put some more effort into the game instead of just rehashing the same thing and giving it a new coat of paint.

382
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Devil's Advocate, I have to.

383
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I may not agree with what I'm about to say, but Devil's Advocate, I have to.

384
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't DDR do the same damn thing?

385
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:45,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it does.

386
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It does the same damn thing.

387
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:50,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another reason why that series is starting to go downhill.

388
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:57,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because that's all they do is just give it a new fresh coat of paint, change the colors of the menu or something, and then just add some new songs.

389
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

390
00:30:58,737 --> 00:30:59,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And expect you to buy it.

391
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:00,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

392
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

393
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it or leave it.

394
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we talk about something other than Harvest Moon now?

395
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

396
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:06,184
[SPEAKER_08]: This next email though is super cool.

397
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:06,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

398
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:09,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR crew, this is Ranma the Blind from Indonesia.

399
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:16,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally wrote my second email to you and I hope I could share some video game related contents that might interest you all and all of your listeners.

400
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,471
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I would like to announce that I finally bought a Wii.

401
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:26,075
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because I've got nostalgia for old Nintendo systems, so I wish I could play some of the old classic games via virtual console.

402
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:32,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Or perhaps I could hear my friends play the games as my eye condition makes me impossible to play all the games.

403
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:33,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

404
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:57,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, I'm still trying some other Wii titles, and I hope I can discover more games for blinds to play.

405
00:31:57,671 --> 00:32:03,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish that Nintendo could make research about this, and perhaps create accessible contents for the blind to purchase.

406
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys, do you have any comments about this?

407
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll pause here if you guys have any comments.

408
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I appreciate hearing back because it's always interesting to hear from this kind of perspective that doesn't often get enough recognition at large in gaming blogs and things.

409
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,321
[SPEAKER_08]: There were sound games on the Saturn back in the day.

410
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:20,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't Nintendo do that?

411
00:32:20,702 --> 00:32:22,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to turn around and ask another question.

412
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:26,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious because I bet this email was sent in before Nintendo's press conference this week.

413
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:37,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious what this emailer thinks about some of these other new innovations like Wii Fit and some of these other directions that Nintendo's going that has a little more to do with movement, if that makes sense.

414
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, email us back.

415
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:42,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm going to have to ask him to email us back because of the next part.

416
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:44,055
[SPEAKER_08]: But did you have a comment?

417
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:50,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was just going to say that, you know, unfortunately, you know, blind gamers are such a small...

418
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:59,951
[SPEAKER_06]: percentage of their demographic that I don't think you're going to ever see anything that's really dedicated to it, unless you get some independent company out there that's really gearing towards, you know, that.

419
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:03,294
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason for them to make sound-based games.

420
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:15,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they could do something pretty innovative, because there was some stuff on the Game Boy Advance that was just sound, part of that bit generation series, but it's just unfortunately, you know, blind handicap and stuff, it is such a small market, you know,

421
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:24,004
[SPEAKER_05]: What about something that would make the existing games more accessible to the audience?

422
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:25,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, if they can do something like that.

423
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:31,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of think about how Windows has the Zoom feature and those other types of accessibility options.

424
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Could a game console adapt something similar?

425
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible, I don't know.

426
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:40,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat Armageddon would probably be a lot easier to play and waggle the thing around.

427
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Broad caliber!

428
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, sorry, let the email finish.

429
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:51,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the next part is, another thing I would like to share is a Final Fantasy concert held in my country.

430
00:33:51,524 --> 00:34:02,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, this is the second one as the concert was also held last year, but it was still enjoyable, especially in Indonesia where video game music is rare to find, and game music concert is like a distant dream.

431
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:06,370
[SPEAKER_08]: You did say you uploaded pictures and videos from the concert.

432
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I want your permission before I make that public to chat, so...

433
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:18,305
[SPEAKER_08]: or if you would like to go into our forum at OrangeDodgeRadio.com and make a thread about it, then we would appreciate you sharing it with everybody that way.

434
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:26,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish in the future another video game music concert will again be held here, perhaps by Video Game Music Live or Play, a video game symphony.

435
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:27,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all for now.

436
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care and have a good show.

437
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:31,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

438
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

439
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:32,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the email.

440
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:33,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this one.

441
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:34,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, how's it going?

442
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:35,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me, Nim.

443
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:38,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been listening lately because of the fact that my iPod was stolen.

444
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:44,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually listen to the downloadable version, but more than likely I'll be tuning in more often and jumping in chat.

445
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:50,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Lately I've been playing a lot of Bimani, Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution, Parapara, and I just heard Poppin' for the first time last week.

446
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:56,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure you've answered this question before, but knowing that you used to be nothing but a show about Bimani, which out of the line are your favorites?

447
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the entire Bomani series?

448
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what the question?

449
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:02,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming.

450
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a tough question.

451
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:09,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say 2DX, but the series has gotten really stale.

452
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:13,587
[SPEAKER_05]: God, the same goes for DDR.

453
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:17,970
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is most of the Konami Bomani series has gotten a little bit stale.

454
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,191
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not been a lot of innovation within the games.

455
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:24,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, I guess, back in the day, it was definitely Beatmania, 2DX.

456
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Keyboard Mania?

457
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, oh fuck, I loved Keyboard Mania.

458
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:29,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Keyboard Mania is my answer.

459
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:46,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved Drum Mania a whole lot, and my drum pads were, unfortunately they're just not as strong as how I like to play, because I'm used to the arcade, but I still like to get out and shake my booty on Parapara, that's always fun.

460
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:49,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Dance Maniacs.

461
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't like Dance Maniacs.

462
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,040
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

463
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Dance Maniacs.

464
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Marathon Road.

465
00:35:55,021 --> 00:36:04,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, personally, I would love to see another Bomani game that was using the Parapara control system, but with non-Parapara music.

466
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just like another, like, dancing game.

467
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:18,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, they can do another dancing game like that and have, like, you know, the, almost like the Wii Fit board on the bottom or something, have, like, pressure sensors or something to do something like that.

468
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:18,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be pretty cool.

469
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, any more emails?

470
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah.

471
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's hear them.

472
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move forward.

473
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:31,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey all, just wanted to chime in as another developer that listens to your show each week.

474
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:37,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, I'm an associate producer, which, if you enjoy abbreviations, turns into ass prod.

475
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:38,969
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

476
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:44,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I love people that can be self-deprecating in their humor.

477
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:46,273
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um...

478
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:51,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell by my email address where I work now.

479
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:56,589
[SPEAKER_08]: And before this, I ran my own indie studio and developed a little strategy game for PC called Land of Legends.

480
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to say where.

481
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:03,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say either, because I read the email beforehand, so I know where this person is from from the email address.

482
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say...

483
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:17,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that it's a company that I know takes a lot of crap from the hardcore community sometimes, but I think they really do some awesome things for the non-hardcore audience.

484
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:22,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've done a lot, especially in the past year, and a lot of stuff that I really enjoy.

485
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:27,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not just saying that because you emailed.

486
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:32,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for the show and let you guys know that you have

487
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:33,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet another developer listening.

488
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:36,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel free to write if you have any questions or issues I can help with.

489
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:39,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to use the nickname HeroAntagonist.

490
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny, I heard back from the developer that emailed us previously and he was willing to do an Ask a Developer type segment.

491
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:52,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we can get this guy in on it too and have some type of roundtable thing on a later show.

492
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:55,108
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be kind of fun, especially during the next few months.

493
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:59,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be a little bit slow before we get into the fall rush of game news.

494
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be kind of fun to do an Ask a Developer roundtable.

495
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So please write us back if you'd be willing to participate.

496
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:06,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You can contact me directly or send back the email bag, whatever.

497
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:09,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're going to try definitely doing something like that in the future.

498
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:10,099
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's short.

499
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR.

500
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm kind of late with this one, but happy belated birthday, OLR.

501
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,640
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are awesome and keep it up.

502
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Ron.

503
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ron.

504
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

505
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:19,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you bring us a present?

506
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:20,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

507
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:23,402
[SPEAKER_08]: You said, Ron, I think of Potter Puppet House.

508
00:38:24,162 --> 00:38:24,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

509
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Snape.

510
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:26,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's bother him.

511
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:28,043
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

512
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:28,803
[SPEAKER_08]: This last one.

513
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:29,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.

514
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say I love the show.

515
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:36,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do you think about young gamers on online games that they really shouldn't play?

516
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm 14, so I really shouldn't be talking.

517
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted your opinion.

518
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:40,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Christian.

519
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says you shouldn't talk if you're 14?

520
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:42,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, age...

521
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:45,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Age is a number.

522
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:45,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Age is a number.

523
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Maturity is everything.

524
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if you can play a game maturely, and that doesn't mean you have to play adult or act adult.

525
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,614
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have fun but still be mature.

526
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:05,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And by that, I mean you don't go on to Xbox Live and yell, you know, N, N, N, F, F, F, and all those words that people scream on Xbox Live.

527
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:12,146
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can have fun and have that self-deprecating humor and laugh and have a good time, then, you know,

528
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:14,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a suggestion.

529
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Use periods when you type.

530
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:18,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I had perfect grammar when I was fourteen.

531
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:45,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's dig up some of your high school papers and check.

532
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:45,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly?

533
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,625
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I really don't care that much.

534
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:51,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say, because I can prove it.

535
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:52,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I can back it up.

536
00:39:52,707 --> 00:40:09,154
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, seriously, it's just a matter of how you... If you're typing on an MMO and you have something to say, think... Something my granddaddy used to always say, I will quote a bit of wisdom, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

537
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:10,155
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case...

538
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Put brain in gear before typing, I guess.

539
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:17,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin DDR in chat would like to point out, I am a 14-year-old playing online games.

540
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

541
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not alone.

542
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:20,334
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

543
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:28,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of, you know, just thinking before you do something.

544
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing online games at 14.

545
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:38,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Only when I was 14, the online games we had to play were Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars, The Pit...

546
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,346
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so on.

547
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:42,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you catch my references, you're a winner.

548
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:45,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

549
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:46,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

550
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:47,107
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

551
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

552
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:55,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, I give everybody a hard time for their grammar, so don't worry about it.

553
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:57,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's really not all that great.

554
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's really better than Rob's on AIM, though.

555
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that.

556
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

557
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, shut up.

558
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:05,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get on to...

559
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:11,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other news coming out of E3 that didn't necessarily have to do with the press conferences.

560
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:15,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I want to spend a little time talking about music games.

561
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:16,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, that's how we started.

562
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:17,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our roots.

563
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:22,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to talk about some of the music games that were going on at E3 and some of the events that happened this week outside of E3.

564
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:28,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with a game that was coming out from EA.

565
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:30,161
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Boogie.

566
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:33,817
[SPEAKER_05]: EA announced the soundtrack to the game called Boogie.

567
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with a karaoke microphone and it's actually on the Wii.

568
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:44,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were trying to put together basically a lot of generations of hits.

569
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this game you're supposed to be able to dance, sing, and make music videos using the Wii controls.

570
00:41:50,656 --> 00:41:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be interesting.

571
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:53,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the songs that will be in this game.

572
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: ABC by the Jackson 5.

573
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:58,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Brick House by the Commodores.

574
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Canned Heat by Jamiroquai.

575
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Roller Coaster by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

576
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas.

577
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:07,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Shack by the B-52s.

578
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:09,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Milkshake by Khalees.

579
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so rad.

580
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:12,775
[SPEAKER_05]: One Way, that's the song we gotta get Loki to play.

581
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:36,871
[SPEAKER_05]: One Way or Another by Blondie, Groove is in the Heart by D. Light, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Cindy Lauper, Get the Party Started by Pink, Fergalicious by Fergie, there's another Loki song, YMCA by The Village People, Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, SOS by Rihanna, Oops I Did It Again, Britney Spears, that's a pretty fun list that brings across all generations there, so.

582
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Sabbath Paranoid

583
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:32,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Oyster Cult, Don't Fear the Reaper, The Ramones, Rockaway Beach, Rush with Tom Sawyer, Bon Jovi with Wanted Dead or Alive, Nirvana in Bloom, Stone Temple Pilots, Vaseline, Weezer, Say It Ain't So,

584
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:44,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Foo Fighters, Learn to Fly, Metallica, Enter Sandman, The Hives, Main Offender, The Strokes, Reptilia, and Queens of the Stone Age go with Flow.

585
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:48,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I heard in this game you'll be able to use the microphone as claps or a tambourine.

586
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:53,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So I demand this mix have Stevie Nicks somewhere in it.

587
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Fleetwood Mac, whatever you have to do to do it.

588
00:43:55,905 --> 00:44:00,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But you cannot have a game where you play the tambourine and not represent Miss Stevie Nicks because...

589
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:02,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

590
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:34,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That has the possibility of being a pretty awesome game.

591
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:36,947
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one reason I'm sad I didn't go to E3.

592
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:37,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have liked to play that.

593
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:39,648
[SPEAKER_05]: They also promise new content every week.

594
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:41,089
[SPEAKER_06]: For how long?

595
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If it takes off, I'd say probably for a year.

596
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:47,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

597
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:49,093
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that could just keep going, though.

598
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:50,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's great.

599
00:44:50,494 --> 00:44:52,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be very interesting to see what that does.

600
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite ambitious.

601
00:44:54,456 --> 00:44:56,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Harmonix gets it, you guys.

602
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:56,897
[SPEAKER_05]: They get it.

603
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:58,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band teams with MTV.

604
00:44:58,638 --> 00:44:58,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

605
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:00,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take off.

606
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:07,445
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's kind of interesting to see what's going to happen to Guitar Hero this year because they've almost got to beat their own game.

607
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:21,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize there's a guitar and drum element in this game that makes this, but I hope somehow poppy songs can, you know, because I love poppy songs as well as rock, so I hope somehow they can be integrated into this game one way or another.

608
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:23,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

609
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:28,902
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a weird side of me that would like to be able to sing, you know, just the weird songs you wouldn't expect in this game, you know?

610
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:32,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want Rock Band 2 or whatever to have different instruments.

611
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:32,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

612
00:45:32,683 --> 00:45:34,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band 2, Electric Boogaloo.

613
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully Rock Band 2 gives us a little more, you know, so we can sing different songs.

614
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:39,504
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be damn hard to do a keyboard style thing, though.

615
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:40,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Please give me keyboard.

616
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:42,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give me keyboard.

617
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:49,485
[SPEAKER_08]: The format that they have set up for that, I doubt very seriously that would be possible unless it's like seven keys.

618
00:45:50,246 --> 00:45:51,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's USB.

619
00:45:51,306 --> 00:45:52,286
[SPEAKER_06]: How hard could it be?

620
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:55,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about screen format.

621
00:45:56,363 --> 00:46:05,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, especially when you've got the voice track, guitar, all this other business going on on the screen, and your animation going on.

622
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:15,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing keyboard mode is not going to be... I'm trying to think of the way that they have the Guitar Hero style play going in.

623
00:46:15,928 --> 00:46:17,448
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to be able to do keyboard that way.

624
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,329
[SPEAKER_08]: They could do it with Keyboard Mania because you had a full screen.

625
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:31,455
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Destroyer of Dreams, everybody.

626
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:34,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just being realistic, Rob.

627
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:36,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand, but... Rob, there is no Easter Bunny!

628
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you.

629
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:44,645
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no bunny hanging out at Easter.

630
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we please move on?

631
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:48,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

632
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:50,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's my turn, isn't it?

633
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:52,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I have good news.

634
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:55,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it would be good news if it was still 1991, wouldn't it?

635
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, please read the story now.

636
00:47:00,452 --> 00:47:00,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what's coming.

637
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:12,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Slash, our curly-haired, top-hat-wearing hero of Guns N' Roses, currently a Velvet Revolver, is a boss in Guitar Hero 3.

638
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:16,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Buckethead is cooler!

639
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely agree this news would have been ten times cooler in 1991.

640
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:25,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still kind of cool, you have to admit.

641
00:47:25,615 --> 00:47:27,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Having Slash in the game, that is kind of cool.

642
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:34,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, those of us that remember Slash from our high school days are a little bit more grown up now and can spend the money on things like Guitar Hero 3.

643
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:38,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a certain cool factor to having Slash in the game.

644
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:44,069
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Guitar Hero 3 knows they're going to really have it in for them with this whole rock band thing coming out, but...

645
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:46,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it could be pretty cool.

646
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it all boils down to song list for me.

647
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:53,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like this year's lineup, EA has it in for Activision.

648
00:47:53,413 --> 00:48:05,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they've got Skate coming out with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground coming out later, Rock Band, and I don't know, I guess with licensed games, you know, The Simpsons and stuff.

649
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision has a lot to lose if they don't innovate.

650
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:13,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Innovate or Die GK128 says Fuck Slash

651
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:46,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero needs a college rock edition featuring Frank Black from the Pixies and Jay Maskis from Dinosaur Jr.

652
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:47,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.

653
00:48:48,473 --> 00:48:49,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Officially.

654
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,735
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what we need?

655
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:58,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We need like late 70s, early 80s rock like Enid Tho and some Joy Division for me.

656
00:48:58,538 --> 00:48:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be great.

657
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And some Bauhaus.

658
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:19,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of music games and going over to Konami, kind of talking about what they're up to, Supernova 2 was tested this week, and some of the news has been a little bit lost in the shuffle of all the E3 news, but if you head over to a site like BomaniStyle.com that dedicates themselves to all the music game news, you can get some of the latest wrap-ups from the fans out there playing the location test.

659
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:22,322
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole list of the extra songs that are in the game has shown up.

660
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:29,724
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some interesting covers in it, including Come Clean, which if I remember right was like a Hilary Duff song, I think.

661
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:31,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Faint, Me Against the Music

662
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting that Konami sticks with all these covers, not the real things.

663
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:46,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

664
00:49:46,523 --> 00:49:49,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, some other reports that come in from the updates.

665
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:57,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Marvelous ratings in Supernova 2 don't seem to award more points than perfects, and for some reason seemed easier to obtain than usual.

666
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:01,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Strings of perfect ratings will by no means hamper a great song rating.

667
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:08,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami finally has spelled Marvelous the right way with one L, and it's a solid silver color.

668
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:10,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

669
00:50:10,356 --> 00:50:16,419
[SPEAKER_05]: If a player is able to receive all perfects or better, the AAA rating on the results screen will feature the text, Full Perfect Combo.

670
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:17,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

671
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other news there.

672
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,544
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an extra stage that has a background video with Black Roses, people, and other things that are going on.

673
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:27,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the song is called Unreal.

674
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an introduction video to DDR has returned.

675
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:32,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been one of those in a little while.

676
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:33,668
[SPEAKER_05]: They say since 4th Mix there.

677
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:37,590
[SPEAKER_05]: But they say some of the songs feel a little off sync.

678
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:43,566
[SPEAKER_05]: People were complaining that some of the older songs from DDR Extreme and DDR Supernova didn't feel quite right.

679
00:50:43,846 --> 00:50:46,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't off-sync by much, but they were bitching it was off-sync.

680
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:59,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But it should also be noted they were also bitching that the pads being used on the location test machine were not perfect, which might be a good point to reiterate that maybe it's time for Konami to come out with some new pads that are a little better with the technology that's a little newer.

681
00:50:59,774 --> 00:51:07,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention, I mean, but if you guys remember the original Supernova beta test, same issues, you know, that stuff was off-sync.

682
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:07,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

683
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,968
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says only in DDR is perfect, not good enough.

684
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:12,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

685
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:43,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So for DDR fans who are looking to get back into arcades, also the rumor is EMUs is coming with Supernova 2, which you might remember from the Japanese Pomona games.

686
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:47,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It never really came over here, but the rumor is the test machine had the EMUs set up on it.

687
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting.

688
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:50,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see where that goes.

689
00:51:51,262 --> 00:51:52,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Could make up for lack of memory cards.

690
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:54,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

691
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:56,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

692
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:57,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

693
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:03,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so I don't know.

694
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, I guess, cool that there's new content coming out for Guitar Hero 2 for the Xbox 360.

695
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:15,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And the new pack actually is going to have a few more songs in there.

696
00:52:17,628 --> 00:52:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you know, it's got... I want to be sedated, smoke on the water, and you've got another thing coming.

697
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:27,693
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still going to be 500 Microsoft points, or $6.25.

698
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:29,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

699
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:33,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, people that did download it before the first pack

700
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:35,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.

701
00:52:58,956 --> 00:52:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

702
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:29,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to have something petty to complain about, but I just realized something.

703
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,597
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR hasn't had another download pack since the launch of the fucking, you know, Universe game.

704
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the fuck are the downloads?

705
00:53:59,617 --> 00:54:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, Universe 2 is right around the corner.

706
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:04,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell is my goddamn downloads for Universe 1?

707
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:06,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did you just forget to do that?

708
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:09,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like the karaoke revolution append discs.

709
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to know my theory?

710
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:14,780
[SPEAKER_05]: They ain't coming because the song packs were all already on the disc and that's all they made.

711
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my theory.

712
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them for that.

713
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:22,181
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

714
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to move in two weeks and I still don't have a place to live.

715
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:29,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit frustrating.

716
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,261
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully I will be better very soon and I'll have a place because that would be nice.

717
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:35,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Because otherwise I'm going to cry.

718
00:54:37,181 --> 00:54:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to some other news.

719
00:54:41,262 --> 00:54:44,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to get into some news that, you know, some other things picked up around this week.

720
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:47,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily at E3, but some of them are, some of them aren't.

721
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

722
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:52,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is some other stuff.

723
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:58,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Disney has actually purchased War Inspector, their Junction Point Studios.

724
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:08,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we'll be getting some new games, and Disney is going to have some stuff coming to the new consoles.

725
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:19,128
[SPEAKER_08]: War Inspector brought us the Deus Ex, Thief, Deadly Shadows, System Shock.

726
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:20,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

727
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:25,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know how to feel about this.

728
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:53,839
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a quote on here saying, Warren Spector's unique talents as leading creative forces in the world of video games, his knowledge and passion for Disney, his legacy of storytelling and character development adds a unique creative dimension to our portfolio.

729
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's from the executive VP of Disney Interactive.

730
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:01,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we'll get some good.

731
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Disney's been up to a lot of wheeling and dealing lately.

732
00:56:04,935 --> 00:56:10,499
[SPEAKER_05]: They, at E3, announced a new online service that will be on all of their DS titles.

733
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called D-Gamer, and it's going to be first in the Chronicles of Narnia game that's coming out for the DS.

734
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:22,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what D-Gamer's going to do is it's going to turn your Nintendo DS into Xbox Live of sorts.

735
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:29,635
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be avatars, you can chat with other people, and you can look at the achievements that your friends have unlocked.

736
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:33,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting that it took a third party to do this.

737
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:38,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So the system is more than capable of handling this type of technology, it's just that Nintendo doesn't want to do it.

738
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:40,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

739
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And interesting that somebody has decided to step up and do it, if not just for their own games.

740
00:56:46,306 --> 00:56:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's face it, there's a certain audience that gets a lot of these Disney games that come out, you know, the Hannah Montana games and the That's So Ravens game.

741
00:56:54,175 --> 00:57:10,859
[SPEAKER_05]: that will benefit from this, whereas the rest of us hardcore gamers that are too cool to go out and buy a Chronicles of Narnia video game are going to be sitting here going, gosh, I wish I had something like that when I was playing, you know, the games I'm playing, like Pokemon, even though that's not much cooler.

742
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:14,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

743
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Rob really likes Hannah Montana.

744
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

745
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Another disappointment.

746
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:20,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

747
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:26,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Still rumors that the 6-axis controller is gonna be rumbling soon.

748
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:32,869
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's been confirmed by a few different places, one of which is supposedly a Sony employee.

749
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, I guess...

750
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:41,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony employee confirmed directly to Kotaku that the 6-axis will be rumbling soon.

751
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:52,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, shortly afterwards, Immersion comes out saying, hey, we're making a TouchSense rumble controller for the PlayStation 3 in September.

752
00:57:53,493 --> 00:58:04,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a third-party company is making it for the PlayStation 3 in September, because why the hell would you add rumble to your controllers if, I don't know, there wasn't rumble coming, because that would be kind of stupid.

753
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:08,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that's very interesting.

754
00:58:08,734 --> 00:58:15,937
[SPEAKER_06]: But Sony is still denying it, saying, hey, yeah, it's not coming, you know, this is all rumor, blah, blah, blah, blah.

755
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:21,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, last week, they were also saying, hey, we have no plans on cutting the PlayStation 3 price.

756
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, hey, the 60 gig system is going to be $4.99 and we're going to be still producing them, you know, that kind of stuff.

757
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:30,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

758
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:34,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumble isn't so last gen after all.

759
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:35,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, exactly.

760
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's probably coming this fall.

761
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:42,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you buy your PlayStation 3 systems, guess what?

762
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:43,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to buy new controllers.

763
00:58:44,163 --> 00:58:46,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Much like the PlayStation 1, if you remember.

764
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:52,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Devil's Advocate, could the rumble in these controllers be for the backwards compatible games?

765
00:58:53,568 --> 00:58:55,069
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be weird to see them.

766
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It could possibly, I guess, for that.

767
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:03,334
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, as far as I'm aware, I don't think the rumble stuff is in there.

768
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

769
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:05,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's possible.

770
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'd be kind of weird to buy a controller just for the backwards compatible games.

771
00:59:09,982 --> 00:59:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because that would imply that somebody bought a PlayStation 3 would totally skip the PlayStation 2, and I can't think that that's a very large audience.

772
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:20,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't imagine that programming or whatever would be built into the emulation either.

773
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:21,489
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

774
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

775
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be an interesting theory, but I think it's coming.

776
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we shall see what Sony does in the upcoming months.

777
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:35,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony's gonna eat crayon pie is what they're gonna do.

778
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:37,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, except this.

779
00:59:37,394 --> 00:59:39,075
[SPEAKER_08]: This is redemption, I think.

780
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:47,880
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a poem that hinted to a coming of something.

781
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:50,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

782
00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:56,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Hill 5 has been announced for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which I'll probably get it on PS3.

783
00:59:56,785 --> 00:59:58,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy.

784
00:59:58,867 --> 00:59:59,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy.

785
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:10,412
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how would your inner fangirl feel if I told you that Silent Hill 5 is not being developed by Team Silent, but in fact is being developed by the team that brought you Mark Echo's Getting Up?

786
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:30,664
[SPEAKER_05]: and the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer game on the Xbox.

787
01:00:30,704 --> 01:00:32,108
[SPEAKER_08]: The first Buffy game was really good.

788
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:33,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

789
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:35,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So your inner fangirl may give this a chance?

790
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,182
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as my man does music.

791
01:00:40,424 --> 01:00:40,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Akira Yamaoka

792
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:13,251
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, of course, Silent Hill Arcade, which I had my fangasm over in Part A. Seriously, if you haven't seen the videos, it's so... I don't want to spoil what happens, but, like, the battle with Pyramid Head ends in, like, the raddest way.

793
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:14,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

794
01:01:14,692 --> 01:01:16,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, fangasm all over.

795
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:18,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

796
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:21,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yes, I am a fanboy for Pyramid Head and Silent Hill.

797
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:22,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I will admit it.

798
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:30,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I'm also a fanboy for Price Drops, and I was kind of hoping, like many of you, that Microsoft would announce one this week at E3.

799
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:31,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

800
01:01:32,686 --> 01:01:38,369
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an interview from 1UP with Shane Kim and they were talking to him.

801
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,650
[SPEAKER_05]: He's of course the corporate VP at Microsoft Game Studios.

802
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:47,633
[SPEAKER_05]: They were asking him about the whole, you know, what does Xbox 360 need to win and where's the price drop?

803
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:53,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Shane Kim doesn't completely count out a price drop.

804
01:01:55,288 --> 01:01:56,808
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, he says, stay tuned.

805
01:01:57,128 --> 01:01:58,349
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't announce anything here.

806
01:01:58,429 --> 01:01:59,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't feel the need to.

807
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:02,049
[SPEAKER_05]: July is a very odd time to announce a price reduction.

808
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even sure Sony announced a price reduction anyway, because, you know, the whole bait and switch thing going on.

809
01:02:09,011 --> 01:02:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So they said we didn't feel the need to do it at E3.

810
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:14,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not cutting it out of the picture.

811
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:18,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It might just not be coming for a little while, kind of like was speculated earlier in the show.

812
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.

813
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:29,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I should say there's a huge rumor going around about the August 1st price drop.

814
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

815
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:31,288
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems a little soon.

816
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:35,050
[SPEAKER_05]: If they were going to do it then, they might as well have announced it at PlayStation 3.

817
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackwolf has an interesting thought.

818
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:38,812
[SPEAKER_05]: He says they might announce it at Penny Arcade Expo.

819
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:41,454
[SPEAKER_06]: They might announce it... Take it directly to the fans.

820
01:02:41,514 --> 01:02:41,974
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll love it.

821
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Announce it at PAX or now there's X07, you know.

822
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:47,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard they canceled it.

823
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:48,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well... No, no, no.

824
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm thinking... I'm thinking they're...

825
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:53,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Event over in Europe.

826
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:54,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

827
01:02:54,624 --> 01:02:55,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's Exo 7.

828
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's happening this year.

829
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:57,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what about Tokyo Game Show then?

830
01:02:57,946 --> 01:02:58,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be.

831
01:02:59,047 --> 01:02:59,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

832
01:02:59,528 --> 01:02:59,868
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

833
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:01,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They have plenty of time to do it.

834
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:05,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially waiting until closer to Halo and stuff.

835
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:06,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

836
01:03:06,414 --> 01:03:07,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're in trouble.

837
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing I was going to mention real quick though, there was also Capcom was saying that they speculate that

838
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:15,957
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 3 will drop price again.

839
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:21,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also speculation that I know Europe was supposed to be getting the 120 gig PlayStation 3.

840
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:23,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you imagine if they do the same thing here?

841
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's going to be every few months or so you're going to get price drop, clearance, new system come out.

842
01:03:30,268 --> 01:03:30,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

843
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:31,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

844
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:41,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So GamePro, on top of their game apparently, did a little article of seven games that mysteriously were missing from E3.

845
01:03:41,096 --> 01:03:41,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

846
01:03:42,256 --> 01:03:44,137
[SPEAKER_06]: which is full of inaccuracies.

847
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:45,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's just go down the list, shall we?

848
01:03:46,337 --> 01:03:47,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 4.

849
01:03:48,178 --> 01:04:00,782
[SPEAKER_06]: God, where was Grand Theft Auto 4 other than the PlayStation press conference, the Xbox press conference, the Take-Two press conference where they did a walkthrough demo of the thing?

850
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:02,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it wasn't there.

851
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:04,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Spore.

852
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:07,284
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Spore was there.

853
01:04:07,465 --> 01:04:11,706
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed off a few more things on it and had a little press demo for it.

854
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: God of War 3.

855
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:14,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that wasn't there.

856
01:04:14,899 --> 01:04:16,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give them that.

857
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:19,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what other stuff they're talking about here.

858
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:23,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised there was no God of War 3, but I guess they always have Heavenly Sword.

859
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably so far off in development.

860
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:26,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true.

861
01:04:27,908 --> 01:04:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So was Halo 3 when they first started cock-teasing us with it?

862
01:04:31,491 --> 01:04:31,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

863
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:33,892
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Rainbow Six game?

864
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying the successor to Rainbow Six Vegas?

865
01:04:38,656 --> 01:04:38,696
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

866
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:41,518
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

867
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:45,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the last game just came out, what, a few weeks ago?

868
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they need to be teasing the new one yet.

869
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it goes the way of Splinter Cell Conviction.

870
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another thing out of the Microsoft conference.

871
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exclusive to Xbox 360.

872
01:04:55,164 --> 01:04:55,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

873
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Prince of Persia 4.

874
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:05,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think we need a new Prince of Persia game since we have, like, kind of, uh, Assassin's Creed kind of fills that void there for a little bit.

875
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:09,093
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't needed a Prince of Persia game since, you know, what, 1994?

876
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:09,533
[SPEAKER_08]: At all, ever.

877
01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:12,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

878
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,161
[SPEAKER_05]: The new ones are okay.

879
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Jackson's Halo.

880
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:25,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they didn't have enough Halo content with the gift cards and the 360 and everything else.

881
01:05:25,992 --> 01:05:27,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And Final Fantasy XIII.

882
01:05:27,353 --> 01:05:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they announced it wasn't going to be there anyways.

883
01:05:29,813 --> 01:05:31,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

884
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:32,974
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some other stuff?

885
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:36,115
[SPEAKER_06]: How about, was it that new Rygar game that was supposed to be out there?

886
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:37,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they show that?

887
01:05:37,075 --> 01:05:37,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, that was pretty cool.

888
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the fuck is Animal Crossing Wii?

889
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, Rygar was Tecmo, and I don't believe Tecmo was there.

890
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's probably why that wasn't there.

891
01:05:44,797 --> 01:05:46,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the fuck is Animal Crossing on the Wii?

892
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:47,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still being worked on.

893
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:48,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Work faster!

894
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Done by the guy apparently who did the Mii Channel.

895
01:05:53,175 --> 01:05:53,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

896
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

897
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:57,057
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet there's no Mii support in the game whatsoever?

898
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:58,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the irony.

899
01:06:00,399 --> 01:06:04,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackwolf would like to point out there were no console games for Squeenix.

900
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all DS and PSP.

901
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:07,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So nothing on the console.

902
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the hell's that Final Fantasy game on the Wii then?

903
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there a Crystal Chronicles game coming out at launch?

904
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:14,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

905
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:15,426
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

906
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:18,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the Dragon Quest slashy slash game?

907
01:06:18,857 --> 01:06:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares about Crystal Chronicles?

908
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,247
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio

909
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:11,419
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,144
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, the time waster was waiting in traffic to get to your next appointment or get to more games.

911
01:07:43,465 --> 01:07:49,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, because last year we were in Santa Monica because of the whole, you know, all games arena thing that was going on.

912
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And driving to E3 was a bitch every day.

913
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:53,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

914
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I mean, the traffic around was really horrible.

915
01:07:57,896 --> 01:08:01,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two miles from all the hotels and the show floor.

916
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:05,871
[SPEAKER_02]: and there were no press rooms at the Barker Hangar.

917
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So you couldn't get on the internet.

918
01:08:07,632 --> 01:08:09,033
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't report anything from there.

919
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:16,098
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to go back to the Fairmont Hotel which was probably the farthest hotel away because that's where the press room was.

920
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were on a deadline like for the working press like newspapers and other internet sites had deadlines, they had to spend a lot of time going back and forth, back and forth just so they could do their work.

921
01:08:28,528 --> 01:08:28,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So

922
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:33,170
[SPEAKER_02]: The ESA knows that the physical location was really the only downside.

923
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:39,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if they consolidated it more and still only invited about 3,000 or 4,000 people, it'd still be a great show.

924
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:42,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, couldn't they just rent one small part of the LA Convention Center?

925
01:08:43,073 --> 01:08:46,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a hard time believing LA Convention Center is the only place in the area.

926
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:49,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't they find another convention center in an LA suburb to do it in?

927
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:52,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Or move it to Vegas, like I've heard suggested?

928
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Lawrence Young was telling me Long Beach Convention Center, maybe.

929
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,428
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is that you're going to have to bring us as your crew next year, Bobby.

930
01:08:59,448 --> 01:08:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

931
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:28,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That loophole will probably be very closed next year.

932
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:29,811
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see what happens.

933
01:09:30,072 --> 01:09:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they can open it up a little more in Vegas.

934
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

935
01:09:33,353 --> 01:09:34,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quickly, what were your thoughts?

936
01:09:34,554 --> 01:09:35,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to walk the show floor.

937
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:37,156
[SPEAKER_05]: What impressed the hell out of you?

938
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: What disappointed the hell out of you?

939
01:09:39,517 --> 01:09:41,858
[SPEAKER_02]: What impressed me was Burnout Paradise.

940
01:09:42,459 --> 01:09:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, on my show, Plug Plug, since it's not your five-year anniversary, I'm going to plug my show.

941
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:47,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

942
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:48,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone has a podcast.

943
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:49,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You might as well say it.

944
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:53,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed the producer for Burnout Paradise.

945
01:09:53,459 --> 01:10:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really doing some really interesting things with the online multiplayer, and they have added enough to the game itself that it's going to be a great game for communities to play.

946
01:10:02,383 --> 01:10:04,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a great game to play online.

947
01:10:04,563 --> 01:10:06,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really hyped for Burnout Paradise.

948
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I was already hyped for Burnout before you said that.

949
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:09,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm even more hyped.

950
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:10,146
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

951
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:14,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're doing seamless online multiplayer.

952
01:10:14,247 --> 01:10:15,128
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no lobby.

953
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:18,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an open world, and people just drop in on the open world, and then the host says...

954
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:19,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you want a race?

955
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:20,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

956
01:10:20,686 --> 01:10:21,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, boom, and he starts the race.

957
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Test Drive Unlimited.

958
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

959
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:25,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Rad.

960
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:28,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Rock Band.

961
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about Rock Band because I did get to play it.

962
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:41,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it four times on the drums just to make sure that all my rants about the drum peripheral were founded or unfounded or whatever.

963
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:45,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't like the placement of the pads.

964
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is fine.

965
01:10:49,389 --> 01:10:54,772
[SPEAKER_02]: and it does feel like you're playing a drum set except for the fact that your arms are in the wrong place.

966
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:56,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

967
01:10:56,093 --> 01:11:08,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the thing is, I was the only one there who had a problem with the drum set because the harmonics people and the MTV people, which were extremely nice to me, they were very receptive to me, they're like, oh, you're a drummer.

968
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you like that drum peripheral, huh?

969
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it?

970
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:13,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, not really.

971
01:11:14,164 --> 01:11:14,584
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

972
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:16,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

973
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to the marketing manager at EA.

974
01:11:19,512 --> 01:11:20,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to a guy who works for MTV.

975
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:24,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to one of the Harmonix developers, and I said, you know, the pads are great.

976
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:25,795
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardware is great.

977
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:26,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The UI is fine.

978
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,136
[SPEAKER_02]: The placement sucks of the pads.

979
01:11:29,176 --> 01:11:30,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that they were adjustable, though.

980
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:34,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not just that.

981
01:11:34,178 --> 01:11:42,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fact that the note chart has the hi-hat on the second drum from the left, and usually you have to cross your arms for that.

982
01:11:43,447 --> 01:11:49,169
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest issue was the far right drum, which they used as the symbol a lot of times.

983
01:11:49,349 --> 01:11:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: All the drums could change at any time.

984
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:53,110
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't really married to one thing.

985
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:03,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But having to pull back on your arm instead of go forward, which is the natural motion of your arm, that took a while to get used to, and so I would overshoot the pad all the time.

986
01:12:04,473 --> 01:12:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, they have the Xbox guide button right in the center, and I hit it like three times bringing up the guide while playing.

987
01:12:10,855 --> 01:12:12,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, you pulled a Peter Moore.

988
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:13,806
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

989
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:45,011
[SPEAKER_02]: and so finally one of the harmonics chicks was like, I'll sing Tom Sawyer, come on, let's go.

990
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was fun.

991
01:12:48,414 --> 01:12:56,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I will still get it because I'm a whore for that stuff, but I still don't like the placement and I'm going to be very vocal about the placement of the pads.

992
01:12:57,584 --> 01:13:03,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you real quick, I don't want to take up too much time, but since you were there, I do want to pick your brain on some of these things.

993
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:10,518
[SPEAKER_05]: How did it compare to last year's E3, and how did it seem to be received by the audience as a whole?

994
01:13:10,818 --> 01:13:17,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Were people enjoying the fact that it was more of an exclusive event, or did people miss the glitz and glamour and the booth babes of yonder past?

995
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody I spoke to that attended E3 loved the new E3.

996
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:28,646
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who didn't like E3, some of them had good reasons.

997
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: The more indie games scene, they didn't like it because they were shut out.

998
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:42,315
[SPEAKER_02]: and they kind of used the lack of the booth babe, the lack of the glitz as part of it, but really it was about they couldn't be a part of it.

999
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:44,416
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not invited to even exhibit.

1000
01:13:44,456 --> 01:13:45,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The ESA wouldn't even let them there.

1001
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:51,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody that was there loved the fact that you could have a conversation with people on the show floor.

1002
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You could walk up to anything and play it.

1003
01:13:55,161 --> 01:14:00,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix might not have liked it because every time I walked by their set of kiosks, nobody was playing the games.

1004
01:14:01,344 --> 01:14:01,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1005
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, everybody loved it except for the physical distance between things.

1006
01:14:08,446 --> 01:14:10,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed a few appointments because I couldn't get there in time.

1007
01:14:10,648 --> 01:14:13,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get to see Fallout 3 because I was 20 minutes late because of traffic.

1008
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Question from Rob D in chat.

1009
01:14:15,653 --> 01:14:18,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Bobby if he thinks that E3 can stay alive this way.

1010
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it did its job.

1011
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.

1012
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It did its job admirably.

1013
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether the ESA will actually continue doing it in this way, that I don't know.

1014
01:14:34,438 --> 01:14:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they made enough money doing it this way or not.

1015
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

1016
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else have a question for Bobby who got to go there and actually be at E3?

1017
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it was kind of bad that I didn't accept my invite.

1018
01:14:49,963 --> 01:14:52,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have had a cameraman and a sound guy.

1019
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:54,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

1020
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:58,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's making pouty face at Jamie right now.

1021
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:00,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we were a TV show.

1022
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,470
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I did get to sleep a lot, so that was good.

1023
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:04,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really, I had to work.

1024
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and the day you all were at E3, I was on jury duty, so I had one of the website's mobile version on refresh on my cell phone to follow the press conferences.

1025
01:15:13,894 --> 01:15:15,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sad and pathetic.

1026
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:16,495
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my E3.

1027
01:15:16,756 --> 01:15:17,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I did that at work.

1028
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:19,757
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1029
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd only say that because it didn't have the glitz, it didn't have the glamour, and really, to be honest, like the press conferences, everybody surrendered.

1030
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:51,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually E3 is about who had the best press conference, and all of them said, we don't want the best press conference this year.

1031
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going for that, and so that might be where a part of that came from.

1032
01:15:55,927 --> 01:16:05,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I mean, in terms of seeing things, getting things done, getting contacts, networking, all that stuff, this E3 was the best out of the 11 that I went to.

1033
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:09,875
[SPEAKER_02]: and I even said that on the Xbox Live Marketplace video that I'm apparently all over.

1034
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:18,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, a perfect example of that would have been the Konami press conference where it's like, yeah, two DDRs, Silent Hill 5, go get your press kit.

1035
01:16:23,799 --> 01:16:25,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's up with that, Bobby?

1036
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:35,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, now since there's less people at E3, you have a bigger chance of being a media whore, and Bobby, you really got some media whoring done this year.

1037
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand you're on a banner ad for, what, game trailers?

1038
01:16:39,013 --> 01:16:39,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1039
01:16:39,253 --> 01:16:41,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You show up in Xbox, what video in Xbox Live Marketplace are you on?

1040
01:16:42,877 --> 01:17:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: the on10.net E3 show floor wrap up video because I was with the TV channel that should be renamed Name Nameless and I was with All Games even before then I've known Laura Foy for many many years so when she saw me in the empty square on Wednesday she came over and asked me a few questions and apparently I get more air time than a frag doll on this thing but I was on that MTV Latin America made me sign a waiver because they filmed me playing Tom Sawyer on the drums huh

1041
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Hudson, their video crew, the same ones that made the Bomberman video that's on YouTube that says Act Zero sucked ass and we know it.

1042
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,142
[SPEAKER_02]: They came around and did something and it was really stupid.

1043
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:29,649
[SPEAKER_02]: If they used my thing, the question was, it was this chick and she goes, okay, here's the question, games or girls?

1044
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:33,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at her because it's the most absurd question I've ever heard in my life

1045
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Act Zero, I'll Take Girls, For Sure

1046
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,314
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think my response was games have pause buttons.

1047
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:14,156
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, care to rebuttal?

1048
01:18:15,976 --> 01:18:17,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have something that involves a button.

1049
01:18:17,716 --> 01:18:20,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even better, you just go, what, you're offering?

1050
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:20,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Heart, Bobby.

1051
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:26,918
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Bobby, thanks so much for the call and for the perspective from someone who was actually there.

1052
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:33,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And congrats on, I'm sure, what was going to end up being a lot of exposure for you and your show and all that good stuff.

1053
01:18:33,059 --> 01:18:33,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations.

1054
01:18:34,468 --> 01:18:35,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

1055
01:18:35,468 --> 01:18:35,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1056
01:18:36,669 --> 01:18:37,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, my friend.

1057
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:38,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1058
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, later.

1059
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:40,450
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

1060
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1061
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good call.

1062
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:45,011
[SPEAKER_05]: We always like hearing from Bobby.

1063
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,211
[SPEAKER_05]: More calls, please.

1064
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:47,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1065
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:48,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this?

1066
01:18:49,212 --> 01:18:51,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1067
01:18:51,112 --> 01:18:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a guy who's disappeared for far too long.

1068
01:18:54,373 --> 01:18:56,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, is this VXJasonXV?

1069
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be me.

1070
01:18:58,134 --> 01:18:59,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Howdy, how are you?

1071
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, uh...

1072
01:19:01,514 --> 01:19:06,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to the whole thing while I was working way too many damn hours at work

1073
01:19:23,016 --> 01:19:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, belated happy birthday to Orange Lounge Radio, belated happy birthday to you, Rob, and belated happy birthday to myself, because I am a whore for that kind of stuff.

1074
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:32,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, where's my present?

1075
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, where's mine?

1076
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

1077
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So, real reason, Ace Combat 6, holy cow.

1078
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:43,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, here's the game we didn't talk about yet.

1079
01:19:45,003 --> 01:19:46,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The, uh, yeah, no kidding.

1080
01:19:46,504 --> 01:19:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The, um...

1081
01:19:48,261 --> 01:20:02,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Monday I do believe it is I got a new monitor for my birthday and I have a nice little consolidation thing going on because it's my computer monitor for two different computers as well as my Xbox 360 screen and it does high definition.

1082
01:20:03,504 --> 01:20:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm finally running my 360 in 720p and a lot of things are looking a hell of a lot better than standard components.

1083
01:20:12,797 --> 01:20:42,289
[SPEAKER_04]: and I finally managed to get a hold of the demo from the E3 category and I played it and holy cow that game looks beautiful I don't know if it's satellite imagery high resolution satellite imagery or low level aircraft imagery of the landscapes but oh man they're doing a beautiful job with that that game was so fun just to look at and it played so well still I've loved that series ever since Air Combat on the Playstation

1084
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:50,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like simulations like Flight Simulator.

1085
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:59,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I love arcade-style games, and Air Combat and Ace Combat have always been that, and they are doing a good job continuing the series.

1086
01:20:59,803 --> 01:21:00,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1087
01:21:02,084 --> 01:21:03,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as free.

1088
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:08,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of teetering towards the more realistic flying, but still arcade dogfighting.

1089
01:21:09,224 --> 01:21:09,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

1090
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:11,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything else to say.

1091
01:21:11,485 --> 01:21:13,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I am buying that game the day it comes out.

1092
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:14,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, shame on you guys.

1093
01:21:14,507 --> 01:21:14,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1094
01:21:14,607 --> 01:21:15,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't know.

1095
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:16,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched a couple of the trailers, uh,

1096
01:21:35,578 --> 01:21:39,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Skate looks pretty boring, but I think that goes back to the whole simulation versus arcade thing.

1097
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:45,523
[SPEAKER_04]: The project, Prove Yourself, crap, Tony Hawk game.

1098
01:21:46,763 --> 01:21:47,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.

1099
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:49,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Proving Ground, thank you.

1100
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:50,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Mixing all those words up.

1101
01:21:52,106 --> 01:22:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Proving Ground seems to be going right down the same path, again, expanding on a few more elements, and it looks like it's a very true-to-form continuation of the series.

1102
01:22:02,058 --> 01:22:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I look at?

1103
01:22:03,099 --> 01:22:11,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful Katamari told me absolutely nothing new, but I don't know yet whether I'm going to like it if it's the same thing all over again or not.

1104
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:20,706
[SPEAKER_04]: The music was kind of... I don't know how to describe it, but the music is kind of making me teeter on the side that I might not be caring for that game too much.

1105
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman Live... Oh man, I haven't played a Bomberman game in forever.

1106
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:42,775
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailers and all of the media that Microsoft posted was really fun to look at and hopefully the rest of the year and into the first half of the next year when all this stuff is going to really all be coming out is going to not be too much of a drain on my banking account.

1107
01:22:44,456 --> 01:22:51,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, I know you've been a music game fan for a long time obviously because you've been with OLR for a long time and Actdeft brings up a very interesting question in chat.

1108
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if Jason will talk about Rock Band.

1109
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:54,459
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about Rock Band?

1110
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:55,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

1111
01:22:57,068 --> 01:23:01,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over this over a little bit in the forums, so all you people who aren't a part, go read.

1112
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always great to do that in between shows.

1113
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:13,372
[SPEAKER_04]: The aesthetics of cramming everything in for multiple person play seems to be really, really off.

1114
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:18,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The lyrics are probably going to be the most underused portion of that game, and for good reason.

1115
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:23,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Less people sing than sit there and play a guitar or a drum or anything else.

1116
01:23:24,394 --> 01:23:25,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know too much about the drum.

1117
01:23:26,196 --> 01:23:27,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Four versus five is kind of funny.

1118
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero goes five while Guitar Freaks is three.

1119
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:35,062
[SPEAKER_04]: The drum peripheral is going to be four while Drum Mania was five.

1120
01:23:37,783 --> 01:23:39,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never liked console Drum Mania.

1121
01:23:39,885 --> 01:23:45,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play it because I like Drum Mania in general, but I've played the arcade version of MGL.

1122
01:23:45,209 --> 01:23:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: The console version wasn't very faithful.

1123
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like cramming my arms that close together.

1124
01:23:50,632 --> 01:23:53,094
[SPEAKER_04]: What Bobby was saying was just kind of driving that point home again.

1125
01:23:57,063 --> 01:24:21,003
[SPEAKER_04]: bass I don't know I don't think I've got enough hands on with it on guitar here too but the vocals are going to be the lowest point other than that I'm still recognizing a couple of the songs which makes me happy enough that I'll actually have something to play and it looks like it's going to be fun you know for a game that's changing companies it looks like it's still going down a very good path for the general makeup and play of the game and fun is really what it's all about right?

1126
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,965
[SPEAKER_04]: hell yeah good music good game all right

1127
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Jason, we've got to let you go to get probably about one more call in here, but thanks so much for the call.

1128
01:24:27,824 --> 01:24:28,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it, okay?

1129
01:24:29,285 --> 01:24:29,445
Yep.

1130
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, take care, buddy.

1131
01:24:30,926 --> 01:24:31,286
[SPEAKER_04]: See you, guys.

1132
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:31,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1133
01:24:33,428 --> 01:24:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we always appreciate Jason when he gives us a call.

1134
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:36,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do about one more call.

1135
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:42,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've got a lot of people trying to get through tonight, but we also want to wrap up pretty soon here, so let's do at least one more call.

1136
01:24:42,835 --> 01:24:44,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1137
01:24:44,156 --> 01:24:44,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1138
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:46,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It's GS68.

1139
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:47,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, GS68.

1140
01:24:47,418 --> 01:24:47,839
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1141
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:49,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1142
01:24:50,749 --> 01:24:56,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I read about Ghost Squad coming out for the Wii, and that just reminded me about the arcade version.

1143
01:24:57,754 --> 01:24:59,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you heard about what coming out for the Wii?

1144
01:25:00,335 --> 01:25:01,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghost Squad for the Wii.

1145
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:02,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

1146
01:25:03,457 --> 01:25:17,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that's always bugged me about the arcade version is that, like, I went to the Philippines, and most of the Ghost Squad machines there have card slots, but, like, here in California, like, none of the machines have card slots, so I

1147
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:26,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only, like, go up to level 4 on the missions and only get... And I don't get a whole lot of stuff as much as on the card slots and machines.

1148
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:36,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like... I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit there, so I'm sorry, what was the question out of that?

1149
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:44,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like, yeah, like... One thing that's bugged me about that game, the arcade game, is that... Like, in the US, the...

1150
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:48,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, almost none of the machines in the U.S.

1151
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:55,852
[SPEAKER_01]: have car slots, but if I go to any other country with that game, like, the machines usually have car slots.

1152
01:25:55,872 --> 01:26:15,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I went to the Philippines earlier this year, and most of their machines there had car slots, which is nice, because, like, I get to have, like, more levels and features and stuff, and I just don't wonder why they don't, like, for games like that and the

1153
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:20,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Why... Like, why don't...

1154
01:26:22,996 --> 01:26:36,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you're talking about as far as the arcade scene goes and why is it that they have the cards in some places and not in others, I think it just has to do with the arcade scene in general here.

1155
01:26:36,303 --> 01:26:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's enough of a scene to support that type of technology here.

1156
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:45,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously Konami and DDR is one thing that comes to my mind like that and everything they're doing with EMUs overseas and things.

1157
01:26:46,008 --> 01:26:48,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just that Japanese has more of an arcade culture now

1158
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:53,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I look at Asian arcades and they have a lot of cool stuff like... There are pachinko places in the US, by the way.

1159
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:53,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

1160
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:53,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1161
01:27:14,124 --> 01:27:14,324
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1162
01:27:14,564 --> 01:27:17,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, anything you want to share about your thoughts with E3?

1163
01:27:17,587 --> 01:27:19,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there anything that really got you excited at E3?

1164
01:27:19,348 --> 01:27:20,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really catch.

1165
01:27:20,489 --> 01:27:22,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really caught up with E3.

1166
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:23,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't read much about it.

1167
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:27,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully you learned stuff here tonight by listening to the show.

1168
01:27:28,656 --> 01:27:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we could educate some folks.

1169
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:30,518
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1170
01:27:30,558 --> 01:27:32,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, thanks so much for the call, GS60.

1171
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:33,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it, okay?

1172
01:27:34,501 --> 01:27:34,961
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

1173
01:27:35,382 --> 01:27:35,602
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1174
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:36,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

1175
01:27:36,643 --> 01:27:37,003
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

1176
01:27:38,024 --> 01:27:38,384
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1177
01:27:39,136 --> 01:28:07,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's going to about do it because we're running almost an hour 40 for this segment so we really need to switch back over and wrap things up so I'm sorry to those calls we didn't get to tonight but we'll also take more calls next week I'm sure we always do so we're going to go around now and ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio any last minute stories I have a couple actually go for it this is more European news coming to Xbox Live Arcade there was Bomberman and Yaya Kung Fu on the 18th it'll be out July

1178
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:17,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the fifth Harry Potter game demo is on Xbox Live Arcade in the UK.

1179
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:19,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the record, it is out here as well.

1180
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:28,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but it's actually supposed to take up 2.55% of the 20 gig hard drive.

1181
01:28:28,802 --> 01:28:29,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1182
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Lost Planet PC is getting Mega Man.

1183
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:35,744
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of neat.

1184
01:28:35,964 --> 01:28:37,564
[SPEAKER_08]: A Mega Man patch for Lost Planet PC.

1185
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:39,671
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1186
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:13,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, if that's it, then Loki, anything you want to share?

1187
01:29:14,135 --> 01:29:15,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

1188
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:23,603
[SPEAKER_06]: IGN just did their Week in Review podcast, I guess, and one of the things that they mentioned is Rock Band coming to the Wii in 2008.

1189
01:29:23,643 --> 01:29:26,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's interesting.

1190
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:32,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Another interesting thing caught in, I guess, a trailer for Smash Bros.

1191
01:29:32,231 --> 01:29:35,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl is, I guess, Bulbin from...

1192
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:43,083
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zelda series is going to be either a assist trophy character or a playable character.

1193
01:29:44,603 --> 01:29:45,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1194
01:29:45,324 --> 01:29:45,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

1195
01:29:45,924 --> 01:29:46,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Bulbin.

1196
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one of those... I don't know if they're elves or what.

1197
01:29:51,985 --> 01:29:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Some sort of enemy from the game.

1198
01:29:55,406 --> 01:29:57,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, other interesting things...

1199
01:29:59,062 --> 01:30:01,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple Series, one of my favorite things to talk about.

1200
01:30:02,404 --> 01:30:03,565
[SPEAKER_06]: D3's lineup there.

1201
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:08,249
[SPEAKER_06]: They're releasing their first two volumes on the Wii.

1202
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:11,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Volume 1 looks like a kart racing game, I guess.

1203
01:30:12,152 --> 01:30:15,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one looks like a frog jumping game.

1204
01:30:16,114 --> 01:30:17,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of interesting.

1205
01:30:18,436 --> 01:30:21,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully those make their way out over here at some point.

1206
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:23,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, one thing we can't forget.

1207
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my wife might be looking forward to this.

1208
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:35,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Nitro Bike was announced for the Wii by Ubisoft, and it's being developed by Leftfield Productions, the creators of the classic Excitebike 64.

1209
01:30:35,999 --> 01:30:40,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of like, I guess, Excite Truck, but with bikes.

1210
01:30:41,064 --> 01:30:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Excitebike.

1211
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:46,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other interesting things.

1212
01:30:47,729 --> 01:30:51,712
[SPEAKER_06]: One game we've talked about here before, 2 Mickey Fighters.

1213
01:30:53,194 --> 01:30:53,754
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

1214
01:31:22,153 --> 01:31:22,713
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

1215
01:31:49,446 --> 01:31:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: As we get into, because, you know, now E3 was in July and not May, so there's a little less time before the fall rush.

1216
01:31:54,492 --> 01:31:56,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be looking forward to sharing that all with you.

1217
01:31:56,194 --> 01:32:00,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking of the fall, you know, we hit our 250th episode this fall, if you can believe that.

1218
01:32:01,027 --> 01:32:08,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of fun stuff in store, but we're not going to do anything special for it because, you know, we did the 200th show last year and the 5th year anniversary of this show.

1219
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:11,856
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to celebrate ourselves too much, but it certainly is a milestone that's interesting.

1220
01:32:11,936 --> 01:32:13,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day is a celebration.

1221
01:32:14,478 --> 01:32:18,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day is a new celebration of life.

1222
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:22,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, I noticed Loki's watching the Silent Hill Arcade videos on YouTube.

1223
01:32:22,804 --> 01:32:23,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks nice.

1224
01:32:23,485 --> 01:32:24,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't it look hot?

1225
01:32:24,185 --> 01:32:25,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the pyramid head thing?

1226
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:26,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

1227
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch the beginning of Part B. It's awesome.

1228
01:32:29,869 --> 01:32:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm watching the beginning of Part 2 right now.

1229
01:32:32,309 --> 01:32:33,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's in there then.

1230
01:32:33,569 --> 01:32:34,010
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see it.

1231
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:34,670
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1232
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Pyramid Head goes, Slice.

1233
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:37,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna die.

1234
01:32:39,731 --> 01:32:40,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he goes, Slice.

1235
01:32:40,891 --> 01:32:45,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And then right when it's about to hit the guy's head, it switches back to the day.

1236
01:32:46,172 --> 01:32:47,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever you want to call it.

1237
01:32:47,072 --> 01:32:49,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you said you weren't spoiling it for our listeners.

1238
01:32:49,553 --> 01:32:50,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I did.

1239
01:32:51,428 --> 01:32:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Robbie Meany, bud.

1240
01:32:52,408 --> 01:32:53,349
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to watch it.

1241
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:54,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't spoil anything.

1242
01:32:54,309 --> 01:32:55,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on IGN.

1243
01:32:55,649 --> 01:32:56,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll watch it.

1244
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:57,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be cool, though, if they brought it to the Wii.

1245
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:01,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks like these gun games are going to be taken off.

1246
01:33:03,172 --> 01:33:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan and I had an idea a while back.

1247
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,173
Point blank Wii.

1248
01:33:06,553 --> 01:33:10,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you remember the Biohazard Gun Survivor, right?

1249
01:33:10,714 --> 01:33:14,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And we got it over here as Resident Evil Gun Survivor and they took out the gun support.

1250
01:33:14,876 --> 01:33:16,036
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to play it with a controller.

1251
01:33:16,636 --> 01:33:19,237
[SPEAKER_08]: We were thinking back in the day how would the Dreamcast...

1252
01:33:19,775 --> 01:33:24,299
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember the Dreamcast gun had a controller on it, right?

1253
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:25,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1254
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't they do something like that with the Wii?

1255
01:33:31,284 --> 01:33:36,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Use the controller on it to do your motion, move back and forth, and then shoot with the gun?

1256
01:33:36,168 --> 01:33:37,429
[SPEAKER_08]: They could easily do those games.

1257
01:33:40,551 --> 01:33:42,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's kind of the way they did it.

1258
01:33:42,373 --> 01:33:46,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Resident Evil 2 Arcade, you used your actual gun as your direction.

1259
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:46,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1260
01:33:47,017 --> 01:34:05,645
[SPEAKER_05]: that was kind of cool too and then you got to shoot people dead here's one other game that came out of E3 I didn't hear any other news on but there's a new Trauma Center game that's going to come out for the Wii and this one actually supports widescreen and looks pretty and has new characters I'm very excited about a new Trauma Center game for the Wii because Trauma Center is awesome alright, what are you laughing about?

1261
01:34:05,825 --> 01:34:15,369
[SPEAKER_06]: they should have a game they should have like a game for Silent Hill Konami, hear me out on this I think you've got a hit with this

1262
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:22,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how these sim games and stuff like, you know, pets and dogs and cats and stuff's all really popular?

1263
01:34:22,662 --> 01:34:29,163
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have a Pyramid Head game where you just, you know, you take care of Pyramid Head or you are Pyramid Head and you feed him corpses.

1264
01:34:29,183 --> 01:34:36,565
[SPEAKER_06]: You feed him corpses and you can, you know, feed him, let him rape stuff, you know, and you can slice people with the blade.

1265
01:34:36,805 --> 01:34:40,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I think we take our Pyramid Head love a little bit too far on this program.

1266
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:41,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's just me.

1267
01:34:42,046 --> 01:34:44,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1268
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:45,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, go ahead and start us off tonight.

1269
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:52,993
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is there's going to be more announcements coming out.

1270
01:34:53,173 --> 01:34:55,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everything gets announced at E3.

1271
01:34:56,095 --> 01:34:59,117
[SPEAKER_06]: God's sake, most people nowadays have their own gamer days and shit.

1272
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I twisted my ankle earlier and it kind of hurts.

1273
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:04,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Owie.

1274
01:35:05,621 --> 01:35:07,303
