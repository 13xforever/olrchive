00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here live on this Sunday evening, July the 15th of 2007.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,200
We're going through the E3 wrap-up, of course.

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Now, I know you guys have probably been reading about it on the various blogs, but maybe there's

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,840
some things that we caught that maybe slipped off your radars, off the cracks.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,160
And of course, you know, we didn't get to go to E3 this year, so we're just kind of

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,600
like a lot of you guys on the outside looking in.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
And so we're kind of collecting our thoughts.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,000
What do the people who weren't there think about it?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,440
What are the gaming fans who didn't get to go to E3 this year really think about it?

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Because hey, it's our money.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
We're spending it.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,040
So we're going to talk tonight about what we thought of the various news there from

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
E3.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,080
And we talked about Nintendo and Microsoft and Part A. Let's go on to the last press

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,800
conference, which was Sony.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Yes.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,320
And one of the big things coming from the Sony press conference, which some might say

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,200
is not really surprising, is a new PSP coming in September.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,520
Not necessarily the PSP 2, but a redesigned PSP.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,200
I guess people are kind of dubbing it PlayStation Portable Slim.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,160
It's supposed to be 33% lighter, 19% slimmer, has a longer battery life, and is also going

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,600
to be having a video out on it as well, which is kind of cool.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,720
We'll be retailing for $169.99, so the same price as a normal PSP now.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
And we'll eventually replace those as well.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,240
And it will be loaded with the 3.6 firmware, so probably seeing goodbye to homebrew with

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
that at least.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
That's their hopes.

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,040
Other interesting things, it will be offered in three different colors, black, silver,

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,880
and white, all a little bit glossy, kind of like the DS Lite.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,400
And also, the ice silver will be a part of a $1.99 entertainment package that's going

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,160
to be with a 1GB memory stick, Daxter, and Family Guy's freaking suite collection on

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
UMD.

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,600
Also, they're going to be releasing a white Star Wars themed PSP that will retail for

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
$1.99.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,000
And also, it will be packaged with Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,760
So that is coming in September.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Looks interesting.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,180
I might actually sell my second PSP to get one of these as well, because I like the idea

39
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,840
of video out.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,200
Video out does sound pretty cool, and I know a lot of people kind of wrote it off, like

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,680
whoop-de-doo, video out, you know, who cares.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,760
But you know, it does make those UMDs at least a little more usable that you can have them

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,640
on your TV, but also, just getting to play, you know, some of these games, like the Final

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Fantasy remake and stuff like on my big TV.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,240
If you think about it, if you're looking at, you know, possibly just using this as like

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,400
even, you know, portable and stand-alone video player at home, if you don't want to buy DVDs,

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,480
a lot of these UMDs are going for like dirt cheap, and you can pick them up, you know,

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,580
probably use pretty, under five bucks, so.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,720
How are they going to look when blown up to a big screen though?

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,360
They will be 480p, so it will look like a DVD.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
It's not bad.

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
I guess they're encoded at DVD bit rates, it's just, it's shrunken down to the PSP screen,

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
so.

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Really sharp.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,160
It will be pretty sharp, I guess, on normal screen.

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
It shouldn't be too bad, I don't know.

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Maybe it might be letterbox or something.

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah, I'm kind of excited about the video out, but the problem is I already own a PSP,

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,840
so I don't really want to buy a whole new one just for video out.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't on the first, but I guess this

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,680
is how they get you to buy another one, I don't know.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Here's the thing though.

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,920
The video out uses the serial port that's on the bottom of the PSP.

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,560
Supposedly this one's redesigned.

65
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm not sure if that's actually the case, but they're seeing it's redesigned.

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,800
So it's possible with this new firmware update 3.6 that maybe with the current ones you can

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
do that, but.

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Please let that be the case.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,120
It would be not, it wouldn't be too surprising if they don't mention that until later on.

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,440
Much like certain other stories we'll get into later, where they don't mention certain

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,800
aspects of things.

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
Alright, fair enough.

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,120
So do you think you'll pick up a PSP redesign?

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,320
I think I will just because I have two of them right now and I want to sell one of them

75
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,360
or at least get rid of it because I have no use for it right now, and that'd be a good

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
excuse to buy one of those because it wouldn't really cost me much.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
The other thing though about it though, this is kind of a trend you'll see at the Sony

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,080
press conference, something that they've been denying and denying, yet people are saying

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,160
it's going to be happening and we've heard rumors and lo and behold, it's true.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Kind of a trend that's going along with it.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,400
We shall see as we continue throughout the press conference stories here.

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Well there is something that I have to say that I actually expected this.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,800
You know with all of the rumors going around about exclusive game this and exclusive game

84
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:17,960
but I honestly, this is what I expected, is that Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be exclusive

85
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,080
to the PS3.

86
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
Reaffirmed.

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,000
Not buying it.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not buying it.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And this is why.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Okay, it may be a PS3 exclusive when it comes out.

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,340
I do not doubt that it's going to come to the 360 eventually because it would be dumb

92
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,560
for them to ignore the entire Xbox 360 user base.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,240
It's not because they're plain sides or anything, it's just about money.

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,040
They want to sell as many copies of this as possible.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,600
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a release on the Xbox 360 maybe later on.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,400
I will be surprised.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I don't think it's going to happen.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,720
I think it's going to stay on PS3.

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,940
I think it really all depends on sales.

100
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,800
I can totally see how it could happen where one of the Metal Gears ended up coming out

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
for GameCube later on.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
I think the first Metal Gear was redone.

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,400
I could see something like that happening and this seems to happen a lot with the Metal

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Gear series where it shows up on the Sony platform first and then kind of mutates into

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,000
a special edition thing that comes out on Xbox or whatever later on but a year later.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,920
I could see something like that happening if the sales aren't strong enough on its own.

107
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,880
So it's really going to depend but a year is such a long wait that it's not going to

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,360
have a huge impact as far as the fanboys are concerned.

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,320
I think what you can count on, you can count on them not announcing another platform until

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,960
well after the game is out.

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,440
I think that is something that will be a given.

112
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,960
Unless, for whatever reason, Sony has a really shitty fourth quarter and they don't sell

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,880
that many units or whatever and it's looking like, hey, we're not going to sell that many

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
units of Metal Gear Solid 4, maybe we should rethink this exclusive thing because exclusives

115
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
change all the time.

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,640
I'm thinking Konami has not only done this with the Metal Gear series but Silent Hill

117
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
as well.

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,600
Silent Hill 2 was out on the PlayStation 2 first and the Wrestle Streams came out on

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,020
Xbox.

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,600
Little things like that happen.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Hit Stunt says, I wouldn't doubt if Konami is contractually obligated to say it's not

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,760
coming to any other system until the PlayStation 3 version comes out, just like the standard

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,600
six month delay like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Virtua Fighter 5.

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
But you know what?

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,600
It's good for them that they do have this because at least this is something, hey, maybe

126
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,360
this will sell a few systems for them.

127
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
They need all they can take.

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,880
Well, we'll see where that leads but nevertheless the Xbox 360 folks who were convinced it was

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,160
coming to their platform get a little bit of a setback.

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,560
I suppose hope is never lost but hope has been diminished quite a bit.

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,080
Speaking of exclusives, another exclusive that was announced on the PlayStation 3 is

132
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
Unreal Tournament 3.

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,200
Now it was only affirmed as a timed exclusive for the PlayStation 3 but that does mean if

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,480
you're a Sony fan and you got your PlayStation, you're going to get it first on the PlayStation

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
3.

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,120
As far as the timed thing, I could care less.

137
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,760
I think this is the much cooler part about it is that you're going to be able to use

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,800
mods on the PlayStation 3 and the PC version.

139
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,520
Now the PC version will come out a little later but that's kind of cool for the modding

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,920
community of which a game like Unreal gets a lot of this stuff is that the mods you make

141
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
for PC you're going to be able to use on PS3 as well.

142
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
That's cool.

143
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
And they're saying everything from just weapon mods to total conversions for it are going

144
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
to be available.

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,920
So that's tons of extra content for it which is awesome.

146
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,720
Now we need Duke Nukem 3D with mods and stuff and that'd be cool too.

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
We shall see.

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,400
What's pretty interesting about the whole Unreal Tournament 3 thing is as of May it

149
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,200
was actually going to be exclusive to the 360 so kind of flip-flopped there.

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,840
Amazing what money can do.

151
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,600
Something very interesting, probably a little bit surprising would be that NCSoft has actually

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,960
pledged support for the PlayStation 3 platform and are going to be releasing exclusive PlayStation

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,880
3 online games.

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,880
So not sure if they're actually going to be bringing their current titles over like

155
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,600
Lineage, Guild Wars, City of Heroes and stuff like that but they will be making at least

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,720
some of their current IPs and new IPs available for the platform.

157
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,920
So that's pretty awesome.

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
I think NCSoft is a pretty rad company and I like games like Guild Wars and so that's

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,240
pretty exciting that they're going to be bringing some more stuff to the consoles and if they

160
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
want to go with PlayStation 3 then good for them.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm sure Sony's very happy with that announcement.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm still waiting on those online games that they were talking about at E3 the year before.

163
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,380
Do you think that maybe some of those are being now ported to PlayStation 3?

164
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,400
I don't see why they weren't all that big graphic monsters.

165
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,520
Maybe if they did all of them at once but I think that their whole intention was having

166
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,200
a big service available to people just to come in and play.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
That's what I want to see.

168
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
Do you think we might see Guild Wars 2 on the PlayStation 3?

169
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
I hope not.

170
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Shit.

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,640
I hate MMOs on consoles.

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Really?

173
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,200
MMOs should stick to freaking PCs unless they are specifically made for a console.

174
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,660
I disagree on Guild Wars because I believe since the whole format of Guild Wars is you

175
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,720
buy the game and you go online for free.

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,160
That really works for a console because they pay those monthly fees and stuff and then

177
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,160
maybe a little bit more casual and later on when they offer their expansions or whatever

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,080
you can download those as a microtransaction or whatever.

179
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,920
That would actually work very well for consoles whereas an MMO like Final Fantasy XI or something,

180
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
not as good as normal.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Interesting points.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We shall see what ends up happening.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well, as far as other stuff, for people who wanted the 60GB PS3, it actually will get

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,800
it while you can because we're not going to be getting any more.

185
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,400
So yeah, let's cut the price and then get rid of them.

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,640
Seems to me like a clearance option.

187
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,200
Like Overstock, you know?

188
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,560
Buy all this.

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,280
It's a bait and switch is what it is.

190
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, because the 80GB is going to be coming out for $600 next.

191
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,600
And it costs Sony less to make because they put the cheaper emulation thing in it.

192
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,160
That's a nasty fucking trick they played on the hardcore audience.

193
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,840
Most casual gamers aren't going to figure it out, but in my mind that was a bit of a

194
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
nasty trick.

195
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,760
They did the same thing though with the 20GB system.

196
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,320
It was only available until about December.

197
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,480
Despite what they say, it was unavailable to buy after about December.

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,920
And it's just to give you the impression that you really want that 20GB one, but you can't

199
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
find it and you really, really want the system so you're going to spend the extra hundred

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,480
dollars on it because you get this free game now and all that stuff.

201
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
But I don't know, I'm not surprised.

202
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,160
You know what sucks for our friends in Europe is that they're not getting a price cut.

203
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,480
Instead, what they're getting is a bundle with some first party titles and another six

204
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,360
axis controller for 115 pounds.

205
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Which in my mind just reaffirms why Sony's doing this.

206
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not so much about, oh, we're going to give the US a price cut.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,640
It's about, oh, we need to stop losing so much money on the systems, so we're going

208
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,920
to give the US the system we've been putting out in Europe that costs us less to make.

209
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,200
Well, they'll be getting a choice to pick from Resistance Fall of Man, Motorstorm, Genji,

210
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,800
Days of the Blade, Formula One, Championship Edition, Ridge Racer 7, two of those plus

211
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,720
the two six axis controllers and it'll be available.

212
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,280
It's actually due on sale on the 18th of July for the UK and starting in Europe on the first

213
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,840
of August.

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,040
Well, if you want to get a PlayStation 3 and emulation is of a concern to you, maybe you

215
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,240
don't have a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1, this would probably be the time to get

216
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
it.

217
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
I mean, honestly, if there's one positive thing you could say about this is that it

218
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,760
does give you the chance to snatch up that system while you still can.

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,240
Be sure to read the labels carefully.

220
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,520
The new systems will show you.

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,120
It has a little warning about the emulation on the new box that says not all games are

222
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
actually playable.

223
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Now, you know, it wouldn't be fair to mention this and then not mention, well, you know,

224
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,240
the Xbox 360 uses software emulation as well, so to rag Sony for cutting back on the emulation

225
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
may be a little bit unfair, I don't know, but however, I don't know.

226
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,360
You do still feel like the sense of loss with this whole little switch going on and the

227
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,240
fact that they're, you know, maybe I don't want to dig out my PlayStation 2 and I'm

228
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,440
going to go through all this to hook up my PlayStation 3.

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I don't know.

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
All right.

231
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,400
Well, anyhow, let's go on to another game that was announced by Sony.

232
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,960
Now, this is something original and this is good because Sony needs to have more original

233
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,400
fun stuff, more original IPs to really differentiate themselves from Microsoft, and so they came

234
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,480
up with a game called Echo Chrome.

235
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,280
This is something that was introduced by Phil Harrison, and what's very interesting about

236
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,120
Echo Chrome is that the graphics are very simplistic.

237
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,320
They're black and white MC Escher-style drawings, and what's kind of cool, I watched a video

238
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,740
of this game in motion, is that the way you rotate the screen around will affect the way

239
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,960
the painting looks, thusly affecting the little runner that runs around the painting.

240
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,440
Now, there's little holes and little launch pads and little gaps that as you rotate the

241
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,620
screen become filled because of your perspective.

242
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,440
It's a very interesting type of thing for a puzzle game.

243
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,140
It's certainly not going to push the envelope as far as next-gen graphics are concerned,

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,380
but the graphics are crisp, according to folks that have seen it, crisp, clean, sharp graphics

245
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,520
that might actually be kind of fun.

246
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,520
But I look at this and I kind of go, this looks like it better be a download title.

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,200
I could not see myself paying 60 bucks for something like this.

248
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
It's going to be a download title.

249
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Thank God.

250
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
It's also coming with a PSP.

251
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Okay, cool.

252
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,920
Well, it's a download title that looks pretty rad.

253
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,440
That's right up there with some of the classics on Xbox Live Arcade.

254
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,260
It could be pretty awesome.

255
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,680
So good for them with something original that gets people going, oh, something new as opposed

256
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,100
to a sequel to the same old thing.

257
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,640
Other things that they're showing off there, one other thing for the redesigned PSP is

258
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,840
it's going to actually have an improved UMD slot there, so you're not going to have any

259
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,800
launched UMDs from dropping the system on the ground.

260
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,720
Also it's going to have double the RAM, so it's going to load those UMDs a little bit

261
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
faster.

262
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Plus, it's supposed to make web browsing a little bit easier, be able to load some of

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,840
the larger pages out there and stuff.

264
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,240
Other things they were showing off, Gran Turismo 5.

265
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,920
It's going to be coming out, of course, next year at some point.

266
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,760
They're going to be releasing a Gran Turismo 5 prologue to the PlayStation Network.

267
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,480
That's going to be just like Gran Turismo HD, a little bit of a demo taste of it as

268
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
you will.

269
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,560
Also, they were showing home and some of the improvements done to that.

270
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,960
They've redesigned the whole lobby system for it.

271
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
It looks almost like an outdoor mall.

272
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,120
Also you'll be able to jump into multiplayer games with people as well.

273
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,960
That's pretty much the big stuff they were showing off on their network.

274
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,920
My only gripe with them, remember last week how we were talking about, oh yeah, they're

275
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,840
going to be bringing demos and videos to the PlayStation Network.

276
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,080
It's going to be just like the Xbox Live thing.

277
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,880
They're going to be bringing it home and stuff.

278
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
No they didn't.

279
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
They brought videos.

280
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,020
Great, because I can watch those all over the internet and stuff.

281
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,760
Not a single demo.

282
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,960
Bobby Blackwolf has asked why you're not mentioning Chewbacca.

283
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay, Chewbacca announced the PSP redesign thing with Darth Vader.

284
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Great.

285
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,200
At least that guy is still getting work.

286
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,720
Same thing we've done before for all of the other three conferences.

287
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Chat room, I ask for your opinion as well.

288
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,320
What did you think of the Sony press conference?

289
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Rate it on scale.

290
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Tell me what you thought.

291
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Who wants to go first?

292
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,020
Well right, Dark Soccer without resounding yawn.

293
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
Is that your summary?

294
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Yeah.

295
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Okay.

296
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Short and sweet.

297
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
Loki.

298
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,480
I think their whole theme of promises, promises and not following through has kind of shown

299
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,680
through again this year.

300
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,500
The price cut, they made it look like a price cut but it's actually not a price cut which

301
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,840
is fucked up.

302
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Not to mention some other stuff we'll get into a little bit later on that's also fucked

303
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,720
up especially if you buy a system now.

304
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,200
And just this whole, oh look at all these games that are coming out and not mentioning,

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,240
oh by the way they're not coming out until next year.

306
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,280
I do have to give them props on Killzone 2 though.

307
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,580
That looks fucking amazing.

308
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,240
And that is about the only thing.

309
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Thank you for satisfying a chat comment before I read it.

310
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,880
Tigerclaw was just complaining, we forgot to mention the new Killzone 2 trailer.

311
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,520
I didn't forget to mention it.

312
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
I didn't mention it on purpose.

313
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,640
It looks really good and it's actually, it's a game I want to buy now because it looks

314
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,160
kind of like Resistance a bit.

315
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,120
You know, Resistance with a little bit of Gears of War thrown in there and I think that's

316
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
pretty awesome.

317
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
It impressed me a lot more than Halo 3 did.

318
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,680
So you know, props to them for that but the problem is it's not coming out this year.

319
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,360
So once again you're show me shit that, you know, I'm not going to buy your Playstation

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,680
3 for these games that are coming out next year.

321
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,240
At least I wouldn't be buying it if I didn't have one right now this holiday season which

322
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,680
is really where it's going to count for you guys.

323
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,120
It's, I'll be buying it when it comes out, you know, actually in the summer of next year

324
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,260
or whatever.

325
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,380
So it doesn't do them any good for this holiday.

326
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,840
Once again, if they don't come out with something amazing, they're going to lose out on another

327
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
holiday.

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,800
It's really going to hurt them.

329
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,240
The only thing I really care about coming out of there is, of course, Silent Hill 5

330
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,200
and I really want Metal Gear Solid 4.

331
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,240
As far as my thoughts on Sony's press conference, you know, I said before last week that Nintendo

332
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,520
had the most to lose going into E3 and Sony had the most to gain.

333
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,960
Getting a new Civ game?

334
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,440
Well, yeah, but that's, well it's also coming on Xbox 360 though.

335
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,680
I downloaded the trailer and I'm pretty excited about that.

336
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,240
But that's different.

337
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,040
You know, I think Sony did a way better job than they did last year.

338
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,680
I think, you know, they certainly changed the tone of their press conference and had

339
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,720
it a little well oiled and got the kinks a little better, worked out this year.

340
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,040
But I still walked away from it being more excited about the PSP than the Playstation

341
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
3.

342
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,280
And I don't know if that's a good sign.

343
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,640
This whole bait and switch leaves a real bad taste to my mind.

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Here's the problem.

345
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,480
Last year, remember, last year it was all, oh, Gran Turismo 5, it's going to be like

346
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,560
Gran Turismo HD and stuff, but better and all this stuff.

347
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,440
No Gran Turismo 5 this year.

348
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,200
And then this, you know, the E3, ooh, Gran Turismo 5, it's so awesome and stuff.

349
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,840
You know, and it does look really good, but Project Gotham 4 also looks really good.

350
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,600
And if this game is going to take, you know, until Summer 08 to come out, they're going

351
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,400
to have Project Gotham Racing 5, which is going to look even more amazing.

352
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,720
And it's just, it's all this promising of really good games that are coming out way

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
later.

354
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
That's the problem.

355
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,360
It's not like Microsoft where it's like, here's these great games, they're coming out this

356
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Fall.

357
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,920
You know, get excited for them because they're right around the corner, whereas this stuff

358
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,720
is coming way later on.

359
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
Yeah, I kind of feel the same way as that.

360
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,520
You know, it sounds like I'll have a lot more to get excited about with the Playstation 3

361
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
at next year's E3.

362
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Exactly.

363
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,200
Like Final Fantasy XIII is there, but is it going to be too late?

364
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't know.

365
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,360
Or remember, like, you know, they're showing LittleBigPlanet, that's next year.

366
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,200
They're talking about Home, which I hope that's this year.

367
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,760
I mean, it's, yeah, I don't know.

368
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,160
So it's just disappointing in that sense.

369
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
I don't know.

370
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Part of me on a scale of 1 to 10 wants to give Sony a question mark for, I just don't

371
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
know.

372
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,680
Like, their press conference looks like the town of Silent Hill.

373
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,640
There's too much haze around everything for me.

374
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,000
I will give them, I will reward them for their PSP redesign, even though, you know, they're

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,440
taking the old ones away or whatever's supposed to be happening.

376
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,960
You know, I give that good points, but the Playstation 3, although some games look cool,

377
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,980
I'm not completely blown away, but I give them credit.

378
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,760
I give them the most improved player award.

379
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,740
I would give their conference a 6.

380
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Explain this to me.

381
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,360
Why should I get a PS3 with a larger hard drive when there's nothing to download for

382
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
it?

383
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,440
There's trailers for movies, there's trailers for games, there's literally less than ten

384
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,000
demos online, and there's a handful of, you know, Playstation download titles.

385
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,920
So am I buying this larger hard drive system for, you know, so I can dump some of my games

386
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,560
stuff to the hard drive so it can cache the system and make it run faster since the Blu

387
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,840
Ray drive's too slow?

388
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,720
I mean, it's, they haven't really shown me why we need to buy a system with a larger

389
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
hard drive in the first place.

390
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,040
They're really pushing, trust me, hard drive space is not what's holding people back from

391
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,160
buying your system.

392
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Black Wolf says, going to chat room, all three companies pretty much surrendered the press

393
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
conferences.

394
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,040
Flora Dean says, Sony fails three.

395
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,540
Dark Tetsuya says, I liked everything I saw except the new Ratchet and Clank, which should

396
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,400
just be released on Playstation 2 if it's not already.

397
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,000
SSJ100Matt says, Sony, they showed everyone what they wanted, games, Killzone 2, Unreal

398
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
3, etc.

399
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,280
They showed that the Playstation 3 has real future, solid B+, A-.

400
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,200
You know what, I will give them credit for this and maybe, actually, maybe I'll bump

401
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,580
up my score to a seven for this sole reason, the eye of judgment was nowhere to be seen.

402
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,440
So I will bump up Sony's score to seven for scrapping that piece of shit.

403
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,000
They showed it on the show floor, so that was there.

404
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,560
We're great in the conference, so I'll give them the bonus point.

405
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,080
I will give them the same as I gave Nintendo a six, just because it's promises, and I think

406
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
there's going to be, you know, where the disappointments were with the whole...

407
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Black Wolf says, eye of judgment was not on the floor.

408
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,240
Well, I saw a video of it, so I know that it was there in some...

409
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,520
Maybe behind a door that maybe...

410
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Bobby didn't look behind.

411
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,280
Well, it was there, they were showing it, but, you know, I just...

412
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,600
I think people are going to get...

413
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,920
It's going to be a whole line of disappointments with Sony, and that's just...

414
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,080
As we go through the fourth quarter, it's just going to be disappointment after disappointment.

415
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,900
I think the PlayStation 3 is really set to go the same way as the PSP.

416
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,840
It's not going to get really, really cool until like three years later, or two or three

417
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
years later.

418
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah, unfortunately.

419
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Kind of interesting.

420
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,360
All right.

421
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,620
Black Wolf says it might have been in their invite-only hotel suite.

422
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,680
He wanted to ask about the copying of cards just for you, about going to Kinko's and making

423
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
your own cards.

424
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Here's their reasoning behind it.

425
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
They're saying...

426
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,740
They basically didn't give a reason.

427
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,480
There's no copy protection on the cards, but their thing was, you know, it would be like

428
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,440
playing Magic the Gathering with someone with photocopied cards.

429
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,340
Like you'd really play someone with photocopied cards.

430
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,080
That was their reasoning behind it.

431
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,480
So in other words, yes, you can copy the cards or download images off the internet instead

432
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,440
of buying booster packs and copying the card stock, and it'll work just fine.

433
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,880
The Rob D. asks, the PSP is really, really cool?

434
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
I might buy a PSP for the emulation.

435
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,000
All right, maybe less of the really, really.

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,040
But you know, the PSP has never been solely a gaming system.

437
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,380
I do respect the system for everything else it can do, like being kind of a little mini

438
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,480
media kit.

439
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,240
But yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff that have come out for it in the past year.

440
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,660
I think they can't be ignored.

441
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,320
But did you notice, though, that they're kind of making the PSP out now to be almost like

442
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,360
more of an iPod or a Zune or something?

443
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,920
Because now it has a video out thing on it, and you're going to be able to charge it using

444
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,000
the USB cable on there as well.

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
So if you're on the go, you can charge it and stuff.

446
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,740
And then of course, memory stick prices are coming down quite a bit.

447
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,380
So I don't know.

448
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
It's interesting.

449
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:42,000
Their PR department is so horrible, so horrible, and their upper management needs to shut the

450
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
hell up.

451
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
It's not helping them.

452
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,880
And I know Ken Kutaragi's gone now because he was making dumb statements before and stuff.

453
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,560
But my god, Kazurai is not any better.

454
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,440
It's not any better with him.

455
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,960
All right, well, there you have it.

456
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,160
Our thoughts on the Sony press conference.

457
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,880
Let's go now to some more listener feedback via the email bag, because we love to get

458
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
emails.

459
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,920
And if you weren't in our chat room tonight and you want to give your two cents to the

460
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,360
press conferences or anything you saw at E3, send us an email, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com,

461
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,200
because Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and reads a few of her favorite pieces

462
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
of email here with us.

463
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
So Dark Sakura?

464
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,920
Hee hee hee, Captain Crayola.

465
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:29,200
Jump in the mailbag and pull something out for us, will you?

466
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Email.

467
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Hi, OLR crew.

468
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,280
I guess this is where I should say I'm a long time listener, but a first time emailer.

469
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,200
I first heard about your show from Bobby Black Wolf.

470
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,680
He's an old friend of mine from the days when we were moderators on the forums for a TV

471
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,600
channel that are left unmentioned and have been listening to the podcast on and off for

472
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
about a year.

473
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,820
I always find the show enjoyable and you've become one of my mainstays for relatively

474
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,560
unbiased or biased in a way that matches my own opinions at gaming news.

475
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Recently I listened to the podcast of your five year plus one episode and I have a bone

476
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,120
to pick with Loki and Rob regarding the Harvest Moon series.

477
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,040
Loki is on record as enjoying sandbox games and the Harvest Moon series fits this description

478
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,240
to a T. The games have something for everyone.

479
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,560
Real time strategy fans can strategize to get the most crops each season, those who

480
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,760
enjoy dating sims can and most of the games date the NPCs, culminating in creating a family.

481
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Action fans can have fun catching fish, chopping down trees and planting endless fields of

482
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,840
grass, RPG fans can engage in as many tedious and pointless quests as have ever been found

483
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,340
in one game.

484
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,480
There are no expectations and certainly no requirements for the manner in which one plays

485
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,440
the game, what's not to love.

486
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,300
Not liking the series because farming isn't for you makes more sense than disliking them

487
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,680
because all the games are the same.

488
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,240
After all doesn't Halo do the same thing?

489
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,120
Anyway my husband and I love the show and are looking forward to listening for years

490
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
to come.

491
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Thanks for brightening up our week.

492
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Yours the black monster.

493
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,200
P.S. this email was written on a G4 titanium power book.

494
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,280
I'll address this.

495
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,020
It's not a sandbox game, it's a sim for one.

496
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,840
It's a farming sim and granted yeah it has RPG elements and stuff like that, much like

497
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Animal Crossing is also like a sim.

498
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,680
It's basically you're doing tasks and stuff.

499
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Same kind of thing.

500
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Let's go for the game.

501
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,580
My problem with it, and you may want to compare it to Halo I guess, yeah Microsoft isn't releasing

502
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,720
eight copies of the game a year.

503
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,840
I mean seriously there are so many Harvest Moon games they're saying that are different

504
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,560
but aren't really different.

505
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,320
Like there's the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls which I'm going to take a wild guess and say

506
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,440
it's probably just like the Harvest Moon Boys and Girls on the GameCube and stuff like that.

507
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,560
There's the whole innocent life of futuristic Harvest Moon or something like that which

508
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,040
was just like a futuristic setting, still farming and still all the same stuff.

509
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,180
Great if that's for you, awesome.

510
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
It's not a sandbox game.

511
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,040
This is not Grand Theft Auto farming.

512
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,120
See this is the problem is that this game doesn't involve guns and violence.

513
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,560
That's where your problem is.

514
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,640
The problem is it doesn't change.

515
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,320
It's not innovating any.

516
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,120
I mean it's farming.

517
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Okay great.

518
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,280
Are there different crops this time?

519
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Oh goody.

520
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,040
I mean it's not like you have a crop or something and you have to fight off the man who's trying

521
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,840
to steal your property to build a mall or something on it.

522
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,240
I think what's going on here is that sandbox is kind of being seen as a very general term

523
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,760
where Loki likes a very specific type of sandbox game like the 3D jump, shoot, find, destroy

524
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,400
rape type of sandbox game.

525
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,320
Sandbox games are basically games you can go in there and do whatever you want and tackle

526
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
it however you want.

527
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,520
This is a farming, this is a sim game.

528
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:51,880
You start off with crops, you tend to the crops and stuff and it's a farming sim with

529
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,560
RPG elements.

530
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,480
From my perspective I've tried Harvest Moon.

531
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,360
I played the one on the GameCube and I just couldn't get into it.

532
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,680
I think for me there was just kind of like too much going on at once.

533
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,480
It didn't have that kind of simplicity that Animal Crossing had but I don't know.

534
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,160
I guess maybe I need to give the series another look because if I like Animal Crossing I should

535
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,560
like something like Harvest Moon but I just wasn't feeling it.

536
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,280
There was nothing to keep me coming back.

537
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:28,680
What they need to do is instead of releasing four or five titles a year of Harvest Moon,

538
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,720
just release one good title of Harvest Moon each year and do it that way.

539
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,640
Put some more effort into the game instead of just rehashing the same thing and giving

540
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
a new coat of paint.

541
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,880
A devil's advocate, I have to, I may not agree with what I'm about to say but devil's advocate

542
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
I have to.

543
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,160
Doesn't DDR do the same damn thing?

544
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Yes it does.

545
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,320
It does the same damn thing and that's another reason why that series is starting to go downhill.

546
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,920
It's because that's all they do is just give it a new fresh coat of paint, change the colors

547
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,240
of the menu or something and then just add some new songs and that's it and expect you

548
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
to buy it.

549
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,000
Can we talk about something other than Harvest Moon now?

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Absolutely.

551
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
This next email is super cool.

552
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,220
Dear OLR crew, this is Rama the Blind from Indonesia.

553
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,520
I finally wrote my second email to you and I hope I could share some video game related

554
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,600
contents that might interest you all and all of your listeners.

555
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,920
First of all, I would like to announce that I finally bought a Wii.

556
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,840
That's because I've got nostalgia for old Nintendo systems so I wish I could play some

557
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,840
of the old classic games via virtual console or perhaps I could hear my friends play the

558
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,600
games as my condition makes me impossible to play all the games.

559
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,100
I tried experimenting with the Wiimote and discovered that Wii bowling is actually playable

560
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
by the blind.

561
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,520
Even though I cannot control the ball accurately, the game is still fun for the blind.

562
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,200
By measuring the distance between both sides, left and right TV screen, I can move my Wii

563
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,160
mote within the range and that's how Wii bowling becomes playable as I don't need to see the

564
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,620
screen.

565
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,220
Right now, I'm still trying some other Wii titles and I hope I could discover more games

566
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,480
for blinds to play.

567
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,400
I wish that Nintendo could make a research about this and perhaps create accessible contents

568
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
for the blind to purchase.

569
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,640
So you guys, do you have any comments about this?

570
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
Well I appreciate hearing back because it's always interesting to hear from this kind

571
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,080
of like perspective that doesn't often get enough recognition at large in gaming blogs

572
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
and things.

573
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,400
There were sound games on the Saturn back in the day.

574
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,480
Why can't Nintendo do that?

575
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm actually going to turn around and ask another question.

576
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm really curious because I bet this email was sent in before Nintendo's press conference

577
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
this week.

578
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm really curious what this emailer thinks about some of these other new innovations

579
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,720
like Wii Fit and some of these other directions that Nintendo's going that has a little more

580
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,600
to do with movement.

581
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
That makes sense.

582
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,520
Well, email us back, actually I'm going to have to ask him to email us back because of

583
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
the next part.

584
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Did you have a comment?

585
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:51,440
Oh, I was just going to say that unfortunately blind gamers are such a small percentage of

586
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,600
their demographic that I don't think you're ever going to see anything that's really dedicated

587
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,800
to it unless you get some independent company out there that's really gearing towards that.

588
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,440
There's no reason for them to make sound based games unless they can do something pretty

589
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,000
innovative because there was some stuff on the Game Boy Advance that was just part of

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,840
that bit generation series but it's just unfortunately blind handicapped and stuff.

591
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,320
It is such a small area for them that there's unfortunately not going to see much publishers

592
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,720
out there focusing on that.

593
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,960
What about something that would make the existing games more accessible to the audience?

594
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,680
That's great if they can do something like that.

595
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,040
I sort of think about how Windows has the zoom feature and those other types of accessibility

596
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,840
options.

597
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,800
Could a game console adapt something similar?

598
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
That's possible.

599
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I don't know.

600
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
World Combat Armageddon though would probably be a lot easier to play.

601
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,240
You can waggle the thing around and throw...

602
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Broadcalibur!

603
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Anyhow, sorry.

604
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Let the email finish.

605
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,480
The next part is another thing I would like to share is a Final Fantasy concert held in

606
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
my country.

607
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,040
Actually, this is the second one as the concert was also held last year but it was still enjoyable

608
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,080
especially in Indonesia where video game music is rare to find and game music concert is

609
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
like a distant dream.

610
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,680
You did say you uploaded pictures and videos from the concert.

611
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,520
I want your permission before I make that public to chat.

612
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,720
Or if you would like to go into our forum at orangelesradio.com and make a thread about

613
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,400
it then we would appreciate you sharing it with everybody that way.

614
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,140
I wish in the future another video game music concert will again be held here perhaps by

615
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,920
video game music live or play a video game symphony.

616
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,080
I think that's all for now.

617
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:56,800
Take care and have a good show.

618
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,960
Thanks for the show and let you guys know that you have yet another developer listening.

619
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,640
Feel free to write if you have any questions or issues I can help with.

620
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm just going to use the nickname hero antagonist.

621
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
You know, it's funny.

622
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,920
I heard back from the developer that emailed us previously and he was willing to do an

623
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,840
ask a developer type segment.

624
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,400
So maybe we can get this guy in on it too and have some type of like round table thing

625
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
on a later show.

626
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,720
That might be kind of fun especially during the next few months.

627
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,000
It might be a little bit slow before we get into the fall rush of game news.

628
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,560
It might be kind of fun to do an ask a developer round table.

629
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
So please write us back if you'd be willing to participate.

630
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,600
You can contact me directly or send back the email back, whatever, because we're going

631
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,620
to try definitely doing something like that in the future.

632
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
This one's short.

633
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Hey, OLR.

634
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,480
I know I'm kind of late with this one, but happy belated birthday, OLR.

635
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,040
You guys are awesome and keep it up.

636
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Ron.

637
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Thank you, Ron.

638
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Thank you.

639
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
Did you bring us a present?

640
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,760
You said Ron and I think of Potter Puppet Pals.

642
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Stop.

643
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
It's Snape.

644
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Let's bother him.

645
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
No.

646
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
This last one.

647
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Hey, guys.

648
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,360
I just want to say I love the show and what do you think about young gamers on online

649
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,080
games that they really shouldn't play?

650
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm 14, so I really shouldn't be talking.

651
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,280
I just wanted your opinion.

652
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Sincerely, Christian.

653
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,960
Who says you shouldn't talk if you're 14?

654
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I mean age.

655
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Age is a number.

656
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Age is a number.

657
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
Maturity is everything.

658
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,680
I think if you can play a game maturely and that doesn't mean you have to play adult or

659
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
act adult.

660
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,040
You can have fun but still be mature and by that I mean you don't go onto Xbox Live and

661
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,140
yell NNNFFF and all those words that people scream on Xbox Live.

662
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:12,880
If you can have fun and have that self-deprecating humor and laugh and have a good time, then

663
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,160
fun doesn't have an age limit.

664
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,080
I am totally supportive of 14-year-olds playing online games.

665
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,720
If your parents are aware and if you're getting all your homework and all your other life

666
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,280
obligations done, it's not cutting into that, I think it's just like watching Nickelodeon

667
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
or whatever else is on TV.

668
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I do have a suggestion.

669
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
What?

670
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Use periods when you type.

671
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
He's 14.

672
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,200
Give him a break.

673
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,320
I had perfect grammar when I was 14.

674
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,680
Let's dig up some of your high school papers and check.

675
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Honestly?

676
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,520
No, I really don't care that much.

677
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,160
I can say it because I can prove it.

678
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I can back it up.

679
00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:04,640
If you're typing on an MMO and you have something to say, something my granddaddy used to always

680
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,560
say, I will quote a bit of wisdom, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

681
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,600
In this case, put brain in gear before typing, I guess.

682
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,720
Kevin DDR in chat would like to point out, I am a 14-year-old playing online games so

683
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
you're not alone.

684
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Well, you're not alone.

685
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
There we go.

686
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,520
It's just a matter of just thinking before you do something.

687
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,160
I was playing online games at 14 only when I was 14 the online games we had to play were

688
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,880
Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars, The Pit, and so on and so on and if you catch

689
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,680
my references, you're a winner.

690
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,360
Is that it?

691
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
That's it.

692
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
All right.

693
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,640
If you'd like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

694
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,480
By the way, I give everybody a hard time for their grammar so don't worry about it.

695
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Mine's really not all that great.

696
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,200
Well, it's really better than Rob's on AIM though.

697
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I will say that.

698
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
All right.

699
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,760
Anyhow, shut up.

700
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,880
We will get on to some other news coming out of E3 that didn't necessarily have to do with

701
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
the press conferences.

702
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,880
Actually, I want to spend a little time talking about music games because that's how we started.

703
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
That's our roots.

704
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,380
We need to talk about some of the music games that were going on at E3 and some of the events

705
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,240
that happened this week outside of E3.

706
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,360
Let's start with a game that was coming out from EA.

707
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,640
It's called Boogie.

708
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,240
EA announced the soundtrack to the game called Boogie.

709
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,400
It comes with a karaoke microphone and it's actually on the Wii.

710
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,960
They were trying to put together basically a lot of generations of hits.

711
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,640
In this game, you're supposed to be able to dance, sing, and make music videos using the

712
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,960
Wii controls.

713
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
That should be interesting.

714
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:59,240
Some of the songs that will be in this game, ABC by the Jackson 5, Brick House by the Commodores,

715
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,400
Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Love Roller Coaster by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Let's Get It

716
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,720
Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Love Shack by the B-52s, Milkshake by Kelis.

717
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,120
That's so rad.

718
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
One Way.

719
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,240
That's the song we got to get Loki to play.

720
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,520
One Way or Another by Blondie, Groove is in the Heart by Delight, Girls Just Want to Have

721
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,360
Fun, Cyndi Lauper, Get the Party Started by P!nk, Fergalicious by Fergie.

722
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,760
There's another Loki song.

723
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,080
YMCA by the Village People, Can't Touch This by MC Hammer, SOS by Rihanna, Oops I Did It

724
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
Again by Britney Spears.

725
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,920
It's a pretty fun list that brings across all generations there, so very cool.

726
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,440
If you want to see the full list, it's there at ea.com slash ea-tracks.

727
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,560
Another game coming out from EA, Rock Band.

728
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Should be pretty interesting.

729
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
They announced some tracks at E3.

730
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:01,640
Let's see, we've got The Who with Won't Get Fooled Again, Mountain with Mississippi Queen,

731
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:10,960
David Bowie, Looks Like a Suffragette City, Black Sabbath Paranoid, Blue Oyster Cult Don't

732
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:22,280
Fear the Reaper, The Ramones, Rockaway Beach, Rush with Tom Sawyer, Bon Jovi with Wanted

733
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:33,520
Dead or Alive, Nirvana in Bloom, Stone Temple Pilots Vaseline, Weezer Say It Ain't So, Foo

734
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:42,040
Fighters Learn to Fly, Metallica Enter Sandman, The Hives, Main Offender, The Strokes, Reptilia,

735
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,680
and Queens of the Stone Age Go with Flow.

736
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,600
Now I heard in this game you'll be able to use the microphone as claps or a tambourine,

737
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,040
so I demand this mix have Stevie Nicks somewhere in it, Fleetwood Mac, whatever you have to

738
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
do to do it.

739
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,860
But you cannot have a game where you play the tambourine and not represent Miss Stevie

740
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,860
Nicks because that would just be awesome.

741
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
All kinds of awesome.

742
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,160
But the sound list sounds pretty neat so far.

743
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
It does.

744
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,720
And some other really cool things that they're going to be doing with the download content

745
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,640
is you'll be able to download whole albums at a time when you're playing this game.

746
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,720
One of the albums that they're going to have available is going to be for Metallica, and

747
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,360
I believe they're also announcing the Who's Who's Next album is also going to be available.

748
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,400
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

749
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,760
That has the possibility of being a pretty awesome game.

750
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,960
That's one reason I'm sad I didn't go to E3.

751
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
I would have liked to play that.

752
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,640
They also promise new content every week.

753
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,220
For how long?

754
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,760
If it takes off, I'd say probably a year.

755
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
For a year?

756
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Oh my gosh.

757
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,200
That's something that could just keep going, though.

758
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,640
I think that's great.

759
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,880
That's going to be very interesting to see what that does.

760
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Quite ambitious.

761
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,320
Harmonix gets it, you guys.

762
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,540
They get it.

763
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,720
Rock Band teams with MTV, I'm sorry.

764
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,640
It's going to take off.

765
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,960
It's kind of interesting to see what's going to happen to Guitar Hero this year because

766
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,640
they've almost got them beat at their own game.

767
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,680
I realize there's a guitar and drum element in this game that makes this...

768
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,720
I hope somehow poppy songs can... because I love poppy songs as well as rock songs.

769
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,840
I hope somehow they can be integrated into this game one way or another.

770
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I don't know.

771
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,540
There's just a weird side of me that would like to be able to sing just the weird songs

772
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,920
you wouldn't expect in this game.

773
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,120
I want Rock Band 2 or whatever to have different instruments.

774
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah.

775
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
Rock Band 2 Electric Boogaloo.

776
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,200
Hopefully Rock Band 2 gives us a little more so we can sing different songs.

777
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,640
It would be damn hard to do a keyboard-style thing, though.

778
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,120
Please give me keyboard.

779
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,600
Please give me keyboard.

780
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,340
The format that they have set up for that, I doubt very seriously that would be possible

781
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,340
unless it's like...

782
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,340
I don't care.

783
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,340
...seven keys.

784
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,340
It's USB.

785
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,880
How hard could it be?

786
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,200
I'm talking about screen format.

787
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Oh, screen format.

788
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,880
Yeah, especially when you've got the voice track, guitar, all this other business going

789
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,900
on on the screen and your animation going on.

790
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,240
Doing keyboard mode is not going to be...

791
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,900
I'm trying to think of the way that they have the Guitar Hero-style play going in.

792
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,520
They're not going to be able to do keyboard that way.

793
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,960
They could do it with keyboard mania because you had a full screen.

794
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,000
It was something that you could spread out, something that required the whole screen.

795
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,580
You couldn't have it coming at you and have it lay out to the keyboard format.

796
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,460
Dark Sakura, Destroyer of Dreams, everybody.

797
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,080
I'm just being realistic, Rob.

798
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,080
I understand.

799
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,440
Rob, there is no Easter Bunny.

800
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,280
I hate you.

801
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,240
There was no bunny hanging out at Easter.

802
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,040
Can we please move on?

803
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Yes, please.

804
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,200
Hey, it's my turn, isn't it?

805
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,440
I have good news.

806
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,040
Well, it would be good news if it was still 1991, wouldn't it?

807
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,440
Oh, please read the story now.

808
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
I know what's coming.

809
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:11,680
Which, our curly-haired, top-hat-wearing hero of Guns N' Roses, currently a velvet revolver,

810
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,680
is a boss in Guitar Hero 3.

811
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,120
Buckethead is cooler!

812
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,040
I'm done.

813
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,120
I absolutely agree this news would have been ten times cooler in 1991, but it's still kind

814
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
of cool.

815
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,440
You have to admit, having Slash in the game, that is kind of cool because, you know, those

816
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,200
of us that remember Slash from our high school days are a little bit more grown-up now and

817
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,360
can spend the money on things like Guitar Hero 3, and there is a certain cool factor

818
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,000
to having Slash in the game.

819
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,680
You know, Guitar Hero 3 knows they're going to really have it in for them with this whole

820
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,040
rock band thing coming out, but I think it could be pretty cool.

821
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,900
Again, it all boils down to Songlist for me.

822
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,080
It's almost like this year's lineup, EA has it in for Activision.

823
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,880
I mean, they've got Skate coming out with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground coming out later.

824
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,520
Rock band and, I don't know, I guess with licensed games, you know, The Simpsons and

825
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
stuff.

826
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,800
Activision has a lot to lose if they don't innovate.

827
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,960
Could you imagine, though, the kind of Guitar Hero that they would have in 1991, like for

828
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,960
the Nintendo?

829
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,440
Super Nintendo was out at that time.

830
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,160
Something like that, though, would be a Genesis game.

831
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,640
It would be on Sega CD.

832
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,360
I want to say there was something like it, but there really wasn't.

833
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,880
I think the closest thing we had was Chris Cross's Make Your Own Music video.

834
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,680
And then we also had the CD plus G karaoke discs.

835
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,680
Exactly.

836
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Anyway.

837
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,240
I have the Marky Mark 1, Rob.

838
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,520
GK128 says, Fuck Slash, Guitar Hero needs a college rock edition featuring Frank Black

839
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,840
from the Pixies and Jay Mascis from Dinosaur Jr.

840
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,920
I love you, officially.

841
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
You know what we need?

842
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,480
We need like late 70s, early 80s rock like Enitho and some Joy Division for me.

843
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
That'd be great.

844
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
And some Bauhaus.

845
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,520
Well, speaking of music games and going over to Konami, kind of talking about what they're

846
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,880
up to, Supernova 2 was tested this week, and some of the news has been a little bit lost

847
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,400
in the shuffle of all the E3 news, but if you head over to a site like BomaniStyle.com

848
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,320
that dedicates themselves to all the music game news, you can get some of the latest

849
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,600
wrap ups from the fans out there playing the location test.

850
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,480
And the whole list of those extra songs that are in the game has shown up.

851
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,340
There's some interesting covers in it, including Come Clean, which if I remember right was

852
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,520
like a Hilary Duff song, I think.

853
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,400
One of those little girls from the Disney Channel.

854
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,120
Faint, which if I'm not mistaken is a Linkin Park cover, is in there.

855
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
That should be interesting.

856
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,120
Waiting for Tonight.

857
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,300
Me Against the Music.

858
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,960
Some interesting covers there.

859
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,440
It's very interesting that Konami sticks with all these covers, not the real things.

860
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
I don't know.

861
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,200
Well, anyway, some other reports that come in from the updates.

862
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,560
Marvelous ratings in Supernova 2 don't seem to award more points than perfects, and for

863
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,200
some reason seemed easier to obtain than usual.

864
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,440
Strings of perfect ratings will by no means hamper a great song rating.

865
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,520
Konami finally has spelled Marvelous the right way, with one L, and it's a solid silver

866
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,520
color.

867
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
Let's see.

868
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,080
If a player is able to receive all perfects or better, the triple A rating on the results

869
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,240
screen will feature the text, full perfect combo.

870
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,680
Interesting.

871
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Some other news there.

872
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,680
There's an extra stage that has a background video with Black Roses, people and other things

873
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
that are going on.

874
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,160
I guess the song is called Unreal.

875
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,680
There's an introduction video to DDR Has Returned.

876
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,460
There hasn't been one of those in a little while.

877
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,600
They say since 4th Mix there.

878
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,440
But they say some of the songs feel a little off sync.

879
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,600
People were complaining that some of the older songs from DDR Extreme and DDR Supernova didn't

880
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,600
feel quite right.

881
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,240
It wasn't off sync by much, but they were bitching it was off sync.

882
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,520
It should also be noted that they were also bitching that the pads being used on the location

883
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,400
test machine were not perfect, which might be a good point to reiterate that maybe it's

884
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,960
time for Konami to come out with some new pads that are a little better with the technology

885
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
that's a little newer.

886
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:06,600
Not to mention, if you guys remember the original Supernova Beta test, same issues, that stuff

887
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
was off sync.

888
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,260
It's just because it's a test.

889
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,720
Gerardimo says Me Against the Music by Helen is better than the original.

890
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,240
Gerardimo also says that that actually was not the extra stage.

891
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,840
I guess there's a little bit of confusion going on there.

892
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,240
I did hear that there was actually a song called No that was the extra stage, and there

893
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,360
was one other one, I think, called Kano or something as well.

894
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,080
Let's see, Black Wolf says only in DDR is perfect and not good enough.

895
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,760
Nice.

896
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,600
For DDR fans who are looking to get back into arcades, also the rumor is EMUs is coming

897
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,580
with Supernova 2, which you might remember from the Japanese Bomani games, it never really

898
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,840
came over here, but the rumor is the test machine had the EMUs set up on it.

899
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
So that's kind of interesting.

900
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
We'll see where that goes.

901
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,120
It could make up for lack of memory cards.

902
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Maybe.

903
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
Hopefully.

904
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,480
I don't know.

905
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,280
So I don't know.

906
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,560
This is, I guess, cool that there's new content coming out for Guitar Hero 2 for the Xbox

907
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:18,040
360, and the new pack actually is going to have a few more songs in there, but at the

908
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,360
same time, I want to be sedated, smoke on the water, and you've got another thing coming.

909
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,080
It's still going to be 500 Microsoft points, or $6.25, and guess what?

910
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:37,760
Because people that did download it before, the first pack, over 300,000 of you, they

911
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,540
just showed Activision that, guess what?

912
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:47,000
That price point is still good, so we're not lowering the price.

913
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,380
So if you want them to lower the price, don't buy it.

914
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,380
So in other words, those prices aren't coming down anytime soon because too many people

915
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,120
actually supported the old packs, even though we told them not to.

916
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Yes.

917
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,220
Well, I don't know about you guys, but that news that the prices are not coming down for

918
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,600
this old shit from Guitar Hero 1 makes me a little bit angsty, and you know what that

919
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:17,860
means.

920
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,160
Time for the FUs of the week.

921
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Dark Sakura, please do us the honors and start us off.

922
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,720
My FU goes to my stomach, because I haven't, well, technically myself I should say, because

923
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:38,200
I haven't put anything in it since 12 o'clock today, and I'm very hungry.

924
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,000
So FU on the human dependency on food for sustenance.

925
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Loki.

926
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,840
You know, I was going to have something petty to complain about, but I just realized something.

927
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,080
DDR hasn't had another download pack since the launch of the fucking universe game.

928
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,480
Where the fuck are the downloads?

929
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,760
Shit, universe 2 is right around the corner, where the hell is my goddamn downloads for

930
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,760
universe 1?

931
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,800
Or did you just forget to do that, kind of like the carry of your revolution pen discs?

932
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Want to know my theory?

933
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,280
They ain't coming because the song packs were all already on the disc, and that's all they

934
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
made.

935
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,760
That's my theory.

936
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,400
Fuck them for that.

937
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,400
That's it.

938
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,320
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to move in two weeks and I still don't

939
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
have a place to live.

940
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,640
That's a little bit frustrating, but hopefully all will be better very soon and I'll have

941
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,360
a place, because that would be nice, because otherwise I'm going to cry.

942
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,320
Let's move on to some other news.

943
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Now we're going to get into some news that, you know, some other things picked up around

944
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
this week.

945
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,760
Not necessarily at E3, but some of them are, some of them aren't.

946
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,760
Dark Soccer?

947
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,600
Well, there is some other stuff.

948
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:59,840
Disney has actually purchased War Inspector, their Junction Point Studios, so now we'll

949
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:12,280
be getting some new games and Disney is going to have some stuff coming to the new consoles.

950
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:24,200
War Inspector brought us the Deus Ex, Thief, Deadly Shadows, System Shock.

951
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,720
I really don't know how to feel about this.

952
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:32,280
I'm hoping that it's going to be good for getting the new games, and I mean, maybe it'll

953
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,840
mean that we get a Tron game, can I beg?

954
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,720
Besides the old recycled ones we're getting on Xbox Live?

955
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,720
Seriously.

956
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,120
Well, there's a quote on here saying, War Inspector's unique talents as leading creative

957
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,520
forces in the world of video games, his knowledge and passion for Disney, his legacy of storytelling

958
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,960
and character development adds a unique creative dimension to our portfolio, and it's from

959
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,400
the Executive VP of Disney Interactive.

960
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,920
So maybe, maybe we'll get some good.

961
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,980
Well, Disney's been up to a lot of wheeling and dealing lately.

962
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:11,080
They at E3 announced a new online service that will be on all of their DS titles.

963
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,480
It's called D Gamer, and it's going to be first in the Chronicles of Narnia game that's

964
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,520
coming out for the DS, and basically what D Gamer's going to do is it's going to turn

965
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,440
your Nintendo DS into Xbox Live of sorts.

966
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,440
There will be avatars, you can chat with other people, and you can look at the achievements

967
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,600
that your friends have unlocked.

968
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Interesting that it took a third party to do this.

969
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,040
So the system is more than capable of handling this type of technology, it's just that Nintendo

970
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,920
doesn't want to do it.

971
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,360
Interesting, and interesting that somebody has decided to step up and do it, if not just

972
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
for their own games.

973
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,960
But let's face it, there's a certain audience that gets a lot of these Disney games that

974
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,080
come out, you know, the Hannah Montana games and the That's So Raven game, that will benefit

975
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,480
from this, whereas the rest of us hardcore gamers that are too cool to go out and buy

976
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,520
a Chronicles of Narnia video game, are going to be sitting here going, gosh, I wish I had

977
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,560
something like that when I was playing, you know, the games I'm playing, like Pokemon,

978
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,760
even though that's not much cooler.

979
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,760
Anyway.

980
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,960
Because Rob really likes Hannah Montana.

981
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,960
Sad.

982
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,560
Another disappointment, well, still rumors that the 6-axis controller is going to be

983
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:31,000
rumbling soon, in fact, it's been confirmed by a few different places, one of which is

984
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,460
supposedly a Sony employee, apparently, I guess, Sony employee confirmed directly to

985
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,560
Kotaku that the 6-axis will be rumbling soon.

986
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:48,920
Of course, shortly afterwards, immersion comes out saying, hey, we're making a TouchSense

987
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,540
rumble controller for the Playstation 3 in September.

988
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,700
So if a third-party company is making it for the Playstation 3 in September, because why

989
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,680
the hell would you add rumble to your controllers if, I don't know, there wasn't rumble coming,

990
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,800
because that would be kind of stupid, I don't know, that's very interesting.

991
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,840
But Sony is still denying it, saying, hey, yeah, it's not coming, you know, this is all

992
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,160
rumor, blah blah blah blah, but then again, last week, they were also saying, hey, we

993
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:25,400
have no plans on cutting the Playstation 3 price, or, you know, hey, the 60-gig system

994
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,520
is going to be $4.99 and we're going to be still producing them, you know, that kind

995
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
of stuff.

996
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:36,240
Let me put it this way, rumble isn't so last gen after all, oh yeah, exactly, I'm going

997
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,600
to take a wild guess and say it's probably coming this fall.

998
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:44,200
And so when you buy your Playstation 3 systems, guess what, you get to buy new controllers,

999
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,520
much like the Playstation 1, if you remember.

1000
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,000
Devil's advocate, could the rumble in these controllers be for the backwards compatible

1001
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,580
games?

1002
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,520
It would be weird to see them, it could possibly, I guess, for that, but right now, as far as

1003
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:04,560
I'm aware, I don't think the rumble, like, stuff is in there, I don't know.

1004
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,160
I guess it's possible, it just, but they'd be kind of weird to buy a controller just

1005
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,840
for the backwards compatible games.

1006
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,840
Yeah, because that would imply that somebody bought a Playstation 3, you would totally

1007
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,120
skip the Playstation 2, and I can't think that that's a very large audience.

1008
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,240
And I can't imagine that that, like, programming or whatever would be built into the emulation

1009
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:28,200
either, you know what I mean, so, I don't know, it'd be an interesting theory, but I

1010
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
think it's coming.

1011
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,520
Alright, well we shall see what Sony does in the upcoming months.

1012
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,680
Sony's going to eat crayon pie is what they're going to do, well, except this, this is redemption

1013
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:50,360
I think, they did a point that hinted to a coming of something, ok, I'm just going to

1014
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,720
say it, Silent Hill 5 has been announced for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, which I'll

1015
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:00,640
probably get it on PS3, I'm happy.

1016
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,800
Oh my god, that's such a surprise, a Silent Hill game coming soon!

1017
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,800
It is Silent Hill 5 and I don't care, so, gimme.

1018
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,280
Here we go though, how would you feel, now we all know that Akira Yomoka is doing the

1019
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,400
music and that's all sorts of rad because that's some of the best part of the Silent

1020
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,080
Hill games, but Dark Sakura, how would your inner fangirl feel if I told you that Silent

1021
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,820
Hill 5 is not being developed by Team Silent, but in fact is being developed by the team

1022
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,480
that brought you Mark Echo's Getting Up and the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer game on

1023
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,480
the Xbox.

1024
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,640
The first Buffy game was really good.

1025
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,880
Alright, so your inner fangirl may give this a chance?

1026
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,840
As long as my man does the music.

1027
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:44,560
Alright, yeah, so Akira Yomoka, they did announce is doing the music, so, alright, there you

1028
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
go.

1029
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,100
That's too much metal for one hand.

1030
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,720
There was lots of Silent Hill news this week, because you know, Origins looks like they've

1031
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,480
completely redone it from the time you and I saw it.

1032
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,840
Yeah, it actually looks really good now.

1033
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,360
That's why it's getting pushed back from the end of last year.

1034
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,360
Thank god, see, you know.

1035
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,080
They completely redid that stuff, and then of course Silent Hill Arcade, which I had

1036
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,560
my fangasm over in part A. Seriously, if you haven't seen the videos, it's so rad.

1037
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:12,120
I don't want to spoil what happens, but like the battle with Pyramid Head ends in like

1038
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,920
the raddest way.

1039
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,640
Oh my god, like, fangasm all over.

1040
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,640
It's awesome.

1041
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,400
And yes, I am a fanboy for Pyramid Head and Silent Hill, I will admit it.

1042
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,200
Anyhow, I'm also a fanboy for price drops, and I was kind of hoping, like many of you,

1043
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,760
that Microsoft would announce one this week at E3.

1044
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,760
Well, you know what?

1045
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,480
There was an interview from 1UP with Shane Kim, and they were talking to him.

1046
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,700
He's of course the corporate VP at Microsoft Game Studios.

1047
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:46,760
They were asking him about the whole, you know, what does Xbox 360 need to win, and

1048
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,520
where's the price drop?

1049
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:55,320
Well, Shane Kim doesn't completely count out a price drop.

1050
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,200
In fact, he says, stay tuned.

1051
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,600
We didn't announce anything here.

1052
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Didn't feel the need to.

1053
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,360
July is a very odd time to announce a price reduction.

1054
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,960
I'm not even sure Sony announced a price reduction anyway, because, you know, the whole bait

1055
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,080
and switch thing going on.

1056
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,060
So they said we didn't feel the need to do it at E3.

1057
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,620
So they're not cutting it out of the picture.

1058
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,040
It might just not be, you know, coming for a little while, kind of like was speculated

1059
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,360
earlier in the show.

1060
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,040
So very interesting.

1061
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:29,720
Of course, I should say there's a huge rumor going around about the August 1st price drop.

1062
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,720
I don't know.

1063
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
That seems a little soon.

1064
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,360
If they were going to do it then, they might as well have announced it at PlayStation 3.

1065
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,880
Black Wolf has an interesting thought.

1066
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,320
He says they might announce it at Penny Arcade Expo.

1067
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
They might announce it.

1068
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,320
Take it directly to the fans.

1069
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,320
They'll love it.

1070
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,360
Announce it at PAX or now there's X07, you know.

1071
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,640
I heard they canceled it.

1072
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,640
Oh, well.

1073
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
No, no, no.

1074
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,120
I'm thinking of their event over in Europe.

1075
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,120
Is that it?

1076
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,120
Yeah, it's X07.

1077
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
I don't think that's happening this year.

1078
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Okay, what about Tokyo Game Show then?

1079
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
That could be.

1080
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
I don't know.

1081
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,120
You never know.

1082
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,120
They have plenty of time to do it and especially, you know, waiting until closer to Halo and

1083
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,120
stuff.

1084
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,120
I don't know.

1085
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
I don't think they're in trouble.

1086
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,160
Another thing I was going to mention real quick though, there was also Capcom was saying

1087
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,200
that they speculate that the PlayStation 3 will drop price again and there's also speculation

1088
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,600
that I know Europe was supposed to be getting that 120 gig PlayStation 3 and can you imagine

1089
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,640
if they do the same thing here and so it's going to be every few months or so you're

1090
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,760
going to get price drop, clearance, new system come out.

1091
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:40,280
Anyways, so GamePro on top of their game apparently did a little article of seven games that mysteriously

1092
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,400
were missing from E3, which is full of inaccuracies, so let's just go down the list, shall we?

1093
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,680
Grand Theft Auto IV, God, where was Grand Theft Auto IV other than the PlayStation press

1094
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,280
conference, the Xbox press conference, the Take-Two press conference where they did a

1095
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,520
walk-through demo of the thing, yeah, it wasn't there.

1096
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,480
Spore, no, Spore was there.

1097
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,800
They showed off a few more things on it and had a little press demo for it.

1098
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,640
God of War III, okay, that wasn't there, I'll give them that.

1099
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,180
Let's see what other stuff they're talking about here.

1100
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,480
I'm surprised there was no God of War III, but I guess they always have Heavenly Sword

1101
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,480
on account.

1102
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,480
It's probably so far off in development.

1103
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,480
Yeah, true.

1104
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,320
So was Halo 3 when they first started cockteasing us with it.

1105
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:41,280
I don't know, a new Rainbow Six game, they're like saying the successor to Rainbow Six Vegas,

1106
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,200
I don't know, I mean the last game just came out, what, a few weeks ago, I don't think

1107
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,720
they need to be teasing the new one yet, especially if it goes the way of Splinter Cell Conviction,

1108
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,160
that was another thing out of the Microsoft conference, it's exclusive to Xbox 360.

1109
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:01,440
Uh oh, Prince of Persia IV, I don't really think we need a new Prince of Persia game

1110
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,760
since we have like kind of Assassin's Creed kind of fills that void there for a little

1111
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
bit.

1112
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:12,160
Have you seen Prince of Persia games since, you know, what, 1994 at all, ever?

1113
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,360
I don't know, the new ones are okay.

1114
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:22,320
Peter Jackson's Halo, I mean, that's just, because they didn't have enough Halo content

1115
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,080
what with the gift cards and the 360 and everything else.

1116
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,200
And Final Fantasy XIII, well they announced it wasn't going to be there anyways, so I

1117
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,960
don't know, you know, how about some other stuff, how about, was it that new Rygar game

1118
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,040
that was supposed to be out there, why didn't they show that, because that was pretty cool.

1119
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,680
Where the fuck is Animal Crossing Wii?

1120
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,240
Oh actually, Rygar was Tecmo and I don't believe Tecmo was there, so that's probably why that

1121
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,880
wasn't there.

1122
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,200
Where the fuck is Animal Crossing on the Wii?

1123
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,440
It's still being worked on.

1124
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,920
Work faster!

1125
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,680
Done by the guy apparently who did the Mii Channel.

1126
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,400
How much you want to bet there's no Mii support in the game whatsoever, oh the irony.

1127
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,000
Black Wolf would like to point out there were no console games for Squeenix, it was all

1128
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,520
DS and PSP, so nothing on the console.

1129
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,240
Where the hell is that Final Fantasy game on the Wii then?

1130
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,800
Wasn't there a Crystal Chronicles game coming out at launch?

1131
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,800
Hello?

1132
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,360
What happened?

1133
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,880
Where's the Dragon Quest slashy slash game?

1134
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,160
Who cares about Crystal Chronicles?

1135
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,400
I think Crystal Chronicles, I don't know, I've seen their fall lineup so far and it's

1136
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,260
all DS and PSP games.

1137
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,360
Very interesting, that's all.

1138
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:36,480
Okay, well, that's about all we have to say on this year's E3 and all the stories.

1139
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,040
We'll get into some last minute stories in just a little bit, but we are going to open

1140
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,240
up the Skype line if you wish to give us a call.

1141
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:49,240
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1142
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,720
We always encourage folks to interact with us, whether it be through Skype or phone or

1143
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
whatever.

1144
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
So let's go to the phones, they're already ringing.

1145
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1146
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,040
I'm coming with my Wii sapper right for you, Loki.

1147
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
Well hello, Bobby Blackpool.

1148
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,600
Well that's okay, you won't be able to hit me because it's going to suck.

1149
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,320
It's just like Princess Leia shooting mode or something.

1150
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,880
Yeah, you better hope that the Wii sensor bar can completely read where you're pointing

1151
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,880
that damn thing.

1152
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,480
Well, so you actually got to go to E3, you lucky bastard, how was it?

1153
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,920
It was surprisingly very good except for the physical location of everything going on.

1154
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,800
It was basically, it's like they moved the time waster to something else.

1155
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,120
Last year and the year before, the time waster was waiting in line to play the games.

1156
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,920
This year, the time waster was waiting in traffic to get to your next appointment or

1157
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,680
get to the more games.

1158
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,840
That's right, because last year we were in Santa Monica because of the whole all games

1159
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:53,440
arena thing that was going on and driving to E3 was a bitch every day, seriously.

1160
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:01,360
Yeah, and I mean the traffic around was really horrible, two miles from all the hotels and

1161
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,960
the show floor and there were no press rooms at the Barker Hanger, so you couldn't get

1162
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,120
on the internet, you couldn't report anything from there.

1163
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,660
You had to go back to the Fairmont Hotel, which was probably the farthest hotel away

1164
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:17,000
because that's where the press room was.

1165
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,720
So if you were on a line like for the working press, like newspapers and other internet

1166
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,140
sites had deadlines, they had to spend a lot of time going back and forth, back and forth

1167
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,560
just so they could do their work.

1168
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,160
So the ESA knows that the physical location was really the only downside.

1169
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:38,280
I think if they consolidated it more and still only invited about 3,000 or 4,000 people,

1170
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,240
it'd still be a great show.

1171
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,320
Couldn't they just rent one small part of the LA Convention Center or find another?

1172
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,900
I have a hard time believing LA Convention Center is the only place in the area.

1173
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,120
Couldn't they find another convention center in an LA suburb to do it in?

1174
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:58,320
I think Lawrence Young was telling me like Long Beach Convention Center maybe, but LA

1175
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,840
Convention Center is too expensive for what they were trying to do.

1176
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,320
It's all about saving the money.

1177
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,080
Now Vegas would be great.

1178
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,340
Yeah, Vegas is convention heaven, it'd be awesome.

1179
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,680
We could go to E3 and then go see strippers, it would be incredible.

1180
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,440
Exactly, but I don't know how many of the game journalists would get sloshed after that

1181
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,160
and how well they'd work.

1182
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,640
All I know is that you're going to have to bring us as your crew next year, Bobby.

1183
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,720
That loophole will probably be very close next year.

1184
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,200
We shall see what happens.

1185
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,480
Maybe they can open it up a little more in Vegas, who knows.

1186
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,620
Really quickly, what were your thoughts?

1187
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,120
You got to walk the show floor.

1188
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,260
What impressed the hell out of you?

1189
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,600
What disappointed the hell out of you?

1190
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,440
What impressed me was Burnout Paradise.

1191
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,320
In fact, on my show, since it's not your five-year anniversary, I'm going to plug my show.

1192
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,320
That's fine.

1193
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,320
It's a podcast.

1194
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,320
You might as well say it.

1195
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,560
I interviewed the producer for Burnout Paradise.

1196
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,920
They're really doing some really interesting things with the online multiplayer and they

1197
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,960
have added enough to the game itself that it's going to be a great game for communities

1198
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,960
to play.

1199
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,520
It's going to be a great game to play online.

1200
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,720
I'm really hyped for Burnout Paradise.

1201
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,920
I was already hyped for Burnout before you said that.

1202
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Now I'm even more hyped.

1203
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,440
That's great.

1204
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,360
They're doing seamless online multiplayer.

1205
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,360
There's no lobby.

1206
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,240
It's an open world and people just drop in on the open world and the host says, hey,

1207
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,240
you want to race?

1208
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
Yeah.

1209
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Okay.

1210
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,240
Boom.

1211
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,240
He starts the race.

1212
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,240
It's like Test Drive Unlimited.

1213
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
It's crashing.

1214
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
Right.

1215
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
Rad.

1216
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,220
Now, Rock Band.

1217
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,920
Let's talk a little bit about Rock Band because I did get to play it.

1218
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,920
I played it four times on the drums just to make sure that all my rants about the drum

1219
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,920
peripheral were founded or unfounded or whatever.

1220
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,760
I still don't like the placement of the pads.

1221
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,720
Everything else is fine and it does feel like you're playing a drum set except for the

1222
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,200
fact that your arms are in the wrong place.

1223
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,200
Interesting.

1224
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,840
Now, the thing is I was the only one there who had a problem with the drum set because

1225
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,820
the harmonics people and the MTV people, which were extremely nice to me, they were very

1226
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,200
receptive to me, they're like, oh, you're a drummer.

1227
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,040
Yeah, you like that drum peripheral, huh?

1228
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it?

1229
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,760
I go, not really.

1230
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,520
They're like, what?

1231
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,580
Good for you.

1232
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,480
I talked to the marketing manager at EA.

1233
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,920
I talked to a guy who works for MTV.

1234
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,920
I talked to one of the harmonics developers and I said, you know, the pads are great.

1235
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,920
The hardware is great.

1236
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,160
The UI is fine.

1237
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,080
The placement sucks of the pads.

1238
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,960
I heard that they were adjustable though.

1239
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,240
Well, it's not just that.

1240
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:39,180
It's the fact that the note chart has the high hat on the second drum from the left

1241
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,480
and usually you have to cross your arms for that.

1242
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:49,400
My biggest issue was the far right drum, which they used as the symbol a lot of times.

1243
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,440
All the drums could change at any time.

1244
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,240
They weren't really married to one thing, but having to pull back on your arm instead

1245
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:01,060
of go forward, which is the natural motion of your arm, that took a while to get used

1246
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,920
to and so I would overshoot the pad all the time.

1247
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,320
Also, they have the Xbox guide button right in the center and I hit it like three times

1248
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,200
bringing up the guide while playing.

1249
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,600
You pulled the Peter Moore.

1250
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
I did.

1251
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,880
I pulled the Peter Moore three times and the game didn't pause.

1252
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,080
Notes were still going up and the guide had come up, but it's a pre-alpha thing.

1253
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,720
That'll be fixed, but I played two games on medium with the drum set, two games on hard

1254
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:33,360
and even electronic arts people were coming over to watch me play Tom Sawyer on hard because

1255
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,640
I wasn't failing it.

1256
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,560
You have good taste in song choices too.

1257
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,560
Yes.

1258
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Nobody else wanted to do it.

1259
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,300
They're like, I don't want to sing that high and so finally one of the harmonics chicks

1260
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,560
was like, I'll sing Tom Sawyer.

1261
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,000
Come on, let's go.

1262
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,280
It was fun.

1263
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:54,080
I will still get it because I'm a whore for that stuff, but I still don't like the placement

1264
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,640
and I'm going to be very vocal about the placement of the pads.

1265
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,280
Let me ask you real quick, I don't want to take up too much time, but since you were there,

1266
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,080
I do want to pick your brain on some of these things.

1267
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,840
How did it compare to last year's E3 and how did it seem to be received by the audience

1268
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,880
as a whole?

1269
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,340
Were people enjoying the fact that it was more of an exclusive event or did people miss

1270
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,480
the glitz and glamour in the booth babes of yonder past?

1271
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:25,080
Everybody I spoke to that attended E3 loved the new E3.

1272
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:30,200
The people who didn't like E3, some of them had good reasons.

1273
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:35,600
The more indie games scene, they didn't like it because they were shut out.

1274
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,200
They kind of used the lack of the booth babes, the lack of the glitz as part of it, but really

1275
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,440
it was about they couldn't be a part of it.

1276
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,500
They were not invited to even exhibit.

1277
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:49,560
The ESA wouldn't even let them there, but everybody that was there loved the fact that

1278
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,340
you could have a conversation with people on the show floor.

1279
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,160
You could walk up to anything and play it.

1280
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,760
Square Enix might not have liked it because every time I walked by their set of kiosks,

1281
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:06,280
nobody was playing the games, but other than that, everybody loved it except for the physical

1282
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,240
distance between things.

1283
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,600
I missed a few appointments because I couldn't get there in time.

1284
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,300
I did not get to see Fallout 3 because I was 20 minutes late because of traffic.

1285
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,800
Question from Rob D in chat.

1286
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:22,340
Ask Bobby if he thinks that E3 can stay alive this way.

1287
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:26,740
I think it did its job.

1288
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,860
It did its job admirably.

1289
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:34,340
Whether the ESA will actually continue doing it in this way, that I don't know.

1290
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:40,020
I don't know if they made enough money doing it this way or not.

1291
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,020
Very interesting.

1292
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,920
Anyone else have a question for Bobby who got to go there and actually be at E3?

1293
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,020
I guess it was kind of bad that I didn't accept my invite.

1294
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,880
You could have had a cameraman and a sound guy.

1295
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,640
Damn it.

1296
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,920
He's making pouty face at Jamie right now.

1297
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,840
I wish we were a TV show.

1298
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,160
However, I did get to sleep a lot, so that was good.

1299
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,160
Not really, I had to work.

1300
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,960
Yeah, and the day when you all were at E3, I was on jury duty, so I had one of the websites

1301
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,880
mobile version on refresh on my cell phone to follow the press conferences.

1302
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,340
It was sad and pathetic.

1303
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,640
That was my E3.

1304
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,280
I did that at work.

1305
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,000
I actually left my desk to the open computer and sat there and watched the streaming Nintendo

1306
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,200
conference because no one really pays attention to what I do.

1307
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,640
What would you say to the folks, because I've heard a lot of folks that didn't go to E3

1308
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,840
say worst E3 ever.

1309
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,160
Is that true?

1310
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,640
They'd only say that because it didn't have the glitz, it didn't have the glamour, and

1311
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,000
really to be honest, the press conferences, everybody surrendered.

1312
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,040
Usually E3 is about who had the best press conference, and all of them said, we don't

1313
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,660
want the best press conference this year.

1314
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,880
They're not going for that.

1315
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,600
That might be where a part of that came from, but no, in terms of seeing things, getting

1316
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,560
things done, getting contacts, networking, all that stuff, this E3 was the best out of

1317
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,280
the 11 that I went to.

1318
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,000
I even said that on the Xbox Life Marketplace video that I'm apparently all over.

1319
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,200
I was going to say a perfect example of that would have been the Konami press conference

1320
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:21,200
where it's like, yeah, two DDRs, Silent Hill 5, go get your press kit.

1321
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:26,000
What's up with that, Bobby?

1322
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,760
Now since there are less people at E3, you have a bigger chance of being a media whore,

1323
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,800
and Bobby, you really got some media whoring done this year.

1324
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,240
I understand you're on a banner ad for game trailers.

1325
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,920
What video on Xbox Life Marketplace are you on?

1326
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:48,940
The On10.net E3 show floor wrap-up video, because I was with the TV channel that should

1327
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:52,200
be renamed Nameless, and I was with all games even before then.

1328
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,240
I've known Laura Foy for many, many years, so when she saw me in the empty square on

1329
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:01,000
Wednesday, she came over and asked me a few questions, and apparently we have more air

1330
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,440
time than a frag doll on this thing.

1331
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
But I was on that.

1332
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,520
MTV Latin America made me sign a waiver because they filmed me playing Tom Sawyer on the drums.

1333
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,460
And then Hudson, their video crew, the same ones that made the Bomberman video that's

1334
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,720
on YouTube that says, Act Zero sucked ass and we know it.

1335
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,940
They came around and did something, and it was really stupid.

1336
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:26,800
If they used my thing, the question was, it was this chick, and she goes, okay, here's

1337
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,060
the question, games or girls?

1338
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,040
And I look at her, because it's the most absurd question I've ever heard in my life, coming

1339
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,680
out of something like that, but it's going to come across as, he's actually thinking

1340
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,720
games or girls, oh my God.

1341
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,160
You got to love creative editing.

1342
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,280
Rob D says a great summary here, for not getting invited to E3, Bobby did a good job of being

1343
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,280
at E3.

1344
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,400
Yeah, that loophole ruled.

1345
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,640
Excellent job of being an E3 stowaway, that's up to you.

1346
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,720
I would have answered back to her, if you're talking about Act Zero, I'll take girls for

1347
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,720
sure.

1348
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:12,240
No, I think my response was, games have pause buttons.

1349
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,960
Our soccer, I can't rebuttal.

1350
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,560
Yeah, I have something that involves a butt and my foot kicking in.

1351
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,280
Or even better, you just go, what, you're offering?

1352
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,280
Heart, Bobby.

1353
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,160
All right, well, Bobby, thanks so much for the call and for the perspective from someone

1354
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,580
who was actually there, and congrats on, I'm sure, what was going to end up being a lot

1355
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,840
of exposure for you and your show and all that good stuff, so congratulations.

1356
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,520
Yeah, thank you.

1357
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,360
All right, until next time, my friend.

1358
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
Yep.

1359
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,360
All right, later.

1360
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,360
See you.

1361
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,360
Bye.

1362
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,360
All right.

1363
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,360
Very good call.

1364
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,360
We always like hearing from Bobby.

1365
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,360
More calls, please.

1366
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1367
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,040
Who's this?

1368
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,920
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

1369
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,000
This is a guy who's disappeared for far too long.

1370
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,080
Ah, is this VX JasonXV?

1371
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,080
That would be me.

1372
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,000
Howdy, how are you?

1373
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,600
I'm busy and chilling in Colorado in more ways than one.

1374
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,560
But our website is still up, despite all of that, so you are the best webmaster in the

1375
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,920
world, and I hope you heard our shout-out in the five-year anniversary special.

1376
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,920
I listened to the whole thing while I was working way too many damn hours at work.

1377
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,920
Well done.

1378
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,920
So, what's up?

1379
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,520
What do we owe this call to tonight?

1380
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,200
Belated happy birthday to Orange Lounge Radio, belated happy birthday to you, Rob, and belated

1381
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,940
happy birthday to myself, because I am a whore for that kind of stuff.

1382
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,940
Thank you.

1383
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:33,940
Where's my present?

1384
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,940
I don't know.

1385
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,940
Where's mine?

1386
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,940
All right, fair enough.

1387
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:41,400
So, for real reason, Ace Combat 6.

1388
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Holy cow.

1389
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,440
Ah, here's the game we didn't talk about yet.

1390
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,560
Yeah, no kidding.

1391
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,960
The last Monday, I do believe it is, I got a new monitor for my birthday, and I have

1392
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,720
a nice little consolidation thing going on, because it's my computer monitor for two different

1393
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,560
computers as well as my Xbox 360 screen, and it does high-definition.

1394
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,520
So I'm finally running my 360 in 720p, and a lot of things are looking a hell of a lot

1395
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,960
better than standard component.

1396
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:18,400
And I finally managed to get a hold of the demo from the E3 category, and I played it,

1397
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,000
and holy cow, that game looks beautiful.

1398
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,960
I don't know if it's satellite imagery, high-resolution satellite imagery, or low-level aircraft imagery

1399
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,320
of the landscapes, but oh, man, they're doing a beautiful job with that.

1400
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:37,760
That game was so fun just to look at, and it played so well still.

1401
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:43,200
I've loved that series ever since Air Combat on the PlayStation.

1402
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,960
Why you're making me want to go check it out myself, even though I'm not usually into the

1403
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,240
flying games, so...

1404
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,520
I don't like simulations like Flight Simulator.

1405
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:56,280
I love arcade-style games, and Air Combat and Ace Combat have always been that, and

1406
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,880
they are doing a good job continuing the series.

1407
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,200
Like old-school After Burner, right?

1408
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Yeah.

1409
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:08,120
It's not as free, it's kind of teetering towards the more realistic flying, but still arcade

1410
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,120
dogfighting.

1411
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,120
It's fun.

1412
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:14,000
I don't have anything else to say, I am buying that game the day it comes out.

1413
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,960
Well thank you for bringing up a game we neglected to bring up earlier in the show.

1414
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,200
Yeah, shame on you guys.

1415
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Oh, sorry.

1416
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,880
You know, there's just so damn much that comes out of E3, that's why we rely on you guys

1417
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
to help us out.

1418
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Yeah.

1419
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:29,920
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1420
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,080
Anything else out of E3 got you excited?

1421
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,360
I watched a couple of the trailers, Skate looks pretty boring, but I think that goes

1422
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,680
back to the whole simulation vs. arcade thing.

1423
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,680
The project...

1424
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,680
Prove yourself!

1425
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,680
Crap.

1426
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,680
Tony Hawk game.

1427
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,600
Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.

1428
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,600
Proving Ground, thank you!

1429
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,300
I'm mixing all those words up.

1430
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,640
Proving Ground seems to be going right down the same path, again, expanding on a few more

1431
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:02,160
elements, and it looks like it's a very true-to-form continuation of the series.

1432
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,160
What else did I look at?

1433
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:08,920
Beautiful Katamari told me absolutely nothing new, but I don't know yet whether I'm going

1434
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,640
to like it if it's the same thing all over again or not.

1435
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,840
The music was kind of, I don't know how to describe it, but the music is kind of making

1436
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:23,680
me teeter on the side that I might not be caring for that game too much.

1437
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,160
Bomberman Live, oh man, I haven't played a Bomberman game in forever.

1438
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:34,040
The trailers and all of the media that Microsoft posted was really fun to look at, and hopefully

1439
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,200
the rest of the year and into the first half of the next year when all this stuff is going

1440
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,400
to really all be coming out is going to not be too much of a drain on my banking account,

1441
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,400
but you know.

1442
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,380
Jason, I know you've been a music game fan for a long time, obviously, because you've

1443
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:51,880
been with OLR for a long time, and Act Deaf brings up a very interesting question in chat.

1444
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:57,120
I wonder if Jason will talk about Rock Band, what do you think about Rock Band?

1445
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,360
We went over this over a little bit in the forums, so all you people who aren't a part,

1446
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,360
go read.

1447
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,240
It's always great to do that in between shows.

1448
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:12,860
The aesthetics of cramming everything in for multiple person play seems to be really, really

1449
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,960
off.

1450
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,600
The lyrics are probably going to be the most underused portion of that game, and for good

1451
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,320
reason, less people sing than sit there and play a guitar or a drum or anything else.

1452
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,440
I don't really know too much about the drum, four versus five is kind of funny, you know,

1453
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,960
Guitar Hero goes to five while Guitar Freaks is three, the drum peripheral is going to

1454
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,840
be four while Drummania was five.

1455
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:42,180
I didn't like, I've never liked console Drummania, I'll play it because I like Drummania in general,

1456
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:47,560
but I've played the arcade version of MGL, console version wasn't very faithful, I don't

1457
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,680
like cramming my arms that close together.

1458
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,880
What Bobby was saying was just kind of driving that point home again.

1459
01:23:53,880 --> 01:24:01,940
Bass, I don't know, I don't think I've got enough hands on with it on Guitar Hero 2,

1460
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,680
but the vocals are going to be the lowest point.

1461
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,200
Other than that, I'm still recognizing a couple of the songs, which makes me happy enough

1462
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:12,720
that I'll actually have something to play, and it looks like it's going to be fun.

1463
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,320
For a game that's changing companies, it looks like it's still going down a very good path

1464
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,400
for the general make-up and play of the game.

1465
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,280
And fun is really what it's all about, right?

1466
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,280
Hell yeah.

1467
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,680
Good music, good game.

1468
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,680
All right.

1469
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,160
Well, Jason, we've got to let you go to get probably about one more call in here, but

1470
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,040
thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?

1471
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,040
Yep.

1472
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,040
All right, take care, buddy.

1473
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,040
See you guys.

1474
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,040
Bye.

1475
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,880
All right, we always appreciate Jason when he gives us a call.

1476
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,440
We'll do about one more call, I know we've got a lot of people trying to get through

1477
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,520
tonight, but we also want to wrap up pretty soon here, so let's do at least one more call.

1478
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,600
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1479
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,600
It's GS68.

1480
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
Hi, GS68.

1481
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,600
What's on your mind?

1482
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,520
Basically, I read about Ghost Squad coming out for the Wii, and it just reminded me about

1483
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,720
the arcade version.

1484
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,960
I'm sorry, you heard about what coming out for the Wii?

1485
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,960
Ghost Squad for the Wii.

1486
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,520
Oh, okay.

1487
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,600
And one thing that's always bugging me about the arcade version is that I went to the Philippines,

1488
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:14,960
and most of the Ghost Squad machines there have card slots, but here in California, none

1489
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:20,400
of the machines have card slots, so I can only go up to level four on the machines,

1490
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:31,440
and I don't get a whole lot of stuff as much as on the card slots and machines.

1491
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit there, so I'm sorry, what was the question out of

1492
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
that?

1493
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:48,120
One thing that's bugging me about the arcade game is that in the U.S., none of the machines

1494
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:55,000
in the U.S. have card slots, but if I go to any other country with that game, the machines

1495
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
usually have card slots.

1496
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:05,120
I went to the Philippines earlier this year, and most of their machines there had card

1497
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:13,840
slots, and I get to have more levels and features and stuff, and I'm just wondering, for games

1498
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:23,400
like that, and why don't, oh, sorry.

1499
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:29,100
I think if you're talking about as far as the arcade scene goes, and why is it that

1500
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:35,120
they have the cards in some places and not in others, I think it just has to do with

1501
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,320
the arcade scene in general here.

1502
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,840
I don't think there's enough of a scene to support that type of technology here, and

1503
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,680
obviously Konami and DDR is one thing that comes to my mind like that, and everything

1504
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,040
they're doing with EMUs overseas and things.

1505
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,920
I think it's just that Japanese has more of an arcade culture that supports that, whereas

1506
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,700
here, it's all about the tickets, and taking in the tickets and redeeming them for cash

1507
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,700
and prizes.

1508
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,700
You know what I mean?

1509
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:03,160
Yeah, I look at Asian arcades, and they have a lot of cool stuff, like...

1510
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,880
Like Pachinko, which they don't have here.

1511
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,880
Yeah, and...

1512
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,520
There are Pachinko places in the US, by the way.

1513
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,400
But it's not the Nor- it's a novelty thing here.

1514
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
I agree.

1515
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,400
Yeah.

1516
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,680
All right, well, hey, anything you want to share about your thoughts with E3?

1517
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,560
Was there anything that really got you excited about E3?

1518
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,280
I didn't really catch- I wasn't really caught up with E3, I didn't read much about it.

1519
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:28,560
Well, hopefully you learned stuff here tonight by listening to the show.

1520
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,920
I hope we can educate some folks.

1521
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,400
All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call, GS68.

1522
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,040
We really appreciate it, okay?

1523
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,040
You're welcome.

1524
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,040
All right, take care, buddy.

1525
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,040
You too.

1526
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,040
All right.

1527
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,360
I think that's going to about do it, because we're running almost an hour 40 for this segment,

1528
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,440
so we really need to switch back over and wrap things up.

1529
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,720
So I'm sorry to those calls we didn't get to tonight, but we'll also take more calls

1530
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,840
next week, I'm sure.

1531
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,160
We always do.

1532
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,060
So we're going to go around now and ask if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

1533
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,960
Any last minute stories?

1534
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,000
I have a couple, actually.

1535
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Go for it.

1536
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,080
This is more European news.

1537
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,880
Coming to Xbox Live Arcade, there was Bomberman and Yaya Kung Fu on the 18th.

1538
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,000
It'll be out in July.

1539
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:18,600
Also the fifth Harry Potter game demo is on Xbox Live Arcade in the UK.

1540
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,080
Just for the record, it is out here as well.

1541
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:30,240
All right, but it's actually supposed to take up 2.55% of the 20 gig hard drive, yay.

1542
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,360
And the Lost Planet PC is getting Mega Man.

1543
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,360
That's kind of neat.

1544
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,600
A Mega Man patch for Lost Planet PC.

1545
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:44,400
Does it let you play as Mega Man?

1546
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,320
It actually doesn't say.

1547
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,800
It just says some type of Mega Man patch.

1548
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,240
I imagine it's probably a suit or something silly.

1549
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,240
That's what they need in Dead Rising.

1550
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,240
It's a character.

1551
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,240
It's a playable character.

1552
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:00,040
You can play as Joe from Lost Planet, Mega Man, or Frank West from Dead Rising.

1553
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,760
Oh, Frank West is awesome.

1554
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,520
Yeah, you can get the costume and the gun.

1555
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,520
Really?

1556
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,520
And you can get the hat.

1557
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,520
You can get the whole thing in Dead Rising.

1558
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,520
Oh, rad.

1559
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,200
Anyway, if that's it, then Loki, anything you want to share?

1560
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,480
Yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

1561
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,520
IGN just did their Week in Review podcast, I guess, and one of the things that they mentioned

1562
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,560
is Rock Band coming to the Wii in 2008.

1563
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,440
So that's interesting.

1564
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:34,320
Another interesting thing, Cotton, I guess, trailer for Smash Bros. Brawl is, I guess,

1565
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:41,920
Bulbin from the Zelda series is going to be either a trophy assist or assist trophy character

1566
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,640
or a playable character.

1567
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,640
So that's kind of neat.

1568
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,640
Who's this?

1569
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,640
I'm sorry?

1570
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,640
Bulbin.

1571
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:53,120
It's like one of those, I don't know if they're elves or what, some sort of enemy

1572
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,120
from the game.

1573
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:01,440
Anywho, other interesting things, the simple series, one of my favorite things to talk

1574
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:07,560
about, D3's lineup there, they're releasing their first two volumes on the Wii.

1575
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:13,600
The first one, Volume 1, looks like a kart racing game, I guess, and the other one looks

1576
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,480
like a frog jumping game, so that's kind of interesting.

1577
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,680
Hopefully those make their way out over here at some point.

1578
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:27,240
Of course, one thing we can't forget, I know my wife might be looking forward to this,

1579
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:33,440
Nitro Bike was announced for the Wii by Ubisoft and it's being developed by Left Field Productions,

1580
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:39,720
the creators of the classic Excitebike 64, and it's kind of like a, I guess, Excite

1581
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:45,240
Truck but with bikes, so, Excitebike.

1582
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:53,320
Some other interesting things, one game we've talked about here before, Tomiki Fighters,

1583
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:59,240
which now is being called Blastworks, which is coming to the Wii later on this year, it's

1584
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:02,080
going to have other games in that as well.

1585
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:09,040
Blastworks will not only feature Tomiki Fighters, as well as some other games created by Kent

1586
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:15,720
at show, including Our Rootage, which has been confirmed, and looks like Gunroar and

1587
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,280
Taurus Trooper are also being looked into, and those are other shooter games that he's

1588
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,240
developed for free.

1589
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,240
Looks pretty cool.

1590
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,240
I think it's only going to be about 30 bucks when it comes out, too.

1591
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,240
And I believe, yeah, that's it.

1592
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,680
All right, lots of news this week.

1593
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,060
It will be hard to top it next week, but of course we'll be back with another episode

1594
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:43,280
of Orange Lounge Radio next week, and maybe catching a lot more of your opinions and fallout

1595
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,320
from E3, and I'm sure as we start to kick into the fall months, it's just going to be

1596
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:52,520
oodles and oodles of news as we get into, because now E3 was in July and not May, so

1597
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:55,600
there's a little less time before the fall rush, so we'll be looking forward to sharing

1598
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,600
that all with you.

1599
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:00,320
And speaking of the fall, we hit our 250th episode this fall, if you can believe that,

1600
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,160
so lots of fun stuff in store.

1601
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,600
But we're not going to do anything special for it, because we did the 200th show last

1602
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,560
year and the fifth year for the anniversary of this show.

1603
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,100
We don't want to celebrate ourselves too much, but it certainly is a milestone that's interesting.

1604
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,640
Every day is a celebration.

1605
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:19,560
Every day is a new celebration of life.

1606
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,800
So I noticed Loki's watching the Silent Hill arcade videos on YouTube.

1607
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,800
It looks nice.

1608
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,800
Doesn't it look hot?

1609
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,800
Did you see the pyramid head thing?

1610
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,680
Watch the beginning of part B. It's awesome.

1611
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:33,040
Yeah, I'm watching the beginning of part two right now.

1612
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
It's in there then.

1613
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,040
You'll see it.

1614
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:41,560
Pyramid head goes slice, you're going to die, and then he goes slice, and then right when

1615
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:46,880
it's about to hit the guy's head, it switches back to the day, or whatever you want to call

1616
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,880
it.

1617
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,520
I thought you said you weren't spoiling it for our listeners.

1618
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,520
Sorry, I did.

1619
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
Rob you meanie bud.

1620
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,520
You need to watch it.

1621
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,520
I didn't spoil anything.

1622
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,520
It's just awesome.

1623
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,520
It's about IGN.

1624
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
I'll watch it.

1625
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,520
It would be cool, though, if they brought it to the Wii.

1626
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:02,760
I mean, it looks like these gun games are going to be taken off, or at least...

1627
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,320
You know, Dan and I had an idea a while back.

1628
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,840
Point blank, Wii.

1629
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,760
Hey, you remember the Biohazard Gun Survivor, right?

1630
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,960
And we got it over here as Resident Evil Gun Survivor, and they took out the gun support.

1631
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,640
You had to play it with the controller.

1632
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:22,640
We were thinking back in the day how with the Dreamcast, you remember the Dreamcast

1633
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:25,360
gun had a controller on it, right?

1634
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,360
Mm-hmm.

1635
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:33,640
Couldn't they do something like that with the Wii, use the controller on it to do your

1636
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,200
motion, move back and forth, and then shoot with the gun?

1637
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,680
They could easily do those games.

1638
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,400
I mean, it's kind of what the way they used the range.

1639
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:47,120
In Resident Evil 2 Arcade, you used your actual gun as your direction.

1640
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,120
That was kind of cool, too.

1641
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,280
And then you got to shoot people dead.

1642
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,900
Here's one other game that came out of E3 I didn't hear any other news on, but there's

1643
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,600
a new Trauma Center game that's going to come out for the Wii, and this one actually supports

1644
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,880
widescreen and looks pretty and has new characters.

1645
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm very excited about a new Trauma Center game for the Wii, because Trauma Center is

1646
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
awesome.

1647
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,880
All right, what are you laughing about?

1648
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:12,200
They should have a game for Silent Hill.

1649
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,280
Konami, hear me on this.

1650
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,320
I think you've got a hit with this.

1651
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:21,760
You know how these sim games and stuff, like pets and dogs and cats and stuff, are all

1652
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,560
really popular, they should have a Pyramid Head game, where you take care of Pyramid

1653
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:33,280
Head, or you are Pyramid Head, and you feed him corpses, and he can feed him, let him

1654
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,880
rape stuff, and you can slice people with a blade.

1655
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,240
Sometimes I think we take our Pyramid Head love a little bit too far on this program.

1656
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,720
I don't know if it's just me.

1657
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,160
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1658
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:48,000
Loki, go ahead and start us off tonight.

1659
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,320
My final thought is, there's going to be more announcements coming out.

1660
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,560
Not everything gets announced at E3.

1661
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:01,120
God's sake, most people nowadays have their own gamer days and shit.

1662
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,800
My final thought is, I twisted my ankle earlier, and it kind of hurts.

1663
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,800
Owie.

1664
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,800
Ice it.

1665
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,800
I know I need to.

1666
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,080
Dr. Sakura.

1667
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:15,080
Reject false conventions.

1668
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,600
On that note, we'll see you next time.

01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,920
