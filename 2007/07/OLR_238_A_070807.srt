1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,040
The PlayStation 3 might be getting a price cut in the name of E3, notable games may not

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,280
even show up in E3, and lots of tunes are dying over a new advertisement in World of

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Warcraft.

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:22,080
So, let's

5
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,400
have a contest on the program.

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:36,520
In

7
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,800
the next on

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Actually, who knows?

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
How's your week been?

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
It's been good.

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Now, you saw Transformers last week and told us all about it.

12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,760
You seen anything new this week?

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
No.

14
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,320
Actually, I meant to see Transformers again this week, but I got lazy.

15
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,040
We got out of work early on the 3rd, and I was like, you know, I could go see Transformers

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
again.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,780
But then I got out to my car and it was hot, and I was like, I just want to go home and

18
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
sit in the air conditioning.

19
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,880
It's been very hot here in Sacramento, where our show is based, like 106 or 107.

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
This week's been crazy.

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
At least we don't have humidity.

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,640
Anyway, you'd think we were a movie podcast or something, but we're actually not.

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,760
We talk about video games, so we're going to start off tonight's program as we always

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,400
do, talking about how was your gaming week.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,800
But first, I want to introduce our chat room.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,980
It's over at chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

27
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,660
We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, and interesting things always happen if you're

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,600
listening live, such as if you listen tonight, we had to do two takes of our intro because

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I made a big boo-boo.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,560
So, if you want to hear the whole show, you've got to listen live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,920
Pacific Standard Time at orangelawnsradio.com on our live 365 feed, and you can always participate

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
in our chat room.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,720
We'll also be opening up our Skype line later on.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,760
That's also a telephone number, an 877 number you can call into, and we'll get those calls

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
a little later on in the program.

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,440
But first, Dark Soccer's going to tell us all about her gaming week.

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
I had one.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
I did try to play Super Mario World of Warcraft, and then I got tired of updating all that

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
crap.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,640
So, what I did was play a little bit of Pokemans.

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
How's Pokemans been going?

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,160
We had an email, actually, last week asking how you were doing on your Pokemans, and you

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
weren't here.

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm hardly doing.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
That's what I answered.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
I played a crap ton of pinball.

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
We got two new machines.

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,960
We finally got rid of Retardo Johnny Mnemonic, and we got rid of Guns N' Roses.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,560
We have a Simpsons pinball party now, which is really freaking cool, and we have World

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,760
Cup Soccer, which was my favorite machine ever.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,240
Of course, my first time playing it, I cracked a billion points, which just goes to show

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,280
that my mad skills at that game have only diminished very slightly, because I could

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
at least...

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,240
Because you didn't break two billion.

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,480
I've almost gotten there.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,520
I was really, really good at that machine.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,920
I also played the Spiderman pinball today.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,960
The new one does really, really good, and I kept hitting Sandman over and over and over

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
again.

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,040
Thank God for being a bad, bad guy in the movie.

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
The end.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
Low-key, how was your gaming week?

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
And less dramatic, please.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
It was good.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
We finally hooked up.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, we have a temporary setup for the 360 LAN systems at my work now, so we tried a

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,480
few test games of Saints Row, and it's fun.

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I can't wait.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,280
The only problem is, right now we have...

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,500
Some of the systems have the patch for the multiplayer in it so that there's no lag,

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,840
and some of them don't, so we ran into a few issues with that.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,400
But one thing that's awesome in the game is the pimp slap power-up that you can get.

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,040
Basically, you run around with a pimp hat on, you can backhand people and fling them

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,920
across the entire stage, which is awesome.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,220
The only problem is the game only has three multiplayer maps, which kind of sucks, and

77
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,840
I've been kind of spoiled with Infinite Sprint and Grand Theft Auto, so it'll hold this over

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,480
until Grand Theft Auto IV.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,220
Been playing lots of Final Fantasy on the PSP.

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,720
I don't know why, but I've been playing it, and it's pretty good.

81
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,040
Just finished, was actually getting the TNT to the dwarves so they can blow up that one

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,080
part of the map to allow you to sail the ship outside a little sea that's in the middle

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
there.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
So that's kind of neat.

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,640
And then, other than that, I played Transformers the game, and I think last week I said that

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,680
it was an alright game, obviously there's some flaws in it and stuff.

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,320
I want to rescind that and say that the game blows ass and it's awful.

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,900
The more you play it, the more you realize the game is really, really awful.

89
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,000
I got so frustrated with the game, it's so bad.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,640
I was fighting Starscream and Blackout, and first you have to fight Starscream, and then

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
you eventually have to fight Blackout, then you have to fight them both together.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Well, the little drones that they throw down in the middle were actually harder than Starscream

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,680
and Blackout, which is stupid.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,360
But the whole game is very glitchy, and I highly recommend not playing it.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,180
I will play it through to get some more achievement points, but I'm going to quickly sell this.

96
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,320
But you did give this game a favorable review last week, right?

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It was okay.

98
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,040
You know, some of the missions are alright.

99
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,400
I haven't played too many of the Decepticon missions, I'm still playing through the Autobots

100
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,120
because I want to play the worst part of the game first and then play stuff where you have

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,840
to blow up things.

102
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,800
But I actually watched my friend play the first mission of the Decepticons, and it didn't

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,360
look that much more fun, actually.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,800
It looked like it sucked, so I don't know.

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,360
It's just a really bad game, I guess, unfortunately.

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
Tigerclaw, a big, big Transformers nerd, has some advice for you.

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,000
Loki, Loki, to beat the drones, you have to throw things at them first.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,680
I understand that, and that's what I was doing because obviously each drone has the same

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,880
damn pattern to them, and I was throwing stuff and it wasn't doing anything.

110
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,480
So it was dumb.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,440
Now, this happens sometimes.

112
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,680
We do change our opinions on video games, and not something that's really talked about

113
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
a whole lot.

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,320
You know, sometimes this happens with movies.

115
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,000
You may watch a movie one time and you didn't like it, but then the second time you watch

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
it you see something you didn't see before.

117
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,840
Sometimes that happens with games, too.

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,760
Can you think of other games that you've ever changed your mind on after playing them, either

119
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,920
favorably or unfavorably?

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,300
I can't think of anything offhand.

121
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,440
Maybe Guitar Hero was cool in the beginning and it kind of sucks now.

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,640
And then again, music games for me right now, I just can't dedicate enough time to them.

123
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
So I don't know.

124
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,520
I would say World of Warcraft, I didn't get into it the first time I played it.

125
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,760
Maybe Final Fantasy XI, you know?

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,320
Yeah, maybe.

127
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,680
Because after a while, you know, it started just...

128
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,080
After two years for me.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,720
Finally you get done with the low-level partying stuff and then you realize, oh yeah, this

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
kind of sucks now.

131
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,760
But I don't know, it's okay.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,920
Activision is pulling an Ubisoft is what they're doing.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,200
They're really letting me down with a lot of their games.

134
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Or we talked about this last week briefly, Nintendogs.

135
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Like I think it was the last week or two weeks ago we talked about how we all loved Nintendogs

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,880
when we first played it and then we actually played the full game and was like, wow, this

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
got old quick.

138
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,020
And really I can't blame Activision, I guess, too much for these games because they're not

139
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,760
developing them, but stop publishing crappy games.

140
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,880
I mean seriously, I was discussing something with you guys off-air earlier and it's like,

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,720
stop publishing crappy games, you know?

142
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Dumb ideas.

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,000
What else was I going to say?

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,040
I was just thinking that you don't really see that a lot in the review game industry

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
where people kind of change their minds over time.

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't know.

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,480
Not really addressed a lot, but it can happen.

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Anyway, anything else for your gaming week?

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,960
No, that's pretty much it.

150
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,520
My gaming week wasn't anything too spectacular because I was still playing some World of

151
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Warcraft.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,720
I've been working on the Battlestar Galactica themed PvP guild because we aren't just nerds

153
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,920
playing World of Warcraft, we have to take it one step further and incorporate Battlestar

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,360
Galactica into our guild, so that's like double nerd.

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,080
So I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, but also the new game I checked out this week,

156
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,480
I did check out Missile Command on Xbox Live Arcade because I do love the old, old 2600

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
version and the old arcade version to some extent as well.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,560
And the Atari ports are coming out pretty good.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,200
They're cheap, they're five bucks, and the enhanced graphics are actually really good.

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,520
It doesn't feel like the same type of graphics.

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,200
They actually, when they enhanced the graphics, they enhanced it for widescreen mode as well,

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
so it kind of changes the element of Missile Command.

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
The only thing I don't really like is that I want to be able to control the game with

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
a mouse.

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,600
I don't like using the stick to control the game.

166
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Missile Command was the type of game that was meant for a freaking trackball or a mouse,

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
which is essentially an inverted trackball, right?

168
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,680
That's why I cannot play that game with a thumbstick.

169
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,480
I need some type of mouse or trackball control to really play Missile Command.

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,920
But as far as the presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay, it's Missile Command.

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
And it's cheap.

172
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
So it's fine.

173
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,120
I remember another game that I had with favorable reviews and then they kind of went down towards

174
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
the end.

175
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
What's that?

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Elibits was another one.

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Yeah, me too.

178
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Me too.

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,040
I really liked Elibits and then I was kind of like, eh, I got old.

180
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,360
It's always, it gets old, just not like that.

181
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,360
That, uh, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, I think a little bit.

182
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
That's more of a party game though.

183
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm trying to think of a game that I hated at first that I grew to like a lot more.

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,280
Oh, I know.

185
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Silent Hill.

186
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,160
I didn't like Silent Hill the first time I played it.

187
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And now I love it.

188
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,720
It's like totally just one of those things where I saw, I don't know, I saw something

189
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn't see before the first time.

190
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
Driver 3 made peer pressure.

191
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I don't know.

192
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I hate the game.

193
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I still hate the game, but it's fun to play.

194
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Uh, Jamie.

195
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Burnout.

196
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Oh, Burnout.

197
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
I was kind of stupid at first.

198
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,520
And then when I saw how big explosions could be, I was like, I like, I like explosions

199
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,640
and wrecks and I really like them in my video games, especially when that's the whole point.

200
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,760
I had just the opposite.

201
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,680
I liked it when it first came out.

202
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,240
Um, well actually I think the one that really stood out for me is Burnout Takedown and then

203
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Revenge is just kind of eh, it's okay.

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,080
And then, you know, the newer ones are just kind of eh, I don't care.

205
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Uh, of course our chat room wants to chime in with their suggestions.

206
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,640
JV Mon says, Katamari gets old really fast.

207
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Like within minutes.

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Yeah, the PSP one.

209
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
That's like a perfect example.

210
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,880
Uh, let's see, um, SSJ 100 Matt is commenting on Missile Command.

211
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,360
Who needs a port when you got the real thing?

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
I finally fixed my Atari 400.

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,800
Well, for the enhanced mode, you know, for the enhanced mode is totally, you know, high

214
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,920
def graphics and Rayvar music and you know, all that kind of stuff.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,380
And it's only five bucks, which if you think about how many quarters you popped into Missile

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,360
Command back in the day, five bucks is not too bad of a deal.

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Um, but you know, it just depends.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,320
I mean, some people aren't into the old retro classics.

219
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I am, so it's worth it to me.

220
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,480
But if you're not into the retro upgrades, well then there's probably a lot on Xbox Live

221
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
you don't like.

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,620
Uh, but I also wanted to say I played Luminous a lot this week because of the new packs that

223
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
came out last week.

224
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,560
I finally got around to downloading those.

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,880
And now it's kind of cool because Luminous has all these different skins in it now.

226
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,680
I mean, granted, I've probably dropped like 30 bucks on the game when you count how much

227
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,200
I paid for the game and all these other packs I'm buying.

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
But the Tokyo Club pack is decent.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,280
I think there's like two okay songs and two pretty good songs.

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
And the skins are all good.

231
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,680
And the booster pack has some pretty good stuff.

232
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
I haven't unlocked everything.

233
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,560
I think I've unlocked 13 of the 20 skins.

234
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Um, there's some pretty decent stuff in there.

235
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,680
Uh, a couple recycles from the old Luminous games, which isn't much of a surprise, but

236
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
some new stuff as well.

237
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
So.

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
I did play a dance game this week.

239
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I forgot.

240
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
No, what's that?

241
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Uh, briefly played Neon FM, which, uh, went on the PC or something.

242
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah, I got leaked in there.

243
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,480
But, uh, well, it never got made, let me put it that way.

244
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
It's okay.

245
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
It would have been pretty cool if they had the dance pads for it and stuff.

246
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
It's just, you know.

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Uh, I guess, well, god, you want to keep interrupting my gaming week?

248
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I can't think.

249
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm done.

250
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah, I think I am too.

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Luminous was really it.

252
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Luminous and Missile Command and World of Warcraft and that's really it.

253
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,880
Not a whole lot else.

254
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Outside the norm that I've been talking about the last few weeks on the show in regards

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
to DS.

256
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh, come on.

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
No game tab?

258
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,600
Uh, maybe a little bit, but I'm not allowed to discuss it because I get called a whore

259
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
and a sellout when I do.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's okay.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Be a whore and a sellout.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's up to you.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, then I did play a little bit of game tab this week as well, yes.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
And when did you play on game tab?

265
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
Uh, old Atari 2600 games.

266
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
That's been my thing.

267
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,520
I've been going back through leaderboards trying to get high scores on stuff.

268
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I played BurgerTime too.

269
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Rob likes to score.

270
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Trying to remind.

271
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Oh, sorry.

272
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,440
I was going to say, remind me, I need to let you, uh, loan you, um, Sam and Max season

273
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
one.

274
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Well, you don't need to.

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I have it on game tab.

276
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
I just haven't played it.

277
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Then play it.

278
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
I know.

279
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
I need to.

280
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
All right.

281
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Anyway, so that's that.

282
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Let's, uh, go to some housekeeping and then we'll get into gaming news.

283
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Housekeeping tonight.

284
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,480
SAC anime, we mentioned last week, we'll be going to SAC anime.

285
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,080
Uh, we only hit a little, we hit a little kink though.

286
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,320
We don't know if we're actually doing a panel at SAC anime cause, uh, communication has

287
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,920
not been so great, but that's okay.

288
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Things happen.

289
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
It was very last minute.

290
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,080
Uh, I know at least dark Sakura is going to SAC anime, uh, and I'm going as well, so we'll

291
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
be around.

292
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
So if you're going to be there, say hi, Loki.

293
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,280
I don't know if you're going or not.

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
When is it?

295
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,840
It's next weekend at the double tree, maybe quadruple tree.

296
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,920
So we'll, you know, Hey, I got an idea.

297
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Let's name it tree.

298
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,560
No, double tree.

299
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Okay.

300
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
I was holding up for quadruple tree.

301
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Anyhow.

302
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,960
Uh, that's really it.

303
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,480
We just want to mention that we'll be appearing there in one way or another, even if we're

304
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
just walking the floor like the rest of you.

305
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,960
And uh, again, uh, we're always looking for automate conventions in California and the

306
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,000
West coast area that we can get to, to, uh, come say hi, cause we love doing live panels

307
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
and that's like, you know, we, we like doing our show live.

308
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,920
I don't know if you noticed, but we've recorded live.

309
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,040
You guys have the chat room and it's a whole nother thing to have the studio audience.

310
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Don't you love when everybody's staring right at you?

311
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Dark Sakura, isn't that the best way to record a show?

312
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,480
I'm used to it all the time.

313
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

314
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
Who wants to start us off tonight?

315
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I guess I could.

316
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
All right.

317
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
If I got to.

318
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
All right.

319
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Yes, you got to.

320
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,880
Well, there is a, uh, expected a price cut coming for the PlayStation three, uh, supposed

321
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,720
to reduce by a hundred dollars.

322
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,040
Um, there was an ad put out by a circuit city saying that, um, it was going to be, uh, dropping,

323
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,880
um, right now it's 600 bucks, but I don't know, 500 might make it actually sell better.

324
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,520
I don't know, but, um, it's supposed to be in conjunction with E3.

325
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,560
So that's going to be this year's E3 speech, 499 us dollars, 499 us dollars.

326
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,200
And the rest of us are like, okay, well, I mean the other models dropping the three 99

327
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
other model, they're not producing it anymore.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,360
Oh, I got those bastards item.

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,120
I didn't even think of that because when I heard about the a hundred dollar price drop,

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,880
I was like, oh, well then the other one will be three 99.

331
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
That'll be easily affordable.

332
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
I forgot.

333
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
They got rid of that.

334
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
Sneaky bastards.

335
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,020
I was all excited about this price drop too.

336
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,280
And I guess everyone's doing it now.

337
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,460
In fact, I think a few people at, I remember seeing some scans of target receipts where

338
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,520
people are buying them for four 99 already.

339
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,440
So it's everywhere, but it's a secret.

340
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,520
You're not supposed to know about this yet.

341
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,040
God, I have to admit though.

342
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm still not, I'm still not sold 500 still a lot.

343
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,120
You're talking to a guy who's like moving in a few weeks and has all those expenses.

344
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,480
So I can't be thinking about video game expenses right now.

345
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I mean, we're gonna play Jamie's just, I don't know people just, that's okay.

346
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
It's collecting dust at my house anyway.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And everyone's like, oh, well that makes it more affordable.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,760
I'm going to buy that instead of a three 60.

349
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,960
Well, don't you think they're going to re drop the price of a three 62 to compete with

350
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
this?

351
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Obviously.

352
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,280
Otherwise actually they might leave it the same because you know, they feel it's competitive

353
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,600
pricing still and stuff like that.

354
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,360
But I would, I'd hope that they dropped the price of three 60.

355
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,680
Lots and lots of feedback in chat room on this raw steel UT says price drop after less

356
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
than a year.

357
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
That's a problem.

358
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
SSJ 100.

359
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,640
Matt says they can drop the price as much as they want, but people will still bitch.

360
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,200
People bitch when the Wii was $50 more and raw steel UT responds to that true.

361
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:14,560
If people had their way, they'd be free and separate off 12, 15 degrees.

362
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,720
We paid that $50 on the Wii for the crappy Wii sports.

363
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
But I don't know.

364
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
See as hardcore gamers, we look at Wii sports and we go, eh, you know, the, the novelty

365
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,600
wears off after a little bit, but seriously, I know people that are not gamers that still

366
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,240
all they talk about Wii tennis.

367
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,480
Like I was having dinner with some friends the other night who are not like the gamer

368
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,640
crowd and they were like, let's have a Wii party.

369
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,880
Let's get together and play Wii tennis.

370
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,100
Rob, you have a Wii, don't you?

371
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,500
Let's all get together and play.

372
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,880
And so like it's, it's still like a lot of fun for a lot of people.

373
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Just maybe not the hardcore audience who kind of, you know, got over it after a few months.

374
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,320
It was kind of interesting watching the effect that has.

375
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,920
There you go.

376
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,400
JVMon suggests $499 PlayStation 3 is better competition for the Elite 360.

377
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,640
Gerardimo says if PlayStation 3 dropped the price, I might buy one even though there are

378
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,720
still no games.

379
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,420
Hold out.

380
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,660
Hold out is all I can say.

381
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Think about it.

382
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,360
We're going to sucker you into buying it before the holiday season and guess what's going

383
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,000
to fucking come out later on?

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, look at that.

385
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,360
It's the six axis controller with rumble now and now we're including them with the new

386
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
systems.

387
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Oops.

388
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
You already bought one.

389
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,760
Now you have to buy another controller too.

390
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,880
Just fucking wait.

391
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,400
There's no games really that are super huge coming out between now and Christmas anyways.

392
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,760
I mean, wait until the fall.

393
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,000
You can wait a few more months and just pick up the good games when they come out then.

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So I have a question for you guys.

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,040
I already said I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner at this time and this doesn't really change

396
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,800
my opinion, but my question for you guys is you guys have bought PlayStation 3s.

397
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,040
Loki, you bought the old $499 model, which was the 20 gig.

398
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,920
Jamie, you guys bought the deluxe one.

399
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,200
Do you guys feel shafted by this?

400
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,320
No.

401
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,160
You don't feel like you got ripped off even though they're dropping the price because

402
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,920
maybe you've had nine months of good game play before that?

403
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Right.

404
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,640
I got my PlayStation 3 first day, so I don't care.

405
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I wouldn't call it.

406
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
I got my good out of it.

407
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,360
I don't really even care about it.

408
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,120
I got $100 off of it anyway because we used our Discover card and got money back.

409
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,200
I wouldn't call it good game play, but no, seriously, that's one of my reasons why I'm

410
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
telling people that they should hold off.

411
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,560
I have my PlayStation 3.

412
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,160
I bought maybe five games for it.

413
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,480
I sold back most of those because guess what?

414
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,720
They were just the 360 counterparts and they weren't any better.

415
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:40,320
I mean, Ridge Racer 7 and Full Auto 2, Motorstorm, it was pretty cool for a little bit and then

416
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
it got boring really quick and then Resistance, that's probably the only one I'd say that's

417
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,240
really good on it, but still, that's four games that I bought on that system since it's

418
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
come out.

419
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,720
How many games have I bought on the 360?

420
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Way too many.

421
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,540
So Lair, Heavenly Sword, Little Big Planet, Hall, but you know Lair's been delayed to

422
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,760
August now and who knows, I mean, it keeps getting delayed each month, so who knows if

423
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
it's not going to end up in September anyways.

424
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,200
Heavenly Sword looks awesome.

425
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,740
I am planning on picking that one up and also, strangely enough, Ratchet and Clank, Tools

426
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,920
of Destruction, which you know, normally a game that I would not be interested in, but

427
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,400
it looks pretty cool, but that's the problem though.

428
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,980
It's only like a couple games, whereas the 360, I'm planning on buying a lot more than

429
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,800
just a couple games.

430
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,640
So that's a problem, because even if they do get you to buy the system, you're going

431
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,000
to be waiting a while for some good games, especially if you're holding out for your

432
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,620
Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid IV.

433
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,600
Plan on waiting about a good another, I don't know, almost nine months now until those games

434
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,400
come out, so if not longer.

435
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Alright, well, with this price cut on the PlayStation 3, I mean, there's a lot of possible

436
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,180
factors for why this price cut is happening now, but could one of them be the pressure

437
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,560
from the third-party companies?

438
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,940
It also came out this week, just before the news of the price cut, that Sega made an interesting

439
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,940
comment about the pricing of the PlayStation 3.

440
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,640
One of the executives at Sega, Masano Madea, actually had this quote, quote, name brand,

441
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,680
price and software are what count.

442
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,080
This is what he told Reuters in an interview, quote, since it's getting difficult to make

443
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,600
software availability a differentiating factor, superior marketing and pricing strategy will

444
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
be the key for Sony.

445
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,400
So kind of interesting, he's talking about, you know, maybe Sony should change up their

446
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,760
strategy and look at the way that they're pricing the system.

447
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
And lo and behold, they did.

448
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
And I do think that they're changing their strategy, I mean, look at the home that's

449
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,360
coming out, it's, you know, a sign of good things to be coming, but I want to see them

450
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,680
here because, you know, promises aren't getting us anywhere.

451
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,060
Obviously, they promise all this shit, you know, that's supposed to be out at launch,

452
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,060
never came out at launch, all these delays, all these third-party games getting delayed

453
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,560
for the PlayStation 3 or just not coming out at all.

454
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,640
And then, you know, at the same time, they need to have a strong Christmas or else they're

455
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
doomed.

456
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,220
I mean, because already, you know, the 360s had, you know, a couple strong Christmases

457
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,880
already, and this is going to be the third strong one.

458
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,480
They've got a really good lineup, especially with Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, and God knows

459
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,800
what other stuff is coming out around that time.

460
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,180
And then the Wii, obviously, the Wii is going to take off like crazy at Christmas because

461
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,060
you still can't find them.

462
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,820
They really need to, because they're losing, you know, they're dropping behind a lot now,

463
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,920
and if they don't, you know, pick it up, it's going to be hard.

464
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Now Matt, though, we are sitting just days away from E3 2007, and Sony pulled a pretty

465
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,540
big trump card out of their hand at Game Developers Conference and really changed a lot of people's

466
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,800
minds with Home and LittleBigPlanet.

467
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,920
Are they sitting on something else right now?

468
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,040
I hope they are.

469
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,040
And I really do, because I would like to see them be successful.

470
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,680
A box of Crayolas.

471
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Sorry.

472
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,480
I don't have much faith in Sony.

473
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,040
Crash Bandicoot Paint.

474
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,600
There's that new Spyro game, I was watching the ads for it.

475
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,840
I'm sorry, if all they have to release, you know, is Spyro as far as their games go, then...

476
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,480
MacMan makes an interesting quote, E3 will change everything, and it's very interesting.

477
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, it'll suck.

478
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Because we're not there.

479
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Exactly.

480
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
The interesting thing about E3 this year is that didn't the developers bitch that E3 was

481
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,600
too big of a deal, and you know, that it was ruining their game, and Sony wah wah wah'd

482
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,680
about E3 last year, and that's kind of the reason E3 has changed a lot, but isn't all

483
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,180
that same pressure still there this year?

484
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,960
Has anything changed?

485
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,380
People are still going to be making a lot of judgments based off of the cards that people

486
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,160
lay on the table at E3.

487
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,600
Whether they're there or not, we're all on the internet now.

488
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,160
I mean, hell, did you hear what Scott over at All Games is doing?

489
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,760
They're like going in there with like a live camera that's going to sit on Scott's head

490
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,520
so you can be at E3 with them.

491
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
It's just fucking nuts.

492
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,760
I mean, if they think the pressure is gone from E3 because they made this, you know,

493
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,880
they locked it down like Fort Knox, you're mistaken.

494
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
It's...

495
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I understand why they...

496
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Critics are watching you.

497
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,840
I understand why they did this, but they really, you know, E3 needs to succeed this year because

498
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,320
this is kind of a whole new experiment for them to see, you know, kind of changing things

499
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,920
up and supposedly they're going to get more business done, but really, when you think

500
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,000
about it, what kind of business can you get done at E3?

501
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,480
I mean, other than, you know, a lot of the press stuff where they're covering all these

502
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,520
games and everything, I mean, is there really, I mean, granted us, I mean, we were only like

503
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,000
three people at E3, maybe, you know, four or five or whatever, but, you know, obviously,

504
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
we can't see all of E3.

505
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,200
It's impossible to cover everything in great detail, but, you know, these larger, you know,

506
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,960
press outlets and stuff, it's a lot easier for them, but really, do you think there's

507
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,720
stuff that they're just missing from E3?

508
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
I mean, I don't...

509
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,720
A lot of them just say what the game companies want them to say because they just copy, paste,

510
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
press releases anyway.

511
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Okay.

512
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,200
So we're going to expect them to do any more, you know, better work at these places?

513
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
No.

514
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,680
There's still enough of the independent press getting in.

515
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,040
Not as much as there should be, and, you know, I'm not saying that bitterly, I promise, but

516
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
there is...

517
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Oh, I am.

518
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,720
There is enough of the independent press getting in that are not going to be corporate whores.

519
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, I'm extremely bitter.

520
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,280
I found out when someone from our work's going, bastard.

521
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
He's feeling it out.

522
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Oh my God.

523
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
All right.

524
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,920
Anyhow, I had to say this in chat because now everybody's making plays on the E3 will

525
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,240
change everything because now they're coming up with their own tag lines.

526
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,160
Kyle Snyder says, dust cap two.

527
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,000
This time it's not dust cap one.

528
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
Long running orange lingerie joke there.

529
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
JV Mon says, Emodium AD will change everything.

530
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,480
I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean, so forget it.

531
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
I'm just excited.

532
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:00,240
I can't wait to see the press releases and all that stuff and also watching the conferences.

533
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,360
Anyways, another rumor that's supposedly coming out of the Sony press conference, or speculation

534
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,000
at least, is that the six axis controller is getting rumble as well as touch sensitivity.

535
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,080
It'll be interesting to see if they do that.

536
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,480
They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be doing, but apparently that through,

537
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,040
I guess, different sections of the controller, you'll be able to have touch sensitivity very

538
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,760
similar to, I guess like the DS touch screen, and then the rumble as well.

539
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,840
There's been even some confirmation on that coming because apparently in a developer's

540
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,600
behind the scenes video for Haze, they were showing the guy playing the game a little

541
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,960
bit and then all of a sudden one of the shots, oh the controller's blurred out for some reason.

542
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,760
That's kind of weird that it's blurred out.

543
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
Why would they do that?

544
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,520
I'm telling you, Sony's got more cards they're going to show at E3.

545
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Oh yeah, Eye of Judgment.

546
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
Fuck the Eye of Judgment.

547
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,660
I'm telling you, PlayStation Eye is just a fucking eye toy again.

548
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,480
Don't be suckered into it.

549
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,320
I'm not suckered into it.

550
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Well, we're all going to end up being suckers if we've got a PlayStation 3 down the line

551
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:31,540
because it looks like Sony is going to be working with the Nielsen's research folks

552
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,540
to see what we're playing, to see what they can advertise in.

553
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,340
Isn't that special?

554
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,880
So yeah, we're going to get more ads in our games thanks to this crap.

555
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,840
Hooray, and we're still going to pay $60 for them.

556
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,520
That's bullshit.

557
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,160
Big stinkin' piles of horse hockey.

558
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Especially when they have tons of ads in games like Transformers.

559
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,120
Come on.

560
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Does that mean...

561
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, the whole movie was an Xbox ad, at least at the end.

562
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,720
Because on TV, where the Nielsen Rays are, if I want a show to get canceled, I don't

563
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
watch it.

564
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,560
So how do I get a game to get canceled?

565
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Just not buy it?

566
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Don't play it.

567
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
How do they rate it?

568
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I don't...

569
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
How exactly are they going to monitor it?

570
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,880
I think it's to see who's playing what the most so that they know what type of games

571
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,120
to advertise in.

572
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Interesting.

573
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,040
Now, doesn't Microsoft kind of already do that?

574
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,320
I mean, I don't know if Sony does this.

575
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,960
Microsoft kind of knows what you're playing all the time because you hit that little button

576
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,480
to see your friends list, you can see what they're all playing.

577
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
And Major Nelson posts every week, hey, these are the top 10 games on live.

578
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,120
So they kind of know what people are playing.

579
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I guess only out of those boxes that are connected to live, that's still a pretty good representation.

580
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
I don't know.

581
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,280
We'll see.

582
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,960
Anyhow, one other thing that you could be playing on the PlayStation 3, and who knows

583
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,080
how many ads are going to be in this game, Gran Turismo 5.

584
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,200
Gran Turismo 5 will probably not see release until late 2008.

585
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,880
This was something that director Kaonori Yamauchi said to Car and Driver magazine.

586
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Because spring of 2008 is the earliest possible release window for the game.

587
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Sony is trying to get them to push the date, but they want the game to be absolutely perfect.

588
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,640
He did say, though, that there would be no crash damage physics.

589
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,760
The perfect damage system will actually be changing the physics of the game and modeling

590
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,160
of each panel of each car separately.

591
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,400
So I have no idea, but they're taking out crash damage physics.

592
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,840
But they did it in Forza.

593
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,760
Why can't they do it in Gran Turismo 5?

594
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
No idea.

595
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,600
It's kind of a weird, weird thing.

596
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
It's not a big deal.

597
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,880
I mean, Project Gotham, I don't think, does damage physics either.

598
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,000
At least it's not that I'm aware of.

599
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,240
I guess not every racing game does.

600
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,720
I mean, Gran Turismo is not Burnout.

601
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,440
But I guess maybe that's why I kind of get a weird phase.

602
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Because when I think about playing racing games, I like racing games like Burnout, where

603
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,340
the point is to crash into shit.

604
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,780
And so I go, no crashing physics?

605
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,360
What the hell kind of racing game is this?

606
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
But then I go, yeah, that's right.

607
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,560
I've never really been a fan of Gran Turismo because I like my racers fake.

608
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,160
Not real.

609
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,520
Anyways, once again if you're hoping to see some cool shit, especially Final Fantasy 13

610
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:21,120
at E3, well, you better forget it because it's not going to be at E3 at all.

611
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,040
So boo-hoo.

612
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,680
Not surprising though, because I know Square Enix this year, they've been doing a lot

613
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,660
of Nintendo stuff like DS and PSP titles, and I think there's actually some Wii titles

614
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,880
in there as well.

615
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Why did they decide not to bring Final Fantasy 13?

616
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,400
It's probably not done yet.

617
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Duh.

618
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,320
I mean, obviously, how long did it take 12 to come out?

619
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,120
Well they had a freaking trailer at one, why does Square do that?

620
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,840
I remember my very first E3 they showed Final Fantasy 12 and then it wasn't even there

621
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
the next year.

622
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah, but here's the thing though.

623
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,440
They show you a trailer, but then, you know, we'll use Sony, and I think Microsoft used

624
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,180
the phrase, mainly Sony though, it's a target render.

625
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,360
This is what we hope the game to look like.

626
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,660
Oh, okay, thank you very much for getting my hopes up.

627
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,480
It's not exactly what the game is going to look like, but it's a target, you know, so

628
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm going to strive to.

629
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,160
I mean, I'm sure the game's still going to look phenomenal and exceed a lot of folks'

630
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
expectations.

631
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,520
I mean, let's face it, Square's always pushed the envelope in that department, you know.

632
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,560
Oh, don't get me wrong, it's going to be awesome, but I'm more excited seeing, what is it, Last

633
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Remnant.

634
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
That looks pretty cool.

635
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,900
That could be pretty awesome.

636
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,480
That's one in the Unreal Engine, huh?

637
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,880
I think that's going to be there, in trailer form.

638
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,200
You'll see, well, regardless, I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of pissed that

639
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,560
Final Fantasy XIII isn't going to be at E3, because that was a game I was really looking

640
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,920
forward to, and the game that would have finally made me buy a PlayStation 3, hands down, but

641
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,840
now that it's not going to be at E3, I'm a little bit angsty, and when we get angsty

642
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:58,040
here at Orange Lawns Radio, people die, and we bring on the FUs of the Week.

643
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,280
Dark Sakura, take it away.

644
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,720
My FU of the Week goes toward, um, crap I can't do anything about right now.

645
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,600
Very vague FU of the Week, but that's alright.

646
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,680
Well, just like lots of stuff, you know, things that I can work toward that, uh, you know,

647
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,200
are going to take a lot of hard work that aren't immediate.

648
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,640
I would like to see immediate results.

649
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,840
Unfortunately in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, does it?

650
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,600
So your FU is to patience, in a way.

651
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
And money.

652
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Okay.

653
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Patience and money.

654
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Patience and money.

655
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,560
My FU goes to Stella the Kitty, because she, uh, aw, I want to meet your new kitty!

656
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,720
She's very persistent on chewing the power cord to the fan, and the light in our house,

657
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,240
and she doesn't realize that there's a lot of electricity going through that, and unfortunately

658
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,880
she does, very persistent on it, no matter where you move the fan, she always wants to

659
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
chew on the cords, so.

660
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
You know what you should get?

661
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
A square bottle.

662
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
No.

663
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Bitter apple spray.

664
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Ah, yeah.

665
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,160
Cats, cats are very sensitive in their noses, and, um, bitter apple is, um, a scent that

666
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,440
cats do not really quite care for, except unless they're nuts like one of my old cats.

667
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
He would lick it.

668
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
That cat was insane.

669
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,560
You do know your cat is named after a popular Atari 2600 emulator?

670
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,680
Well, you know, I didn't name the cat.

671
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:24,160
Actually the woman, the woman that, uh, you know, was fostering the cat, um, I guess Stella's

672
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,800
full, she calls her Stella-dora, so I don't know.

673
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm totally gonna cat her to take pictures of your cat.

674
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
We've got plenty more.

675
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,960
I brought my camera, too, so.

676
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,720
You should tell your wife that there's a video game reference in your cat's name, she'll

677
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
love that.

678
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,080
She will absolutely love that.

679
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,720
Well, my cat was trying to play, um, the PSP last night, or basically she was trying to

680
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,440
chew on the headphone cord that I had while I was trying to play the PSP, but I moved

681
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,480
around the stuff in Final Fantasy and she was like, hey, there's stuff moving on the

682
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,600
screen, she kind of, like, got closer and closer and closer.

683
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,920
So pretty soon we'll have the cat playing the PSP or something, or, yeah.

684
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
You wanna watch her go crazy?

685
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Take pictures of her.

686
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Get the Jingle Cats video.

687
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
No, I need the cat.

688
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,720
I wanna see Stella versus Shermy.

689
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,220
Shermy will just sit there and be like, hi, I'm the fattest cat in the universe.

690
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Shermy will do that.

691
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,280
She's like the blob.

692
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Shermy is like E. Honda.

693
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
No, she can't.

694
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,920
She'll just jump up in the air and sit on Stella.

695
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,720
Shermy is like the blob, the immovable object.

696
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,960
All right, no force on earth can move the Shermy.

697
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
Can I do my FUs now?

698
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Okay.

699
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,160
All right, my FU of the week goes to my new driver's license picture.

700
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
It's horrible.

701
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh, come on, Rob.

702
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,720
Your face does not look that fat.

703
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,440
My face looks like a Christmas light.

704
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,100
It's red and fat.

705
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
It's horrible.

706
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,840
I just had to get a new license picture taken.

707
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,920
My birthday just passed since that year that my license.

708
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,280
I had to go in and take a new picture.

709
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,840
I look fat and red.

710
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
You do not.

711
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
It's horrible.

712
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
I look like I have a bowl full of jelly.

713
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
That's what I do.

714
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
It's horrible.

715
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
FU to the DMV.

716
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,160
Why do you do this to people?

717
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,320
This is why we have rampant anorexia and bulimia in our society is because of the DMV.

718
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
That's all.

719
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,660
I'm done.

720
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,920
And no, chat room, you may not have a scan.

721
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,560
That's personal information.

722
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
I'm not scanning my driver's license and putting it on the internet.

723
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,640
That's one of the dumbest things you can do.

724
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,460
All right, let's get back into the gaming news before I get more frustrated because

725
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,920
like then I'm going to take out my wallet and look at my picture again.

726
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,960
I'm going to get more angrier.

727
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,840
Well, Rob, I'm sorry I'm about to piss you off again.

728
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,680
Now don't we normally love Nintendo?

729
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,120
I love Nintendo.

730
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:33,000
Nintendo, we love you so much, but why do you have to hurt us by not having a playable

731
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,120
Smash Brothers at E3?

732
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,840
Fuckers.

733
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,440
So Nintendo's not going to be showing Smash Brothers at E3?

734
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
And you know what they just...

735
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
What's their excuse?

736
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
They just...

737
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,200
Well, it wasn't in Kojima's blog that he played an almost complete version.

738
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Like in April.

739
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
So why not?

740
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Why are you fucking with us, Nintendo?

741
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head

742
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.

743
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Give us a playable Smash Brothers or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head

744
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:15,560
with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank.

745
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Give me!

746
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,320
I need my pit and I need my snake.

747
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
The end.

748
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I got a snake, man.

749
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
I got a snake, man.

750
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:30,000
One time I fed my snakes some beer.

751
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,720
Let's see.

752
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Going to chat room.

753
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,720
TLUT says, like we don't know how Smash Brothers is going to play?

754
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,780
I don't care.

755
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
My God.

756
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:48,200
They do a damn update on the website every day and every blog on the face of the earth

757
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,200
covers the damn website.

758
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,220
Just go to the website and check it out each day.

759
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,560
We don't need to hear or see it updated every day.

760
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't give a crap about the final moves and the control scheme and all that shit.

761
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,320
Just wait for the game to come out.

762
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Be surprised.

763
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:16,560
Well, as if I wish I had good news for you, but the journey continues here with Nintendo

764
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,520
and what they are and aren't going to be showing at E3.

765
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,560
Actually this has nothing to do with what's at E3.

766
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,960
This is just the way it is.

767
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,840
Michael Kelba, who is actually the head of Retro Studios who is designing of course Metroid

768
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,800
Prime 3 corruption, in an interview recently with GamePro, he has confirmed that there

769
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,140
will be no online multiplayer in Metroid Prime 3 corruption.

770
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:47,380
Those of us that were hoping and thinking and speculating and convinced that Nintendo

771
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,060
is finally going to get into online gaming, they're finally going to open up to the world

772
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,120
of online gaming and Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the game that will do it.

773
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,500
We just got fucking shot down this week.

774
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:04,560
Way to brace next gen, or this gen, last gen, I don't know, online.

775
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:14,440
God damn it, this makes me angry.

776
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,600
Why won't you embrace online gaming Nintendo?

777
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,040
What did Phantasy Star Online episodes 1 and 2 burn you that badly?

778
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,760
What is your big problem with online gaming?

779
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,400
Why do you have to spray us with these friend codes crap?

780
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,280
Why won't you put your series that we love online?

781
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,160
Why do you give us something crappy like the new Pokemon game that's your only online game

782
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,400
and mediocre online stuff anyway?

783
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:46,840
Why will you not wake up to the next generation of gaming?

784
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,680
And I copy everything that Jamie said before about the game.

785
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Anyways, more positive news.

786
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,920
Wait a minute, hold on, no, no, no, I'm going to chat for a minute.

787
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Hitstun says even fucking Virtua Fighter 5 is going to be online now.

788
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,220
You know when a shitatious series like Virtua Fighter goes online and Metroid is still single

789
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,640
player only.

790
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,880
Something is fucked in this world.

791
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,160
RosteelUT says no Metroid Prime 3 online, good, Nintendo Online sucks anyway, but it

792
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,680
could have been better.

793
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,280
Jvmon says Pokemon Online is slow as hell.

794
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:30,880
The DS games are fine, Nintendo can do it, they're just not doing it for some reason.

795
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,120
RosteelUT says people who play Nintendo systems don't want online, those who want to play

796
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,720
online have 360.

797
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,960
I beg to differ, if you give them online, they will embrace online.

798
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,720
Moms and grandmas like to play Bejeweled Online and those fucking Popit games on Pogo and

799
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,420
shit and all those other games, like Poker Online, they'll play that, they'll play the

800
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,140
Wii Online too, they'll give me that just because it's not a hardcore gaming audience

801
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,140
or whatever.

802
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,360
This just makes me angry because I've been waiting so long for Nintendo to go online.

803
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:08,600
Was last year's E3, we're embracing online, the system is going to be, Nintendo is going

804
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,840
to be providing new content daily and every day you're going to be able to go to your

805
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Nintendo Wii system and see new content, whether it be game downloads or all this shit or how

806
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,880
about, what else were they promising that was going to be really cool.

807
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:32,720
The Wii Connect 24, providing updates automatically, notice all these promises and nothing following

808
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
through.

809
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,260
You know, I will let this slide Nintendo because you know what, in all honesty, Metroid will

810
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,600
never be as good 3D as it was in 2D.

811
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,840
You can argue with me all you want on that one, but I just feel very strongly that Super

812
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,820
Metroid was the all-time greatest Metroid game, and there will never be a Metroid game

813
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,720
as good as Super Metroid.

814
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:58,600
Unless they do a new one in the vein of Super Metroid on the DS.

815
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,720
Well kinda, I mean on the Advance there was Zero Mission or whatever, but it's not the

816
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,600
same on a tiny screen, that's the problem, it's not the same on a tiny screen.

817
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:17,000
The first time I played Super Metroid and Kraid, you know, multi-story boss on the TV,

818
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that was the shit.

819
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,080
The Brinstar music.

820
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
You can't duplicate that on a DS.

821
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Rob.

822
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Rob.

823
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Rob.

824
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
What?

825
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,200
What are you doing on Thursday?

826
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,440
I don't know, what?

827
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
We are playing Super Metroid.

828
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,240
You are coming to my house and we are playing Super Metroid on my 50 inch widescreen.

829
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,680
I'll try to make that happen if we're not house hunting because I am in the middle of

830
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
that right now.

831
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,240
But anyway, what was I ranting about Metroid?

832
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,280
Oh, Nintendo, prove me wrong then about this whole online thing.

833
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,520
Let that be your cards on the table at E3.

834
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,340
I will let this Metroid Prime 3 corruption thing slide if you tell me that Smash Brothers

835
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,600
is going to be online.

836
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,400
I will throw myself in front of Jamie's tank to stop her evil doings and then I will make

837
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,480
love to all of you.

838
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,440
Fuck that, I want to see it actually be online.

839
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,600
I don't want it being promised online.

840
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,960
It's like they promised new fucking content each day on goddamn, you know, Wii Connect

841
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,360
24.

842
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,960
What's the point of having my damn system connected to the internet 24 hours a day if

843
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,040
you're not going to do anything with it?

844
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,280
Fuck, I even got to boot up my system before my messages will download onto it.

845
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,680
What the hell is this Wii Connect 24 shit?

846
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,520
Anyways, so hold on real quick, I'm sorry, sorry, real quick comments from chat.

847
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,960
MikeW0440 says Metroid Prime was one of the greatest games of all time in some people's

848
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
opinion.

849
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,800
That's right, and some people are entitled to be wrong.

850
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
That's fine.

851
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm just kidding.

852
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,960
Prime was a great game, but Super Metroid was better.

853
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
That's all.

854
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,280
GS191 says Nintendo is labeled a big disappointment.

855
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,560
If they add something, people want more.

856
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,440
Nintendo is placed on a very high pedestal and is judged as such.

857
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,680
You know that's true.

858
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,440
As mad as I am right, Nintendo has the most to lose going into this E3, right?

859
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,560
Sony has the most to gain, Nintendo has the most to lose.

860
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:03,040
The problem is like Nintendo, they mark themselves as being innovative, and they are in certain

861
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,280
aspects, but in other aspects, they're making really stupid mistakes.

862
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,440
Not a lot of storage on their system.

863
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Not allowing third party or outside storage.

864
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,080
Granted, they do have the SD memory cards, but other than transferring your game saves

865
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:25,760
off of it and maybe playing some MP3s in Excite Truck, it's not being used, or I don't know,

866
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,200
the whole online thing.

867
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,200
It's all these promises, and you get your hopes up, and then they don't fucking deliver.

868
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,480
I want delivery, dammit.

869
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,940
Please read a story that will not make me want to play the FU music again.

870
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:48,920
Nintendo in Japan, they're of course Club Nintendo, including they have a lot of exclusive

871
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,860
games that get released on there, and they get to buy them off with points that you earn

872
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,480
from buying different Nintendo games and stuff.

873
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:05,120
Such wonderful games include the Game & Watch Collection for the DS, Tingle's Balloon Fight,

874
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,560
and now Exclamation Warriors.

875
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:17,560
It's a bizarre DS game that uses the microphone for gameplay, so it's kind of like a Sentai

876
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,600
Hero type thing, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and you basically yell your attacks

877
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,240
and stuff, so you know, like TRANSFORM, and that's how you play the game.

878
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,280
It's like PUNCH, KICK, and they have like some video of people playing it and stuff,

879
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,000
so it's very strange.

880
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,040
It's something that would probably do pretty well over here, but of course we'll never

881
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
see it.

882
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:51,000
I could imagine Loki playing this game, PUNCH, KICK, KICK, KICK GOD DAMN IT I SAY KICK NO

883
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,120
I SAY KICK BRU BRU

884
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,760
Yeah my voice was already leaving before tonight's show by the way, tonight's show is just making

885
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,520
it worse, I just kind of wanted to get that out there because I can feel myself losing

886
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,280
my voice, it was already going away last night, that's just great.

887
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,180
This show is very healthy for me, I think I just shaved five years off of my life with

888
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,240
tonight's bout of anger.

889
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,840
I have bouts of anger every day, usually when I go to work, this actually makes me a little

890
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
angry too.

891
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,000
Guess the game they're bringing out on the Wii and DS?

892
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,480
Lord knows what, Mario?

893
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Jenga!

894
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,440
Wait, like the board game Jenga?

895
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,520
It's not a board game, it's the stacking game, you know where you have all the blocks and

896
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
you have to pull one out and put it up at the top?

897
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,160
But Jenga's only fun if you have all the blocks to fall all over people.

898
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,720
Okay people, step away from the credit card.

899
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,760
Here's why.

900
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,080
Why the fuck would you buy a game that's probably not going to play very well, granted, okay

901
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:03,120
yeah it's the Wii, you can use the Wii Remote too, okay but yeah, honestly, the Wii is not

902
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,440
that sensitive.

903
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,120
Jenga doesn't cost, I would imagine it's probably less than $10, and you're going to buy a game

904
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,080
for at least $20, and that's the low end.

905
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,260
I bet this Wii version would not have truth or dare Jenga on it, and there is a truth

906
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,940
or dare Jenga game available, it's kind of fun.

907
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,240
So I don't understand why people do this shit.

908
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,120
Because people are too lazy to put the block sculpture together, because it is a little

909
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,280
bit painstaking, I mean you have to put three this way, then three this way, then three

910
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
this way.

911
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,960
Oh my god, and you can just like, I don't know, stack it in the plastic thing that comes

912
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
with it.

913
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,640
Oh that's so difficult, so difficult!

914
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,760
That is a lot of effort for some people.

915
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,640
What can you imagine though, taking it out with the Wii Remote and stuff like that, and

916
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,140
all of a sudden your IR gets fucked up because something shiny is in the room and it knocks

917
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,760
the whole thing over and you're like, fucking A, why the hell did I pay money for this damn

918
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
game?

919
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,540
I was doing it perfect and it fucked it up, what the hell?

920
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,520
Maybe this version of Jenga will actually be online, you could play online.

921
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,560
Oh yeah, oh wait, Nintendo, never mind.

922
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,480
It can't be online, because that's not possible.

923
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,160
Yeah, I agree, I have no idea why this game exists.

924
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,560
But we can talk about some games that will exist pretty soon.

925
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,160
Jamie, are you excited about Jenga on the Wii?

926
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,320
No, I want, I miss my actual Jenga.

927
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,520
We should play Truth or Dare Jenga on OLR one night during a slow news week, because

928
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,240
the little blocks that you pull out have little questions on them that you have to answer,

929
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,000
or little dares you have to do, or it's dumb stuff.

930
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,800
It's like a Mormon Truth or Dare game, you're not going to do anything that dirty.

931
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:48,080
Anyway, let's talk about some upcoming release dates over in Japan and some things you can

932
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,040
get your hands on pretty soon.

933
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,400
Let's talk about the Xbox 360 on July 12th, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

934
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,700
2 makes its way to the Japanese audience thanks to Ubisoft, that's on the Xbox 360.

935
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,120
Going over to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Quest Swords finally

936
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,920
shows up on July 12th from Squeenix on the Nintendo Wii.

937
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,360
Not a very busy release week, but if you go over to the PlayStation 3, you get Gundam

938
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,640
Musou, but that's actually coming out in Korea, I'm not sure if that's also coming out in

939
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,680
Japan, but it is coming out over there.

940
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,680
It's the same TV type anyway, actually the same TV is over here.

941
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games are going into

942
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,760
the best hits, so they're getting big price reductions over there in Japan.

943
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,160
Also Disgaea Hour of Darkness 2 is also getting a price cut.

944
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,440
Not a whole lot of new games coming out over there in Japan, although if you're a music

945
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,720
game fan, you probably already have Pop and Music 14 Fever preordered.

946
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,980
Pop and Music 14, of course, the long running music game series, it's kind of like a cross

947
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,620
between Beat Mania and Trouble with the Pop-O-Matic Bubble, because the controller looks like

948
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,480
seven of those and you hit them.

949
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,560
If you ever watch that movie, what the hell is that movie?

950
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,040
Lost in Translation, which is walking through the arcade, you see somebody freestyling on

951
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
Pop and Music, it's pretty awesome.

952
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, there's a game called Izumo Zero, it's an adventure

953
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,140
game.

954
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,080
It's yet another title that has a very nice looking anime chick on the front, I'm sure

955
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,840
that's like every other game of that type.

956
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,200
I'm totally labeling this based on the box art alone.

957
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,760
On the Nintendo DS, Death Note, there's a Death Note game coming out from Konami.

958
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,000
I need this.

959
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,020
So you'll like that one.

960
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,200
And Monster Farm DS also coming out, and one of my favorite titles, I have no idea what

961
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,000
this is supposed to mean, but it's Kyurin Revolution Mezase Idol Queen, it's a strategy

962
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,120
game from Konami, but it looks like a pop idol kind of contest, and the chick's wearing

963
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,440
a cowboy hat and winking at you on the box art cover, so I have no idea what the hell

964
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,520
that game's supposed to be.

965
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:10,040
Over on the PSP, coming out on July 12th over in Japan, you have Tekken Dark Resurrection

966
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,920
getting a price cut, and that's it, no new games.

967
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,520
There you have it, Japanese releases.

968
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I was going to mention something real quick, the DDR Hottest Party page finally made it

969
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,720
up on the Japanese site for Konami, and I thought there was some intro, they had quotes

970
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,440
from all the music directors and stuff from other Bomani games in Japan, and they have

971
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,280
some really interesting quotes like, this game is killing it, the Dance Dance Revolution

972
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,160
Extreme director, Inubuzu, which I thought was funny.

973
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,760
That's what happens when I don't play DDR for like six months, and then I try to play

974
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,960
like a ten foot song on the arcade, I go, this game is killing me.

975
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
You know.

976
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
What?

977
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,000
I actually passed a nine footer the other day.

978
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Wow can I shake your hand?

979
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,560
After a year of not playing.

980
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,840
No that's good, but did you want to die afterwards?

981
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Yes I did freaking kakame!

982
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,000
This game is killing it!

983
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,580
Anyhow, more release dates please, Loki.

984
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,960
Well if you're looking for console games this week, keep looking.

985
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,960
The only thing that you are going to find though is Project Silpheed for the 360, that's

986
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,680
going to be making its way out this week.

987
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,120
Didn't that already come out?

988
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
No.

989
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,800
It is coming out this week though.

990
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,120
That's about it for console games.

991
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,680
Now for handhelds though, we've got a few things, Smash Court Tennis 3 is coming out

992
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:43,120
to the PSP, as well as Riviera, The Promised Land is also making its way out to the PSP.

993
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:49,560
See for the DS, just Vegas Casino High Five, that's making its way out.

994
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:58,040
And then on the PC, not a whole lot of good stuff, but yet again, it doesn't cease to

995
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:05,120
amaze me, another Tycoon game, Ride Carnival Tycoon, coming out, I swear to god there's

996
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,880
a new one every fucking week.

997
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:14,560
I can probably play that piece of shit online, but I still can't take my Wii online.

998
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,840
Anyhow, how about some European release dates for the listeners?

999
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,720
Well we have a few interesting things.

1000
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,440
Actually on the 13th is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Game Boy Advance,

1001
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,160
Mario Party 8 for Wii, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, also on the 13th

1002
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,160
for PC.

1003
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,440
On the 20th we have The Darkness and Transformers The Game on DS, sorry, the DS release.

1004
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,360
And then on the 21st, the one thing everybody's been looking forward to on the PC, this is

1005
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,640
so exciting, Brian Lara's International Cricket.

1006
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,640
Hooray!

1007
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,440
I'm so excited.

1008
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,080
Because everybody loves cricket.

1009
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,840
Yeah.

1010
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,520
And to that statement, I hear a chorus of crickets in the background, wah wah wah, oh

1011
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
god I'm fired.

1012
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,880
Wasn't that that little doll that you'd put the tape in her back and she'd read you a

1013
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,880
story?

1014
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
What?

1015
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
It was called Cricket.

1016
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
It was Teddy Ruxpin.

1017
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,280
Have you been reading Penny Arcade lately?

1018
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,280
No.

1019
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,280
They're doing like, I don't read, they're doing like hardcore Teddy Ruxpin, the action

1020
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
hero.

1021
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,560
Now that's cool.

1022
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,040
There should be, there should be like a fighting game with our childhood favorites, like Teddy

1023
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,800
Ruxpin versus Cabbage Patch Doll.

1024
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,280
Now here's the thing, you probably never played this game, but it's a, I don't know if it's

1025
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,040
a tabletop RPG, but it is an RPG.

1026
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:46,120
It's called Fuzzy Heroes, and you use stuffed animals as, I swear to god, you use stuffed

1027
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:52,240
animals as characters in the game, and based on what the stuffed animal has, the attributes

1028
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,560
and stuff, you have different attack abilities, and it's a tactical, like, I guess I don't

1029
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,480
know what you'd call it, tabletop RPG, but it's basically like a tabletop RPG, and you

1030
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,280
move them around and stuff and you attack with different abilities, like so for example,

1031
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,520
I had, we had brought, and we only played this game once, and it kind of sucked.

1032
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,640
What is this game called again?

1033
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,640
Fuzzy Heroes.

1034
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
This is like a furry's paradise.

1035
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:22,480
And basically, like, I had the dragon from Fantasia, you know, that we got at Disneyland,

1036
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,920
and so, you know, because it's a dragon, you know, it would have, like, flight and fire

1037
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,160
and stuff like that, so, I don't know, this was a long time ago, but I don't know, it's,

1038
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,120
they could do something like that, I guess, with stuffed animals, it's an interesting

1039
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,120
idea.

1040
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,120
You could do that with them again.

1041
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,120
Yeah.

1042
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Okay.

1043
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
What?

1044
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,040
Oh, my God, Rob.

1045
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,760
Here's what Miklotov, here's.

1046
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,880
Best radio ever.

1047
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,480
Sometimes I wish this were a TV show, but here is the present that Miklotov, Rice Princess,

1048
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,600
and Xtaphir all went together and got me.

1049
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,480
It's a panda bear wearing stripper boots and a tutu.

1050
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,480
A pink tutu.

1051
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,720
A pink tutu carrying a little wand with, Jonas just joined us, by the way, and he's making

1052
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,960
this face like OMG.

1053
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,720
Jonas, can you please describe this, her name is Sassy Pants, by the way.

1054
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,640
Can you please describe Sassy Pants to the listeners?

1055
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
And welcome to the show.

1056
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,640
How could I even explain?

1057
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
What the hell is this?

1058
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,800
It's a panda bear wearing a pink tutu and stripper boots.

1059
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,800
So what I'm curious, how would Sassy Pants fare in Fuzzy Heroes?

1060
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,920
Because I think she would dominate, because she can cast magic, true, she has stripper

1061
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,640
boots, so you know she can kick, so I want to play Fuzzy Heroes with Sassy Pants.

1062
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,800
I'm not sure, because I unfortunately don't have the rule book in front of me, because

1063
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,320
this is someone else's thing, but okay, it's a game, if you go to FuzzyHeroes.com,

1064
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:55,280
I think you can still buy the book, but anyways, it's created by Inner City Games Designs,

1065
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,120
and let me see if I can read a brief description of what the game is.

1066
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:04,480
Inner City Games Design is probably best known for our Fuzzy Heroes line of miniature gaming

1067
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,840
products, products that use stuffed toys and action figures as miniature combatants in

1068
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,120
a 3D strategic simulation.

1069
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,560
These games are designed to be introductory for those who are new to the miniatures hobby,

1070
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:24,440
but with both enough depth and humor to engage the veteran miniatures gamer as well.

1071
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,720
We still make Fuzzy Heroes and in fact are gearing up for another set of both games and

1072
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,800
comics for this line, I guess they have comics for this too.

1073
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,360
We also make several independent toy related games, including Very Large Creature, Stuffed

1074
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:49,520
Toys Vs. Miniatures, and Sports Fuzz, 3D football using toys, beer bottles, and whatever happens

1075
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,400
to be lying around.

1076
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,600
By the way, Sassy Pants' tiara fell off, so I found that in the living room, but there's

1077
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,680
also that, which must add some magical powers to it.

1078
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,480
I don't know, but I swear you can probably find this in a comic shop, anyplace that has

1079
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,080
the miniatures tabletop strategy games and stuff.

1080
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
We're spending far too much time on this topic.

1081
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
Sorry.

1082
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,080
No, it's funny.

1083
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,880
I'd never heard of this.

1084
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,320
It would be fun for like, that'd be a fun thing to record.

1085
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,800
Yeah, for a YouTube or something, OLR plays Fuzzy Heroes.

1086
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,600
I wanted to say though about the Harry Potter game that's coming out, it came out here obviously

1087
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,200
already, and I actually got to see it this week, I forgot to say it during my gameweek

1088
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,080
because I didn't play it, I watched somebody else play it.

1089
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,080
It looked boring.

1090
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,600
It looked like all the other Harry Potter games, they didn't look, I mean, because I

1091
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
was really excited.

1092
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Those figures are not very great.

1093
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,000
I was excited about getting to cast magic with the wiimote and everything.

1094
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,680
The funniest thing though was when my friend Eddie, who was playing it, picked up the table

1095
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,920
and was slamming it into people.

1096
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,280
They would go, oh, oh, that hurts, oh, that hurts.

1097
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,840
The game's really funny.

1098
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,480
It's like, you go to Hogwarts and then you run errands through people.

1099
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,640
It's like Hogwarts errand boy, the game is really what the hell...

1100
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,880
No, it's like Animal Crossing at Hogwarts.

1101
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,840
Except Animal Crossing is more fun?

1102
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Yeah.

1103
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,040
Instead of shaking trees, you get beaten up by the whomping willow.

1104
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,480
Anyway, I just wanted to say that real quickly because I actually played the Harry Potter,

1105
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,920
well, I watched the Harry Potter game and it wasn't all that.

1106
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,360
Anyway, Australia, we haven't talked a lot about what's going on in Australia, but

1107
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:23,860
if you are a Wii owner in Australia, you have some good news for you this week.

1108
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,080
You got a ton of virtual console games this week, which is very interesting and that's

1109
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,020
why we're kind of wanting to report on the show is that Nintendo can certainly just push

1110
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,320
out like a shitload of games all at once.

1111
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,600
Listen to this, Australia's got like all of this in one week here.

1112
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,960
Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, Alien Crush, Military

1113
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,500
Madness, R-Type, Dungeon Explorer, Soldier Blade, Motor Roader, and Vigilante.

1114
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,240
So if you're a TurboGrafx fan in Australia, you had a very good week this week.

1115
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,240
Hey, Rob, while we're at it.

1116
00:58:53,240 --> 00:59:00,000
Um, there were actually new releases for, um, uh, and actually now I'm trying to find

1117
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
them again.

1118
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,120
There were new releases for a virtual console in the UK as well and I unfortunately just

1119
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,960
lost my link to it.

1120
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,120
Super Mario Brothers 2 in the US.

1121
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,120
Oh, and over there?

1122
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,920
I do believe that was one of them.

1123
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,320
I had just had it and I feel really crappy about it because, um, I just looked all this

1124
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
up last night.

1125
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,800
I think Paper Mario is supposed to be coming over here pretty soon too.

1126
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,800
They said what's coming out over here on Monday?

1127
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Nothing yet?

1128
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,880
I saw Paper Mario 4, I think, is one of the other regions.

1129
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Here it is.

1130
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
Okay.

1131
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,040
The, uh, Virtual Console, um, for, uh, UK, actually Sonic the Hedgehog 2 just came out.

1132
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:43,000
Um, Golden Axe 2, Echo Tides of Time, Dragon Spirit, those are the games that just came

1133
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
out.

1134
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,280
I think we got most of those over here already, I think.

1135
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,820
So for once, uh, Europe didn't beat us to the punch on Virtual Console because they

1136
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,820
have been lately.

1137
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,360
But they did get some really good games because I love Echo Tides of Time.

1138
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,960
Um, sadly though, I think this is the Mega Drive version and not the, uh, the Mega CD

1139
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,960
one.

1140
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,960
Oh, good point.

1141
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,120
James Patrick in chat says, Australia never saw the release of the TurboGrafx at all.

1142
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:09,640
So if you're a TurboGrafx fan living in Australia, you might be the only one.

1143
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,640
You're a rarity.

1144
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,720
Either that or you were a major hardcore importer.

1145
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,360
Yeah, you're a hardcore importer.

1146
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
Anyways.

1147
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,560
Um, another game that's coming out here later in the fall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles,

1148
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,720
is going to be supporting co-op gameplay as well.

1149
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:29,520
I mean, what good gun game doesn't support, you know, co-op play, but, um, you'll be able

1150
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,080
to kill zombies and whatnot, uh, with a friend.

1151
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,220
I think, obviously though, it's probably local co-op and not online because, you know.

1152
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,220
It is on the Wii.

1153
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,480
They should totally have it to where you are one person and then other people control the

1154
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,480
zombies.

1155
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,560
Sort of like that Pac-Man game.

1156
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,560
That would be fun.

1157
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,520
You could, I want Zombie the game where you are a zombie.

1158
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,000
Why haven't, why hasn't a game like that been made?

1159
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That's a brilliant idea.

1160
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
They need to do more.

1161
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
What?

1162
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,040
They did an online game, I thought, with Resident Evil where if you got bit, you became a zombie

1163
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,040
and stuff.

1164
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,920
But I think they should do Marvel Zombies the game.

1165
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,480
Or you're a superhero zombie.

1166
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,920
Or a George Romero zombie type game or something.

1167
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,880
I don't know, I guess that's what Dead Rising was.

1168
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,440
But like one where you actually get to be the zombie.

1169
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
That would be kind of fun.

1170
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,440
Like an online game.

1171
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,480
Oh, I guess that was Resident Evil on PS2, wasn't it?

1172
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,840
I want Marvel Zombies the game.

1173
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,480
But make it good this time.

1174
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
Make it memorable.

1175
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,560
Well, hey, I have something that's memorable.

1176
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
What's that?

1177
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,000
People were crackheads like me back in the day.

1178
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,440
Ragnarok Online is going to be on Japanese DS in 2008.

1179
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:40,920
The game is also going to be released with Sakana no Asobo, which is a fishing game.

1180
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:49,040
And a, sorry, there's actually going to be an Ikebana game, Ikebana is flower arranging

1181
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,040
by the way.

1182
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:57,720
But Ragnarok Online is going to be in real time using the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

1183
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,760
And it's supposed to be, I guess, tailored to the DS, but it's only going to be out in

1184
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,080
Japan right now.

1185
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,160
Which means I'm going to be importing it and sitting around with my dictionary.

1186
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,160
Either that, or I will just probably remember where all the shit is anyway, because I played

1187
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,960
Ragnarok Online for what, five, six years?

1188
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,800
Well there's really only one phrase that you need to know in Japanese, and that's we ban

1189
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
you.

1190
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,980
Yeah, but actually, the Rob D makes an interesting point, why are they calling it Ragnarok Online

1191
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,980
when it's not online?

1192
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
It is online.

1193
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,980
It's going to be on Wi-Fi.

1194
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
Oh.

1195
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,980
Huh?

1196
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,980
Touche.

1197
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,260
So much for that.

1198
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,720
Also speaking of quirky games coming over from overseas, Majesco is going to be making

1199
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,800
a local version of Furu Furu Park.

1200
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,620
It was a game that came out in Japan in April, and get this, it's a game on the Wii that

1201
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,120
consists of mini games.

1202
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,720
Who doesn't love mini games on the Wii?

1203
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,200
Good stuff.

1204
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,560
But the cool thing about it, in all seriousness, is that it's based off a lot of classic Taito

1205
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,840
games that you've seen re-released in other bundles, but these are re-imagined games.

1206
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,560
Bubble Bobble, Arkanoid.

1207
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,360
Majesco's going to be localizing it here for North America, and making it all in English

1208
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,360
and all that good stuff.

1209
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,360
I love Arkanoid.

1210
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,760
That is one of the mindless games that I absolutely just love, is Arkanoid.

1211
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,560
Will you be able to pass level 30?

1212
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,840
I'm pretty sure you will be.

1213
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,480
I always liked Arkanoid Revenge of- Don't!

1214
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,200
That was one of my favorites.

1215
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
I like those games as a kid a lot.

1216
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,120
I had my breakout going on back in the day.

1217
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,280
I was where you could give your paddle a gun.

1218
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,520
It's like Breakout with guns, that was awesome.

1219
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,280
By the way, the game also has like original type of games.

1220
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,620
There's a karate game, a safe cracking game, so it's not just retro classics.

1221
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:46,980
But mini game fun, because who doesn't love their mini games on the Wii?

1222
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,760
That's what I live for on the Wii.

1223
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:55,000
Well, something very interesting that's going to be coming to arcades pretty soon.

1224
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,240
Capcom is actually doing an original 2D fighting game.

1225
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,200
It's going to be the first one that they've done in three years.

1226
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
It's coming soon.

1227
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,620
There's a new teaser page on Capcom Japan's site.

1228
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,520
No word exactly on what it is, although it looks very promising seeing as some of the

1229
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:20,340
shots we've seen so far of the Street Fighter 2 HD for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation

1230
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,340
Network and stuff.

1231
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,120
Oh, it looks awesome.

1232
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,680
Do you really think they'd put out Street Fighter 4?

1233
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,640
No, not for another five years.

1234
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,320
If Street Fighter 3 was any indication.

1235
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,120
I think we need another Marvel vs. Capcom.

1236
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,120
You know what we need?

1237
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,120
We need a Cyberbot sequel, because Cyberbot is Capcom's number one fighting game.

1238
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,480
Interesting choice.

1239
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,600
To quote Puzzle Fighter anyway.

1240
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
Let's see.

1241
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,600
You could have...

1242
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,320
It's the game that gave us Devilot and Super 8.

1243
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,160
Capcom and SNK vs. Marvel and I don't know, your mom.

1244
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Arcades vs. comics.

1245
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
There you go.

1246
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,880
It'll be like arcade fighting games vs. comic characters.

1247
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,640
We just need a new Cyberbot.

1248
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,600
We need a new Cyberbot, because Cyberbot is still...

1249
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
And we...

1250
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
And another Red Earth.

1251
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,880
How about another Darkstalkers game?

1252
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,760
That would be cool.

1253
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
No.

1254
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
How about no?

1255
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
I don't know.

1256
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
It's all about dude who played with his blood.

1257
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,760
That'd be cool.

1258
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
Go get a...

1259
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,960
Going to chatroomchat.orangelandtrader.com, Rob D. says, new Capcom 2D fighter?

1260
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,960
I'm in.

1261
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
No questions asked.

1262
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,960
Let's see.

1263
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:26,560
Shadow Charlie says, quote, butt fucking yeah, another Cyberbot.

1264
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,560
Hell yeah.

1265
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,080
What they need to do is they need to get like, you know how they have the Triforce thing

1266
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,320
for, you know, the F-Zero stuff, where it's Sega and, you know, Namco and Nintendo.

1267
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:43,160
They need to do something like that for fighting games, SNK, Capcom, and maybe Sega, I guess.

1268
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,200
And do like some sort of all-encompassing thing that has a lot of characters from all

1269
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
these different games.

1270
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,760
You know, you think all those brilliant minds put together could like, I don't know, save

1271
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,760
arcades?

1272
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,760
No.

1273
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,760
You think?

1274
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,760
I don't know.

1275
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,760
Maybe they don't want to.

1276
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,760
Well, I mean, look at MUGEN.

1277
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,640
I mean, that's the way to go.

1278
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,040
Billions of fighters all fighting each other.

1279
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,040
That should be the name of the game.

1280
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,280
MUGEN is freaking awesome.

1281
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,280
There it is.

1282
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,280
There's the name of the game right there.

1283
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,160
Billions of fighters all fighting each other.

1284
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
That's it, right?

1285
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,160
Super happy.

1286
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,160
Yeah.

1287
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,200
Because, you know, that's fighting orgy.

1288
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,800
You know what game, though, that I really want a new version of?

1289
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,880
Not orgy.

1290
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,320
No.

1291
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,520
I want a new Rival Schools.

1292
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,400
I played the crap out of the first one, out of the Evolution one.

1293
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,200
I paid 90 bucks for the Evolution one.

1294
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,320
Well, no, there was a rumor about the Apollo Justice game or whatever that was subtitled

1295
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,840
and people are thinking it's either a new Phoenix Wright game or a new Rival Schools

1296
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,840
game.

1297
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
So.

1298
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
You know what?

1299
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,840
MUGEN makes this joke in chat, the Super Ultimate Extreme Fighting Combat Tournament, and that

1300
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:58,160
makes me think, oh my god, why doesn't Capcom and Midway just get together, give the fans

1301
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,360
what they want?

1302
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,720
Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat.

1303
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,720
Come on.

1304
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
That would be hot.

1305
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,000
That would be hot.

1306
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It wouldn't work.

1307
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,120
They would have to use, like, this really shitball Street Fighter game.

1308
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
Actually, no.

1309
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,120
And Mortal Kombat.

1310
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Actually, no.

1311
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,760
They could take the Mortal Kombat characters and make them all cool, cell, you know, shaded

1312
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,760
and stuff.

1313
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,280
The ones that are all 3D, they could use the Street Fighter EX.

1314
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,840
Now I do realize this means Capcom and Midway have to get together, which I don't think

1315
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,960
anybody ever thinks would happen, but.

1316
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,960
Why not?

1317
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,960
I would say that would be pretty cool.

1318
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,960
And there you go.

1319
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,720
Midway, SNK, and Capcom.

1320
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,000
And I would say instead of going, you know, with the live, you know, the Mortal Kombat's

1321
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,800
been out of arcades for how long now?

1322
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,800
For a long time.

1323
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,640
And this way you could take, you know, the characters from Mortal Kombat and actually

1324
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,040
draw them all cell shaded and stuff and it would look pretty awesome.

1325
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,400
But they would never do that because it would be awesome and make sense.

1326
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,400
Ross Steele, UT, says Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat wouldn't work.

1327
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,560
The games are too different.

1328
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:58,260
I don't know though, but they made, I mean, they made Capcom fight comic book characters

1329
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,360
and that somehow worked.

1330
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:05,560
I mean, and, you know, Marvel versus Capcom versus SNK, you know, and it could, I mean,

1331
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,080
I understand because there's a lot of weaponry that goes into Mortal Kombat and it's a much

1332
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,080
darker game.

1333
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:16,600
Yes, it's a total fanboy thing I'm going off on here with, but come on and indulge me for

1334
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,600
just like five seconds.

1335
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,760
It might be a fun game.

1336
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:25,200
Well, if you don't mind me going to a previous topic, by the way, the Ragnarok Online DS

1337
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,440
is not actually online.

1338
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,680
They just have multiplayer elements over Wi-Fi.

1339
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:37,840
I'm going to refrain from making the obvious joke here about Nintendo because I'm irritating

1340
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,120
some folks in chat, although they can kiss my big fat butt.

1341
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,800
They should just do it on Wii, but instead of your little Ragnarok characters, you have

1342
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,800
your Miis.

1343
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,200
No, that might be cute.

1344
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,200
You have, like, Ragnar-Me.

1345
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,040
Ragnar-Me?

1346
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,040
You're weird.

1347
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,560
All right, enough of this whole fighting game talk.

1348
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,040
Somebody please bring up another topic.

1349
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:06,720
Well, anyone who's a fan of Valkyrie Profile will be happy that Valkyrie Profile 2 has

1350
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,060
a date.

1351
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,800
It will be out on the 7th of September.

1352
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,600
Yay!

1353
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:21,240
So this one has got a different story.

1354
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:28,000
There's going to be the youngest of three Valkyries is booted out of heaven and has

1355
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
to go do shit.

1356
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,280
That would suck to get booted out of heaven, actually.

1357
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:37,360
So this is one of those series I've wanted to play but haven't gotten a chance to check

1358
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,360
out.

1359
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,840
Well, seeing as how if you're a Valkyrie you have to fight all the time and then think

1360
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,800
people to die, so I think being booted out of heaven might not be so bad.

1361
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,160
The only other game with a Valkyrie I can think of is Gauntlet because I always used

1362
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,760
to play Blue Valkyrie.

1363
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,960
Or Macross.

1364
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,960
Blue Valkyrie.

1365
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,680
Yeah, but that's a different kind of Valkyrie, duh.

1366
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,960
I like that Valkyrie a lot better.

1367
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:02,200
Dude, I wouldn't mind having the one where you use your brain, like in Macross Plus.

1368
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,080
The YF-21.

1369
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,080
That was it.

1370
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,080
Anyway.

1371
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,080
Uh, you know, a lot of folks in chat, going back to the fighting game topic for a moment,

1372
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,280
now they're getting all Killer Instinct on it.

1373
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,640
They're like, who owns Killer Instinct now?

1374
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,640
I do.

1375
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,640
Who cares?

1376
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
Killer Instinct sucked.

1377
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,640
It was kind of fun.

1378
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,640
I liked it.

1379
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,640
Boo!

1380
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Boo yourself.

1381
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,640
I actually have both of them.

1382
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,800
I have the one on Nintendo 64 and, okay.

1383
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,720
I forgot they had it on 64.

1384
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,440
Yeah, they did KI 2 Gold.

1385
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,440
That's right.

1386
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,440
Good times.

1387
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,440
And I remember, this was before I moved out here.

1388
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,440
I had Dan play the game over and over and over again just to rip me orchid's music.

1389
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,880
SSJ100Matt says, Rare says they have no intention of doing a new Killer Instinct.

1390
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
DIAF Rare.

1391
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,880
You know, I played a Rare, actually I did play a Rare game at the party.

1392
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Pinbot.

1393
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,480
Rare published Pinbot for the Nintendo.

1394
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,480
That's true.

1395
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,560
But thank God, though, they're going to be doing that Banjo Kazooie sequel.

1396
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,560
Woo!

1397
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,200
Cannot wait.

1398
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,880
That's going to be so awesome and totally won't suck.

1399
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,560
All right, look, let's change the topic completely here.

1400
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,480
One last topic for this part A, then we're going to go into a break and come back for

1401
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,040
part B. Talking about the Simpsons game.

1402
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,400
You know, the Simpsons have a game coming out, you know, it's no coincidence there's

1403
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,880
a movie and pretty soon there'll be a game.

1404
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,840
And this game is like a spoof of every other video game, yes?

1405
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,840
Yes.

1406
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,840
Yes.

1407
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,760
Well, the ultimate spoof waits for you at the very end of the game.

1408
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,040
The very last boss, the final boss in the Simpsons game is Matt Groening, the creator

1409
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,800
of the Simpsons is who you will face at the very end of the game.

1410
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,800
Ooh, spoiler!

1411
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,880
Yeah, sorry, OMG spoiler, but you know, come on, you don't play a Simpsons game for the

1412
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,880
plot.

1413
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
You play it because it's funny.

1414
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,120
The game looks sexy, too, by the way.

1415
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,080
This is like EA's first Simpsons game.

1416
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,080
It looks awesome.

1417
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,080
Good.

1418
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Well, props to EA.

1419
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,840
You know, sometimes we dog on that company a little bit on this show, but props to them

1420
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,200
if they pull this off.

1421
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,480
Certainly not anything like Superman returns the game.

1422
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,240
This game, by the way, will be out this fall, so it's going to miss the movie, but probably

1423
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,680
make it in time for the DVD release, yes?

1424
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,960
That would be my guess.

1425
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,200
The Rob D says, you totally spoiled the Simpsons game I wasn't going to play.

1426
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,200
How could you?

1427
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,120
SSJ100Matt says, still waiting on Simpsons arcade game on 360.

1428
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,640
You never know, the movie's around the corner.

1429
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
It could happen.

1430
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,640
It could happen.

1431
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,320
But, again, it's going to be like that whole, you know, Konami and Ubisoft had to kind of

1432
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,520
team up to get us Ninja Turtles, so what, Konami and EA are going to have to team up

1433
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,160
to get us Simpsons, right?

1434
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,160
Could happen, though.

1435
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,160
Who knows?

1436
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:38,320
You know, it could very well could be like Doom, where it's like, Doom, there it is.

1437
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,560
We didn't tell you about it, so there it is.

1438
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,480
That's exactly what Peter Moore said at the press conference, too, is it's like, Doom,

1439
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,480
there it is.

1440
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,600
Yeah, we need a break.

1441
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,920
I know, that's how I feel, too.

1442
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,120
We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with a little more of Orange Lounge

1443
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,120
Radio.

1444
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,960
Hey, in part B tonight, listless.

1445
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,440
E3 is just around the corner, so we need to do an honorary E3 listless.

1446
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,360
If you haven't heard listless before, definitely stay tuned for part B. And we'll be back with

1447
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,600
more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1448
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,980
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and it's podcast to the world twice

1449
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,980
a week.

1450
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,240
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
