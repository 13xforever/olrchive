00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:26,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 8th, 2007, the PlayStation 3 might be getting a price cut in the name of E3, notable games may not even show up at E3, and lots of tunes are dying over a new advertisement in World of Warcraft.

2
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that radio program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:47,067
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:47,547
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

6
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:48,988
[SPEAKER_02]: What, huh?

7
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

8
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:50,589
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

9
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:51,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here, aren't I?

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you finally saw Transformers today?

11
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

12
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And, verdict?

13
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a major female boner for Ironhide now.

14
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:00,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that?

15
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Williams, let's go!

16
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:33,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Also joining us, I will not be going on a date with Techmaster Loki.

17
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

18
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your wife might disapprove of that.

19
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:37,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

21
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,031
[SPEAKER_02]: She might like it, actually.

22
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:41,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

23
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,312
[SPEAKER_02]: How's your week been?

24
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been good.

25
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you saw Transformers last week and told us all about it.

26
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen anything new this week?

27
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:48,793
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

28
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:52,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I meant to see Transformers again this week, but I got lazy.

29
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:58,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We got out of work early on the 3rd, and I was like, you know, I could go see Transformers again.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,686
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I got out to my car and it was like hot and I was like, I just want to go home and sit in the air conditioning.

31
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very hot here in Sacramento where our show is based.

32
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 106, 107 this week has been crazy.

33
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:09,817
[SPEAKER_02]: At least we don't have humidity.

34
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:13,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you'd think we were a movie podcast or something, but we're actually not.

35
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about video games, so we're going to start off tonight's program as we always do, talking about How Was Your Gaming Week.

36
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I want to introduce our chat room.

37
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over at chat.orangelongeradio.com.

38
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:33,258
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, and interesting things always happen if you're listening live, such as if you listen tonight, we had to do two takes of our intro because I made a big boo-boo.

39
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to hear the whole show, you've got to listen live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time at OrangeLondonRadio.com on our live 365 feed.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can always participate in our chat room, chat.OrangeLondonRadio.com.

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also be opening up our Skype line later on.

42
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:50,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also a telephone number, an 877 number you can call in to.

43
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:52,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get those calls a little later on in the program.

44
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, DarkSakura is going to tell us all about her gaming week.

45
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one.

46
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I did try to play some World of Warcraft and then I got tired of updating all that crap.

47
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:07,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So all I did was play a little bit of Pokemans.

48
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:09,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really it.

49
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:10,519
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Pokemans been going?

50
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an email actually last week asking how you were doing on your Pokemans.

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hardly doing.

52
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:16,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I answered.

53
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a crap ton of pinball.

54
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:18,802
[SPEAKER_03]: We got too many machines.

55
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,723
[SPEAKER_03]: We finally got rid of Retardo Johnny Mnemonic.

56
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got rid of Guns N' Roses.

57
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Simpsons pinball party now, which is really freaking cool.

58
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:35,806
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have World Cup Soccer, which was my favorite machine ever.

59
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, my first time playing it, I cracked a billion points, which just goes to show that my mad skills at that game have only diminished very slightly.

60
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you didn't break two billion.

61
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I've almost gotten there.

62
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really, really good at that machine.

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played the Spider-Man pinball today.

64
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,303
[SPEAKER_03]: The new one is really, really good.

65
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,186
[SPEAKER_03]: and I kept hitting Sandman over and over and over again.

66
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,229
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you get for being a bad, bad guy in a movie.

67
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,290
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

68
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

69
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:08,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And less dramatic, please.

70
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:09,534
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

71
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,935
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally hooked up.

72
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:16,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a temporary setup for the 360 LAN systems at my work now.

73
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:21,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried a few test games of Saints Row and it's fun.

74
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:22,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.

75
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,567
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is right now we have

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:33,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the systems have the patch for the multiplayer in it so that there's no lag, and some of them don't, so we ran into a few issues with that.

77
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:39,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that's awesome in the game is the pimp slap power-up that you can get.

78
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:47,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you run around with a pimp hat on, you can backhand people and fling them across the entire stage, which is awesome.

79
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:58,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only problem is the game only has three multiplayer maps, which kind of sucks, and, you know, I've been kind of spoiled with Infinite Sprint and, um, Grand Theft Auto, so.

80
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll hold us over until, uh, Grand Theft Auto 4.

81
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, been playing lots of Final Fantasy on the PSP.

82
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:11,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but I've been playing it, and it's pretty good.

83
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Just finished, um, was actually...

84
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

85
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:34,906
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

86
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:01,569
[SPEAKER_01]: First you have to fight Starscream, and then you eventually have to fight Blackout, then you have to fight them both together.

87
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:09,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the little drones that they throw down in the middle were actually harder than Starscream and Blackout, which is stupid.

88
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, the whole game is very glitchy, and I highly recommend not playing it.

89
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:22,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it through to get some more achievement points, but I'm going to quickly sell this.

90
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,346
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did give this game a favorable review last week, right?

91
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

92
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the missions are alright.

93
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played too many of the Decepticon missions.

94
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:36,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still playing through the Autobots because I want to play the worst part of the game first and then play stuff where you have to blow up things.

95
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:40,716
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually watched my friend play the first mission of...

96
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:46,073
[SPEAKER_01]: The Decepticons, and it didn't look that much more fun, actually.

97
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like it sucked, so I don't know.

98
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:52,754
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really bad game, I guess, unfortunately.

99
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:56,755
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw, a big, big Transformers nerd, has some advice for you.

100
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:59,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, Loki, to beat the drones, you have to throw things at them first.

101
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:09,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that, and that's what I was doing, because there's, obviously, each drone has the same damn, you know, pattern to them, and I was throwing stuff, and it wasn't doing anything.

102
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:10,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was dumb.

103
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:11,458
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

104
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:41,561
[SPEAKER_02]: now this happens though sometimes we do change our opinions on video games and not something that's really talked about a whole lot you know like sometimes this happens with movies you may watch a movie like one time and you didn't like it but then like the second time you watch it you see something you didn't see before like sometimes that happens with games too can you think of other games that you've ever like changed your mind on after playing them either favorably or unfavorably um hmm I can't think of anything offhand maybe like Guitar Hero you know it was cool in the beginning and it kind of sucks now

105
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:47,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I'm just not really in... Music games for me right now, I just can't dedicate enough time to them.

106
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,722
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

107
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,863
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um... I would say World of Warcraft.

108
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get into it the first time I played it.

109
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Final Fantasy XI?

110
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:54,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

111
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.

112
00:07:57,046 --> 00:08:00,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after a while, you know, it started just... After two years for me.

113
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:06,651
[SPEAKER_01]: After you finally, you know, you get done with the low-level partying stuff, and then you realize, oh, yeah, this kind of sucks now.

114
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,552
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um... I don't know.

115
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:10,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

116
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:11,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just...

117
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:15,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something you don't... Activision is pulling an Ubisoft, is what they're doing.

118
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,941
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really letting me down with a lot of their games.

119
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we talked about this last week briefly, Nintendogs.

120
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:28,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think it was the last week or two weeks ago, we talked about how we all loved Nintendogs when we first played it, and then we actually played the full, full game and was like, wow, this got old quick.

121
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:36,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I can't blame Activision, I guess, too much for these games, because they're not developing them, but... Stop publishing crappy games.

122
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:37,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, I...

123
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:45,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I was discussing something with you guys off-air earlier, and it's like, stop publishing crappy games.

124
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Dumb ideas.

125
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:50,974
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to say?

126
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:57,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking that you don't really see that a lot in the review game industry, where people kind of change their minds over time.

127
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:57,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

128
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really addressed a lot, but it can happen.

129
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, anything else for your gaming week?

130
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:04,041
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

131
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

132
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week wasn't anything too spectacular because I was still playing some World of Warcraft.

133
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on the Battlestar Galactica themed PvP guild because we aren't just nerds playing World of Warcraft.

134
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,991
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to take it one step further and incorporate Battlestar Galactica into our guild.

135
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:20,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like double nerd.

136
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft but also the new game I checked out this week I did check out Missile Command on Xbox Live Arcade because I do love the old old 2600 version and the old arcade version to some extent as well and you know the Atari ports are coming out pretty good you know they're cheap they're five bucks and you know the enhanced graphics are actually really good it doesn't feel like kind of like the same type of graphics they actually when they enhanced the graphics they enhanced it for widescreen mode as well so it kind of changes the element of Missile Command and

137
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I don't really like is that I want to be able to control the game with a mouse.

138
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:58,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like using the stick to control the game.

139
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:03,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Missile Command was the type of game that was meant for a frickin' trackball or a mouse, which is essentially an inverted trackball, right?

140
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,644
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I cannot play that game with a thumbstick.

141
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:10,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some type of mouse or trackball control to really play Missile Command.

142
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the presentation, graphics, sound, gameplay, it's Missile Command.

143
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cheap, so it's fine.

144
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:18,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Rayman's Raving Rabbids

145
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:42,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know!

146
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:43,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill.

147
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like Silent Hill the first time I played it.

148
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I love it.

149
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:50,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally just one of those things where I saw something I didn't see before the first time.

150
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:51,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Driver 3.

151
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Made peer pressure, I don't know.

152
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:54,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the game.

153
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hate the game, but it's fun to play.

154
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Burnout?

155
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of stupid at first.

156
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I saw how big explosions could be, I was like, I like explosions and wrecks.

157
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like them in my video games.

158
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when that's the whole point.

159
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just the opposite.

160
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it when it first came out.

161
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:18,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, I think the one that really stood out for me was Burnout Takedown.

162
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Revenge is kind of eh, it's okay.

163
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the newer ones are just kind of eh.

164
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:25,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

165
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, our chat room wants to chime in with their suggestions.

166
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:32,175
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon says, Katamari gets old really fast, like within minutes.

167
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:33,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the PSP one.

168
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,236
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a perfect example.

169
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

170
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt is commenting on Missile Command.

171
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Who needs a port when you got the real thing?

172
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally fixed my Atari 400.

173
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:44,737
[SPEAKER_02]: for the enhanced mode.

174
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:50,902
[SPEAKER_02]: For the enhanced mode is totally high def graphics and Ravar music and all that kind of stuff.

175
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:57,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only $5, which if you think about how many quarters you popped into Missile Command back in the day, $5 is not too bad of a deal.

176
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just depends.

177
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people aren't into the old retro classics.

178
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:02,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, so it's worth it to me.

179
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're not into the retro upgrades, then there's probably a lot on Xbox Live you don't like.

180
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:09,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also wanted to say I played Luminous

181
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

182
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's some pretty decent stuff in there.

183
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:42,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a couple recycles from the old Luminous games, which isn't much of a surprise, but some new stuff as well, so.

184
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play a dance game this week, I forgot.

185
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,580
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what's that?

186
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:48,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I briefly played Neon FM, which, uh... Wow.

187
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the PC or something?

188
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got leaked in there.

189
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:55,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, well, it never got made, let me put it that way.

190
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:56,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

191
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been pretty cool if they had the dance pads for it and stuff, it's just, you know.

192
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess, well, God, you want to keep interrupting my gaming week?

193
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:04,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of...

194
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous, Missile Command, World of Warcraft GameTab

195
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:21,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little bit, but I'm not allowed to discuss it because I get called a whore and a sellout when I do.

196
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:22,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

197
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a whore and a sellout.

198
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:23,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you.

199
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I did play a little bit of GameTap this week as well, yes.

200
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:27,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did you play on GameTap?

201
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:28,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Old Atari 2600 games.

202
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:29,788
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my things.

203
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going back through leaderboards trying to get high scores on stuff.

204
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I play BurgerTime, too.

205
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob likes to score.

206
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind.

207
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:36,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

208
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:41,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, remind me I need to loan you Salmon Mac Season 1.

209
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you don't need to.

210
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on GameTap.

211
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't played it.

212
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Then play it.

213
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:45,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

214
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to.

215
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,194
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, so that's that.

216
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:52,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some housekeeping, and then we'll get into gaming news.

217
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping tonight.

218
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,319
[SPEAKER_02]: SacAnime, we mentioned last week we'll be going to SacAnime.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We only hit a little kink, though.

220
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:04,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if we're actually doing a panel at SacAnime, because communication has not been so great.

221
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:04,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.

222
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Things happen.

223
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very last minute.

224
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:10,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I know at least DarkSakura is going to SacAnime, and I'm going as well.

225
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:11,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be around.

226
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to be there, say hi.

227
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:14,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I don't know if you're going or not.

228
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:14,572
[SPEAKER_02]: When is it?

229
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:16,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next weekend at the Doubletree.

230
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Next weekend.

231
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

232
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,176
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to Quadruple Tree.

233
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I got an idea.

234
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:24,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's name it Tree.

235
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Double Tree.

236
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

237
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I was holding up for Quadruple Tree.

238
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's really it.

239
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:35,847
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to mention that we'll be appearing there one way or another, even if we're just walking the floor like the rest of you.

240
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: and, again, we're always looking for anime conventions in California in the West Coast area that we can get to to come say hi because we love doing live panels and that's like, you know, we like doing our show live.

241
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:48,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you noticed, but we've recorded live.

242
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have the chat room and it's a whole other thing to have the studio audience.

243
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you love when everybody's staring right at you, DarkSakura?

244
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the best way to record a show?

245
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:55,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

246
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm used to it all the time.

247
00:14:59,391 --> 00:14:59,651
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

248
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news.

249
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to start us off tonight?

250
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:03,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I could.

251
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:04,412
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

252
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:05,372
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got to.

253
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:06,932
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yes, you got it.

254
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:14,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is an expected price cut coming for the PlayStation 3, supposed to reduce by $100.

255
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:22,639
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an ad put out by Circuit City saying that it was going to be dropping.

256
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's $600, but I don't know, $500 might make it actually sell better, I don't know.

257
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:32,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's supposed to be in conjunction with E3.

258
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be this year's E3 speech.

259
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: $499 U.S.

260
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:37,321
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.

261
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: $499 U.S.

262
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,121
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.

263
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rest of us are like, okay.

264
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean the other model is dropping to $399?

265
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:44,644
[SPEAKER_02]: What other model?

266
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not producing it anymore, are they?

267
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a collector's item, yo.

268
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:49,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Those bastards.

269
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Collector's item.

270
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:55,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even think of that because when I heard about the $100 price drop, I was like, oh, well, then the other one will be $399.

271
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:56,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be easily affordable.

272
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot they got rid of that.

273
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Sneaky bastards.

274
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all excited about this price drop too.

275
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess everyone's doing it now.

276
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:10,886
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think a few people, I remember seeing some scans of Target receipts where people are buying them for $4.99 already, so it's everywhere.

277
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a secret!

278
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,667
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to know about this yet!

279
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Shh!

280
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:17,548
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

281
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, though, I'm still not sold.

282
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: $500 is still a lot for me.

283
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:28,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking to a guy who's moving in a few weeks and has all those expenses, so I can't be thinking about video game expenses right now?

284
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just go over and play Jamie's.

285
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, people.

286
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

287
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:33,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's collecting dust at my house anyway.

288
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's like, oh, well, that makes it more affordable.

289
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy that instead of a 360.

290
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:42,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, don't you think they're going to drop the price of the 360, too, to compete with this?

291
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:42,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.

292
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, actually, they might leave it the same because...

293
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:52,832
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel it's competitive pricing still and stuff like that, but I'd hope that they drop the price to $360.

294
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:55,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of feedback in chatroom on this.

295
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross Steel UT says, Price drop after less than a year, that's a problem.

296
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:03,058
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, They can drop the price as much as they want, but people will still bitch.

297
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: People bitched when the Wii was $50 more.

298
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ross Steel UT responds to that, True, if people had their way, they'd be free.

299
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:17,000
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sephiroth 1215 agrees we paid that $50 on the Wii for the crappy Wii Sports.

300
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:18,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, see...

301
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: As hardcore gamers, we look at Wii Sports and we go, eh, you know, the novelty wears off after a little bit.

302
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:30,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, I know people that are not gamers that still all they talk about Wii Tennis.

303
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was having dinner with some friends the other night who are not like the gamer crowd.

304
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, let's have a Wii party.

305
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get together and play Wii Tennis.

306
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:37,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you have a Wii, don't you?

307
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:38,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all get together and play.

308
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:42,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's still like a lot of fun for a lot of people.

309
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:47,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maybe not the hardcore audience who kind of, you know, got over it after a few months.

310
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,231
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon suggests $499 PlayStation 3 is better competition for the Elite 360

311
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:02,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Jorardimo says if PlayStation 3 dropped the price, I might buy one, even though there are still no games.

312
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold out.

313
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold out is all I can say.

314
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about it.

315
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:12,847
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to sucker you into buying it before the Holly season, and guess what's going to fucking come out later on?

316
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:13,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that!

317
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 6-axis controller with Rumble now!

318
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:18,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're including them with the new systems.

319
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, you already bought one, now you have to buy another controller too.

320
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:23,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking wait.

321
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:28,456
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no games really that are super huge coming out between now and Christmas anyways.

322
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wait until the fall.

323
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:34,401
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wait a few more months and just pick up the good games when they come out then.

324
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:35,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question for you guys.

325
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:42,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I already said I'm not a PlayStation 3 owner at this time, and this doesn't really change my opinion, but my question for you guys is, you guys have bought PlayStation 3s.

326
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you bought the old 499 model, which was the 20 gig.

327
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you guys bought the deluxe one.

328
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys feel shafted by this?

329
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:51,472
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

330
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:59,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't feel like you got ripped off, even though they're dropping the... Because maybe you've had, what, nine months of good gameplay before that, or...

331
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:00,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

332
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:03,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my PlayStation 3 first day, so I don't care.

333
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call it... I got my good out of it.

334
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really even care about it.

335
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I got $100 off of it anyway.

336
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we used our Discover card and got money back.

337
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't call it good gameplay, but no, seriously, that's kind of one of my reasons why I'm telling people that they should hold off.

338
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:21,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have my PlayStation 3.

339
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:24,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I have... I bought maybe like five games for it.

340
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:27,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold back most of those because...

341
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,374
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

342
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:55,851
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com.

343
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,193
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the problem, though.

344
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:25,935
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only like a couple games, whereas the 360, I'm planning on buying a lot more than just a couple games.

345
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:37,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a problem, because even if they do get you to buy the system, you're going to be waiting a while for some good games, especially if you're holding out for your Final Fantasy XIII or Metal Gear Solid 4.

346
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:46,902
[SPEAKER_01]: You plan on waiting about another, I don't know, almost nine months now until those games come out, if not longer.

347
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:54,321
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, with this price cut on the PlayStation 3, I mean, there's a lot of possible factors for why this price cut is happening now.

348
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:57,504
[SPEAKER_02]: But could one of them be the pressure from the third-party companies?

349
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:04,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It also came out this week, just before the news of the price cut, that Sega made an interesting comment about the pricing of the PlayStation 3.

350
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,995
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the executives at Sega, Masano Medea, actually had this quote, quote,

351
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Name, brand, price, and software are what count.

352
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what he told Reuters in an interview.

353
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, since it's getting difficult to make software availability a differentiating factor, superior marketing and pricing strategy will be the key for Sony.

354
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

355
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:47,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see them here because, you know, promises aren't getting us anywhere.

356
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:52,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they promise all this shit, you know, that's supposed to be out at launch, never came out at launch.

357
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:57,867
[SPEAKER_01]: All these delays, all these third-party games getting delayed for the PlayStation 3 or just not coming out at all.

358
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:03,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, at the same time, they need to have a strong Christmas or else they're doomed.

359
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:04,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because...

360
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:09,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, you know, the 360s had, you know, a couple strong Christmases already.

361
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be the third strong one.

362
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:17,136
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a really good lineup, especially with Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, and God knows what other stuff's coming out around that time.

363
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:23,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Wii, obviously, the Wii's going to take off like crazy at Christmas because you still can't find them.

364
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,522
[SPEAKER_01]: They really need to, because they're losing, you know, they're dropping behind a lot now.

365
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:32,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't, you know, pick it up,

366
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:34,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard.

367
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:47,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Matt, though, we are sitting just days away from E3 2007, and Sony pulled a pretty big trump card out of their hand at Game Developers Conference and really changed a lot of people's minds with Home and LittleBigPlanet.

368
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they sitting on something else right now?

369
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:50,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they are.

370
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:54,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do, because I would like to see them be successful.

371
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,217
[SPEAKER_03]: A box of Crayolas.

372
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:57,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

373
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have much faith in Sony.

374
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Crash Bandicoot paint.

375
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:07,932
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that new Spyro game.

376
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching the ads for it.

377
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if all they have to release is Spyro as far as their games go, then...

378
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Macman makes an interesting quote, E3 will change everything.

379
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll suck.

380
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're not there.

381
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:24,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

382
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't all that same pressure still there this year?

383
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anything changed?

384
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still going to be making a lot of judgments based off of the cards that people lay on the table at E3.

385
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they're there or not, we're all on the internet now.

386
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:53,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear what Scott over at All Games is doing?

387
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:59,791
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going in there with a live camera that's going to sit on Scott's head so you can be at E3 with them.

388
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fucking nuts.

389
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they think the pressure is gone from E3 because they locked it down like Fort Knox, you're mistaken.

390
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand why they... Critics are watching you.

391
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:24,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I understand why they did this, but E3 needs to succeed this year because this is kind of a whole new experiment for them to see, kind of changing things up and supposedly they're going to get more business done, but...

392
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:28,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, when you think about it, what kind of business can you get done at E3?

393
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:33,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, other than, you know, a lot of the press stuff where they're covering all these games and everything.

394
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:41,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is there really... I mean, granted us, I mean, we were only like three people at E3, maybe four or five or whatever.

395
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:44,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, obviously we can't see all of E3.

396
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,064
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to cover everything in great detail.

397
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, these larger press outlets and stuff, it's a lot easier for them.

398
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,888
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, do you think there's stuff that they're just...

399
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:54,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Missing from E3?

400
00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:00,534
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them just say what the game companies want them to say because they just copy-paste press releases anyway.

401
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,037
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we going to expect them to do any better work at these places?

402
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:05,417
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

403
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still enough of the independent press getting in.

404
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as much as there should be.

405
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that bitterly, I promise.

406
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:14,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I am.

407
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:20,629
[SPEAKER_02]: There is enough of the independent press getting in that are not going to be corporate whores.

408
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:21,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm extremely bitter.

409
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:25,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out with someone from our works going.

410
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:26,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Bastard.

411
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,247
[SPEAKER_01]: He's feeling it out.

412
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:37,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I had to say this in chat because now everybody's making plays on the E3 will change everything because now they're coming up with their own taglines.

413
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle Snyder says, Dust Cap 2.

414
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,531
[SPEAKER_02]: This time it's not Dust Cap 1.

415
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:45,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Long running Orange Lingerie joke there.

416
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,913
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon says, Emodium AD will change everything.

417
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean, so forget it.

418
00:25:52,546 --> 00:25:53,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just excited.

419
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see the press releases and all that stuff.

420
00:25:56,868 --> 00:26:00,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And also watching the conferences.

421
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:13,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, another rumor that's supposedly coming out of the Sony press conference or speculation at least is that the 6-axis controller is getting rumble as well as touch sensitivity.

422
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see if they do that.

423
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:21,381
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be doing, but apparently that through...

424
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:32,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess different sections of the controller you'll be able to have touch sensitivity very similar to I guess like the DS touchscreen.

425
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:46,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Rumble as well, there's been even some confirmation on that coming because apparently in a developer's behind the scenes video for Haze, they were showing...

426
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:50,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, Sony's got more cards they're going to show at E3.

427
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:51,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Eye of Judgment.

428
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:52,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the Eye of Judgment.

429
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:55,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, PlayStation Eye, just a fucking eye toy again.

430
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be suckered into it.

431
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not suckered into it.

432
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:35,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're all going to end up being suckers if we've got a PlayStation 3 down the line because it looks like Sony is going to be working with the Nielsen research folks to see what we're playing, to see what they can advertise in.

433
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that special?

434
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:40,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're going to get more ads in our games thanks to this crap.

435
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray, and we're still going to pay $60 for them.

436
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:46,006
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bullshit.

437
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Big stinking piles of horse hockey.

438
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when they have tons of ads in games like Transformers.

439
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on!

440
00:27:55,054 --> 00:27:58,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean... The whole movie was an Xbox ad, at least at the end.

441
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, you know, on TV, where the Neil's Rays are, if I want a show to get cancelled, I don't watch it.

442
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do I get a game to get cancelled?

443
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:07,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not buy it?

444
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't play it.

445
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:08,486
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they rate it?

446
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:12,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... I think it's to see who's playing what the most.

447
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,611
[SPEAKER_03]: so that they know what type of games to advertise in.

448
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

449
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, doesn't Microsoft kind of already do that?

450
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:22,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if Sony does this.

451
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:26,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft kind of knows what you're playing all the time because you hit that little button to see your friends list.

452
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what they're all playing.

453
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:31,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And Major Nelson posts every week, hey, these are the top ten games on live.

454
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:33,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of know what people are playing.

455
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess only out of those boxes that are connected to live, but that's still a pretty good representation.

456
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:40,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

457
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

458
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:49,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, one other thing that you could be playing on the PlayStation 3, and who knows how many ads are going to be in this game, Gran Turismo 5.

459
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo 5 will probably not see release until late 2008.

460
00:28:56,123 --> 00:29:01,445
[SPEAKER_02]: This was something that director Kaonori Yamauchi said to Car and Driver magazine.

461
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:05,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Because spring of 2008 is the earliest possible release window for the game.

462
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:08,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is trying to get them to push the date further.

463
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But they want the game to be absolutely perfect.

464
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,893
[SPEAKER_02]: He did say, though, that there would be no crash damage physics.

465
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:22,721
[SPEAKER_02]: The perfect damage system will actually be changing the physics of the game and modeling of each panel of each car separately.

466
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:27,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no idea, but they're taking out crash damage physics.

467
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:29,267
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did it in Forza.

468
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:32,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they do it in Gran Turismo 5?

469
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,510
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea.

470
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:32,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

471
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:36,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a weird, weird thing.

472
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:37,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.

473
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Project Gotham I don't think does damage physics either.

474
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not that I'm aware of.

475
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not every racing game does.

476
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's, I mean, Gran Turismo's not Burnout, so, you know.

477
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:54,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess maybe that's why I kind of get a weird face, because when I think about playing racing games, I like racing games like Burnout, where the point is to crash into shit.

478
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go, no crashing physics?

479
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,313
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell kind of racing game is this?

480
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:05,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I go, yeah, that's right, I've never really been a fan of Gran Turismo, because I like my racers fake.

481
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:06,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Not real.

482
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:08,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

483
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:09,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

484
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:19,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, if you're hoping to see some cool shit, especially Final Fantasy XIII at E3, well, you better forget it, because it's not going to be at E3 at all.

485
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So, boo-hoo.

486
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:28,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Not surprising, though, because I know Square Enix this year, they've been doing a lot of Nintendo stuff, like DS and PSP titles.

487
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's actually some Wii titles in there as well.

488
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they decide not to bring Final Fantasy XIII?

489
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not done yet.

490
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

491
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:36,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

492
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, how long did it take?

493
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 to come out?

494
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had a freaking trailer.

495
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does Square do that?

496
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:47,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember my very first E3, they showed Final Fantasy XII, and then it wasn't even there the next year.

497
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:48,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

498
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:56,199
[SPEAKER_01]: They show you a trailer, but then, you know, we'll use Sony, and I think Microsoft used this phrasing, mainly Sony, though.

499
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a target render.

500
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,161
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we hope the game to look like.

501
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, thank you very much for getting my hopes up.

502
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:07,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exactly what the game's going to look like, but it's a target, you know.

503
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:09,355
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one to strive to.

504
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:13,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure the game's still going to look phenomenal and exceed a lot of folks' expectations.

505
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:17,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's face it, Square's always pushed the envelope in that department, you know.

506
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:18,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't get me wrong.

507
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome, but I don't know.

508
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:23,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more excited seeing what was it, Last Remnant.

509
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,220
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks pretty cool.

510
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

511
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:28,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to be there in trailer form.

512
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:55,456
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, take it away.

513
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, in the real world, it doesn't quite work that way, does it?

514
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:23,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So your F.U.

515
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:25,365
[SPEAKER_02]: is to patience, in a way.

516
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:25,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And money.

517
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

518
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:27,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Patience and money.

519
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience and money.

520
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, my F.U.

521
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,893
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to Stella the Kitty because she... Oh, I want to meet your new kitty!

522
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:41,218
[SPEAKER_01]: She's very persistent on chewing the power cord to the fan and the light in our house.

523
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:44,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And she doesn't realize that there's a lot of electricity going through that.

524
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:45,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately, she does...

525
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,026
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

526
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I didn't name the cat.

527
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:26,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the woman that was fostering the cat, I guess Stella's full name, she calls her Stella Dora, so I don't know.

528
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:29,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally going to caturday caption pictures of your cat.

529
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plenty more.

530
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought my camera, too.

531
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: You should tell your wife that there's a video game reference in your cat's name.

532
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,186
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll love that.

533
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to watch her go crazy?

534
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the Jingle Cats video I want to see Stella vs. Shermie

535
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:05,583
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

536
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: No force on earth can move the shirt.

537
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:23,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I do my FUs now?

538
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:24,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

539
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to my new driver's license picture.

540
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:30,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible!

541
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, your face does not look that fat.

542
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: My face looks like a Christmas light.

543
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It's red and fat.

544
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:36,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.

545
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to get a new license picture taken.

546
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:40,912
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday just passed and it's that year of my license.

547
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go in and take a new picture.

548
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I look fat and red.

549
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:44,495
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not!

550
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:45,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.

551
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like I have a bowl full of jelly.

552
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:47,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not!

553
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the DMV!

554
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you do this to people?

555
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,821
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we have rampant anorexia and bulimia in our societies, because of the DMV.

556
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:56,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

557
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:56,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

558
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, chatroom, you may not have a scan.

559
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,486
[SPEAKER_02]: That's personal information.

560
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:04,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not scanning my driver's license and putting it on the internet.

561
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:06,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the dumbest things you could do.

562
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get back into the gaming news before I get more frustrated, because then I'm going to take out my wallet and look at my picture again.

563
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get more angrier.

564
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob, I'm sorry I'm about to piss you off again.

565
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, don't we normally love Nintendo?

566
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:24,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Nintendo.

567
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:33,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo, we love you so much, but why do you have to hurt us by not having a playable Smash Bros.

568
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:34,892
[SPEAKER_03]: at E3?

569
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuckers.

570
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:42,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nintendo's not going to be showing Smash Bros.

571
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:43,056
[SPEAKER_02]: at E3?

572
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: What's their excuse?

573
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:51,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it in Kojima's blog that he played an almost complete version?

574
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, in April?

575
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?

576
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:59,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you fucking with us, Nintendo?

577
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a playable Smash Bros.

578
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: or I'll head up to Washington, beat you in the head with an orange bat, fly to Japan, and run over your headquarters with a tank!

579
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:14,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me!

580
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I need my pit, and I need my snake.

581
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:19,718
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

582
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a snake, man.

583
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a snake, man!

584
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:27,284
[SPEAKER_03]: One time I fed my snake some beer.

585
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:27,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

586
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:30,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

587
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:32,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to chat room.

588
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:35,851
[SPEAKER_02]: RawSteelUT says, Like we don't know how Smash Bros.

589
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:36,652
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to play...

590
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:38,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

591
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:39,403
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.

592
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:44,085
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a damn update on the website every day.

593
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:50,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And every blog on the face of the earth covers the damn website.

594
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:54,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go to the website and check it out each day.

595
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:58,073
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to hear or see it updated every day.

596
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:02,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a crap about the final moves and the control scheme and all that shit.

597
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:04,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wait for the game to come out.

598
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:06,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Be surprised.

599
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:07,198
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

600
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:18,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as if I wish I had good news for you, but the journey continues here with Nintendo and what they are and aren't going to be showing at E3.

601
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this has nothing to do with what's at E3.

602
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:22,494
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the way it is.

603
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:37,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Kelba, who is actually the head of Retro Studios, who is designing, of course, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, in an interview recently with GamePro, he has confirmed that there will be no online multiplayer games.

604
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: and Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

605
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:54,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of us that were hoping and thinking and speculating and convinced that Nintendo is finally going to get into online gaming, they're finally going to open up to the world of online gaming and Metroid Prime 3 is going to be the game that will do it.

606
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got fucking shot down this week.

607
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:58,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to brace next gen.

608
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:00,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Or this gen.

609
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Last gen.

610
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

611
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:03,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Online.

612
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:04,987
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.

613
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:05,887
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes me angry.

614
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Why won't you embrace online gaming, Nintendo?

615
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:21,844
[SPEAKER_02]: What, did Phantasy Star Online Episodes 1 and 2 burn you that badly?

616
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:25,247
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your big problem with online gaming?

617
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you have to spray us with these friend codes crap?

618
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Why won't you put your series that we love online?

619
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:37,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you give us something crappy like the new Pokemon game that's your only online game and it's mediocre online stuff anyway?

620
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:43,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Why will you not wake up to the next generation of gaming?

621
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:49,534
[SPEAKER_02]: and I copy everything that Jamie said before about the deck.

622
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, more positive news.

623
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:55,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, hold on.

624
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:55,537
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

625
00:38:55,557 --> 00:38:56,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to chat for a minute.

626
00:38:56,837 --> 00:39:00,539
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun says even fucking Virtua Fighter 5 is going to be online now.

627
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in a shittacious series like Virtua Fighter goes online and Metroid is still single player only.

628
00:39:07,363 --> 00:39:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Something is fucked in this world.

629
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,537
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, no Metroid Prime 3 online?

630
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:15,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Good!

631
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:17,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Online sucks anyway.

632
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:18,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could have been better.

633
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:22,043
[SPEAKER_02]: JVmon says, Pokemon Online is slow as hell.

634
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:23,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS games are fine!

635
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:25,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo can do it!

636
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,708
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not doing it for some reason.

637
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, people who play Nintendo systems don't want online.

638
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:35,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who want to play online have 360.

639
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:37,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg to differ.

640
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,259
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give them online, they will embrace online.

641
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:50,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Moms and grandmas like to play Bejeweled Online and that, like, you know, those fucking pop-it games on Pogo and shit and all those other games, like Poker Online.

642
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll play that.

643
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll play the Wii Online, too.

644
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:56,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give me that just because it's not a hardcore gaming audience or whatever.

645
00:39:56,593 --> 00:40:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: This just makes me angry because I've been waiting so long for Nintendo to go online.

646
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,615
[SPEAKER_01]: What was last year's E3?

647
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,395
[SPEAKER_01]: We're embracing online.

648
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:10,957
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the system is going to be, you know, what was that, Nintendo is going to be providing new content daily.

649
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day you're going to be able to go to your Nintendo Wii system and see new content.

650
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:19,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it be game downloads or all this shit.

651
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:24,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how about... What else were they promising that was going to be really cool?

652
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,436
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii Connect 24.

653
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:29,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Providing updates automatically.

654
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:29,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice!

655
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,950
[SPEAKER_01]: All these promises and nothing following through.

656
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I will let this slide, Nintendo, because you know what?

657
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:39,394
[SPEAKER_02]: In all honesty, Metroid will never be as good 3D as it was in 2D.

658
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You can argue with me all you want on that one, but I just feel very strongly that Super Metroid was the all-time greatest Metroid game.

659
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:48,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And there will never be a Metroid game as good as Super Metroid.

660
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless... What?

661
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,603
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a new one...

662
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:57,661
[SPEAKER_03]: in the vein of Super Metroid on the DS.

663
00:40:58,482 --> 00:40:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, kinda.

664
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:03,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on the Advance, there was Zero Mission or whatever.

665
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:05,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

666
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same on a tiny screen.

667
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:07,269
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

668
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:08,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same on a tiny screen.

669
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: But the DS is... The first time I played Super Metroid and Crayed, you know, multi-story boss on the TV, that was the shit.

670
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brinstar music.

671
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:21,460
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't duplicate that on a DS.

672
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:22,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Rob.

673
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:22,922
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

674
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,202
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

675
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Rubber, rubber, rubber.

676
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing on Thursday?

677
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what.

678
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We are playing Super Metroid.

679
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:34,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You are coming to my house and we are playing Super Metroid on my 50 inch widescreen.

680
00:41:34,232 --> 00:41:36,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to make that happen if we're not house hunting because I am in the middle of that right now.

681
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, what was I ranting about Metroid?

682
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:42,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Nintendo, prove me wrong then about this whole online thing.

683
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that be your cards on the table at E3.

684
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I will let this Metroid Prime 3 corruption thing slide if you tell me that Smash Brothers is going to be online.

685
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I will throw myself in front of Jamie's tank to stop her evil doings and then I will make love to all of you.

686
00:41:58,294 --> 00:41:58,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

687
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:00,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see it actually be online.

688
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:07,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it being promised online, just like they promise new fucking content each day on goddamn, you know, WeConnect24.

689
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:13,438
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the point of having my damn system connected to the internet 24 hours a day if you're not going to do anything with it?

690
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:19,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, I even got to boot up my system before my messages will download onto it.

691
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,320
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this WeConnect24 shit?

692
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:23,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so hold on real quick.

693
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

694
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

695
00:42:24,387 --> 00:42:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick comments from chat.

696
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike W0440 says Metroid Prime was one of the greatest games of all time in some people's opinion.

697
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

698
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:33,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are entitled to be wrong.

699
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

700
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:35,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

701
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:38,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Prime was a great game, but Super Metroid was better, that's all.

702
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:41,757
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 says, Nintendo has labeled a big disappointment.

703
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: If they add something, people want more.

704
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:47,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is placed on a very high pedestal and is judged as such.

705
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:48,139
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's true.

706
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,121
[SPEAKER_02]: As mad as I am, Nintendo has the most to lose going into this E3, right?

707
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:57,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony has the most to gain, Nintendo has the most to lose.

708
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:01,365
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, Nintendo, they mark themselves as being innovative people.

709
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:07,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are in certain aspects, but in other aspects they're making really stupid mistakes.

710
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:09,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of storage on their system.

711
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:13,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Not allowing third party or outside storage.

712
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:23,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, granted they do have the SD memory cards, but other than transferring your game saves off of it and maybe playing some MP3s in Excite Truck, it's not being used.

713
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I don't know, the whole online thing.

714
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:33,250
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these promises, and you get your hopes up, and they don't fucking deliver.

715
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I want delivery, dammit!

716
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:39,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, please read a story that will not make me want to play the FU music again.

717
00:43:39,794 --> 00:43:43,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so, Nintendo in Japan.

718
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:45,557
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, of course, Club Nintendo.

719
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:51,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Including, they have a lot of exclusive games that get released on there, and they get to buy them off.

720
00:43:52,718 --> 00:43:55,599
[SPEAKER_01]: with, I guess, points that you earn from buying different Nintendo games and stuff.

721
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:03,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Such wonderful games include the Game & Watch Collection for the DS, Tingle's Balloon Fight, and now... Rad!

722
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,560
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

723
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, Explanation Warriors.

724
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:12,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bizarre DS game that uses the microphone for gameplay.

725
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:19,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's kind of like, I guess, a Sentai hero type thing, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

726
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:20,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Punch!

727
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:20,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick!

728
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:48,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick!

729
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick, goddammit, I said kick!

730
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:50,742
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

731
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:52,022
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said kick!

732
00:44:53,502 --> 00:44:54,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Brew!

733
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:54,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Brew.

734
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:01,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my voice was already leaving before tonight's show, by the way.

735
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's show is just making it worse.

736
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:05,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of wanted to get that out there because I can feel myself losing my voice.

737
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:07,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already going away last night.

738
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:09,606
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

739
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,987
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is very healthy for me.

740
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just shaved five years off of my life with tonight's bout of anger.

741
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:17,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenga!

742
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:17,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay people.

743
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Step away from the credit card.

744
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:51,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why.

745
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:56,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck would you buy a game that's probably not going to play very well?

746
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, okay, yeah, it's the Wii.

747
00:45:58,022 --> 00:45:59,743
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, use the Wii Remote too.

748
00:46:00,184 --> 00:46:03,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but yeah, honestly, the Wii is not that sensitive.

749
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenga doesn't cost, I would imagine, it's probably less than $10.

750
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:11,014
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to buy a game for at least $20.

751
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:14,801
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the low end.

752
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet this Wii version would not have Truth or Dare Jenga on it.

753
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a Truth or Dare Jenga game available.

754
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of fun.

755
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:25,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So... I don't understand why people do this shit.

756
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:28,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are too lazy to put the block sculpture together.

757
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:29,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is a little bit painstaking.

758
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to put three this way, then three this way, and three... Oh my god, and you can just, like, I don't know, stack it in the plastic thing that comes with it.

759
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so difficult!

760
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So difficult!

761
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,591
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a lot of effort for some people.

762
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:56,118
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you imagine, though, taking it out, you know, with the Wii Remote and stuff like that, and all of a sudden, your IR gets fucked up because something, you know, shiny's in the room, and it knocks the whole thing over, and you're like, fucking A, why the hell did I pay money for this damn game?

763
00:46:56,558 --> 00:46:58,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing it perfect, and it fucked it up.

764
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,279
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

765
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this version of Jenga will actually be online.

766
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:04,402
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play online.

767
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

768
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:05,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

769
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Nintendo.

770
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:07,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

771
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:09,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

772
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:12,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be online, because that's not possible.

773
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:13,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

774
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:15,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea why this game exists.

775
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can talk about some games that will exist pretty soon.

776
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:21,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, are you excited about Jenga?

777
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,452
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want... I miss my actual Jenga.

778
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:30,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We should play Truth or Dare Jenga on OLR one night during a slow news week.

779
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:35,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the little blocks that you pull out have little questions on them that you have to answer, or little dares you have to do.

780
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:36,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dumb stuff.

781
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Mormon Truth or Dare game.

782
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:40,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to do anything that dirty.

783
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:42,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

784
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some upcoming release dates over in Japan and some things you can get your hands on pretty soon.

785
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:53,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the Xbox 360 on July 12th.

786
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:59,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 makes its way to the Japanese audience thanks to Ubisoft.

787
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the Xbox 360.

788
00:48:02,557 --> 00:48:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Going over to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Quest Swords finally shows up on July 12th from Squeenix on the Nintendo Wii.

789
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:12,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Gundam Musou

790
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games are going into the best hits, so they're getting big price reductions over there in Japan.

791
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:39,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Disgaea, Hour of Darkness 2 is also getting a price cut.

792
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:48,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of new games coming out over there in Japan, although if you're a music game fan, you probably already have Poppin' Music 14 Fever pre-ordered.

793
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:49,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' Music 14, of course, the

794
00:48:50,649 --> 00:48:51,750
[SPEAKER_02]: EZUMO ZERO Adventure Game

795
00:49:16,497 --> 00:49:21,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's yet another title that has a very nice looking anime chick on the front.

796
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that's like every other game of that type.

797
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally labeling this based on the box art alone.

798
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,661
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, Death Note.

799
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:34,642
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Death Note game coming out in Konami.

800
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:35,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I need this.

801
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:37,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll like that one.

802
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:40,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And Monster Farm DS also coming out.

803
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite titles, I have no idea what this is supposed to mean, but it's Kirarin Revolution Mezase Idol Queen.

804
00:49:49,394 --> 00:49:55,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strategy game from Konami, but it looks like a pop idol kind of contest.

805
00:49:56,398 --> 00:50:01,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chick's wearing a cowboy hat and winking at you on the box art cover, so I have no idea what the hell that game's supposed to be.

806
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:06,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Over on the PSP, coming out on July 12th over in Japan...

807
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:11,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Tekken Dark Resurrection getting a price cut, and that's it.

808
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:11,978
[SPEAKER_02]: No new games.

809
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

810
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:14,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese releases.

811
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to mention something real quick.

812
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:22,562
[SPEAKER_01]: The DDR Hottest Party page finally made it up on the Japanese site for Konami.

813
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:29,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought there were some interesting... They had quotes from all the music directors and stuff from other Bomani games in Japan.

814
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:34,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have some really interesting quotes like, This game is killing it.

815
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:37,106
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dance Dance Revolution Extreme director...

816
00:50:37,937 --> 00:50:40,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Inubuzu, which I thought was funny.

817
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:46,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when I don't play DDR for like six months and I try to play like a ten foot song on the arcade.

818
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:48,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, this game is killing me.

819
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:51,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.

820
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

821
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:55,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually passed a nine footer the other day.

822
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:56,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, can I shake your hand?

823
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:57,826
[SPEAKER_03]: After a year of not playing.

824
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,728
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's good, but did you want to die afterwards?

825
00:51:01,888 --> 00:51:03,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did, freaking Kakame.

826
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:04,869
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is killing it.

827
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:09,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, more release dates, please, Loki.

828
00:51:09,474 --> 00:51:14,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're looking for console games this week, keep looking.

829
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:18,999
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that you are going to find, though, is Project Silphid for the 360.

830
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:21,560
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be making its way out this week.

831
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't that already come out?

832
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,200
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

833
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It is coming out this week, though.

834
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:57,038
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's about it for console games now for handhelds though we've got a few things Smash Court Tennis 3 is coming out to the PSP as well as Riviera The Promised Land is also making its way out to the PSP see for the DS just Vegas Casino High 5 that's making its way out and then on the PC not a whole lot of good stuff but yet again it doesn't

835
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:04,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Cease to Amaze Me, another tycoon game, Ride Carnival Tycoon, coming out.

836
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:06,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, there's a new one every fucking week.

837
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:11,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I can probably play that piece of shit online, but I still can't take my Wii online.

838
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:18,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, how about some European release dates for the listeners?

839
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have a few interesting things.

840
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:28,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, on the 13th is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Game Boy Advance.

841
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Party 8 for Wii.

842
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:35,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, also on the 13th for PC.

843
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 20th, we have The Darkness and Transformers The Game on DS.

844
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:42,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the DS release.

845
00:52:42,381 --> 00:52:47,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 21st, the one thing everybody's been looking forward to on the PC.

846
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:48,323
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so exciting.

847
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian Lara's International Cricket.

848
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:52,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

849
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:53,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.

850
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody loves cricket.

851
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:00,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

852
00:53:00,716 --> 00:53:03,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that statement, I hear a chorus of crickets in the background.

853
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:07,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, I'm fired.

854
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:10,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that that little doll that you'd put the tape in her back and she'd read you a story?

855
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

856
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Cricket.

857
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:14,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Teddy Ruxpin.

858
00:53:14,749 --> 00:53:16,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been reading Penny Arcade lately?

859
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,510
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

860
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing like... I don't read.

861
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:22,393
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing like hardcore Teddy Ruxpin, the action hero.

862
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:23,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's cool.

863
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:30,618
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be like a fighting game with our childhood favorites, like Teddy Ruxpin versus a Cabbage Patch doll.

864
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:31,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the thing.

865
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:37,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably never played this game, but it's a... I don't know if it's a tabletop RPG, but it is an RPG.

866
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:39,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

867
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,681
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Fuzzy Heroes, and you use stuffed animals.

868
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:49,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, you use stuffed animals as characters in the game.

869
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:54,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on what the stuffed animal has attributes and stuff, you have different attack abilities.

870
00:53:54,284 --> 00:54:01,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tactical, I guess, I don't know what you'd call it, tabletop RPG, but it's basically like a tabletop RPG.

871
00:54:02,227 --> 00:54:05,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And you move them around and stuff, and you attack with different abilities.

872
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:06,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, I had...

873
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:09,184
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:37,465
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting idea.

875
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:39,252
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do that with Lugen.

876
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:40,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

877
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:42,544
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

878
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:44,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, Rob.

879
00:54:44,853 --> 00:54:50,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what Miklatov... Best radio ever.

880
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:57,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I wish this were a TV show, but here is the present that Miklatov, Rice Princess, and Extafural went together and got me.

881
00:54:57,517 --> 00:55:01,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a panda bear wearing stripper boots and a tutu.

882
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:02,139
[SPEAKER_02]: A pink tutu.

883
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:08,861
[SPEAKER_02]: A pink tutu carrying a little wand with a... Jonas just joined us, by the way, and he's making this face like OMG.

884
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:12,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonas, can you please describe this... Her name is Sassy Pants, by the way.

885
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you please describe Sassy Pants to the listeners?

886
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:17,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome to the show.

887
00:55:17,224 --> 00:55:18,544
[SPEAKER_01]: How could I even explain?

888
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:20,185
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this?

889
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:22,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a panda bear wearing a pink tutu and stripper boots.

890
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm curious, how would Sassy Pants fare in Fuzzy Heroes?

891
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:29,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think she would dominate because she can cast magic.

892
00:55:29,669 --> 00:55:29,949
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

893
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:32,370
[SPEAKER_02]: She has stripper boots, so you know she can kick.

894
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to play Fuzzy Heroes with Sassy Pants.

895
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:40,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure because I unfortunately don't have the rulebook in front of me.

896
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:41,628
[SPEAKER_01]: This is someone else's thing.

897
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:43,750
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, it's a game.

898
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:49,195
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to fuzzyheroes.com, I think you can still buy the book.

899
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:54,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, it's created by InnerCity Games Designs.

900
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me see if I can read a brief description of what the game is.

901
00:55:59,049 --> 00:56:05,053
[SPEAKER_01]: InnerCity Games Designs is probably best known for our Fuzzy Heroes line of miniature gaming products.

902
00:56:05,593 --> 00:56:12,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Products that use stuffed toys and action figures as miniature combatants in 3D strategic simulations.

903
00:56:13,017 --> 00:56:18,000
[SPEAKER_01]: These games are designed to be introductory for those who are new to the miniatures hobby, but we both...

904
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:23,479
[SPEAKER_01]: but with both enough depth and humor to engage the veteran miniatures gamer as well.

905
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:31,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We still make Fuzzy Heroes and in fact are gearing up for another set of both games and comics for this.

906
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:33,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they have comics for this too.

907
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:43,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We also make several independent toy related games including Very Large Creature, Stuffed Toys vs. Miniatures, and

908
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:50,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Sports Fuzz, 3D football using toys, beer bottles, and whatever happens to be lying around.

909
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:58,185
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Sassy Pants' tiara fell off, so I found that in the living room, but there's also that, which must add some magical powers to it.

910
00:56:58,766 --> 00:57:06,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I swear you can probably find this in a comic shop, any place that has the miniatures, tabletop strategy games and stuff.

911
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,834
[SPEAKER_01]: We're spending far too much time on this topic.

912
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:09,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

913
00:57:09,935 --> 00:57:10,895
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's funny.

914
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never heard of this.

915
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:14,058
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be fun for, like,

916
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a fun thing to record.

917
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:18,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for YouTube or something.

918
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,441
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR Plays Fuzzy Heroes.

919
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:23,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say, though, about the Harry Potter game that's coming out.

920
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:26,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out here, obviously, already, and I actually got to see it this week.

921
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:27,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to say it during my game week because I didn't play it.

922
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:28,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched somebody else play it.

923
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:30,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked boring.

924
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like all the other Harry Potter games.

925
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:33,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I was really excited.

926
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they're not very great.

927
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:37,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited about getting to cast magic with the Wiimote.

928
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:42,112
[SPEAKER_02]: The funniest thing, though, is when my friend Eddie, who was playing it, picked up the table...

929
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,013
[SPEAKER_02]: and was slamming it into people.

930
00:57:44,053 --> 00:57:45,895
[SPEAKER_02]: They would go, oh, oh, that hurts.

931
00:57:46,235 --> 00:57:46,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that hurts.

932
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:48,256
[SPEAKER_01]: The game's really funny.

933
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:52,340
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you go to Hogwarts and then you run errands for people.

934
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,901
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Hogwarts errand boy.

935
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:57,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is really what... No, it's like Animal Crossing at Hogwarts.

936
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:00,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Except Animal Crossing is more fun.

937
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:00,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

938
00:58:01,346 --> 00:58:04,308
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, instead of shaking trees, you get beaten up by the Whomping Willow.

939
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

940
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:07,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

941
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that real quickly, because I watched the Harry Potter game, and it wasn't all that.

942
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Australia.

943
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:23,046
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked a lot about what's going on in Australia, but if you are a Wii owner in Australia, you have some good news for you this week.

944
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:31,830
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a ton of virtual console games this week, which is very interesting, and that's why we're kind of wanting to report it on the show, is that Nintendo can certainly...

945
00:58:32,631 --> 00:58:35,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Just push out like a shitload of games all at once.

946
00:58:35,152 --> 00:58:35,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to this.

947
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Australians got like all of this in one week here.

948
00:58:38,554 --> 00:58:47,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, Alien Crush, Military Madness, R-Type, Dungeon Explorer, Soldier Blade, Motor Rotor, and Vigilante.

949
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:51,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a TurboGrafx fan in Australia, you had a very good week this week.

950
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob, while we're at it.

951
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:52,861
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

952
00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:57,203
[SPEAKER_03]: There were actually new releases for...

953
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,313
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually now I'm trying to find them again.

954
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:07,297
[SPEAKER_03]: There were new releases for a virtual console in the UK as well and I unfortunately just lost my link to it.

955
00:59:08,017 --> 00:59:08,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Bros.

956
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:09,958
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 in the US.

957
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:10,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and over there?

958
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:12,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that was one of them.

959
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had it and I feel really crappy about it because I just looked all this up last night.

960
00:59:18,023 --> 00:59:20,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Paper Mario is supposed to be coming over here pretty soon too.

961
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:22,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they said what's coming out over here on Monday?

962
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:24,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing yet?

963
00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:27,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Paper Mario 4 I think is one of the other regions.

964
00:59:27,924 --> 00:59:35,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the virtual console for UK, actually, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 just came out.

965
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:40,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Axe 2, Echo Tides of Time, Dragon Spirit.

966
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the games that just came out.

967
00:59:43,192 --> 00:59:45,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got most of those over here already, I think.

968
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:50,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for once, Europe didn't beat us to the punch on virtual console, because they have been lately.

969
00:59:50,535 --> 00:59:52,977
[SPEAKER_03]: They did get some really good games, because I love Echo Tides of Time.

970
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, though, I think this is the Mega Drive version and not the...

971
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega CD one.

972
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:00,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good point.

973
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:04,565
[SPEAKER_02]: James Patrick in chat says, Australia never saw the release of the TurboGrafx at all.

974
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:09,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a TurboGrafx fan living in Australia, you might be the only one.

975
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:10,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a rarity.

976
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or you were a major hardcore importer.

977
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:14,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're a hardcore importer.

978
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:23,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Another game that's coming out here later in the fall, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, is going to be supporting co-op gameplay as well.

979
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what good gun game

980
01:00:25,882 --> 01:00:27,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

981
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:59,642
[SPEAKER_01]: They did an online game, I thought, with Resident Evil where if you got bit, you became a zombie and stuff.

982
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:01,484
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they should do Marvel Zombies the game.

983
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're a superhero zombie.

984
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:06,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a George Romero zombie type game or something.

985
01:01:07,328 --> 01:01:08,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I guess that's what Dead Rising was.

986
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:10,370
[SPEAKER_02]: But like one where you actually get to be the zombie.

987
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of fun, like an online game.

988
01:01:12,612 --> 01:01:15,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess, but that was Resident Evil on PS2, wasn't it?

989
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:16,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Marvel Zombies the game.

990
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:18,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But make it good this time.

991
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:19,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it memorable.

992
01:01:19,698 --> 01:01:21,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I have something that's memorable.

993
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:22,259
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

994
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,141
[SPEAKER_03]: People were crackheads like me back in the day.

995
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:29,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnarok Online is going to be on Japanese DS in 2008.

996
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:40,940
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is also going to be released with Sakana no Aselbo, which is a fishing game.

997
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, there's actually going to be an Ikebana game.

998
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:49,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikebana is flower arranging, by the way.

999
01:01:50,492 --> 01:02:14,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ragnarok Online is going to be in real time using the Nintendo Wi-Fi And it's supposed to be, I guess, tailored to the DS But it's only going to be out in Japan right now Which means I'm going to be importing it and sitting around with my dictionary Either that or I will just probably remember where all the shit is anyway Because I played Ragnarok Online for, what, five, six years?

1000
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:19,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's really only one phrase that you need to know in Japanese, and that's, we ban you.

1001
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:23,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but actually, theRobD makes an interesting point.

1002
01:02:23,555 --> 01:02:25,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they calling it Ragnarok Online when it's not online?

1003
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:27,257
[SPEAKER_03]: It is online.

1004
01:02:27,297 --> 01:02:28,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be on Wi-Fi.

1005
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:32,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1006
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:32,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Touche.

1007
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So much for that.

1008
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:41,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, speaking of quirky games coming over from overseas, Majesco is going to be making a local version of Furufuru Park.

1009
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:44,524
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game that came out in Japan in April, and get this,

1010
01:02:44,946 --> 01:02:45,686
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1011
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:38,153
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the game also has original type of games.

1013
01:03:38,173 --> 01:03:42,054
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a karate game, a safe-cracking game, so it's not just retro classics.

1014
01:03:42,495 --> 01:03:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: But minigame fun, because who doesn't love their minigames on the Wii?

1015
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I live for on the Wii.

1016
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:53,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something very interesting that's going to be coming to arcades pretty soon.

1017
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:59,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom is actually doing an original 2D fighting game.

1018
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:03,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the first one that they've done in three years.

1019
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:04,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's coming soon.

1020
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:08,458
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new teaser page on Capcom Japan's site.

1021
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:21,161
[SPEAKER_01]: No word exactly on what it is, although it looks very promising, seeing as some of the shots we've seen so far of the Street Fighter 2 HD for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and stuff.

1022
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:22,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks awesome.

1023
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:25,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really think they'd put out Street Fighter 4?

1024
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,863
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not for another five years.

1025
01:04:28,587 --> 01:04:30,288
[SPEAKER_03]: If Street Fighter 3 was any indication.

1026
01:04:30,348 --> 01:04:31,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need another Marvel vs. Capcom.

1027
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:32,649
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we need?

1028
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:34,010
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Cyberbot sequel.

1029
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Cyberbot is Capcom's number one fighting game.

1030
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:38,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting choice.

1031
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:39,852
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Puzzle Fighter, anyway.

1032
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, you could have... It's the game that gave us Devilot and Super 8.

1033
01:04:44,254 --> 01:04:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom and SNK vs. Marvel and... I don't know, your mom.

1034
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcades vs. Comics.

1035
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:50,477
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1036
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:54,599
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like... Arcade fighting games vs. comic characters.

1037
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:54,860
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1038
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need a new Cyberbot.

1039
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new Cyberbot.

1040
01:04:58,496 --> 01:05:01,257
[SPEAKER_03]: and another Red Earth.

1041
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:03,417
[SPEAKER_02]: How about another Darkstalkers game?

1042
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:07,038
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

1043
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:07,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1044
01:05:07,378 --> 01:05:09,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about a dude who played with his blood.

1045
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

1046
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:16,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to chatroomchat.orangelandre.com Rob D says, New Capcom 2D fighter?

1047
01:05:17,101 --> 01:05:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.

1048
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:18,481
[SPEAKER_02]: No questions asked.

1049
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:20,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1050
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:25,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Charlie says, But fucking yeah, another Cyberbots.

1051
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah!

1052
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:38,465
[SPEAKER_01]: What they need to do is they need to get, like, you know how they have the Triforce thing for, you know, the F-Zero stuff, whereas Sega and, you know, Namco and Nintendo, they need to do something like that for fighting games.

1053
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:42,106
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get SNK, Capcom, and, I don't know, maybe Sega, I guess.

1054
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:48,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And do, like, some sort of all-encompassing thing that has a lot of characters from all these different games.

1055
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:53,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you think all those brilliant minds put together could, like, I don't know, save arcades?

1056
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,051
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1057
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:55,111
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1058
01:05:57,148 --> 01:05:57,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood Orgy

1059
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:25,242
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1060
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:27,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a new Rival Schools.

1061
01:06:29,025 --> 01:06:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

1062
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:35,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the crap out of the first one, out of the Evolution one.

1063
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:37,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid 90 bucks for the Evolution one.

1064
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:40,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, there was a rumor about the Apollo Justice game or whatever.

1065
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:46,177
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a subtitle and people are thinking it's either a new Phoenix Wright game or a new Rival Schools game, so...

1066
01:06:47,199 --> 01:07:01,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, DJ Dark Knight makes this joke in chat, the super ultimate extreme fighting combat tournament, and that makes me think, oh my god, why doesn't Capcom and Midway just get together, give the fans what they want, Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat, come on, that would be hot.

1067
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:02,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hot!

1068
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't work.

1069
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:07,930
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have to use the really shitball Street Fighter of the game.

1070
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:08,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

1071
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:09,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mortal Kombat.

1072
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:10,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

1073
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:13,213
[SPEAKER_01]: They could take the Mortal Kombat characters and make them all cool.

1074
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,794
[SPEAKER_01]: With the EX.

1075
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:18,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Or with the more recent ones that are all 3D, they could use the Street Fighter EX.

1076
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1077
01:07:44,972 --> 01:07:48,314
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would never do that because it would be awesome and make sense.

1078
01:07:48,474 --> 01:07:51,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross Steel UT says Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat wouldn't work.

1079
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:52,356
[SPEAKER_02]: The games are too different.

1080
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:59,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know though, but they made, I mean, they made Capcom fight comic book characters and that somehow worked.

1081
01:07:59,439 --> 01:08:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... And, you know, Marvel vs. or Capcom vs. SNK, you know, and... It could, I mean, I understand because there's a lot of weaponry that goes into Mortal Kombat and it's a much darker game.

1082
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:14,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a total fanboy thing I'm going off on here with, but come on, in

1083
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:17,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Indulge me for just like five seconds.

1084
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,680
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a fun game.

1085
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:27,322
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind me going to a previous topic, by the way, the Ragnarok Online DS is not actually online.

1086
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have multiplayer elements over Wi-Fi.

1087
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to refrain from making the obvious joke here about Nintendo because I'm irritating some folks in chat, although they can kiss my big fat butt.

1088
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:42,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just do it on Wii.

1089
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,451
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of your little Ragnarok characters, you have your Miis.

1090
01:08:47,371 --> 01:08:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that might be cute.

1091
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:49,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, like, Ragnami.

1092
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:51,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragnami.

1093
01:08:53,932 --> 01:08:54,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You're weird.

1094
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, enough of this whole fighting game talk.

1095
01:08:58,453 --> 01:09:00,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody please bring up another topic.

1096
01:09:01,673 --> 01:09:07,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyone who's a fan of Valkyrie Profile will be happy that Valkyrie Profile 2 has a date.

1097
01:09:08,054 --> 01:09:10,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out on the 7th of September!

1098
01:09:11,655 --> 01:09:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1099
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:20,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the, uh, this one is, uh, you know, got a different story.

1100
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:28,669
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be the youngest of three Valkyrie is, uh, booted out of heaven and has to go do shit.

1101
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That would suck to get booted out of heaven, actually.

1102
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:37,250
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those series I've wanted to play but haven't gotten a chance to check out.

1103
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:40,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, seeing as how if you're Valkyrie, you have to fight all the time and then pick people to die.

1104
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think being booted out of heaven might not be so bad.

1105
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:48,254
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other game with a Valkyrie I can think of is Gauntlet because I always used to play Blue Valkyrie.

1106
01:09:48,754 --> 01:09:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Macross.

1107
01:09:49,855 --> 01:09:50,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Valkyrie.

1108
01:09:50,635 --> 01:09:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's a different kind of Valkyrie.

1109
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:53,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

1110
01:09:53,796 --> 01:09:56,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that Valkyrie a lot better.

1111
01:09:56,477 --> 01:09:59,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I wouldn't mind having the one where you use your brain like in Macross+.

1112
01:10:03,028 --> 01:10:03,489
[SPEAKER_03]: The YF21.

1113
01:10:03,969 --> 01:10:04,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

1114
01:10:05,931 --> 01:10:06,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1115
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:12,158
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of folks in chat, going back to the fighting game topic for a moment, now they're getting all Killer Instinct on it.

1116
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:14,160
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, who owns Killer Instinct now?

1117
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1118
01:10:15,522 --> 01:10:16,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer Instinct sucked.

1119
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have both of them.

1120
01:10:21,893 --> 01:10:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the one on Nintendo 64.

1121
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:25,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot they had it on 64.

1122
01:10:26,314 --> 01:10:28,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did KI2 Gold.

1123
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:28,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1124
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:29,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1125
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, this was before I moved out here, I had Dan play the game over and over and over again just to rip me Orchid's music.

1126
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Rare says they have no intention of doing a new Killer Instinct.

1127
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:43,957
[SPEAKER_03]: DIAF Rare.

1128
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:46,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did play a Rare game at the party.

1129
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:48,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinbot.

1130
01:10:49,639 --> 01:10:51,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Rare published Pinbot for the Nintendo.

1131
01:10:51,762 --> 01:10:57,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank God, though, they're going to be doing that Banjo-Kazooie sequel.

1132
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:57,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

1133
01:10:57,829 --> 01:10:58,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot wait.

1134
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:02,515
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be so awesome and totally won't suck.

1135
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look, let's change the topic completely here.

1136
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: One last topic for this Part A, then we're going to go into a break and come back for Part B. Talking about the Simpsons game, you know, the Simpsons have a game coming out.

1137
01:11:14,384 --> 01:11:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no coincidence there's a movie, and pretty soon there'll be a game.

1138
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:20,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game is like a spoof of every other video game, yes?

1139
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:20,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1140
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:25,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the ultimate spoof waits for you at the very end of the game.

1141
01:11:25,768 --> 01:11:29,290
[SPEAKER_02]: The very last boss, the final boss in the Simpsons game is...

1142
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:33,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, is who you will face at the very end of the game.

1143
01:11:33,652 --> 01:11:34,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, spoiler!

1144
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, OMG spoiler, but, you know, come on.

1145
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't play a Simpsons game for the plot.

1146
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:40,576
[SPEAKER_02]: You play it because it's funny.

1147
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:43,318
[SPEAKER_02]: The game looks sexy, too, by the way.

1148
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like EA's first Simpsons game.

1149
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome.

1150
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:48,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1151
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:49,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, props to EA.

1152
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes we dog on that company a little bit on this show, but props to them if they pull this off.

1153
01:11:53,784 --> 01:11:57,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not anything like Superman Returns, the game.

1154
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:05,320
[SPEAKER_02]: The Simpsons game, by the way, will be out this fall, so it's going to miss the movie, but probably make it in time for the DVD release, yes?

1155
01:12:06,141 --> 01:12:07,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my guess.
