Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, May 20th, 2007, Blizzard officially announces Starcraft 2

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Halo 3 gets an official release date

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Project Gotham 3 is mistaken for a Sony game once again

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't have to go to work tomorrow

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I didn't go Thursday or Friday

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I was supposed to go to a wedding and we decided not to go

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I went and did nerdy stuff yesterday

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And slept a lot

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I had time off set to go on vacation to L.A.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Actually, I think I was supposed to go to Disneyland

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But this was a couple of years ago

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This was before Disneyland was the cool thing to do between us

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And for some reason or other the trip got cancelled

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We didn't end up going

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I just kept the time off of work

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And that was the same week that Final Fantasy XI came out

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh God

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I remember that

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I sat at home and played Final Fantasy XI for like four days straight

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Early days of your addiction

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, it was horrendous

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just looking back on that

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I did that when Final Fantasy VI came out

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, three over here came out

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
When I was in high school

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I stayed home with the flu

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I had a fever

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And it needed more Final Fantasy

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have a fever

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And the only cure is more treasure hunters

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the flu

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I need cure three

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Alright, anyway

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Uh, Loki, Techmaster Loki is here as well

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, I am

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have you ever called in sick or used your vacation to play a video game?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What was that?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't remember

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But you remember taking the time off to play it?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Uh, yes

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Alright

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You don't remember what it was, but you took off

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think I may have done it for San Andreas

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, okay

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Maybe

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Alright, you gonna do it for Grand Theft Auto IV?

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, because we'll be playing it at work

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So it's not a big deal

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know a lot of people were pissed off

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because there were a lot of people that took the day off for the Halo 3 beta

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And we're gonna talk more Halo 3 probably in part B tonight

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But you know the Halo 3 beta came out

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And a lot of people called in sick to work that day

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because they were gonna sit at home and play the Halo 3 beta

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then the damn thing didn't show up for like 13 hours

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And people were pissed

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, because they'd taken the time off work

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But it's hard

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I know it's hard to get upset when it's like, you know, kind of free

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And they never promised it on a certain day to begin with really

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know, it's kind of one of those tricky situations

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I thought that was interesting

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So anyway

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright, so we're gonna get into some gaming news tonight

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But first we're gonna start it off with a little bit of

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How was your gaming week?

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No special guests tonight, but we do have the chat room

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Harvey's here, Rob

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Look at what?

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Harvey

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Who's Harvey?

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Did you see the movie?

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Invisible Rabbit?

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It was a Jimmy Stewart movie

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, what's, no, a little

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Wonder Hamster?

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You need to watch some classic movies every so often, Rob

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Once in a while I do

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Broaden Your Horizons

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I do, I've seen like Casablanca

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies ever

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going to find the DVD of Harvey and buy it for you

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And you're gonna watch it

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And Hitchcock, I love old Hitchcock movies like Psycho

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Casablanca is so like, you know, the simple life

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just like

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh my god, there's this war going on

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why is that the inconvenience me?

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wow, my headache just came back

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Good job

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Alright

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I just swallowed like five Excedrin

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm looking at our chat room right now to see what's going on

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Of course we do tape live on Sunday nights

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then release this to our audio RSS feed is the technical name for it

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But most people just call it a podcast or a blog cast or whatever

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's see, anyway, look in the chat room, what's going on

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Gaming week

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Huh?

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Gaming week

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, we'll get to that

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can't we say hello to the chatters real quick?

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Alright, well

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ActDeaf says I hope OLR cheers me up

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, not with Jamie's current attitude

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hi

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She won't be

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She happy, dammit

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She won't be cheering anybody up there

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Be of good cheer or I'll kick your ass

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's see, PK, I'm sorry, I always say his name wrong

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Peaker Uno, I think is how I'm supposed to say it

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Says we need to have an OLR me we suck at Halo game

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, we do

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
GS68 said Rob floods go faster at night

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I guess in response to chat going Rob, Rob, Rob

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know Sauce was at Disneyland Friday

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Lucky

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, and she said they closed down Pirates for the premiere and then they opened it back

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
up

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, the Pirates premiere was going on, that's cool, fun

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Alright, we're not a Disneyland podcast, so tell us about your gaming week

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I played something like seven hours of, no not seven, because I took a break

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance because I had to start over because there

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
were fingerprints on the rental

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We get free rentals from Hollywood Video, so I just played a whole bunch

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I was very pissed off because I played Iron Man on the Mandarin stage

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Only I used the Ultimate Armor because it looks a lot better than his dorky, you know, asshole armor

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry, I've been reading, I read a lot of comics

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so there wasn't any of the dialogue and I was like, well this is crap

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And so I just went back to playing a whole lot of Deadpool because he's funny

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And god damn stupid computer

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know, I had my computer on Power Saver because I was moving files anyway

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I also went to Pen-a-Go-Go

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Which was this, I want to say it was big, but it really wasn't

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was like in a warehouse in Dixon

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, actually the big, you know, hall at the Dixon Fairgrounds

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
For our international listeners, how can we describe Dixon, California?

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Podunk

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's like going to the country

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's the suburb of a suburb, right?

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have like this old town and then you drive like five minutes and you have farm

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like Davis is a suburb of Sacramento, right?

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where the school is, where the first season of sorority life was, right?

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So most people know UC Davis

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well Dixon is a suburb of Davis, okay?

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So that's, to put it in perspective, like it's not even as populated

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I apologize if we have any listeners in Dixon

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I do love Mary's Pizza Shack, which is in Dixon, but that's about it

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I went to this sweet stuff place, I think it was called

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it was really yummy and I had banana ice cream

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Anyway, sorry, Pen-a-Go-Go, pinball

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, yeah, I'm actually pulling up the list of the games I played at Pen-a-Go-Go

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And this isn't all of them because I did play a bunch of really old, old, old machines

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Like the ones from before

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like, these are so old that they had the flippy numbers, you know?

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Where instead of, you know, you have your LED screen, you had the flippy numbers

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Wow, like the counters

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And there was only one of those that was worth mentioning, which is called Skylab

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And the cool thing about Skylab is that you have this middle section

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's got a line in between them

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And you have five pinballs in there

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And you have to knock five onto one side of it

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then you get like some special thing, only I couldn't do it

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So I played Black Rose, which is a pirate theme with this huge, you know, big old pirate winch on the thing

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And it has cannons in it and you have to like shoot down a pirate ship

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Cool, pirate winches

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And Centaur, which was a cool older table

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It was before they had the big, you know, LED, the big display, digital displays and everything

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And it was just the numbers and all that

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I played the new Pirates of the Caribbean machine, which is actually okay

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But it wasn't quite as awesome as I thought it would be

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I kicked Dan's ass at Theatre of Magic twice

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I love Theatre of Magic, that's a kickass table

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Theatre of Magic is the most sexy pinball table

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was about ready to offer the dude four thousand bucks on

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was like, hello, my retirement money, give me Theatre of Magic

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But no, I had to use it on school

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But he did win, though, on the third game

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But that's okay because I also kicked his ass at Adam's Family

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
God, I wonder where I could find four thousand dollars to buy a Theatre of Magic table

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's so tempting

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Apparently it's one of Dan's buddies that owns the machine

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I played Demolition Man and I thought it would be a great machine because I love ramps

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, suck-tastic

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Much like the movie

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Actually, I like the movie

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Demolition Man is one of my guilty pleasures

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Kind of like Me and Showgirls?

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, yeah, gotcha

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just because I love the whole scene when they're in the car scene to old Oscar Mayer commercials

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You know who really brought down that movie?

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Who?

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sandra Bullock

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It ruins everything

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like poison

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Everything she touches is poison

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The speed was good, the first one

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It had Denis Leary in it, though

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Denis Leary is the reason to watch Demolition Man

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sorry to interrupt your report, but I have to ask Loki, do you have any guilty pleasure movies?

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Guilty pleasure movies?

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I guess Wild Zero, maybe

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Dude, I love that movie, too

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But there's that one

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have a new one, though, possibly

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have to watch it, though

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yo Yo Girl Cop

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, wait, is that the Sukebon Deca?

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No, that was not a cop

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's the one about this Asian chick who fights crime

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She's like a cop by day, crime fighter by night, which is kind of the same thing

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But anyways, she fights crime with this metal yo-yo

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, the yo-yo started off as a weapon

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's amazing

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, it's interesting

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, well, there's more games

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is the worst machine ever

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's like it has action figures all over it

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And the only cool thing about it is this rotating pizza spinner in the middle that will shoot the ball in different directions

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I played Medieval Madness, but the guy who owned it put extra steep ramps in it

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I did break down the castle, that was cool

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Pinbot

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Fucking greatest pinball game of ever

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ever

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But it was dingy

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Actually, you need to come to my house and play Bride of Pinbot

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bride of Pinbot is actually better

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I forgot you have Bride of Pinbot now

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, well, it's not technically ours, it's our friend Will's

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But it lives in my apartment, my garage

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Suddenly we're becoming a pinball podcast, but that's okay

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Pinball is what I played before DDR, which is how I met all you guys

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, this is like going back to our roots

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's a few more worth mentioning

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I played Hyperball

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hyperball is the worst pinball ever

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, not really worst, it's the weirdest

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because you have this big open field and little holes around the perimeter of the thing

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And you have to shoot the balls into the holes and they're like by the alphabet and it's really stupid

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I played High Speed, which is one of the older ones

255
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That was really fun

256
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And Cyclone

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
High Speed was the other NES game that fucking no one played

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They had Pinbot, and then Pinbot was so successful they made High Speed

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But nobody played High Speed

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But High Speed is a fucking awesome table

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It is an awesome, that's why they made it a game

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But Cyclone has, um

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, Cyclone, it was one of the ones I used to play in Mobile at a Godfather's Pizza

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And the marquee of it has a clown on it and this rollercoaster

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And in the first row is Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But on the one in Mobile, someone duct taped over the clown because clowns are scary

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And drew a beard with a big mustache and a cowboy hat on Ronald Reagan

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So, that's always my memory of it

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a cool table, I just hate clowns

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There should be a pinball game where you just hit clowns in the face

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That'd be fun

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The biggest disappointment for me, well there's Fun House

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Fun House is one where you can hit this

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's right!

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I hate Fun House though, we almost bought one and I told Dan no because the freaking head scared the crap out of me

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But the disappointment though is I wanted to see World Cup Soccer and apparently they sold it on Friday and I went on Saturday

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Big Bang Bar, no one had any prototypes there

278
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And Big Bang Bar is like, I've gotten to play a Big Bang Bar

279
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's the one where there's only like 20 of them in existence

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
16

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And when Capcom closed down their pinball division

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
However, the rights to Big Bang Bar have now been made available

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think to Stern I think is going to be released

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't quote me on that yet

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I think Stern's going to be releasing them

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Time Machine is the other one I wanted to see

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Jackbot, Black Knight 2000 and Doctor Who of course were the big ones that I wanted to see

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Other than that, I've been playing stupid Flash games thanks to Loki

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sorry

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's okay, they're kind of addicting

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm going to be doing that all day tomorrow now

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, I was playing Flash games too

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So what were you playing?

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I played, actually, I played Crackdown

295
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
A little bit of co-op Crackdown, that was fun

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I did try the Halo 3 beta once

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was okay

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
To be honest, it's exactly like the last Halo game

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Gameplay-wise, they haven't really changed much

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Which is fine, it was good to begin with

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But I still really suck at Halo

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I had trouble

303
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The only thing I kind of regret is the loading screens

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In some games, they usually show you what the button configuration is

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I went in there and was like, how do I do stuff?

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I had to kind of figure that out

307
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And they still didn't really get the hang of it

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Instead they have the message that says

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Halo 3 Beta, love Bungie

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I thought that was funny

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So that was okay

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I went back to playing Earth Defense Force 2017 again

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I got the fucking super awesome stationary guns

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to be able to blow through Inferno difficulty now

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Like, no problem

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But those are cool

317
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then, what else did I play?

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh yeah, I tried a little bit of that

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What was it, Geasswing or whatever?

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was okay

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Very bland, actually

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The graphics in it were very kind of, ugh

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like I threw this together really quick

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Dude, it was free

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't care, I've seen better shit that's been free, okay?

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Warning Forever, that's free

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that looked a lot better

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And there wasn't even any background on that

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They should, simple, you know

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They should have done all

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Vectors would have been cool

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Anyways

335
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, then beyond that stuff

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I played a little bit of

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Still playing that

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll still be playing that

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Until, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I tried a little bit of Saints Row

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That was fun

343
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
For some reason though, like

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I really, I don't know if anyone has actually tried landing 360 systems

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They are as finicky as shit

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They will not land with each other if like something's different or whatever

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like Saints Row, we were trying to land it

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
One of the systems doesn't have the update for it yet

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The multiplayer update that fixes the lag

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
One system does

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It won't see each other

352
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So that kind of sucked

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Cracked down, we tried landing it again

354
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it won't see each other

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Despite the fact that it's the exact same setup

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it worked the other day

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So I don't know what the fuck's wrong with these things

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But all I know is Microsoft did not make it fucking easy to land this shit

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Fuck them

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's it

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Alright, well, my gaming week

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I also played the Halo 3 beta

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And, you know, it's pretty cool

365
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
To me, my first, my initial impression was like

366
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay, it's like Halo 2

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Is prettier and with, you know, the shield

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And other new X button features, right

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That change up the game a little bit

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But then I'm kind of thinking like

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay, well Halo 2 is a pretty rock solid game

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That people still play online

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Like over and over and over again

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Until their thumbs fall off

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I think, honestly, Halo 3 is going to be pretty cool

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Now there were, like, I found the beta to be a bit confusing at first

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because I was trying to set up a game that would just be my friends and I

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And like I couldn't, like, we could only like

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Get the friends together to join other games

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But I guess you can't really be picky choosy

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because it is a beta

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They're probably trying to stress the stress

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, it's probably what I meant

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I'm not going to complain about that

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was just like

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Aw, darn, I wish I could have done it this way

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I did find that if I don't play ranked mode

389
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If I just stay away from ranked mode

390
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And play, like, the open mode

391
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Generally you get people of a lower skill rank

392
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Which is good, it's better for me to play on

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So I played a couple games and it was a good time

394
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Like the training stuff, or?

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, I played, a random O.L.R. listener came in too

396
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And I'm sorry, dude, I forgot your name

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But somebody that was no O.L.R. listener

398
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Came onto my friends list

399
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We played a Halo 3 match together

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We had a good time

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I actually got more kills than him

402
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So I was all, he's like

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you mean you suck at Halo?

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So I was all excited, but it was just luck

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And sometimes it's just luck

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Especially when nobody knows the maps

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Because they're all new

408
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But I thought it was really pretty

409
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I like that map where you play in the snow

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was kind of neat looking

411
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And the shields look pretty cool

412
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Like, you know, it's kind of cool

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The game's going to sell like crazy

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's going to be Halo 2 all over again

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But just a whole new thing

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's going to be huge

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I mean, I wish I wasn't so ignorant

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When it comes to first person shooters

419
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because a lot of them feel all the same to me

420
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because I don't play a whole lot of them

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like, I've played Quake 3

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And some of the other Quakes

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And, you know, a couple here and there

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But, you know, Halo's just always kind of stood out

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hope it has a great single player, though, too

426
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
For those that don't necessarily like to

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Go online and play random people

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But I can't wait to have the college buddies

429
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I play in the game

430
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's going to be fun

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah

432
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's see, other games I've been playing this week

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I've actually went back to my PlayStation 2

434
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And picked up a game that I played a lot of

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
When it first came out

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But then they just kind of stopped

437
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And neglected it when the Wii came out

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And that would be Final Fantasy XII

439
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And what motivated me to play this game again

440
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Is you might remember last week

441
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I had a bit of an emo week

442
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And Miklotov was here

443
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And he talked about how he bought me the Balthier doll

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who is, like, the reason to play Final Fantasy XII

445
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Because not only is he sexy

446
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But he's just, like, the most interesting character in the game, right?

447
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He's awesome

448
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, yeah, I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XII

449
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because I want to play it through to completion

450
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But I'm kind of one of those people that's like

451
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If I forget what happened in the story

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it's been, like, you know, a good five months

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Since I've touched the game

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I have to go back and start from the beginning

455
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So I started back from the beginning

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But, God, the battle system in that game is great

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I mean, it's like playing an online game

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But not online

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Like, where you get total control over all the other people

460
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's great

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I forgot there's a few other things I did play

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I played Eternal Sonata

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Which they have the demo for

464
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That demo is amazing

465
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I loved it

466
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Did you like it?

467
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's awesome

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh my God

470
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The Xbox 360 needs a game like Eternal Sonata

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So bad

472
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's one of the types of games that Microsoft has been lacking in

473
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ever since, like, Xbox One

474
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And, yes, I know there was, like, Enchanted Arms

475
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But, seriously, this is like a great role-playing game

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It looks to be shaping up to be one

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was so impressed with the demo

478
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
To me, this is how Square Enix should be doing their Final Fantasy games

479
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know how Final Fantasy XIII is going to be

480
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It looks a little weird

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But, you know, this is the way I would see them doing it

482
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Stick to what you know, you know, like Final Fantasy X was okay

483
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And XII was okay

484
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But just, you know, that same type of thing

485
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You don't need to go all full 3D where you can adjust the camera and stuff

486
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, I know

487
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
XII's cool, though

488
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I'm excited to see what they do for XIII

489
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But the battle system in Eternal Sonata is pretty awesome

490
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because it's like, you know, you're on a live playing field

491
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you run around, like, a la Kingdom Hearts

492
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You have, like, five seconds

493
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, but you have five seconds from the second you touch the controller to move

494
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And you make all your moves

495
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And I thought it was just pretty cool

496
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Jamie, you really should check this game out, Eternal Sonata

497
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You have to have a Japanese account to download the demo

498
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Or you should just come over here and play it or something

499
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's great

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's like a Japanese RPG

501
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay

502
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But on the 360

503
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So it's really nice looking

504
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought the graphics were great, too

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And the weirdest thing about the Japanese demo

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it wasn't the Japanese demo

507
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It was the US demo

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because it's Eternal Sonata

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's Trusty Bell over there

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And it's all in English

511
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm not complaining

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So I don't understand why they put it over there

513
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But the other thing I played, of course

514
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I totally hopped on your account and grabbed it

515
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Good, because that's

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, yeah

517
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Love that update, Microsoft

518
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Really blocked those other accounts out there

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, anyways

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But I did get to play some more Super Paper Mario

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm almost finished with it now

522
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But it's fun

523
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Still liking it

524
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I also finally picked up Catan

525
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The Xbox Live Arcade game

526
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Wasn't feeling it

527
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, like, I'm very happy these types of games are coming to Xbox Live Arcade

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But this particular one, I just couldn't get into

529
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They need risks

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, I want something I'm a little more familiar with

531
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Monopoly, Risk, Clue

532
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh my god, Monopoly with pillars

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I understand this game is huge among strategy circles

534
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And I'm probably getting angry emails from some British listeners right now

535
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Where the game is big

536
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But, you know, I just

537
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I wasn't all into, like, the trade, barter, that kind of thing

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Although I guess Monopoly is kind of like that, too

539
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But I don't know, it's different

540
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Trust me

541
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I guess maybe I was just disappointed

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because somebody told me

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, you should play Catan

544
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's like Civilization

545
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's nothing like Civilization

546
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
To be honest, Civilization is incredible

547
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What was I going to say?

548
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Eternal Sonata actually looks better than Blue Dragon

549
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You know, sadly enough

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And then really quickly

551
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Because I know we want to get into some gaming news

552
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I won't take up the whole time here

553
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But I downloaded some retro classics

554
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I downloaded Double Dragon

555
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I downloaded Centipede

556
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I actually paid for them

557
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know why I keep dumping all this money into them

558
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean, the remakes aren't bad

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But it's just, you know, I play them once

560
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I hardly ever play them again

561
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I really need to just play the demo and be happy with that

562
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But I do like the high def graphics on Double Dragon

563
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And it was somebody other than Digital Eclipse porting it

564
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I was excited

565
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I laughed at that

566
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You didn't like it?

567
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It just didn't seem...

568
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I mean, it was okay

569
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It was kind of cool

570
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It just didn't quite seem right

571
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, it is a little weird at first

572
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like, I don't know if you played the Centipede one

573
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But they really changed that one

574
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They totally made that, like, HD

575
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They didn't just, like, I don't know

576
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Put the old school graphics in 720p

577
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They kind of redid the graphics there

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's kind of interesting

579
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But I don't know

580
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm a sucker for classics and all the retro stuff

581
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So what can I say

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And that's why I actually kind of enjoyed Aegiswing

583
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I guess, I don't know how to pronounce it

584
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Aegiswing I think is what it is

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Aegis, yeah

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Aegis

587
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's free

588
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The multiplayer stuff is cool

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a good old

590
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's just like a Gradius type shooter

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's like a throwback to 8-bit shooters

592
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I thought it was gonna be more frantic though

593
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Like, more, you know, crazy Japanese shooter

594
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like Ikaruga or something

595
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But that's okay

596
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I mean, I like, you know, I can't complain

597
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's free

598
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I would put it on par with Heavy Weapon, honestly

599
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And I paid 10 bucks for that one

600
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah

601
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I thought Aegiswing was pretty fun

602
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Stupid Heavy Weapon

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I liked Heavy Weapon

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It wasn't bad

605
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It was certainly one of the better

606
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Probably the best PopCap game on Xbox right now

607
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Is Heavy Weapon

608
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Anyway

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So that's it

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll shut up about my gaming week now

611
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's talk about some housekeeping

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No live show next Sunday

613
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is important

614
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Sorry live listeners

615
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We love you guys

616
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But there will be no live show Memorial Day weekend

617
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's Sunday, May 27th

618
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Because we will be taping that week's show

619
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Live at FanaMe

620
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We're gonna be at FanaMe

621
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And we'll be there taping our show live

622
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
On Saturday, the 26th

623
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's May 26th

624
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We'll be there

625
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know what panel room it is yet though

626
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I missed that little detail

627
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Zero

628
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or whatever

629
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Not on stage zero

630
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Not on stage zero

631
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We report to stage zero

632
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
To find out where we're gonna be

633
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah

634
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So we're gonna be somewhere

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Look in your programs

636
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We're gonna be there two o'clock

637
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Probably

638
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I wouldn't see why they wouldn't

639
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Last year there was like a big room and two small rooms

640
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And we were in the big room

641
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So I don't know why we wouldn't be in the big room again

642
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I hope

643
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We'll see

644
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If not we'll just have to fill all the butts in the seats in the little room

645
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It'll be fun

646
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So it'll be 2 p.m. on Saturday at FanaMe in San Jose

647
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hopefully we'll be at the same time as the Masquerade

648
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No

649
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We got a better time this year I think

650
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because last year we were like the same time as the Masquerade

651
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And that really screwed our attendance numbers

652
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We had only a handful of people

653
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We love those of you that came and showed up anyway

654
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Even though we were at the same time as that

655
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But this year we're like at two o'clock

656
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I don't think there's a whole lot going on then

657
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's like right during the high traffic point of the day

658
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I'm really excited

659
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I think we got a good time

660
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm excited to talk video games

661
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge live

662
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We have a lot to cram in an hour

663
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So we're gonna do that 2 p.m. on Saturday

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
F-A-N-I-M-E dot com

665
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If you want more information if you'll be in the San Jose area

666
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So again that means no live show Sunday

667
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
If you do happen to be here Sunday night

668
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You will hear the premiere of that episode

669
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We will have that edited and ready to play

670
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
At our usual 6 p.m. time on Sunday

671
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So that'll be your first chance to hear it

672
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Just won't have that live interaction element with the chat room

673
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Instead it's live in person

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So that was fun last year

675
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm looking forward to that this year

676
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It'll be amazing

677
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Are you cosplaying this year, yes?

678
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I can get my costume sewn this week

679
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I wanted to do Balthier so bad

680
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But it's just too complicated a costume

681
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I can't do it in time

682
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Don't buy any sort of 3D

683
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, so

684
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't know

685
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Maybe I'll

686
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think maybe I'll just wear a shirt

687
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That says this is my cosplay or something

688
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Does that sound like a good idea?

689
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You're not going to cosplay either, right?

690
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
No, I am not cosplaying

691
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright, so yeah, no show Sunday

692
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So we'll be back here live

693
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Though I believe the date is June 3rd

694
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We'll be here live

695
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And that's that

696
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So let's go into some gaming news

697
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Roll that beautiful bean footage

698
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Of course the big, big, big, big, big, big news this weekend

699
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Is that Starcraft 2 was officially announced

700
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Blizzard officially rolled out the teaser trailer

701
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
For Starcraft 2 in Seoul, South Korea

702
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And of course Korea is a huge

703
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I mean just a huge place where

704
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Starcraft is still popular

705
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's been 10 years since the original game if you can believe it

706
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And of course there was much speculation leading up to this

707
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And Starcraft 2 was one of the things people speculated they would announce

708
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
People thought it was going to be World of Starcraft

709
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Diablo 3, a new IP, or this

710
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So you know

711
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It was never going to be World of Starcraft

712
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, why is that?

713
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
They're not going to compete with themselves

714
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Not going to compete with themselves

715
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But then again, Starcraft 2 is going to be online

716
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We know this, right?

717
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Both, so

718
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Comprehensive website set up at starcraft2.com

719
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You can look at some of the clip art from the game

720
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And some of the stages in action

721
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You can look at the teaser trailer

722
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Which you know, doesn't really show a lot of the game in action

723
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But they do have on the site, they have another trailer that you can look at

724
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Which does have some of the in-game footage

725
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No word yet when the game will be released

726
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It is going to be a PC release

727
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They are not touching the console releases

728
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Their FAQs kind of made it very vague if they would ever go to consoles

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But just kind of knowing Blizzard's history

730
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They probably won't, at least for a long time

731
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So Starcraft 2 coming to PC soon-ish

732
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because they haven't said when

733
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It could be Christmas, it could be next year

734
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Soon is the ultimate answer

735
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I would say next summer would be my bet

736
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I would say like next April

737
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The game looks very complete-ish though

738
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And they had demos and stuff going

739
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Christmas seems a little soon though

740
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Especially when you consider all these games have been getting delayed lately

741
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like Spore and stuff

742
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't know

743
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well Spore is pretty massive as far as what's involved with that

744
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
True

745
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know

746
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Sooner or better

747
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Let's see, Nm64 in our chat room says

748
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Starcraft 2 will come out when it's done

749
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
GS68 follows up with Starcraft forever

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Jvmon says

751
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Starcraft 2 gets released

752
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thousands of babies die inside hot cars in South Korea

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That's sad

754
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Chainsaw Juggling says

755
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think Starcraft 2 is being funded by North Korea

756
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So they can invade South Korea because everyone will be playing the game

757
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'd like to know what our Korean listeners think about that comment

758
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You can address those cards and letters to Chainsaw Juggling

759
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
On behalf of Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Starcraft 2, you guys excited? I don't know if you guys play these types of games

761
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No, absolutely not because I really don't care

762
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You don't play RTSs at all?

763
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't play Starcraft

764
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You know what's weird?

765
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Starcraft is the one Blizzard game I've never played

766
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I played World of Warcraft a lot, but I never

767
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I kind of avoided Starcraft

768
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I know, I lose total gamer cred in saying that, don't I?

769
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But face it, guys, there's only so many hours in the day to play games

770
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But I'll check it out, certainly, for nothing else

771
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And the fact that my current boyfriend's addicted to Starcraft

772
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I'll probably have to play it for his sake

773
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I suppose Dan's probably gonna play it, so

774
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, so we'll probably see it that way

775
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It looks just like Command & Conquer, Tiberium Wars

776
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm like

777
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There's not really much you can do with the RTS

778
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I mean, great, it'll have the Starcraft characters

779
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And races and units and whatnot

780
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah, it is the same three races from the original Starcraft

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Protos, Zerg, and Terrans

782
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So, I mean, it'll be cool

783
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, it's great, it needs an update

784
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's been a while, so

785
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know, really, how much more excited could you have been

786
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
From Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2?

787
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean, it's like, eh, it's new stuff

788
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Who's kind of the same game?

789
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Kind of, yeah, exactly

790
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But Warcraft 2 to Warcraft 3 was a huge change

791
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That was a huge change

792
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't know

793
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Alright, forget it, forget it

794
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Whatever, anyways

795
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Now, coming, GameTap is really becoming

796
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know, the central

797
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
For, like, anything that's

798
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, episodic

799
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Or, you know, a bunch of

800
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They're actually using it now to launch a bunch of new games

801
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Including a new series from American McGee

802
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Which, I don't know if you can be excited about it

803
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He had a hit with, you know, Alice

804
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Had a flop with Bad Day LA

805
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
As sad as I'd like to say that

806
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But he is going to be coming out with a brand new

807
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
24-part episodic series

808
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's going to be Grimm

809
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And it's based off the Grimm fairy tales

810
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That sounds cool

811
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
In fact, they had some little artwork

812
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Showing Pinocchio, so that's kind of neat

813
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Is Hansel and Gretel in it?

814
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Because I still want to push the witch in the oven

815
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sure it will be, but they didn't really specify

816
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What series, you know, what stories are going to be in there

817
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But, of course, they're all going to be kind of dark

818
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And, you know, very Alice-like

819
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And it says it's supposed to start in 2008

820
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So, that's kind of neat

821
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
GameTap's becoming pretty awesome

822
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean, it's already been, like, a pretty good service

823
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I know, God, you must think I'm on their payroll at this point

824
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But I do think it's a really great deal

825
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
They're a good service

826
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
If something's quality, why not tell everyone, right?

827
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Exactly

828
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This type of stuff's only enhancing it

829
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And I guess people are so resistant

830
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because they feel like they're paying for emulators

831
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But, you know, these guys know what they're doing

832
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
They're really putting their all into it

833
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So, a lot of folks probably would have given up by now

834
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I like them

835
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well

836
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Let's hope the game doesn't suck

837
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, in some news of other things that don't suck

838
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Since we've been on the Blizzard tangent for a little while

839
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
On the patch 2.1.0 for World of Warcraft

840
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We will be getting Black Temple as an instance

841
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
For anyone who doesn't know

842
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It was involved in the Outlands

843
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Which was a zone that was added for Burning Crusade

844
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So, you're gonna have to have, like, a huge ol' massive, you know, raid party

845
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
To be able to do it

846
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But, there you go

847
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There's also tweaking the

848
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Some of the newer stuff in the Burning Crusade expansion

849
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A new PvP arena

850
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And epic flying mounts

851
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The Nether Drake

852
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Will be available with that patch

853
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Except I won't be able to play that because I'm not a high enough level yet

854
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But soon, I'm 51

855
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Jewids are going to have their own epic flight form

856
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes

857
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It will be epic

858
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And it will be like the warlock and paladin mount quests

859
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Alright

860
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So that's pretty cool

861
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
By the way, I forgot to say World of Warcraft during my gaming week

862
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We're on a very aggressive recruiting campaign for our guild

863
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We don't call ourselves OL Army

864
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We have a different name just because we want to kind of blend in

865
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We don't want to be an obvious radio promo

866
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But if you want more information, please go to our forums

867
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If you have, like, a dormant character

868
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You're thinking about transferring

869
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We totally want some non-dickhead people to play with

870
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
If someone would give me Burning Crusade, I'd play

871
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I have not even touched the content for Burning Crusade at level 51

872
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I just want to draw an eye

873
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But that's the wrong side

874
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I want a blood elf too

875
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Maybe if you're nice

876
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Somebody will bring that to you for, I don't know, solstice or something

877
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay

878
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Alright

879
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll buy chocolate

880
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I was going to say, um

881
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I heard that a bunch of people from the old Deathcake guild finally

882
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A bunch of people from the old Final Fantasy XI guild finally made the jump

883
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool

884
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I will never, never jump into that

885
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You need to

886
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's because of the wife

887
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But here's the other thing I want to say

888
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We posted a plug for our guild in the official server forums

889
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And, like, within five minutes

890
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Some twat responded with some negative comment to my post

891
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You know, I'm like

892
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
God, I hate web forums sometimes

893
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I hate twats

894
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I hate the internet

895
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I hate twats

896
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Alright, anyway

897
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Sorry

898
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We can talk about other stuff now

899
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Like this

900
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Hey, before there was the WoW addiction

901
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
There was the music game addiction

902
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Which a lot of us are still addicted to

903
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And one of the granddaddies of the music game genre

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Parappa the Rappa

905
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Created by Masaya Matsura

906
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He has talked about the Playstation 3 sluggish sales in Japan

907
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And he's saying that's because the thing's a monster

908
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's a huge game

909
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Or it's a huge system

910
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
He says, quote

911
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's not the size of the hardware

912
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But of the AC adapter when talking about the Xbox 360

913
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Who fuckin' who?

914
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Isn't that crazy?

915
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Get over it

916
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
My God

917
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The AC adapter's too big

918
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't develop for that system

919
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well, but here's the thing though

920
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
He doesn't talk about the Wii at all

921
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Because he says, quote

922
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The Wii is a, quote

923
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Very good piece of hardware

924
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And noting that the controls are pretty awesome

925
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And he has said that he's going to be developing a game for the system

926
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Quote

927
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Soon

928
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Maybe

929
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
My God

930
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
He jumps on the complete bandwagon

931
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Like a whole fuckin' year and a half late

932
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh, the AC adapter's too big

933
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Get over it

934
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Seriously

935
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
My God

936
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It

937
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So what if the brick is huge?

938
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It does not matter

939
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The Xbox was huge

940
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I mean, come on

941
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
No one complained about that

942
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The fact the size of the controllers originally were like

943
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't know

944
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Their own houses

945
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It is a little weird

946
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That is kind of a weird comment

947
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But whatever

948
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I mean, that's

949
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Anyhow

950
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's how he feels

951
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's how he feels

952
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Bitch and moan, people

953
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But

954
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So

955
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah

956
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Apparently, BMG's got the rights now to distribute economic music online

957
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I know you'll be seeing that popping up in iTunes and Rhapsody

958
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And other online distributors

959
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But of course

960
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You'll be seeing stuff from Castlevania

961
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Maybe some DDR

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Maybe Silent Hill

963
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay

964
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So

965
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I don't really have any specific dates on the releases yet, but

966
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's coming

967
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That's pretty cool

968
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, something that's a bit of a relief for a lot of people is that

969
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
They're saying that Rock Band is going to be affordable

970
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Not the $150 to $200 that people were, you know, thinking that it was going to be

971
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But there hasn't been anything specifically said about pricing

972
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But it was said that they don't see a point in making a game that people are not going to be happy buying

973
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So

974
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hopefully

975
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I don't know what their idea of reasonable is

976
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It'll be expensive

977
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I could swing $100 for a game, but $150 maybe not

978
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, I mean, if it has good peripherals, maybe

979
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Let me put it this way

980
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Okay, it's EA putting it out

981
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
EA has, as far as like, you know, pricing goes

982
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Their games are a little on the high end

983
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Even to retailers

984
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But it's going to be expensive

985
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
They're going to milk any sort of money that they could possibly get out of this

986
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Alright

987
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well, that's of course a game we're looking forward to in the far future

988
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That game's probably, what, a Christmas release looking at?

989
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Probably November-ish?

990
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah, probably November

991
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Alright

992
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay, so we're going to be looking at some media releases we have

993
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We're going to run down some release dates

994
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And we'll start in Japan

995
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Because of course a lot of the games that come out in Japan we end up seeing here

996
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Starting off on the Xbox

997
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Or sometimes it goes the other way around too

998
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It takes a while for the games to get over there

999
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It just depends what system you're talking about

1000
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Starting off on the Xbox 360

1001
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out on the 24th of May

1002
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
As well as NBA Street Home Court

1003
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Those are some popular titles over on this side of the pond as well

1004
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Coming out on the Wii

1005
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
A giant name here

1006
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
One patchy slap pachinko blah blah blah

1007
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Sammy's collection Fist of the North Star Wii

1008
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So I guess it's what?

1009
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Fist of the North Star pachinko games coming out from Sega on the Wii

1010
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You would think that they accidentally ran like two names together

1011
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But no, I'm looking at the box art

1012
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And it really is Fist of the North Star pachinko games on your Wii

1013
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Pretty awesome

1014
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's crazy

1015
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If you like pachinko and you like Fist of the North Star

1016
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Hey, this is the game for you

1017
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Going on to some other systems on the Playstation 3

1018
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You're also getting NBA Street Home Court

1019
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
For those of you that import your games that want NBA Jam for whatever reason

1020
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
NBA Jam, sorry, NBA Home Court

1021
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Big difference there

1022
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Playstation 2, Killer7 coming out on the Playstation 2 by Capcom in Japan

1023
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm surprised it's not out there already

1024
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Medal of Honor, well that's on the Playstation 2, not the GameCube

1025
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Maybe it just took a while

1026
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Medal of Honor Vanguard, Shadow of Rome and State of Emergency Revenge

1027
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All coming out on the Playstation 2

1028
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
As well as the King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2

1029
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But that's just moving into the best collection

1030
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That was already out there in Japan

1031
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
State of Emergency Revenge

1032
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's what it's called

1033
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Coming out on the DS you have a crossword simulator from Hudson coming out on May 24th

1034
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
As well as Hoshigami is coming out on May 24th

1035
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Lots of DS games coming out including an Olympic training game it looks like

1036
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What is this called? Sansu Olympic Inkai-Koan, Tsuji de Kiteru Noriyoku Training

1037
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What is that? It looks like Olympic Training or something

1038
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Or maybe some other type of brain training game

1039
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's definitely what it looks like there

1040
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Brain Olympics Training

1041
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Maybe that's what it is, Brain Olympics or something like that

1042
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So all those games coming out in Japan

1043
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm looking to see if there's anything on the PSP real quick this week

1044
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh yes a new Bleach game, Bleach Heat the Soul 4

1045
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Just what we need, more Bleach

1046
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
More Bleach

1047
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh and my favorite title name of the week is actually coming out on the Sony PSP

1048
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's Juiced Eliminator

1049
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That's great

1050
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's actually a racing game and I think it might be something they have over here

1051
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's already out over here

1052
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, Juiced Eliminator

1053
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I have a t-shirt

1054
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It makes it sound like your PSP will slice and dice

1055
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I still want WTF

1056
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Not Julian, you know, Eliminator

1057
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Anyways, this week the big game coming out of course

1058
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Will be Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End

1059
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Where you get to play as the whole crew

1060
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Including Jack Sparrow, which is not voiced by Jenny Depp unfortunately

1061
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You also get, of course, on 360, WarTech Second Orundo

1062
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's kind of interesting

1063
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's like a shooter game, but it's all boss fights almost

1064
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's just one-on-one fights

1065
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Halo 2 for Vista, so that's kind of neat

1066
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Odin Sphere, I know a lot of people were waiting for this one

1067
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That one's finally making its way out here on PlayStation 2

1068
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Dawn of Mana, that's finally coming out as well

1069
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Got delayed a week

1070
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
About time

1071
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Naruto Ninja Council 3, that's going to be coming out on the DS

1072
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Brooktown, hi, senior year

1073
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yay, that's economic game

1074
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Please God, or whatever force is up there in the great beyond

1075
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Listening to our crappy little radio program

1076
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Please, I have one small request for you

1077
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Please, please, please God, who I pray to every night

1078
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Who is so great and holy

1079
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Please do not let Dawn of Mana suck balls like Legend of Mana

1080
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Please, please, please, blessed be thy name, amen

1081
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay, anyways, also coming out this week on the DS

1082
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Death Junior and the Science Fair Doom

1083
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And let's see, Marvel Trading Card Games also coming out on the DS

1084
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And the New York Times Crosswords on the DS

1085
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Hooray

1086
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, we got a bunch of other stuff coming out in the UK

1087
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Odin Sphere comes out on PlayStation 2 the 22nd

1088
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
On the 25th, a whole crap ton of stuff

1089
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
There's Crush for PSP, Custom Robo Arena on DS

1090
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Halo 2 Vista for PC

1091
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Mario Strikers Charged Football

1092
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

1093
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hopefully with the warning intact, the rating

1094
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Monster Madness on PC and Xbox 360

1095
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2

1096
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
SpongeBob and Friends blah blah blah

1097
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Pirates of the Caribbean on multiple systems

1098
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And Valhalla Knights on PSP

1099
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I want to mention something real quick

1100
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I just happened to catch this on Kotaku

1101
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It happened to do with pirates

1102
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But if you happen to be going towards Disneyland anytime soon

1103
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And you have a copy of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End for the DS

1104
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
There are specially marked spots on the rides

1105
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Or near the attractions that if you have your DS copy there

1106
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It will actually download exclusive content for you for the games

1107
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I need to get the game and take it to Disneyland

1108
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's kind of neat

1109
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That's actually a really neat kind of tie-in

1110
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I have to give them props for that

1111
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's a little crazy, but I like that idea

1112
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Too bad it wasn't for a game I would play a lot more

1113
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But that's kind of cool

1114
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Wow, that's kind of smart, I like that

1115
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm looking at Chatroom here

1116
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And somebody was responding to my little prayer there

1117
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Unfortunately they have the generic O.L. Army recruit name

1118
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But O.L. Army recruit number 9148 says

1119
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Donamana does suck

1120
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Uh oh, we're in for trouble there

1121
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What can we do there?

1122
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's see, some of the folks talking about Halo 2

1123
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Let's see, some folks are saying here

1124
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Act Def says Critics on Halo 2 Vista, it stinks

1125
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Rama says the Critics don't know shit

1126
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Mind you these are the same Critics that talked shit about XP when it came out

1127
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So there you have

1128
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Or it could be The Critic because

1129
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The Critic also used to say it stinks

1130
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It stinks

1131
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Alright, there we go

1132
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So anyhow, moving on to other news

1133
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Going to Sony, we're on DS now

1134
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We're going to go over to Sony

1135
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Warhawk, what the hell is going on with Warhawk?

1136
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
At the latest press event apparently

1137
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Warhawk is going to be back on Blu-ray now

1138
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There is going to be a Blu-ray disc version of Warhawk

1139
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
After all, it's going to have extra materials

1140
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Developer interviews, behind the scenes footage

1141
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And a Bluetooth headset

1142
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But the weird thing is, there still is going to be a PlayStation Network version of the game

1143
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes

1144
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So that's kind of funky

1145
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But don't worry though, it's not that

1146
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's only going to be like 40 bucks

1147
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh okay, well that's not so bad then

1148
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah

1149
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Because the online one will probably be 20 or 30 anyway

1150
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Because they can kind of charge that

1151
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah, like 25 bucks or something

1152
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So you get all this extra stuff

1153
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Well that's kind of interesting, that's an interesting way to do it

1154
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There's going to be a public beta of the game starting on May 24th

1155
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And if you want to sign up, you just have to head on over to the official site

1156
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
warhawk.com

1157
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Already signed up, so I haven't been contacted though

1158
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Some good reviews of the game coming out of Sony Gamer's Day though

1159
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So we'll see

1160
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens there

1161
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
PlayStation 3 could use all these types of games

1162
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
They need some good news very badly right now

1163
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And this is good

1164
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Again, I'm not trying to pick on Sony or anything

1165
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm a fan of all three of the gaming companies

1166
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But let's face it, Sony's kind of doing an uphill battle right now

1167
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So this is good, I'm glad

1168
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
They need to kick it up a notch

1169
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Kick it up a notch

1170
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
For their download content

1171
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean seriously, it hasn't really been that much on there

1172
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
RawSteelUT in the chat room is dogging the game

1173
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Warhawk looks like a generic Battlefield clone

1174
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
$40 for a game with no SP mode, fuck that

1175
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
True, I'm not buying it, but you know, it's interesting

1176
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Anyways, if you like Warhawk and those online multiplayer only games

1177
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Guess what? SOCOM Confrontation is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3

1178
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's going to be an online only multiplayer game

1179
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And yeah, it's pretty much more Deathmatch and Captured Flag and all that fun stuff

1180
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But it's SOCOM and it looks pretty so

1181
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
There you go

1182
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It will support I believe up to 32 players online

1183
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And yeah, it's just going to be

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's going to be very interesting

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
However, if you're not really into the multiplayer only SOCOM for PlayStation 3

1186
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
There will be a single player game coming out later on

1187
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That will have online elements as well

1188
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So

1189
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I've never really gotten into this series

1190
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
What is this all about?

1191
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's just, you know, it's kind of like Ghost Recon

1192
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But, you know, sewing his own thing

1193
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's, you know, Navy Seals military type first person shooter game

1194
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Before we get to the next story real quick

1195
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I just kind of want to pose this question

1196
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Because we kind of talked a little bit before

1197
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And I want to open this up to the chat as well

1198
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What kinds of stuff does Sony need right now?

1199
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because we obviously have their Gamers' Day event

1200
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
We have more news coming out of their Gamers' Day event

1201
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
What sorts of announcements does Sony need to be making right now?

1202
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Or are they on the right track?

1203
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
They need more releases

1204
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
More content on their online service

1205
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If they can't do new games

1206
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Put out some demos or something

1207
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Or maybe some more, something that makes it interesting

1208
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Because right now they don't really have anything to download

1209
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's been like one release a month

1210
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And it's been really slow

1211
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
They need some more exclusives for sure

1212
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Because right now they're hurting

1213
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I mean, and I'm talking first party stuff

1214
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Not necessarily third party exclusives

1215
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They need more

1216
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Microsoft's kicking their ass as far as, you know, exclusives go

1217
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They've got at least one new exclusive every month

1218
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You know, one or two

1219
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And it's kind of hurting them

1220
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Because it's like, well, you know

1221
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
There'll be a game that comes out on the 360

1222
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And then later on it'll come out on the Playstation 3

1223
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So you're actually

1224
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's almost like that the Playstation 3 is Europe

1225
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The chat room is lighting up with comments on this one

1226
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Let me get their comments and I'll get to Dark Soccer's reaction if there is any

1227
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Looking at the chat room

1228
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Bandit says simply, a price cut

1229
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
ActDef says more good games

1230
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Let's see

1231
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Jirardomo says hitstun Sony needs a game period

1232
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because I guess hitstun said something about needing more games there

1233
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's see

1234
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Blaze says Sony needs a price cut

1235
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
More download content

1236
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
More big name titles

1237
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And needs to retain exclusives

1238
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Hitstun says actually Sony needs some Neo Geo CD backwards compatibility

1239
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Hell yeah

1240
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Let's see

1241
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Rossi says simply games

1242
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Who said

1243
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Somebody said something about more AAA titles

1244
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
DustCap2 said more AAA titles ASAP

1245
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Kazurai says we're certainly not interested in gimmicks

1246
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think that was GS68 changing their name there

1247
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So there you go

1248
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think they need more triple X titles

1249
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That would work

1250
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They just need intelligence in there

1251
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Price cut seems to be the number one thing we're hearing in the chat room though

1252
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's not likely

1253
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1254
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That's not likely to happen

1255
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It'll probably happen in the fall but it's not

1256
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'd say Christmas

1257
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I think for Christmas to stay competitive I think you'll see it

1258
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I think they need more intelligence in their marketing

1259
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But I think the problem is I think Xbox will counter it with a price cut of their own

1260
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm just worried right now that they're getting hosed as far as exclusives go

1261
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Because it is Sony's fault because Microsoft actually is developing a lot of games in house for themselves

1262
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And they're not relying on third party exclusives

1263
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
They've got their own

1264
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They've got themselves covered each month with a new game coming out from them

1265
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You know and you can't say that about Sony

1266
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I mean that's kind of the problem

1267
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's like well we've got Halo 3

1268
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Well we've got Killzone 2 coming out

1269
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay great

1270
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I mean that's coming out eventually but that's way in the future

1271
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So I don't know

1272
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's just kind of sad

1273
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I mean again you know I'm not trying to beat Sony when they're down or whatever

1274
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And I'm sure we've had enough of this on the program

1275
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Because I love Playstation 2

1276
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Such a great solid console

1277
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm still playing today

1278
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
PS2 is awesome

1279
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You know I've been treating my Playstation 3 like my PSP

1280
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
At one time I had quite a few games for it

1281
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I stopped playing them so I sold them back

1282
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And now I'm only playing like one game on it

1283
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Actually now on the Playstation 3 I'm not playing anything on it

1284
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm playing other systems

1285
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You know Motorstorm I got a little bored with it

1286
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And you know nothing new

1287
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm still playing lots and lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance

1288
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah but you're about ready to throw the six axis out the window right?

1289
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I know I'm ready to explode it into tiny bits

1290
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
When I buy it I'm buying it on Xbox 360

1291
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Wow

1292
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Well you know I believe this week actually

1293
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I've got more controllers

1294
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I was going to say I think it was either this week or last week

1295
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition came out for the 360

1296
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That's the other reasons I don't have to worry about spending the points downloading the characters I won

1297
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Because you know first thing I'm going to do is we can play through every level I can with Hawkeye

1298
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Our Sony fanboys can take comfort in this

1299
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I don't know how you guys feel

1300
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm the only one of the three of us that doesn't own a Playstation 3 yet

1301
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You're not missing it

1302
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I will go out and buy a Playstation 3 if Final Fantasy 13 stays exclusive to Sony

1303
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because I'm that much a whore for the Final Fantasy series I will have to have it

1304
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And you know home looks cool and little big planet

1305
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You know those are all like extra yeas for me

1306
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
With the things they want to do with Final Fantasy 13 I don't think there's processing wise a way it can be done on the other systems

1307
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And have it come out the way they want it to

1308
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So I'll be changing my tune single handedly by that game

1309
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I mean hell Final Fantasy 7 is the reason I bought a Playstation 1

1310
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yep

1311
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So that ended up being an okay buy so hey why not

1312
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I need a new Jet Moto game

1313
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
New Jet Moto

1314
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Less Sony bashing more stories

1315
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Let's throw a little bit of love Sony's way

1316
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Even so I'm not highly excited about this because I played the demo at E3 last year

1317
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
But Heavenly Sword is they're stating that they may have multiplayer as downloadable content

1318
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Which is sort of interesting I guess

1319
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Still I mean they're saying that when they do it they want to make it you know full on multiplayer not just an afterthought

1320
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
There's also rumors of you know a co-op and deathmatch but yeah

1321
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But the game right now though is from what I understand still on schedule for the September release

1322
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It looks awesome

1323
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Okay good good news there that's some very good news Heavenly Sword looks good

1324
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah exactly they need to catch up with that September

1325
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It was like playing the singing level in Kingdom Hearts 2

1326
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Remember that was one small glimpse of the game it was like a year ago a lot could have changed

1327
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I hope I really hope

1328
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You know what's actually kind of exciting and this is kind of funny

1329
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction that game coming out

1330
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's developed by the same people that did Resistance and they're actually using an improved version of the Resistance engine

1331
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It looks awesome so far it's very cinematic in the way that it plays and stuff

1332
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You know and I don't even I'm not really into that kind of you know Ratchet and Clank

1333
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But you know I'm almost kind of thinking to picking it up just because it looks awesome

1334
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Alright well sorry I promise that we wouldn't have much more negative Sony stuff

1335
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But I just can't not talk about this one and this would have to do with a recent PlayStation 3 promotion

1336
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And what happened is that there was an ad for

1337
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Okay basically it's on this Spanish website for Kia

1338
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Okay it was promoting the Kia car and I guess they're doing this promotion right now with the PlayStation

1339
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Because they're running this you know like I don't know maybe you enter to win a PlayStation 3 if you test drive one of their cars

1340
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But here's the thing in the ad they show the PlayStation 3 and then they show a screenshot on the TV

1341
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Of Project Gotham Racing 3 which isn't good because that's a Microsoft game

1342
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And is especially not good because this mistake has happened before on a different website

1343
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So wishful thinking maybe

1344
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Somebody needs to let the marketing department know that Project Gotham is not a PlayStation title

1345
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It gets even worse

1346
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh lord

1347
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Remember there's a Dutch magazine called Media Market that actually did a article on the PlayStation 3

1348
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And there's Project Gotham printed in their magazine

1349
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Damn somebody at Sony marketing needs to get fired right at Sony International Marketing

1350
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Well I think it's a lot of people because it's Kia but somebody I don't know where they're fucking up

1351
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's just a bad mistake to make repeatedly like do it once and it's funny haha people forget

1352
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But do it now three times and people start to go what the hell seriously why can't people understand that Project Gotham is a Microsoft title

1353
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
To be honest I'm going to get some hate mail for this one it's not even my favorite Microsoft racing title by far

1354
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You know there's just different types of titles

1355
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Do You For Speed Carbon was good

1356
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Really?

1357
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah

1358
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I didn't play it very much I like Burnout that's my favorite I think is Burnout

1359
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Because I like to blow things up

1360
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
There's a lot of need for speed

1361
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Burnout Paradise

1362
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh I fucking can't wait for new Burnout yay

1363
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I do like Burnout for exploding

1364
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Exactly Burnout has fire therefore it wins

1365
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I wish I could say the same for Full Auto although it wasn't bad sorry

1366
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So here's something else that's kind of funny a little story

1367
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Apparently there's some guy that uh some gamer that was kind of saying farewell to his Playstation 2

1368
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Because he has a brand new Playstation 3

1369
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I don't know why he decided to do this but he figured the best send off was to piss on it

1370
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And I guess he got drunk and you know pissed on his Playstation 2 and being the dumbass that he is left it plugged in

1371
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And basically knocked himself out after pissing on

1372
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Didn't mommy ever tell you don't piss on the electric fence

1373
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
What was that episode of Beavis and Butthead where they were playing don't piss on the electric fence

1374
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
No it was Ren and Stimpy

1375
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
They were playing don't piss on the electric fence

1376
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah there's a little song that goes with it I know

1377
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I remember the song

1378
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Dark Soccer you've had many consoles come and go throughout your house right?

1379
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Mostly just consoles come

1380
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Have you ever done this send off for a console have you ever you know pulled down your trousers and peed on a console to send it off

1381
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No because I'm not stupid

1382
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Especially if you're in your house why would you piss on it in your own house you stupid moron

1383
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
God I'm gonna piss on it

1384
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You know usually when they break we gut them and try to do something neat with the husks

1385
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Seriously haven't you been paying attention to the internet the thing to do with consoles is to slam them with a sledgehammer

1386
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Put it on YouTube

1387
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And the best way to do that is to play the music from what was that scene in Office Space and recreate it out in the field

1388
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh with the copier yeah that was a good time

1389
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So anyway whenever we hear stories about dumbasses like this one it can make us feel anything else but anger and you know what that means boys and girls

1390
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:27,000
N.M. 64 says Rob Roberts remember it's harder for females not really I mean you know she could take a dookie on it if she wanted to

1391
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Anyway dark soccer your F.U. of the week please

1392
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It goes to you I was going to say F.U. to the Pollen and Dixon for making me all stuffed up and getting all over my car

1393
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
But no F.U. to Rob because you've never had to go out in the wild

1394
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You don't know that I went camping once

1395
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But you've never had well okay you've never been a woman going to the bathroom in the wild

1396
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Just squat behind a tree what's wrong with that

1397
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's a lot it's not as easy as it sounds

1398
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You make it sound like some assembly is required

1399
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That's why I love living in the modern world where we have things called toilets

1400
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And not living in Japan where the public toilets are spot toilets

1401
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Rob you remember though it's not always a good idea to go behind Neil Bush and stuff especially if you're a woman because the drag queen fairy may come and turn you into a man

1402
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And then they'll make a movie out of that that's horrible

1403
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What movie was that again

1404
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I can't remember it was like penis envy that's what it was

1405
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Actually there's another thing it was a movie with Adam Sandler who's coming out

1406
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh is that the gay marriage one

1407
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The trailer already pisses me the hell off so fuck them

1408
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm willing to give the movie a chance to see what the message is in the end but yeah the trailer does make it look like I can't even describe it

1409
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's very trivializing

1410
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah it does

1411
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Draw Them Together did it first

1412
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Draw Them Together did it funny

1413
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'll give the movie a chance but the trailer does not look promising anyway Logie

1414
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Screw all the software makers on the 360 for making it so fucking hard to do a system link game with your goddamn games

1415
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Stop having the patch shit so it's incompatible with unpatched shit

1416
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And then F.U. did my work for not actually having an internet connection in the one room there where we have the game consoles so I can just update them right there

1417
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So I have to take them home

1418
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Okay is it my turn to give an F.U.?

1419
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well my first F.U. is to Draw Them

1420
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't like Draw Them

1421
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Nobody likes Draw Them and Draw Them is no fun

1422
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And then I have a second F.U. and this one's pretty serious so I have to kill the music here for a minute

1423
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I had to give an F.U. to myself because something really bad happened and it's kind of hard for me to admit this openly

1424
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:15,000
But it's just a very difficult thing for me I have to give an F.U. to myself because I kind of like a Fergie song

1425
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I know I failed the internets completely I failed our listeners but I just like this new Fergie song this big girls don't cry

1426
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This is a song that's beautiful

1427
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So I like Fergie and for that I deserve to be mocked and made fun of openly by others and I hate myself

1428
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I'm pointing at you

1429
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Alright that's it more news

1430
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
No I'd say we take an ice cream break

1431
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
An ice cream break no we only have a few more stories six more stories we can do it

1432
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Fine fine fine well speaking of F.Us Sony is committed to the PS3 for ten years and beyond

1433
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Basically the S.C.E.A. president Jack Trenton is quoted saying we didn't get into PS3 for the first six months of 2007

1434
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
We're into this for the next ten years and beyond a million units one way or another at this point isn't going to worry us

1435
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So this is what they're saying well our sales suck but we hope to make it up in ten years

1436
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Good luck

1437
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
We're dedicated to this console to infinity and beyond

1438
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Has any console well I guess you know what it makes sense we kind of look at this and go oh ha ha ha

1439
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,000
You know but come to think of it you know consoles live on even after the next generation I mean technically we are still in the PlayStation 2's life span right

1440
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
They're still putting that crap for it

1441
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Exactly I mean and good crap we had God of War 2 we have this what the role playing game folks looking forward to Final Fantasy 12 is not that old all things considered you know it's console still got a lot of life left in it

1442
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So you know I could see how the console they can say it might be lasting that long before they you know put a bullet in it I don't know

1443
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Anyway sorry I was reading some chat room while Jamie was reading that story there and Mystic Gohan reminded me that big girls don't cry so I need to just suck it up here on the show

1444
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Also big girls and big boys alike love the Chronicles of Riddick or at least you know feel okay about it I don't know sorry bad segue but hey you know what even if you didn't like the movie the game wasn't bad there was a huge game that came out on the Xbox the Chronicles of Riddick game and guess what there is a next gen version coming out

1445
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The UK trade publication MCV has confirmed that Star Breeze is working on a new version of the game for next gen systems the game is called Assault on Dark Athena X and it's going to have a single player mode which is a little bit longer than last time

1446
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:21,000
An all new multiplayer mode and a developers commentary mode so what does that mean you get running commentary while you're playing the game kind of like a DVD track

1447
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And man this part was such a bitch to program I swear code here and code this didn't quite work together so we had to do this to make them work and blah blah blah blah blah and the rest of us are going um yeah I don't speak your language

1448
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's like Final Fantasy 7 and it's like yeah and then the scene where Eris dies oh crap that hasn't happened yet oh shit um forget I said anything about that that oh dammit

1449
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Good job Loki maybe hey maybe in that remake that they keep saying they're gonna do for you know the internet loves to rumor that one for the Playstation 3 maybe it can have developer commentary in it

1450
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And maybe my skin will turn blue

1451
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Maybe it will Jamie maybe it will

1452
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So Sony plans on bringing the pain to the Playstation 3 and actually the Playstation Network it's a game called Pain and it involves you launching a poor hapless victim into stuff

1453
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm gonna buy it

1454
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Wait is this the one where I saw a screenshot where it was just a guy on a like a slingshot and they were gonna fling him into a building or something

1455
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Pretty much and it has monkeys getting injured so injured monkeys people getting hurt sounds like a game I'm gonna buy so yeah that's gonna be coming out later on

1456
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's like jackass but actually funny

1457
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Sort of um yeah I don't know it's just using the physics engine so you just you know launch your character into stuff to get him hurt as badly as possible

1458
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And they have different games like including like a horse mode or spank the monkey and mime toss

1459
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Hey I like that part

1460
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Dr. Burst in chat asks what's with the Sony bashing tonight dude this looks great pain looks great and we said the mystic sword looks cool

1461
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Heavenly sword and rat things

1462
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You're right I'm exposed I hate Sony haha got me

1463
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Well you know though speaking of games that I'm not buying Vivendi is putting time shift on PS3 so it will be up there with the PC and PC 360 I'm sorry Xbox 360 oh my did that slip out

1464
01:03:47,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh I was just gonna say I have a laugh sometimes with like gaming press out there they always make stories for themselves like this whole time shift is coming to PlayStation 3 it's always been scheduled to come out on PlayStation 3

1465
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You know even when when Atari had the rights for it but then it went away for a while

1466
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Thank you for reading the whole rest of the story for me

1467
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh sorry

1468
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You ass

1469
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'm not on top of things

1470
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That's it

1471
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I only read my story

1472
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This is what you're gonna do Jamie you know what story he does next because you can see it so read ahead and when he starts reading it cut him off and finish it okay Jamie

1473
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
You know I'm just gonna leave

1474
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No you're not you get about two minutes to prep because I have a story here first

1475
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
No I don't care

1476
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's about the PlayStation 3

1477
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay I'm gonna sit here and read my comics for the rest of the show

1478
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Alright

1479
01:04:46,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Here we go now this is something the chat room said earlier is that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut and you know gamers have said this and you know you've written the magazines you've read it on your online game blogs and now it's publishers saying that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut

1480
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Specifically Ubisoft and Yves Guillemont who is the president and CEO of Ubisoft has said that Sony will quote for sure have a lower market share than before because of the PlayStation 3's cost

1481
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And he said quote they have to decrease the price quite significantly

1482
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Very interesting

1483
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
However Ubisoft is continuing to support the PlayStation 3 they're bringing an exclusive title to Europe

1484
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Don't know what that means it's an exclusive PlayStation 3 Europe title so those of you guys in Europe that always feel like you're getting pooped on and neglected Ubisoft is hearing your pain and is bringing you something exclusive

1485
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Of course we have absolutely zero idea what that is yet

1486
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Far Cry Cricket

1487
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Who knows Far Cry Cricket

1488
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's Cricket in the Jungle

1489
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
We'll see

1490
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Anyways so Sega is licensing the Unreal 3 engine yes the same engine that's been in practically everything lately but you know hey it's yet another game thoughts are though that it's going to be used in the upcoming I guess they're enhancing or remaking the Alien franchise

1491
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Like Alien Syndrome and that stuff?

1492
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
No like Aliens as in

1493
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Oh the movies oh I didn't know Sega owned the rights to that

1494
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Now you know

1495
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Okay

1496
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Wait no that must be a different thing I'm thinking of

1497
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But they haven't made an Alien movie since the Winona Ryder one which was years ago

1498
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Well they made a crappy Aliens vs Predator movie and then they're making a sequel

1499
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Aliens vs Predator was fun

1500
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
They're making a sequel

1501
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Speaking of guilty pleasure movies there we go

1502
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
When Aliens make out with a black chick yeah

1503
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Or no I'm sorry that was a predator

1504
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I swear to god

1505
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Well at the end of the movie to spoil it for you the predator looks at the one chick and it looks like they're going to make out and then they don't

1506
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Oh so they don't actually kiss

1507
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
They don't actually kiss

1508
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
So you lied to me

1509
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It looks like they are

1510
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Thanks for spoiling the movie OMG spoilers

1511
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It's ridiculous it's a ridiculous movie

1512
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I would have liked to see like maybe Aliens vs Jason or something like that

1513
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Aliens vs Predator was like the big fan thing

1514
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Freddy vs the Predator

1515
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
TigerClawnChat says the best Aliens was the arcade version from Konami

1516
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It was that's what I was thinking of

1517
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But Ross Steel UT says hey Tiger, Aliens vs Predator arcade by Capcom equals sex and act deaf degrees over in Capcom

1518
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
No I was thinking of the Capcom one because it's all about playing through the game with Lynn Karasawa

1519
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
With her freaking sword of death

1520
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Awesome game

1521
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Anything else about the unreal engine?

1522
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Sorry we cut you off but you deserved it

1523
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
No it's going to be probably a first person shooter since people really like to think outside the box

1524
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Sonic 3D again

1525
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Did you happen to catch that video that was like the Sonic concept that they were going to do that was supposed to be based off the cartoon series?

1526
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yes I actually did see that some YouTube-age I don't remember where I saw it posted

1527
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Where like Sonic moved a little more 3D but it was still like a platformer

1528
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That looked so fake to me that looked so incredibly fake

1529
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Because I cannot believe that they would make a game like that where Sonic moved like molasses

1530
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Because if you watch that video it was slow

1531
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I know which system they'd put it out on too, the CDI

1532
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It looked horrible

1533
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't know where did you see that YouTube posted?

1534
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Kotaku

1535
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Was it?

1536
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It looked fake I'm sorry it screamed of fakeness to me like they took some unknown game and sprited Sonic into it

1537
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I don't know I don't want to believe it because it looked horrible

1538
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Maybe that was the beginning of the end of Sega who knows

1539
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Let's see

1540
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm looking at what's in chat going on there

1541
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
ActDeft wants to see a video game, Aliens vs Predator vs Marvel vs Capcom vs SNK

1542
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Well that would be the ultimate wouldn't it?

1543
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Alright and let's see

1544
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
GS68 is kicking Sonic while they're down here

1545
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I tried the Sonic 360 demo and the controls nearly made me have a stroke

1546
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Heart attack, stomach acid overflow, HIV and loose stools all at once

1547
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You know what they need to have now that Sega is doing third party titles now?

1548
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Nintendo vs Sega

1549
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
The fighting game to end all fighting

1550
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Dude Smash Brothers hello Sonic

1551
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
No I'm talking about a bigger roster we're talking like hundreds of characters

1552
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
We never did get the Namco Capcom game out here

1553
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Oh that's true the Namco Cross Capcom or whatever it was?

1554
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It was a big RPG I know someone who has it

1555
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I played the Playstation 2 Japanese one and I'm kind of glad that we didn't because it was kind of lame

1556
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It sounded so cool in theory

1557
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Bandit reminds us they do have Sonic vs Mario in the upcoming Olympics game

1558
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
We talked about it a few shows ago

1559
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You know what I want?

1560
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I want another

1561
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Crap I just lost the game

1562
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I want another Strider

1563
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
What was that ridiculous Sega fighting game that they had where you can actually play as a Daytona car and punch things?

1564
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That was in Fighter's Megamix which I have

1565
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's the kind of ridiculous gameplay I want

1566
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I want you to be able to play as Rob the Robot or as one of the unicycles from Uniracers

1567
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
This is something really ridiculous

1568
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Instead of Captain Falcon I want to play as the car

1569
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Exactly

1570
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'll just turn around and use Nitro Boost

1571
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I want to play as a little spinny fire thing from Dungeons and Super Mario Brothers

1572
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I want to play as a Bob-omb

1573
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Where your final attack is explode

1574
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That's awesome

1575
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I guess it's break time boys and girls

1576
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
We're going to take a quick break here

1577
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in part B

1578
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Lots of news coming up in part B tonight

1579
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
We haven't even touched the Xbox 360 or the Wii

1580
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
This has kind of been the Sony segment

1581
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
We have lots of 360 and Wii news coming up in part B of Orange Lounge Radio

1582
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We'll be back right after this
