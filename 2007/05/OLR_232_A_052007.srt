00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:24,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, May 20th, 2007, Blizzard officially announces StarCraft II, Halo 3 gets an official release date, and Project Gotham 3 is mistaken for a Sony game once again.

2
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:36,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:41,789
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,450
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

6
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,431
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Ms.

7
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Summers?

8
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:50,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Worn out.

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,171
[SPEAKER_01]: All this vacationing is really getting to me.

10
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gee, you poor, poor thing.

11
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

12
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:56,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go to work tomorrow.

13
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:57,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.

14
00:00:58,053 --> 00:00:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: The agony, the agony.

15
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:01,280
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't go Thursday or Friday.

16
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you actually work at all right now?

17
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:11,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to go to a wedding and we decided not to go so I went and did nerdy stuff yesterday and slept a lot.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,354
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just used the time off that you already took off anyway to just say, ah, screw it.

19
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,436
[SPEAKER_01]: To sleep in every morning until noon.

20
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:20,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had something like that happen once is that I had time off

21
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,649
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: and that was the same week that Final Fantasy XI came out.

23
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:37,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.

24
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:39,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.

25
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat at home and played Final Fantasy XI for like four days straight.

26
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The early days of your addiction.

27
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was horrendous.

28
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:46,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Just looking back on that, oh my God.

29
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that when Final Fantasy VI came out.

30
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:49,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Three over here came out.

31
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,999
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in high school and I stayed home with the flu.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a fever and it needed more Final Fantasy.

33
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I may have done it for San Andreas

34
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

35
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:30,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

36
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you gonna do it for Grand Theft Auto 4?

37
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,330
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because we'll be playing it at work, so it's not a big deal.

38
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of people were pissed off because there were a lot of people that took the day off for the Halo 3 beta, and we're gonna talk more Halo 3 probably in Part B tonight, but you know, the Halo 3 beta came out and a lot of people called in sick to work that day because they were gonna sit at home and play the Halo 3 beta, and then the damn thing didn't show up for like 13 hours, and people were pissed, you know, because they'd taken the time off work, but

39
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's hard to get upset when it's like, you know, kind of free and they never promised it on a certain day to begin with, really.

40
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of one of those tricky situations.

41
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I thought that was interesting.

42
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:10,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway.

43
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,790
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're going to get into some gaming news tonight.

44
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we're going to start it off with a little bit of how was your gaming week?

45
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:23,232
[SPEAKER_04]: No special guests tonight, but we do have the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

46
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvey's here, Rob.

47
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at what?

48
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:25,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvey.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's Harvey?

50
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:28,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the movie?

51
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

52
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,207
[SPEAKER_01]: The Invisible Rabbit?

53
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:30,848
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

54
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:31,910
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an Invisible Rabbit?

55
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Jimmy Stewart movie.

56
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:33,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what?

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

58
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:35,095
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wonder Hamster?

59
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:35,876
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

60
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,418
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to watch some classic movies every so often, Ron.

61
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:41,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while, I do.

62
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Broaden your horizons.

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, like, Casablanca and Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies ever.

65
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:50,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find the DVD of Harvey and buy it for you, and you're going to watch it.

66
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:50,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And Hitchcock.

67
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:52,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I love old Hitchcock movies, like Psycho.

68
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:55,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Casablanca is so, like, you know, the simple life.

69
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, oh my god, there's this war going on.

70
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:01,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it the inconvenience me?

71
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:04,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, my headache just came back.

72
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:05,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

73
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:08,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I just swallowed like five Excedrin.

74
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:09,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming week.

75
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:10,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming week.

76
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:10,277
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

77
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, I hope OLR cheers me up.

78
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:34,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not with Jamie's current attitude.

79
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:35,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi!

80
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:36,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Be happy, dammit!

81
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,226
[SPEAKER_04]: She won't be cheering anybody up there.

82
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Be of good cheer or I'll kick your ass.

83
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, PK, I'm sorry, I always say his name wrong.

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Peker Uno, I think is how I'm supposed to say it, says, we need to have an OL Army We Suck It Halo game.

85
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:49,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do.

86
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,937
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 said, Rob floods go faster at night.

87
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:55,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess in response to the chat going, Rob, Rob, Rob.

88
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,160
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Sauce was at Disneyland Friday.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky.

90
00:04:58,821 --> 00:04:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky.

91
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,250
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and she said they closed down Pirates for the premiere, and then they opened it back up.

92
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:05,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Pirates premiere was going on.

93
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:06,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

94
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

95
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not a Disneyland podcast, so tell us about your gaming week.

96
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:16,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I played something like seven hours of... No, not seven, because I took a break.

97
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:22,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance because I had to start over because there were fingerprints on the rental.

98
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,798
[SPEAKER_01]: We get free rentals from Hollywood Video, so I just played a whole bunch.

99
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:26,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,910
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Podunk

102
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like going to the country.

103
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the suburb of a suburb.

104
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:31,852
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this old town, and then you drive five minutes and you have farm.

105
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:36,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Davis is a suburb of Sacramento, where the school is, where the first season of Sorority Life was.

106
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:37,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people know UC Davis.

107
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dixon is a suburb of Davis.

108
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:41,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's...

109
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,262
[SPEAKER_04]: to put it in perspective.

110
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not even as popular as... I apologize if we have any listeners in Dixon.

111
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love Mary's Pizza Shack, which is in Dixon, but that's about it.

112
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:55,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to this sweet stuff place, I think it was called, and it was really yummy, and I had banana ice cream.

113
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:56,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

114
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:56,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinnagogo.

115
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:57,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball.

116
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:58,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah.

117
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually pulling up the list of the games I played at Pinnagogo.

118
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:06,590
[SPEAKER_01]: and this isn't all of them because I did play a bunch of really old, old, old machines.

119
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the ones from before.

120
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:12,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, these are so old that they had the flippy numbers, you know?

121
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:18,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Where instead of, you know, you have your LED screen, you had the flippy numbers.

122
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, like the counters...

123
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,947
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was only one of those that was worth mentioning which is called Skylab.

124
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:36,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing about Skylab is that you have this middle section that's got a line in between them and you have five pinballs in there and you have to knock five onto one side of it and then you get like some special thing only I couldn't do it.

125
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:46,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So I played Black Rose which is a pirate theme with this huge, you know, big old pirate wench on the thing and it has cannons in it and you have to like shoot down a pirate ship.

126
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:47,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, pirate wenches.

127
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And Centaur which was a

128
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,129
[SPEAKER_01]: A cool older table.

129
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before they had the big...

130
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,064
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, LED, the big display, digital displays and everything, and it was just the numbers and all that.

131
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:04,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played the new Pirates of the Caribbean machine, which was actually okay, but it wasn't quite as awesome as I thought it would be.

132
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:07,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kicked Dan's ass at Theater of Magic twice.

133
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Theater of Magic.

134
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,172
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cute guy's table.

135
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Theater of Magic is the most sexy pinball table.

136
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about ready to offer the dude $4,000 on it.

137
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:18,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hello, my retirement money, give me Theater of Magic.

138
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,220
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I had to use it on school.

139
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,416
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did win, though, on the third game.

140
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's okay, because I also kicked his ass at Addams Family.

141
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:31,059
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I wonder where I could find $4,000 to buy a theater or magic table.

142
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:31,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so tempting.

143
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking great game.

144
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently it's one of Dan's buddies that owns the machine.

145
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:41,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Demolition Man, and I thought it would be a great machine because I love ramps.

146
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:42,224
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

147
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:43,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Suck-tastic.

148
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like the movie.

149
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I like the movie.

150
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:51,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Demolition Man is one of my guilty pleasures.

151
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like me in Showgirls?

152
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:53,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

153
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:54,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, gotcha.

154
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:58,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I love the whole scene when they're in the car singing to old Oscar Mayer commercials.

155
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who really brought down that movie?

156
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:00,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?

157
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:01,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandra Bullock.

158
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:01,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

159
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:02,700
[SPEAKER_02]: She ruins everything.

160
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like poison.

161
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything she touches is poison.

162
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But Speed was good, the first one.

163
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,383
[SPEAKER_01]: It had Dennis Leary in it, though.

164
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Leary is the reason to watch Demolition Man.

165
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interrupt your report, but I have to ask Loki, do you have any guilty pleasure movies?

166
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:20,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilty Pleasure Movies, I guess, um, Wild Zero, maybe.

167
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:21,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I love that movie, too.

168
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, there's that one.

169
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:24,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new one, though.

170
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:25,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

171
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:26,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have to watch it, though.

172
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo-Yo Girl Cop.

173
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, is that the Tsukibondeca?

174
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was not a cop.

175
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:40,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one about this Asian chick who fights crime, and she's like a cop by day, crime fighter by night, which is kind of the same thing, but...

176
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, she fights crime with this metal yo-yo.

177
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, the yo-yo started off as a weapon.

178
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:49,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it's interesting.

179
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:50,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, there's more games.

180
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is the worst machine ever.

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:03,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it has action figures all over it, and the only cool thing about it is this rotating pizza spinner in the middle that will, like, shoot the ball in different directions.

182
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:07,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Medieval Madness, but the guy who owned it put extra steep ramps in it.

183
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:09,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did break down the castle.

184
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:10,332
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.

185
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinbot!

186
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:16,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is what I played before DDR, which is how I met all you guys.

187
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like going back to our roots.

188
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:19,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more worth mentioning.

189
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:19,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Hyperball.

190
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Hyperball is the worst pinball ever.

191
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not really worst, it's the weirdest.

192
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have this big open field and little holes around the perimeter of the thing.

193
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:52,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to shoot the balls into the holes and they're like by the alphabet and it's really stupid.

194
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I played High Speed, which is one of the older ones.

195
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,195
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really fun.

196
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:58,397
[SPEAKER_01]: and Cyclone.

197
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:02,338
[SPEAKER_04]: High Speed was the other NES game that fucking no one played.

198
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:06,660
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Pinbot and then Pinbot was so successful they made High Speed but nobody played High Speed.

199
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,960
[SPEAKER_01]: But High Speed's a fucking awesome table.

200
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an awesome, that's why they made it a game.

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:25,785
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cyclone has, um, now, I wanted, Cyclone, it was one of the ones I used to play in Mobile at a Godfather's Pizza and, um, the, the marquee of it has a clown on it and this, um, rollercoaster and then the first row is Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan and,

202
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:30,278
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the one in Mobile, someone duct-taped over the clown because clowns are scary.

203
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:35,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And drew a beard with a big mustache and a cowboy hat on Ronald Reagan.

204
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always my memory of it.

205
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,862
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool table, just I hate clowns.

206
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:44,683
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be a pinball game where you just hit clowns in the face.

207
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fun.

208
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:47,684
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest disappointment for me, well, there's Funhaus.

209
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:49,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Funhaus is one where you can hit... That's right!

210
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Funhaus, though.

211
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:54,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost bought one and I told Dan no because the freaking head scared the crap out of me.

212
00:11:56,073 --> 00:12:01,438
[SPEAKER_01]: But the disappointment, though, is I wanted to see a World Cup soccer and apparently they sold it on Friday and I went on Saturday.

213
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Bang Bar, no one had any prototypes there.

214
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And Big Bang Bar is like, I've gotten to play a Big Bang Bar.

215
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:11,086
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one where there's only like 20 of them in existence, right?

216
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:11,086
16.

217
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:14,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Capcom closed down their pinball division.

218
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:21,474
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the rights to Big Bang Bar have now been made available, I think, to Stern, I think, is going to be released.

219
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:24,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't quote me on that yet, but I think Stern's going to be releasing them.

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Time Machine is the other one I wanted to see, Jackbot, Black Knight 2000, and Doctor Who, of course, were the big ones that I wanted to see.

221
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I've been playing stupid Flash games, thanks to Loki.

222
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

223
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:41,327
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

224
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:42,488
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of addicting.

225
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be doing that all day tomorrow now.

226
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was playing Flash games, too.

227
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were you playing?

228
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I played, actually, I played Crackdown.

229
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:55,579
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of co-op crackdown.

230
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:56,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

231
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I did try the Halo 3 beta once.

232
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

233
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, it's exactly like the last Halo game.

234
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Gameplay-wise, they haven't really changed much, which is fine.

235
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good to begin with.

236
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still really suck at Halo.

237
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I had...

238
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:19,879
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I kind of regret is the loading screens.

239
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,660
[SPEAKER_02]: In some games they usually show you what the button configuration is.

240
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in there and I'm like, how do I do stuff?

241
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:30,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to kind of figure that out and I still didn't really get the hang of it.

242
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:33,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead they have the message that says, Halo 3 Beta, love Bungie.

243
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was funny.

244
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was okay.

245
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to playing Earth Defense Force 2017 again and I got the fucking super awesome stationary guns.

246
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care, I've seen better shit that's been free, okay?

247
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Warning Forever, that's free.

248
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And that looked a lot better.

249
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And there wasn't even any background on that.

250
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:23,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they should, simple, you know, they should have done all vectors would have been cool.

251
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, then beyond that stuff, I played a little bit of, well, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

252
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Still playing that.

253
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:40,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll still be playing that until, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.

254
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried a little bit of Saints Row.

255
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:43,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

256
00:14:43,410 --> 00:15:09,633
[SPEAKER_02]: for some reason though, like, I really, I don't know anyone who's actually tried landing 360 systems, they are as finicky as shit, they will not land with each other if like something's different or whatever, like Saints Row, we were trying to land it, one of the systems doesn't have the update for it yet, the multiplayer update that fixes the lag, one system does, it won't see each other, so that kind of sucked, Cracked Dome, we tried landing it again,

257
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:22,338
[SPEAKER_02]: and it won't see each other despite the fact that it's the exact same setup and it worked the other day so I don't know what the fuck's wrong with these things but all I know is Microsoft did not make it fucking easy to land this shit so fuck them that's it

258
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:28,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 2 is a pretty rock solid game that people still play online over and over and over again until their thumbs fall off.

259
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

260
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:21,367
[SPEAKER_04]: that if I don't play ranked mode, if I just stay away from ranked mode and play like the open mode, generally you get people of a lower skill rank, which is good.

262
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better for me to play on.

263
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played a couple games, and it was a good time.

264
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:26,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the training stuff?

265
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

266
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:33,251
[SPEAKER_04]: A random OLR listener came in, too, and I'm sorry, dude, I forgot your name, but somebody that was an OLR listener came onto my friends list.

267
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We played a Halo 3 match together.

268
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:35,852
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a good time.

269
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:39,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got more kills than him, so I was all, and he's like, what do you mean you suck at Halo?

270
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:41,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was all excited, but it was just luck.

271
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's just luck.

272
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo's just always kind of stood out.

274
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it has a great single player, though, too, for those that don't necessarily like to go online and play random people.

275
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't wait to have the college buddies and I playing the game.

276
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:17,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.

277
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, other games I've been playing this week.

278
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:30,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually went back to my PlayStation 2 and picked up a game that I played a lot of when it first came out, but then I just kind of stopped and neglected it when the Wii came out, and that would be Final Fantasy XII.

279
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:44,886
[SPEAKER_04]: and what motivated me to play this game again is you might remember last week I had a bit of an emo week and Miklatov was here and he talked about how he bought me the Balthier doll who is like the reason to play Final Fantasy XII because not only is he sexy but he's just like the most interesting character in the game, right?

280
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:45,526
[SPEAKER_04]: He's awesome.

281
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:56,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XII because I want to play it through to completion but I'm kind of one of those people that's like if I forget what happened in the story and it's been like a good five months since I've touched the game

282
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back and start from the beginning.

283
00:17:58,524 --> 00:17:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started back from the beginning.

284
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:02,548
[SPEAKER_04]: God, the battle system in that game is great!

285
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like playing an online game, but not online.

286
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, where you get total control over all the other people.

287
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great!

288
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot there's a few other things I did play.

289
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:14,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Eternal Sonata, which they have the demo for.

290
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That demo is amazing!

291
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

292
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you like it?

293
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:19,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

294
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:20,164
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome!

295
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:20,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

296
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:21,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360...

297
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

298
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how Final Fantasy XIII is going to be.

299
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:51,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little weird, but this is the way I would see them doing it.

300
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick to what you know.

301
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy X was okay, and XII was okay, but just that same type of thing.

302
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:03,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to go all full 3D where you can adjust the camera and stuff.

303
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

304
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: XII's cool, though, but I'm excited to see what they do for XIII.

305
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: But the battle system in Eternal Sonata is pretty awesome because...

306
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:15,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, you're on a live playing field and you run around like a la Kingdom Hearts.

307
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like five seconds.

308
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you have five seconds from the second you touch the controller to move to make all your moves.

309
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was just pretty cool.

310
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you really should check this game out, Eternal Sonata.

311
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,268
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have a Japanese account to download the demo or you should just come over here and play it or something.

312
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:28,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

313
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:29,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a...

314
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese RPG, but on the 360.

315
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really nice looking.

316
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the graphics were great, too.

317
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: The weirdest thing about the Japanese demo is it wasn't the Japanese demo, it was the US demo, because it's Eternal Sonata, it's Trusty Bell over there, and it's all in English.

318
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:44,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining.

319
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:50,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't understand why they put it over there, but the other thing I played, of course... I totally hopped on your account and grabbed it.

320
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, because that's...

321
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

322
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that update, Microsoft.

323
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Really blocked those other accounts out there.

324
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:57,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyways.

325
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get to play some more Super Paper Mario.

326
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost finished with it now, but it's fun.

327
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:05,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Still liking it.

328
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I also finally picked up Catan, the Xbox Live Arcade game.

329
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:11,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't feeling it.

330
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:16,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, I'm very happy these types of games are coming to Xbox Live Arcade, but

331
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan, Civilization

332
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing like Civilization.

333
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Civilization is incredible.

334
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:49,814
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I going to say?

335
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:52,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Sonata actually looks better than Blue Dragon.

336
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly enough.

337
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And then really quickly, because I know we want to get into some gaming news.

338
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:00,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to take up the whole time here, but I downloaded some retro classics.

339
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded Double Dragon.

340
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded Centipede.

341
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:03,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually paid for them.

342
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I keep dumping all this money into them.

343
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:09,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the remakes aren't bad, but it's just, you know, I play them once and I hardly ever play them again.

344
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really need to just

345
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Play the demo and be happy with that.

346
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,142
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do like the high def graphics on Double Dragon.

347
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was somebody other than Digital Eclipse porting it.

348
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was excited.

349
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I laughed at that.

350
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:21,528
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't like it?

351
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't seem... I mean, it was okay.

352
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,131
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of cool.

353
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,173
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't quite seem right.

354
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a little weird at first.

355
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:33,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you played the Centipede one, but they really changed that one.

356
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: They totally made that like HD.

357
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't just like...

358
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:43,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, put the old school graphics in 720p they kind of redid the graphics there it's kind of interesting

359
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:44,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

360
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put it on par with Heavy Weapon, honestly, and I paid $10 for that one.

361
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty fun.

362
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid Heavy Weapon.

363
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:19,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Heavy Weapon.

364
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't bad.

365
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:24,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It was certainly one of the better, probably the best PopCap game on Xbox right now is Heavy Weapon.

366
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:26,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so that's it.

367
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll shut up about my gaming week now.

368
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some housekeeping.

369
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: No live show next Sunday.

370
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: This is important.

371
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, live listeners.

372
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:35,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you guys.

373
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But there will be no live show Memorial Day weekend.

374
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Sunday, May 27th.

375
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:40,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.

376
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.

377
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,419
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's stage zero.

378
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We report to stage zero to find out where we're going to be.

379
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we're going to be somewhere.

380
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Look in your programs.

381
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're there at 2 o'clock.

382
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.

383
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:10,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year there was like a big room and two small rooms and we were in the big room.

384
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:11,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know why we wouldn't be in the big room again.

385
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:12,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope.

386
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:13,106
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

387
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,808
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, we'll just have to fill all the butts in the seats in the little room.

388
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

389
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:18,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be 2 p.m.

390
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:21,270
[SPEAKER_04]: on Saturday at Faname in San Jose at the San Jose Convention Center.

391
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it won't be at the same time as the Masquerade.

392
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:30,288
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we got a better time this year, I think, because last year we were like the same time as the Masquerade, and that really screwed our attendance numbers.

393
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:31,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We had only a handful of people.

394
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We love those of you that came and showed up anyway, even though we were at the same time as that.

395
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:38,456
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year we're like at 2 o'clock, and I don't think there's a whole lot going on then.

396
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like right during the high traffic point of the day.

397
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:41,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really excited.

398
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got a good time.

399
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to talk video games.

400
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live.

401
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot to cram in an hour, so we're going to do that.

402
00:23:49,717 --> 00:23:50,378
[SPEAKER_04]: 2pm on Saturday.

403
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:54,780
[SPEAKER_04]: F-A-N-I-M-E dot com if you want more information if you'll be in the San Jose area.

404
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:56,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, that means no live show Sunday.

405
00:23:57,142 --> 00:24:01,785
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do happen to be here Sunday night, you will hear the premiere of that episode.

406
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have that edited and ready to play at our usual 6pm time on Sunday.

407
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:06,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be your first chance to hear it.

408
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Just won't have that live interaction element with the chat room.

409
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, it's live in person.

410
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was fun last year.

411
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:13,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to that this year.

412
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be amazing.

413
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you cosplaying this year, yes?

414
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,936
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get my costume sewn this week.

415
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to do Balthier so bad, but it's just too complicated a costume.

416
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it in time.

417
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It's any sort of 3D.

418
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

419
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:30,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe I'll just wear a shirt that says this is my cosplay or something.

420
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:30,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

421
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:31,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound like a good idea?

422
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:32,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to cosplay either, right?

423
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:34,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am not cosplaying.

424
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:41,221
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so yeah, no show Sunday, so we'll be back here live, though I believe the date is June 3rd.

425
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be here live.

426
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:44,689
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

427
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's go into some gaming news.

428
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll that beautiful bean footage.

429
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the big, big, big, big, big, big news this weekend is that StarCraft II was officially announced.

430
00:24:57,252 --> 00:25:02,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard officially rolled out the teaser trailer for StarCraft II in Seoul, South Korea.

431
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:08,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Korea is a huge place where StarCraft is still popular.

432
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:11,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been 10 years since the original game, if you can believe it.

433
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:12,335
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft II StarCraft II

434
00:25:35,697 --> 00:26:01,513
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehensive website set up at StarCraft2.com you can look at some of the clip art from the game and some of the stages in action you can look at the teaser trailer which you know doesn't really show a lot of the game in action but they do have on the site they have another trailer that you can look at which does have some of the in-game footage no word yet when the game will be released it is going to be a PC release they are not touching the console releases their FAQs kind of

435
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: made it very vague if they would ever go to consoles but just kind of knowing Blizzard's history they probably won't at least for a long time so StarCraft 2 coming to PC soon-ish because they haven't said when it could be Christmas it could be next year soon is the ultimate answer I would say next summer would be my bet I would say like next April the game looks very complete-ish though and they had you know demos and stuff going I don't know Christmas seems a little soon though especially when you consider all these games have been getting delayed lately like Spore and stuff

436
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Spore is pretty massive as far as what's involved with that.

437
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:40,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

438
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:41,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

439
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,712
[SPEAKER_04]: NM64 in our chatroom says StarCraft 2 will come out when it's done.

440
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,494
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 follows up with StarCraft forever.

441
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:50,317
[SPEAKER_04]: JVmon says StarCraft 2 gets released.

442
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands of babies die inside hot cars in South Korea.

443
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:55,682
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sad.

444
00:26:57,105 --> 00:27:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: ChainsawJuggling says, I think StarCraft 2 is being funded by North Korea so they can invade South Korea because everyone will be playing the game.

445
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to know what our Korean listeners think about that comment.

446
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:12,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You can address those cards and letters to ChainsawJuggling on behalf of Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

447
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:13,456
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft 2, you guys excited?

448
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys play these types of games.

449
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:17,639
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely not because I really don't care.

450
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,020
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't play RTSs at all?

451
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play StarCraft.

452
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's weird?

453
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:23,953
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft is the one Blizzard game I've never played.

454
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:27,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I played World of Warcraft a lot, but I kind of avoided StarCraft.

455
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:30,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I lose total gamer cred in saying that, don't I?

456
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But face it, guys, there's only so many hours in the day to play games.

457
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:40,288
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll check it out, certainly, for nothing else than the fact that my current boyfriend's addicted to StarCraft, and I'll probably have to play it for his sake.

458
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:43,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose Dan's probably going to play it, so... Oh, yeah, so we'll probably see it that way.

459
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, eh, it looks just like Command & Conquer Tiberium Wars.

460
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:47,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like,

461
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really much you can do with the RTS, I mean, great, it'll have, you know, the StarCraft characters and, you know, races and, you know, units and whatnot.

462
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:02,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is the same three races from the original StarCraft, Protoss, Zerg, and Terrans.

463
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it'll be cool, I mean, it's great, it needs an update, you know, it's been a while, so, I don't know, I mean, really, I mean, how much more excited could you have been from, you know, Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2, I mean...

464
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, eh, it's new stuff.

465
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:18,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of the same game.

466
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of, yeah, exactly.

467
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:23,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But Warcraft 2 to Warcraft 3 was a huge change.

468
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a huge change.

469
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

470
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:27,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

471
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

472
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:28,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

473
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

474
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:37,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, GameTap is really becoming the center for anything that's...

475
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:48,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, episodic or, you know, a bunch of... They're actually using it now to launch a bunch of new games, including a new series from American McGee, which I don't know if you can be excited about it.

476
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:55,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he had a hit with, you know, Alice, had a flop with Bad Day LA, as sad as I'd like to say that.

477
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:05,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But he is going to be coming out with a brand new 24-part episodic series that's going to be Grimm, and it's based off the Grimm fairy tales.

478
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:06,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds cool.

479
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:07,688
[SPEAKER_02]: GameTap's becoming pretty awesome.

480
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:41,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's already been a pretty good service, and I know, God, you must think I'm on their payroll at this point, but I do think it's a really great deal.

481
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:42,536
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a good service.

482
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:44,636
[SPEAKER_01]: If something's quality, why not tell everyone, right?

483
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

484
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And this type of stuff's only enhancing it.

485
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:53,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess people are so resistant because they feel like they're paying for emulators, but these guys know what they're doing.

486
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,302
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really putting their all into it, so a lot of folks probably would have given up by now.

487
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:58,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.

488
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:00,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope the game doesn't suck.

489
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:15,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in some years of other things that don't suck, since we've been on the Blizzard tangent for a little while, on the patch 2.1.0 for World of Warcraft, we will be getting Black Temple as an instance.

490
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:29,595
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who doesn't know, it was involved in the Outlands, which was a zone that was added for Burning Crusade, so you're going to have to have a huge old massive raid party to be able to do it, but there you go.

491
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:42,871
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also tweaking some of the newer stuff in the Burning Crusade expansion, a new PvP arena, and epic flying mounts.

492
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:47,471
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nether Drake will be available with that patch.

493
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I won't be able to play that because I'm not a high enough level yet.

494
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:51,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But soon.

495
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:52,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 51.

496
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:56,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Druids are going to have their own epic flight form.

497
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:56,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

498
00:30:58,874 --> 00:30:59,574
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be epic.

499
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be like the Warlock and Paladin mount quests.

500
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

501
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I forgot to say World of Warcraft during my gaming week.

502
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on a very aggressive recruiting campaign for our guild.

503
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't call ourselves OL Army.

504
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:17,334
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a different name just because we want to kind of blend in.

505
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,055
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to be an obvious radio promo.

506
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want more information, please go to our forums.

507
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have like a dormant character you're thinking about transferring, we totally want some non-dickhead people to play with.

508
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,307
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone would give me Burning Crusade, I'd play.

509
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:35,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not even touched the content for Burning Crusade at level 51.

510
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want a Draenei.

511
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the wrong side.

512
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Horde guild.

513
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a Blood Elf too.

514
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Then get a Blood Elf.

515
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:45,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you're nice, somebody will bring that to you for, I don't know, Solstice or something.

516
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

517
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:47,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

518
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:48,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy chocolate.

519
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:57,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I heard that a bunch of people from the old Death Cake guild finally... A bunch of people from the old Final Fantasy XI guild finally made the jump.

520
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:58,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

521
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:02,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never, never jump into that.

522
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,167
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to.

523
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:03,887
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because of the wife.

524
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:05,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the other thing I want to say.

525
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:16,390
[SPEAKER_04]: We posted a plug for our guild in the official server forums, and within five minutes, some twat responded with some negative comment to my post.

526
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, God, I hate web forums sometimes.

527
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:19,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate twats.

528
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:20,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the internet.

529
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:21,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate twats.

530
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:23,772
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

531
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:24,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

532
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about other stuff now.

533
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:46,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this, hey, before there was the WoW addiction, there was the music game addiction, which a lot of us are still addicted to, and one of the granddaddies of the music game genre, Parappa the Rapper, created by Masaya Matsuda, he has talked about the PlayStation 3 sluggish sales in Japan, and he's saying that's because the thing's a monster.

534
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge game, or it's a huge system.

535
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, quote, it's not the size of the hardware, but of the AC adapter, when talking about the Xbox 360.

536
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Who fucking who?

537
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over it.

538
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:01,374
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.

539
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:02,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

540
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,295
[SPEAKER_02]: The ACW is too big.

541
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:04,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't develop for that system.

542
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:05,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but here's the thing, though.

543
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:12,181
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't talk about the Wii at all because he says, quote, the Wii is a, quote, very good piece of hardware.

544
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And noting that the controls are pretty awesome.

545
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:21,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has said that he's going to be developing a game for the system, quote, soon, maybe.

546
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:27,571
[SPEAKER_02]: My god, he jumps on the complaint bandwagon like a whole fucking year and a half late.

547
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the AC adapter's too big.

548
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:33,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over it, seriously.

549
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:37,295
[SPEAKER_02]: My god, so what if the brick is huge?

550
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:38,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not matter.

551
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox was huge.

552
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, no one complained about that.

553
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:46,018
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that the size of the controllers originally were like, I don't know, their own houses.

554
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:48,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a little weird.

555
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:51,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of a weird comment, but whatever.

556
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:54,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's... Anywho.

557
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he feels.

558
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he feels.

559
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitchin' moon, people.

560
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

561
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, BMG's got the rights now to distribute Konami music online.

562
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you'll be seeing that popping up in iTunes and Rhapsody and other online distributors.

563
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:14,805
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course...

564
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:20,933
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be seeing stuff from Castlevania, maybe some DDR, maybe Silent Hill.

565
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:29,576
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really have any specific dates on their releases yet, but it's coming.

566
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,037
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

567
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:39,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's a bit of a relief for a lot of people is that they're saying that Rock Band is going to be affordable.

568
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the $150-$200 that people were

569
00:34:43,765 --> 00:35:10,312
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that it was going to be but there hasn't been anything specifically said about pricing but it was said that they don't see a point in making a game that people are not going to be happy buying so hopefully I don't know what their idea of reasonable is it'll be expensive I could swing $100 for a game but $150 maybe not

570
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it has good peripherals, maybe.

571
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:15,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

572
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:16,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's EA putting it out.

573
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:25,166
[SPEAKER_02]: EA has, as far as pricing goes, their games are a little on the high end, even to retailers.

574
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:27,727
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be expensive.

575
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:31,230
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to milk any sort of money they could possibly get out of this.

576
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:32,651
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

577
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:38,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, of course, a game we're looking forward to in the far future.

578
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's probably, what, a Christmas release looking at?

579
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably November-ish?

580
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:41,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably November.

581
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

582
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:44,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some more immediate releases we have.

583
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to run down some release dates, and we'll start in Japan because, of course, a lot of the games that come out in Japan we end up seeing here.

584
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:55,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off on the Xbox, or sometimes it goes the other way around, too.

585
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:56,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a while for the games to get over there.

586
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:57,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends what system you're talking about.

587
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:04,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off on the Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out on the 24th of May as well as NBA Street Home Court.

588
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:07,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some popular titles over on this side of the pond as well.

589
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:11,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Wii, a giant name here.

590
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:18,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, it's Jason Pachislapachinko blah blah blah Sammy's Collection Fist of the North Star Wii.

591
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:24,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's what, Fist of the North Star Pachinko games coming out from Sega on the Wii.

592
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:32,395
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think that they accidentally ran like two names together, but no, I'm looking at the box art and it really is Fist of the North Star Pachinko games on your Wii.

593
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty awesome.

594
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:35,615
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.

595
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,996
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Pachinko and you like Fist of the North Star, hey, this is the game for you.

596
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:48,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on to some other systems on the PlayStation 3, you're also getting NBA Street Home Court for those of you that import your games that want NBA Jam for whatever reason.

597
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,801
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Jam, sorry, NBA Home Court.

598
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Big difference there.

599
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:58,385
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2, Killer7 coming out on the PlayStation 2 by Capcom in Japan.

600
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:00,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised it's not out there already.

601
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:04,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Medal of Honor, well, that's on the PlayStation 2, not the GameCube, so maybe it just took a while.

602
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:13,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Medal of Honor Vanguard, Shadow of Rome, and State of Emergency Revenge all coming out on the PlayStation 2, as well as the King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2.

603
00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:16,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just moving into the best collection.

604
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:16,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That was already...

605
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:24,451
[SPEAKER_04]: State of Emergency Revenge Sanzu Olympic Inkaikoan Suji di Kiteru Noriyuku Training Olympic Training

606
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:48,592
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

607
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

608
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:53,004
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get, of course, on 360, Wartek, Second Orlando.

609
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:56,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

610
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a shooter game, but it's all boss fights almost.

611
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one-on-one fighting.

612
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:05,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2 for Vista, so that's kind of neat.

613
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:08,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Odin Sphere, I know a lot of people were waiting for this one.

614
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's finally making its way out here on PlayStation 2.

615
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:15,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Donna Mana, that's finally coming out as well.

616
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:16,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Got delayed a week.

617
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:18,338
[SPEAKER_02]: About time.

618
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:22,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Naruto Ninja Council 3, that's going to be coming out in the DS.

619
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooktown, hi, senior year.

620
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, that's an economic game.

621
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:38,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, God, or whatever force is up there in the great beyond listening to our crappy little radio program, please, I have one small request for you.

622
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:43,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please, please, God, who I pray to every night, who is so great and holy.

623
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:43,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Donald.

624
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:48,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do not let Dawn of Mana suck balls like Legend of Mana.

625
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please, please.

626
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Blessed be thy name.

627
00:39:51,696 --> 00:39:52,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

628
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

629
00:39:53,437 --> 00:39:56,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, also coming out this week on the DS, Death Jr.

630
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,780
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Science Fair Doom.

631
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, Marvel Trading Card Games also coming out on the DS.

632
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And the New York Times crosswords on the DS.

633
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:08,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

634
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got a bunch of other stuff coming out in the UK.

635
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:12,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

636
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Odin's Fair comes out on PlayStation 2 the 22nd.

637
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,605
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 25th, a whole crap ton of stuff.

638
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Crush for PSP, Custom Robo Arena on DS, Halo 2 Vista for PC, Mario Strikers Charged Football, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, hopefully with the warning intact, the rating, Monster Madness on PC and Xbox 360, Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2,

639
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:59,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Spongebob and Friends blah blah blah Pirates of the Caribbean on multiple systems and Valhalla Nights on PSP I want to mention something real quick I just happened to catch this on Kotaku it happened to do with Pirates

640
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you happen to be going towards Disneyland anytime soon and you have a copy of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End for the DS, there are specially marked spots on the rides or near the attractions that if you have your DS copy there, it will actually download exclusive content for you for the games.

641
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get the game and take it to Disneyland now.

642
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

643
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a really neat kind of tie-in.

644
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give them props for that.

645
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:28,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little crazy, but I like that idea.

646
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

647
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,679
[SPEAKER_04]: ActDeft, Critics on Halo 2 Vista, It Stinks,

648
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, the critics don't know shit.

649
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Mind you, these are the same critics that talked shit about XP when it came out.

650
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

651
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could be the critic, because the critic also used to say, it stinks.

652
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It stinks.

653
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,082
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there we go.

654
00:42:16,294 --> 00:42:16,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

655
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:45,721
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

656
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:51,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, well that's not so bad then.

657
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:52,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

658
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the online one will probably be $20 or $30 anyway, because they can kind of charge that.

659
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like $25 or something.

660
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get all this extra stuff.

661
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of interesting.

662
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:00,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting way to do it.

663
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:09,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a public beta of the game starting on May 24th, and if you want to sign up, you just have to head on over to the official site, warhawk.com.

664
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Already signed up, so I haven't been contacted, though.

665
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:16,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Some good reviews of the game coming out of Sony Gamers Day, though, so we'll see.

666
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see what happens there.

667
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:22,991
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3 could use all these types of games.

668
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: They need some good news very badly right now, and this is good.

669
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:29,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm not trying to pick on Sony or anything.

670
00:43:30,015 --> 00:43:36,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fan of all three of the gaming companies, but let's face it, Sony's kind of doing an uphill battle right now.

671
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:37,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is good.

672
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad.

673
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,281
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to kick it up a notch.

674
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick it up a notch.

675
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,729
[SPEAKER_02]: for their download content.

676
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:46,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, there hasn't really been that much on there.

677
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,874
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteelUT in the chatroom is dogging the game.

678
00:43:48,914 --> 00:43:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Warhawk looks like a generic Battlefield clone.

679
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,418
[SPEAKER_04]: $40 for a game with no SP mode?

680
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

681
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,060
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

682
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it, but, you know, it's interesting.

683
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if you like Warhawk and, you know, those online multiplayer-only games...

684
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:05,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

685
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:09,694
[SPEAKER_02]: SOCOM Confrontation is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3.

686
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:18,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an online-only multiplayer game, and yeah, it's pretty much more Deathmatch and Captured Flag and all that fun stuff.

687
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:22,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's SOCOM, and it looks pretty, so there you go.

688
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:32,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It will support, I believe, up to 32 players online, and yeah, it's just going to be very interesting.

689
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,242
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you're not really into the

690
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer only SOCOM for PlayStation 3.

691
00:44:37,652 --> 00:44:43,816
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a single player game coming out later on that will have online elements as well.

692
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:46,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really gotten into this series.

693
00:44:46,337 --> 00:44:47,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this all about?

694
00:44:47,658 --> 00:44:52,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, it's kind of like Ghost Recon, but, you know, sowing his own thing.

695
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:56,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, Navy SEALs, military type first person shooter game.

696
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:03,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to the next story real quick, I just kind of want to pose this question because we kind of talked a little bit before and I want to open this up to the chat as well.

697
00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:07,588
[SPEAKER_04]: What kinds of stuff does Sony need right now?

698
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:09,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we obviously have their Gamers Day event.

699
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:10,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We have more news coming out of their Gamers Day event.

700
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:15,053
[SPEAKER_04]: What sorts of announcements does Sony need to be making right now?

701
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:16,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are they on the right track?

702
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:22,358
[SPEAKER_02]: They need more releases, more content on their online service.

703
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:24,139
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't do new games...

704
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:28,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Put out some demos or something or maybe some more.

705
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that makes it interesting because right now they don't really have anything to download.

706
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like one release a month.

707
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really slow.

708
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: They need some more exclusives for sure because right now they're hurting.

709
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I'm talking first party stuff, not necessarily third party exclusives.

710
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:45,407
[SPEAKER_02]: They need more.

711
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft's kicking their ass as far as, you know, exclusives go.

712
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:51,769
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got at least one new exclusive every month.

713
00:45:52,264 --> 00:45:53,745
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

714
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Gerardomo says, HitStun, Sony needs a game, period.

715
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:27,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I guess HitStun said something about needing more games there.

716
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:34,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Blaze says, Sony needs a price cut, more download content, more big name titles, and needs to retain exclusives.

717
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun says, actually, Sony needs some Neo Geo CD backwards compatibility.

718
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.

719
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Rossi says, simply, games, period.

720
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, who said, somebody said something about more AAA titles.

721
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:51,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Duscap2 said, more AAA titles, ASAP.

722
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:55,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, KazHorai says, we're certainly not interested in gimmicks.

723
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:58,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was GS68 changing their name there.

724
00:46:59,171 --> 00:46:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

725
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:02,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they need more XXX titles.

726
00:47:03,896 --> 00:47:04,336
[SPEAKER_04]: That would work.

727
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:06,358
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just need intelligence in there.

728
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Price cut seems to be the number one thing we're hearing in the chatroom, though.

729
00:47:10,686 --> 00:47:11,367
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not likely.

730
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:13,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com That's not likely to happen.

731
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,230
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably happen in the fall, but it's not.

732
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say Christmas.

733
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for Christmas to stay competitive, I think you'll see it.

734
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:22,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they need more intelligence in their marketing.

735
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the problem is, I think Xbox will counter it with a price cut of their own.

736
00:47:26,618 --> 00:47:32,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just worried right now that they're getting hosed as far as exclusives go because it's not

737
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:41,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Sony's fault because Microsoft actually is developing a lot of games in-house for themselves, and they're not relying on third-party exclusives.

738
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got their own.

739
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:47,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got themselves covered each month with a new game coming out from them.

740
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you can't say that about Sony.

741
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of the problem.

742
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, we've got Halo 3.

743
00:47:55,092 --> 00:47:57,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got Killzone 2 coming out.

744
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

745
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:02,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's coming out eventually, but that's way in the future, so...

746
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:05,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of sad.

747
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:34,476
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

748
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:54,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I believe this week, actually, Marvel... I've got more controllers.

749
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:59,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I think it was either this week or last week that Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition came out for the 360.

750
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:08,354
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other reasons I don't have to worry about spending the points downloading the characters I want, because you know the first thing I'm going to do is we can play through every level I can with Hawkeye.

751
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:11,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Sony fanboys can take comfort in this.

752
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:12,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how you guys feel.

753
00:49:12,276 --> 00:49:14,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the only one of the three of us that doesn't own a PlayStation 3 yet.

754
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:15,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not missing it.

755
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:17,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I will...

756
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:22,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go out and buy a PlayStation 3 if Final Fantasy XIII stays exclusive to Sony.

757
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm that much a whore for the Final Fantasy series, I will have to have it.

758
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Home looks cool and LittleBigPlanet.

759
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:30,977
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those are all like extra yays for me.

760
00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:38,459
[SPEAKER_01]: With the things they want to do with Final Fantasy XIII, I don't think there's, processing-wise, a way it can be done on the other systems and have it come out the way they want it to.

761
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:40,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be changing my tune single-handedly by that game.

762
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hell, Final Fantasy VII is the reason I bought a PlayStation 1.

763
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:44,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

764
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,066
[SPEAKER_04]: and that ended up being an okay bye-bye.

765
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:48,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, why not?

766
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:50,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a new Jet Moto game.

767
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:51,969
[SPEAKER_02]: New Jet Moto.

768
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Less Sony bashing, more stories.

769
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's throw a little bit of love Sony's way, if we can.

770
00:49:56,131 --> 00:50:01,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even so, I'm not highly excited about this because I played the demo at E3 last year.

771
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:11,020
[SPEAKER_01]: But Heavenly Sword, they are stating that they may have multiplayer as downloadable content, which is sort of interesting, I guess.

772
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

773
00:50:13,507 --> 00:50:21,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, I mean, they're saying that when they do it, they want to make it, you know, full-on, you know, multiplayer, not just an afterthought.

774
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:26,897
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also rumors of, you know, a co-op and deathmatch, but yeah.

775
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:32,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But the game right now, though, is, from what I understand, still on schedule for the September release.

776
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:33,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome.

777
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:34,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

778
00:50:34,862 --> 00:50:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Good news.

779
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,203
[SPEAKER_02]: There, that's some very good news.

780
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:37,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavenly Sword looks good.

781
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

782
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:39,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to catch up with that September.

783
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:42,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like playing the singing level in Kingdom Hearts 2.

784
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:44,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction

785
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:14,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really into that kind of ratchet and clank, but I'm almost kind of thinking of picking it up just because it looks awesome.

786
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:14,831
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

787
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:16,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sorry.

788
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:32,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise that we wouldn't have much more negative Sony stuff, but I just can't not talk about this one, and this would have to do with a recent PlayStation 3 promotion, and what happened is that there was an ad that

789
00:51:34,525 --> 00:52:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: for, okay, basically it's on this Spanish website for Kia, okay, was promoting the Kia car, and I guess they're doing this promotion right now with the PlayStation, because they're running this, you know, like, I don't know, maybe you enter to win a PlayStation 3 if you test drive one of their cars, but here's the thing, in the ad, they show the PlayStation 3, and then they show a screenshot on the TV of Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't

790
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gotham Printed in Their Magazine

791
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:35,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.

792
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:39,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody at Sony Marketing needs to get fired right now.

793
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:40,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony International Marketing.

794
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:42,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a lot of people because it's Kia.

795
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:46,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody, I mean, somebody, I don't know where they're fucking up.

796
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:48,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bad mistake to make repeatedly.

797
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do it once and it's funny, ha ha, people forget.

798
00:52:51,507 --> 00:52:55,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But do it now three times and people start to go, what the hell?

799
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, why can't people understand that Project Gotham is a Microsoft title?

800
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:00,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I'm going to...

801
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

802
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish I could say the same for full auto, although it wasn't bad.

803
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:30,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's something else that's kind of funny, a little story.

804
00:53:31,105 --> 00:53:41,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's some guy, some gamer that was kind of saying farewell to his PlayStation 2 because he has a brand new PlayStation 3.

805
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why he decided to do this, but he figured the best send-off was to piss on it.

806
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess he got drunk and

807
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, pissed on his PlayStation 2 and being the dumbass that he is, left it plugged in and basically knocked himself out after pissing on it.

808
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Mommy ever tell you don't piss on the electric fence?

809
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:01,809
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

810
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,190
[SPEAKER_01]: An episode of Beavis and Butthead?

811
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:06,433
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was Ren and Stimpy.

812
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:08,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't whiz on the electric fence.

813
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:09,775
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little song that goes with it, I know.

814
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,891
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you've had many consoles come and go throughout your house, right?

815
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:16,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly just consoles come.

816
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:19,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever done this send-off for a console?

817
00:54:19,692 --> 00:54:25,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever, you know, pulled down your trousers and peed on a console to send it off?

818
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:26,813
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I'm not stupid.

819
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're in your house.

820
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you piss on it in your own house, you stupid moron?

821
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:34,194
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I'm going to piss on it.

822
00:54:34,394 --> 00:54:37,835
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, usually when they break, we gut them and try to do something neat with the...

823
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: The Husk.

824
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, haven't you been paying attention to the internet?

825
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing to do with consoles is to slam them with a sledgehammer.

826
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:46,729
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you gotta do.

827
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:47,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on YouTube.

828
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on YouTube, yes.

829
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:54,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to play, the best way to do that is to play the music from, what was that scene in Office Space?

830
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And recreate it out in the field.

831
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with the copier and they were, yeah, yeah, yeah, those were good times.

832
00:54:58,623 --> 00:54:58,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

833
00:54:59,404 --> 00:54:59,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

834
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, whenever we hear stories about dumbasses like this one, it can make us feel anything else but anger.

835
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what that means, boys and girls.

836
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:11,365
Not really.

837
00:55:11,686 --> 00:55:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, she could take a dookie on it if she wanted to.

838
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:29,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, DarkSakura, your F.U.

839
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,398
[SPEAKER_04]: of the week, please.

840
00:55:30,778 --> 00:55:31,679
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to you.

841
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:35,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say F.U.

842
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:41,680
[SPEAKER_01]: to the pollen in Dixon for making me all stuffed up and getting all over my car.

843
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:43,201
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, F.U.

844
00:55:43,241 --> 00:55:47,241
[SPEAKER_01]: to Rob, because you've never had to go out in the wild.

845
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:49,662
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know that.

846
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:50,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I went camping once.

847
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:56,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've never had, well, okay, you've never been a woman going to the bathroom in the wild.

848
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Just squat behind a tree, what's wrong with that?

849
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as it sounds.

850
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:08,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You make it sound like some assembly is required.

851
00:56:08,796 --> 00:56:12,399
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I love living in the modern world where we have things called toilets.

852
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:16,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And not living in Japan with the public toilets and squat toilets.

853
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:26,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably remember though, it's not always a good idea to go behind Neil Bush and stuff, especially if you're a woman, because a drag queen fairy may come and turn you into a man.

854
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

855
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:28,950
[SPEAKER_02]: What movie was that again?

856
00:56:29,571 --> 00:56:31,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

857
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Penis Envy.

858
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:35,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.

859
00:56:36,335 --> 00:56:37,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's another thing.

860
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:40,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a movie with Adam Sandler.

861
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:42,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out.

862
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the gay marriage one?

863
00:56:47,682 --> 00:56:50,644
[SPEAKER_01]: The trailer already pisses me the hell off, so fuck them.

864
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:54,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm willing to give the movie a chance to see what the message is in the end.

865
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the trailer does make it look like I can't even describe it.

866
00:56:58,922 --> 00:57:00,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it look like it's very trivializing.

867
00:57:00,903 --> 00:57:01,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

868
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Drawn Together did it first.

869
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:05,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But Drawn Together did it funny.

870
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:09,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give the movie a chance, but the trailer does not look promising.

871
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Loki.

872
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw all the software makers on the 360 for making it so fucking hard to do a system-linked game with your goddamn games.

873
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:24,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop having to patch shit so it's incompatible with unpatched shit

874
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:32,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And then F you to my work for not actually having an internet connection in the one room there where we have the game console so I can just update them right there.

875
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to take them home.

876
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:38,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, is it my turn to give an F you?

877
00:57:39,811 --> 00:57:41,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my first F you is to drama.

878
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:42,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like drama.

879
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:44,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody likes drama, and drama's no fun.

880
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have a second F you, and this one's pretty serious, so I have to kill the music here for a minute.

881
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to give an F you to myself because...

882
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:06,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Something really bad happened, and it's kind of hard for me to admit this openly, but it's just a very difficult thing for me.

883
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:15,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give an F you to myself because I kind of like a Fergie song.

884
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

885
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,623
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I failed the internets completely.

886
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I failed our listeners, but

887
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like this new Fergie song, this Big Girls Don't Cry.

888
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:31,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

889
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,451
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making my hair hurt again.

890
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I like Fergie, and for that I deserve to be mocked and made fun of openly by others.

891
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:47,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate myself.

892
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, I'm pointing at you.

893
00:58:55,646 --> 00:58:56,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

894
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:57,847
[SPEAKER_04]: More news.

895
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:01,649
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd say we take an ice cream break.

896
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:03,411
[SPEAKER_04]: An ice cream break?

897
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we only have a few more stories.

898
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Six more stories, we can do it.

899
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, fine, fine.

900
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:17,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of FUs, Sony is committed to the PS3 for ten years and beyond.

901
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:17,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

902
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:28,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the SCEA president, Jack Trenton, is quoted saying we didn't get into PS3 for the first six months of 2007.

903
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:31,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We're into this for the next 10 years and beyond.

904
00:59:31,933 --> 00:59:35,414
[SPEAKER_01]: A million units one way or another at this point isn't going to worry us.

905
00:59:36,755 --> 00:59:40,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they're saying, well, our sales suck, but we hope to make it up in 10 years.

906
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:42,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

907
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:43,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

908
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dedicated to this console to infinity and beyond.

909
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Has any console... Well, I guess, you know what?

910
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:49,542
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

911
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:51,663
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of look at this and go, oh, ha, ha, ha.

912
00:59:52,103 --> 00:59:57,364
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but come to think of it, you know, consoles live on even after the next generation.

913
00:59:57,384 --> 01:00:00,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, technically, we are still in the PlayStation 2's lifespan, right?

914
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:02,506
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still putting that crap for it.

915
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:03,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

916
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:04,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and good crap.

917
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:05,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We had God of War 2.

918
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:08,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this, what, the role-playing game folks are looking forward to.

919
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII is not that old, all things considered.

920
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,969
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this console's still got a lot of life left in it.

921
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:18,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I could see how the console, they can say it might be lasting that long before they, you know, put a bullet in it.

922
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

923
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:32,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, I was reading some chat room while Jamie was reading that story there, and Mystic Gohan reminded me that big girls don't cry, so I need to just suck it up here on the show.

924
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, big girls and big boys alike love the Chronicles of Riddick, or at least, you know,

925
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:43,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel okay about it.

926
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:43,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

927
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:45,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, bad segue.

928
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, you know what?

929
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you didn't like the movie, the game wasn't bad.

930
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a game that came out.

931
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:06,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Starbreeze is working on a new version of the game for Next Gen Systems.

932
01:01:06,558 --> 01:01:17,045
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is called Assault on Dark Athena X, and it's going to have a single player mode, which is a little bit longer than last time, an all new multiplayer mode, and a developer's commentary mode.

933
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:18,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does that mean?

934
01:01:18,399 --> 01:01:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You get running commentary while you're playing the game?

935
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:21,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like a DVD track on a movie?

936
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:23,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, this part was such a bitch to program.

937
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:35,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear, code here and code this didn't quite work together, so we had to do this to make them work, and blah blah blah blah blah, and the rest of us are going, um, yeah, I don't speak your language.

938
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:45,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like totally like Final Fantasy 7, and it's like, yeah, and then the scene where Eris dies, oh crap, that hasn't happened yet, oh shit, uh, um, forget I said anything about that.

939
01:01:46,558 --> 01:01:46,818
[SPEAKER_02]: That, oh.

940
01:01:48,479 --> 01:01:48,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

941
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:50,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Loki.

942
01:01:51,041 --> 01:02:00,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, hey, maybe in that remake that they keep saying they're going to do for, you know, the internet loves to rumor that one for the PlayStation 3, maybe it can have developer commentary in it.

943
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:04,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe my skin will turn blue.

944
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:07,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it will, Jamie.

945
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:08,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it will.

946
01:02:09,297 --> 01:02:15,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Sony plans on bringing the pain to the PlayStation 3, and actually the PlayStation Network.

947
01:02:15,682 --> 01:02:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Pain.

948
01:02:17,396 --> 01:02:21,458
[SPEAKER_02]: and it involves you launching a poor hapless victim into stuff.

949
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:23,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy it.

950
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:33,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this the one where I saw a screenshot where it was just a guy on a slingshot and they were going to fling him into a building or something?

951
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:34,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

952
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:38,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has monkeys getting injured.

953
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:40,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So, injured monkeys, people getting hurt.

954
01:02:40,744 --> 01:02:42,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a game I'm going to buy.

955
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

956
01:02:43,965 --> 01:02:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming out later on.

957
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:47,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Jackass, but actually funny.

958
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:48,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

959
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

960
01:02:50,836 --> 01:02:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just using the physics engine, so you just launch your character into stuff to get him hurt as badly as possible.

961
01:02:57,438 --> 01:03:03,639
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different games, including Horse Mode or Spank the Monkey and Mime Toss.

962
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that part.

963
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Burst in chat asks, what's with the Sony bashing tonight?

964
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:10,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this looks great.

965
01:03:11,102 --> 01:03:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Pain looks great.

966
01:03:12,682 --> 01:03:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said the Mystic Sword looks cool.

967
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank.

968
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:21,192
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

969
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:23,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm exposed.

970
01:03:23,214 --> 01:03:24,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Sony.

971
01:03:24,115 --> 01:03:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha, got me.

972
01:03:26,378 --> 01:03:30,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, speaking of games that I'm not buying...

973
01:03:31,236 --> 01:03:34,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Vivendi is putting Timeshift on PS3.

974
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:41,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be up there with the PC and PC 360.

975
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:42,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Xbox 360.

976
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:44,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my, did that slip out?

977
01:03:46,888 --> 01:03:47,068
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

978
01:03:47,308 --> 01:03:50,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just going to say, I have a laugh sometimes with gaming press out there.

979
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:53,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They always make stories for themselves.

980
01:03:53,452 --> 01:03:56,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this whole Timeshift is coming to PlayStation 3.

981
01:03:57,095 --> 01:03:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been scheduled to come out on PlayStation 3.

982
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,442
[SPEAKER_02]: even when Atari had the rights for it.

983
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:07,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it went away for a while.

984
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:10,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for reading the whole rest of the story for me.

985
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

986
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:14,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You ass.

987
01:04:18,294 --> 01:04:19,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not on top of things.

988
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: D'oh.

989
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:22,204
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

990
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:23,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him to read my story.

991
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you're going to do.

992
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,305
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you're going to do, Jamie.

993
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what story he does next because you can see Super C. So read ahead.

994
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he starts reading it, cut him off and finish it.

995
01:04:31,346 --> 01:04:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jamie?

996
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:33,986
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just going to leave.

997
01:04:34,006 --> 01:04:34,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

998
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.

999
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:38,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You get about two minutes to prep because I have a story here first.

1000
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,567
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't care.

1001
01:04:39,927 --> 01:04:41,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the PlayStation 3.

1002
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:42,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

1003
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:44,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sit here and read my comics for the rest of the show.

1004
01:04:44,528 --> 01:04:44,828
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1005
01:04:46,228 --> 01:04:46,729
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1006
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is something the chat room said earlier.

1007
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.

1008
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:20,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Gullimont, who is the president and CEO of Ubisoft, has said that Sony will, quote, for sure have a lower market share than before because of the PlayStation 3's cost.

1009
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:24,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, quote, they have to decrease the price quite significantly.

1010
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1011
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Ubisoft is continuing to support PlayStation 3.

1012
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,952
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bringing an exclusive title to Europe.

1013
01:05:32,216 --> 01:05:34,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Far Cry Cricket It's cricket in the jungle We'll see

1014
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so Sega is licensing the Unreal 3 engine.

1015
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:03,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the same engine that's been in practically everything lately, but, you know.

1016
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's yet another game.

1017
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:15,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts are, though, that it's going to be used in the upcoming, I guess they're enhancing or remaking the Alien franchise video game.

1018
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:16,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Alien Syndrome and that stuff?

1019
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like Aliens as in... Oh, the movies!

1020
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:20,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1021
01:06:21,169 --> 01:06:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know Sega owned the rights to that.

1022
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you know.

1023
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1024
01:06:26,797 --> 01:06:27,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait.

1025
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,118
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that must be a different thing I'm thinking of.

1026
01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:34,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But they haven't made an Alien movie since the Winona Ryder one, which was years ago.

1027
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:38,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they made a crappy Aliens vs. Predator movie, and then they're making a sequel.

1028
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Aliens vs. Predator was fun.

1029
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:41,281
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making a sequel.

1030
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:43,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of guilty pleasure movies, there we go.

1031
01:06:43,702 --> 01:06:46,523
[SPEAKER_02]: When aliens make out with a black chick, yeah.

1032
01:06:47,623 --> 01:06:48,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no, I'm sorry.

1033
01:06:48,143 --> 01:06:48,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw it.

1034
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:49,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a Predator.

1035
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:50,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw it.

1036
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Freddy vs. The Predator

1037
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:24,582
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in chat says, the best Aliens was the arcade version from Konami.

1038
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:26,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, that's what I was thinking of.

1039
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:32,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But Ross Steel UT says, hey Tiger, Aliens vs. Predator arcade by Capcom equals sex.

1040
01:07:32,784 --> 01:07:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And Actdeft agrees.

1041
01:07:33,704 --> 01:07:37,925
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was thinking of the Capcom one, because it's all about playing through the game with Lynn Kurosawa.

1042
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:39,985
[SPEAKER_01]: With her freaking sword of death.

1043
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:42,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome game.

1044
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else about the Unreal Engine?

1045
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we cut you off, but you deserved it.

1046
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:53,829
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's going to be probably a first person shooter since, you know, people really like to think outside the box.

1047
01:07:53,909 --> 01:07:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic 3D again.

1048
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:04,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you happen to catch that video that was like the Sonic concept that they were going to do that it was supposed to be based off the cartoon series?

1049
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:05,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I actually did see that.

1050
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:06,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Some YouTube-age.

1051
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:07,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember where I saw it posted.

1052
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, where like Sonic moved a little more 3D, but it was still like a platformer.

1053
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:14,013
[SPEAKER_04]: That looked so fake to me.

1054
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:16,075
[SPEAKER_04]: That looked so incredibly fake.

1055
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:21,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I cannot believe that they would make a game like that where Sonic moved like molasses.

1056
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you watch the video, he was slow.

1057
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:25,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I know which system they'd put it out on, too.

1058
01:08:25,483 --> 01:08:26,184
[SPEAKER_02]: The CDI.

1059
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:27,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1060
01:08:28,246 --> 01:08:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked horrible.

1061
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1062
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did he see that YouTube post?

1063
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:32,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Kotaku.

1064
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:33,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

1065
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1066
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, it looked fake.

1067
01:08:35,492 --> 01:08:35,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1068
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It screamed a fakeness to me.

1069
01:08:37,173 --> 01:08:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they took some unknown game and sprited Sonic into it.

1070
01:08:40,728 --> 01:08:40,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1071
01:08:41,008 --> 01:08:42,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to believe it because it looks horrible.

1072
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was the beginning of the end of Sega.

1073
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:45,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1074
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:48,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1075
01:08:50,915 --> 01:08:53,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at what's in chats going on there.

1076
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:56,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wants to see a video game.

1077
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Marvel vs. Capcom vs. SNK.

1078
01:09:00,522 --> 01:09:02,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that would be the ultimate, wouldn't it?

1079
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:03,484
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1080
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

1081
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:07,747
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68's kicking Sonic while they're down here.

1082
01:09:08,038 --> 01:09:15,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the Sonic 360 demo and the controls nearly made me have a stroke, heart attack, stomach acid overflow, HIV, and loose stools all at once.

1083
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:21,666
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to have now that Sega's doing third-party titles now?

1084
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:23,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo vs. Sega.

1085
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The fighting game to end all fights.

1086
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Smash Bros.

1087
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

1088
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:30,992
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm talking about a bigger roster.

1089
01:09:31,012 --> 01:09:33,094
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking like hundreds of characters.

1090
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:36,916
[SPEAKER_01]: We never did, though, get the Namco Capcom game out here.

1091
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:38,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's true.

1092
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:39,885
[SPEAKER_02]: The Namco Cross Capcom or whatever it was?

1093
01:09:40,386 --> 01:09:40,666
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

1094
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:41,846
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big RPG.

1095
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:43,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I know someone who has it.

1096
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:48,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the PlayStation 2 Japanese one and I'm kind of glad that we didn't because it was kind of lame.

1097
01:09:49,207 --> 01:09:50,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded so cool in theory.

1098
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:56,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Bandit reminds us they do have Sonic vs. Mario in the upcoming Olympics game that we talked about a few shows ago.

1099
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:58,109
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I want?

1100
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:04,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I want another... Crap, I just lost the game.

1101
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:07,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I want another Strider.

1102
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:09,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Strider, please.

1103
01:10:09,636 --> 01:10:15,200
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that ridiculous Sega fighting game that they had where you can actually play as a Daytona car and punch things?

1104
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Fighter's Megamix, which I have.

1105
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fighter's Megamix.

1106
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of ridiculous gameplay I want.

1107
01:10:23,606 --> 01:10:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to be able to play as Rob the Robot or as one of the unicycles from Uniracers.

1108
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:29,871
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something really ridiculous.

1109
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:32,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of Captain Falcon, I want to play as the car.

1110
01:10:32,553 --> 01:10:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1111
01:10:33,513 --> 01:10:34,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1112
01:10:34,995 --> 01:10:35,556
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1113
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:51,303
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I guess it's break time, boys and girls.

1114
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:57,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break here, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in Part B. And lots of news coming up in Part B tonight.

1115
01:10:57,948 --> 01:10:59,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even touched the Xbox 360 or the Wii.

1116
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:05,374
[SPEAKER_04]: This has kind of been the Sony segment, so we have lots of 360 and Wii news coming up in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

1117
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back right after this.

1118
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:12,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1119
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:17,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
