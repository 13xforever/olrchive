00:15.480 --> 00:19.840
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.460
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.680
It is Sunday, May the 6th of 2007.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.160
Hey, itís 567.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.160
Get it?

00:26.160 --> 00:28.440
Weíre here for part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.640
You know, that would only happen once every few years if we get the consecutive numbers

00:32.640 --> 00:33.640
like that.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.400
Anyway, this is part B of our podcast.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.080
If you missed the first half of this episode, please go back over to www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:39.080 --> 00:41.400
and check out the first half of tonightís show.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.400
We are taping live on Sunday night here.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.920
Letís get back into some video game news.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.440
Loki, start us off.

00:47.440 --> 00:52.680
So the bastards over at Microsoft decided that itís time to ruin more fun for you,

00:52.680 --> 00:57.200
including downloading stuff that you shouldnít be downloading, like demos and stuff from

00:57.200 --> 00:59.020
other regions.

00:59.020 --> 01:06.760
So apparently now theyíre going to be enforcing their Xbox Live demo download region lockouts,

01:06.760 --> 01:10.360
and theyíre going to make it impossible for you to download content from other regions.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.600
However, if youíve already downloaded stuff, good for you.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.720
You get to keep it still.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.440
But anything else, you can fuck yourself.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.720
You can see it.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.840
They wonít delete your accounts.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.800
You can see what content is on there, but you canít do shit.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.760
So you can look in the store window, but you canít buy.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.720
And I noticed you came out swinging on this story, second word out of your mouth was ìbastards.î

01:31.720 --> 01:36.960
So Iím curious if you feel personally affected by this, because you donít have a Japanese

01:36.960 --> 01:38.840
account or anything that you were using, right?

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
No, not at all.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
Itís all right.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.560
And we only got demos for Armored Core 4.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.840
I had a demo for Tenchu Z last year.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.800
If Iím not mistaken, arenít they controlling this by IP address lookup, basically, that

01:51.800 --> 01:54.480
theyíre making sure your IP address is in the country you say youíre from?

01:54.480 --> 01:57.120
Oh, if thatís the case, thatís going to be fucking easy.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.880
So whatís to stop them from IP spoofing?

02:00.880 --> 02:06.400
Or port forwarding, or basically bouncing yourself off a different DNS server.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.080
Here come the hacks pretty soon.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.080
Thatíll be easy.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.800
All right, well, Iím sure youíll get right on that in hacking.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.760
Iím sure I will.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
All right.

02:17.760 --> 02:23.880
Anyhow, letís talk about whatís coming out to Xbox Live Arcade, in America at least.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.720
I donít know about all regions, but I know weíre getting it here, and usually the arcade

02:26.720 --> 02:29.280
releases are pretty much universal.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.280
But whatís coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade, Double Dragon is coming out, and that

02:34.280 --> 02:39.320
was rumored earlier in the week to be coming out, but this got confirmed by a press release

02:39.320 --> 02:42.040
coming out of Empire Interactive.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.240
Also Speedball is going to be released as well, Speedball 2.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.680
This was a sports game featuring, like, robots or something.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.000
There it is.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.600
Although it says, actually, Iím going to correct myself, it says Speedball 2 is coming

02:56.600 --> 03:00.620
within the coming weeks, but Double Dragon is coming out this week.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.640
So we donít know if Speedball 2 is necessarily this week or not, but we do know Double Dragon

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
is for sure.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.960
And I had not even heard of Speedball 2 before, I know they call it a classic, but somehow

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
I missed that one.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.680
It wasnít like the Amiga, I think, and stuff like that.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
Oh, well thatís why.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.640
I still was on a Commodore 64 by the time everybody was talking about Commodore Amiga.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.120
Well there is actually another game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and thatís Puzzle Quest

03:21.120 --> 03:27.400
Challenge of the Warlords, which is already on PSP and Nintendo DS, and itís supposed

03:27.400 --> 03:29.240
to come out later this year.

03:29.240 --> 03:37.400
Itís also going to be coming out with Mad Tracks, which is like a Penny Racer the game

03:37.400 --> 03:41.480
or something, and a Rocket Bowl thatís mini-golf but bowling.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.640
Now Penny Racers really sucked.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
This looks like a lot better.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.460
I had Penny Racers when I was little, though.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.080
This looks like, well, they had a game called Penny Racer on the Nintendo 64 and it blew

03:50.080 --> 03:51.080
up.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.080
I donít know what Iím talking about.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.000
Oh, wasnít that, you know, that was Uniracer Iím thinking of.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.880
No, this actually, no, this kind of reminds me of, except without any old, like the Micro

03:58.880 --> 04:00.520
Machines games, almost.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.520
Hm.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.280
That could be kind of.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.160
I mean, it has potential to be fun, but...

04:05.160 --> 04:06.160
Like R.C.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.160
Pro-Am?

04:07.160 --> 04:12.960
But, quite honestly, Iím just, uh, Iíll just keep playing, you know, Uno and Symphony

04:12.960 --> 04:15.480
of the Night.

04:15.480 --> 04:21.000
But um, yeah, Puzzle Quest is going to be so awesome, I canít wait.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.720
Anyways, we have other things coming out, of course, in all the regions of the world.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.360
This week, lots of good stuff, well, not a lot of good stuff, but some pretty good stuff

04:29.360 --> 04:32.120
coming to the US.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.720
Starting off with, of course, on the Xbox 360, we have Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium

04:35.720 --> 04:40.280
Wars finally making its way out, so thatís going to be pretty awesome.

04:40.280 --> 04:45.360
On Playstation 2, we have Tidal Legends 2, which will be making its way out, and Tidal

04:45.360 --> 04:50.920
Legends Powered Up on the PSP, so thatís kind of neat.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.640
Driver 76 will be making its way out on the PSP as well, of course being the prequel to

04:55.640 --> 04:57.960
Driver Parallel Lines.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.120
Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing, and Heat Seeker on PSP.

05:03.120 --> 05:09.320
Then of course, on, letís see, the PC, not a whole lot coming out, weíve got Locomania,

05:09.320 --> 05:16.160
which sounds like a pretty interesting train simulator, and Circus Empire, which also equally

05:16.160 --> 05:18.040
probably boring.

05:18.040 --> 05:24.040
On Playstation 3, youíve got Big Fat Nada, and of course, the Wii, nothing to look at

05:24.040 --> 05:25.520
there either.

05:25.520 --> 05:32.640
And finally, the DS, nothing to see there either, so a whole lot of nothing.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.180
I know actually, I think on Playstation 2 also,.hack//G.U Volume 2 is making its way

05:37.180 --> 05:43.360
out, so thatís it for the week, pretty light week, but itís going to start picking up.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.960
What about Japan, Rob?

05:44.960 --> 05:52.280
Well over in Japan, we will have Command & Conquer 3 as well, at least hitting the Asia regions,

05:52.280 --> 05:55.520
which I imagine a lot of folks who import games if they want to pick up the Asian version

05:55.520 --> 06:00.360
can get that, as well as Spiderman 3 this week, on the Xbox 360 those games are coming

06:00.360 --> 06:01.820
out on.

06:01.820 --> 06:07.520
On the Nintendo Wii, not a lot, you pretty much have to wait until May 17th for the next

06:07.520 --> 06:10.600
big game to come out on the Nintendo Wii.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.320
It seems to be another really slow week in Japan actually, I remember last week was pretty

06:14.320 --> 06:16.920
slow as well.

06:16.920 --> 06:23.000
On May 10th on the Playstation 2, youíre getting Wrestle Kingdom 2 Pro Wrestling Sekai

06:23.000 --> 06:31.080
Taisen as well as Simple 2000 Series Volume 117.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.080
What the hell is this?

06:32.080 --> 06:35.120
Iíve never even heard of Volumes 1 through 116.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.440
You havenít heard of the Simple 2000 Series, man, I go on about these all the fucking time.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.080
Theyíre budget games for like 2,000 yen.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.200
Oh, okay, so itís just games going into this, okay, never mind.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.960
Well, theyíre budget games that get released by like D3, like Earth Defense Force for example.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.520
Okay, I get it.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
Or Zombies vs Ambulance.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.840
I didnít put two and two together.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.560
Well, they have the Zero Sen, then youíll be happy to know here it is, the Zero Sen

06:56.560 --> 06:58.400
is coming out on Playstation 2.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.640
I can only download all of them.

07:00.640 --> 07:06.520
It looks like planes blowing shit up, old planes, like it looks like 1941 all over again.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.520
Awesome.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.640
They really need to bring the Simple series over to the US.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.600
I mean, can you imagine just all the like really cheap ass games coming out?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.400
Thatíd be cool.

07:16.400 --> 07:22.880
On the Nintendo DS this week, you get a game called Saikou Todai Shogi is coming out this

07:22.880 --> 07:23.880
week.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.880
Itís a board game for the DS.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.560
Saikou Todai Shogi.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.040
Yeah, Saikou 2, lady.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
Okay.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.040
Itís a board game simulator.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.040
Yeah, itís Shogi.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.640
And, yeah, isnít part of the fun about this segment getting to hear me butcher Japanese

07:44.640 --> 07:46.240
pronunciation?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.040
By the way, the big, big, big release this weekÖ

07:48.040 --> 07:49.400
That means greatest something.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.480
I think this might be why you donít see much coming out this week, because finally when

07:52.480 --> 07:56.640
I got to the bottom of the page and saw the PSP releases, Final Fantasy Tactics coming

07:56.640 --> 08:01.680
out in Japan this week, the PSP version there, so Iím sure thatís what youíll all be playing

08:01.680 --> 08:02.680
and importing this week.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.920
So the rest of the games just kind of donít matter anymore.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.720
How about the Europe release dates, Jamie?

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
Why donít?

08:08.720 --> 08:11.040
Iíll tell you about them, Rob.

08:11.040 --> 08:15.280
On the 9th, we have Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.

08:15.280 --> 08:21.680
The 11th brings us 32nd Americaís Cup of the Game on PC, Bus to Move Bash on Wii, Driver

08:21.680 --> 08:28.160
76 on PSP, GoPuzzle, PlayStation 3, Hard Rock Casino on PS2 and PSP, and for the DS, we

08:28.160 --> 08:31.160
also have Picross DS and Turn It Around.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.640
Iíd like to bash the Bus to Move series after this many years.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
Go away.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.720
Donít come back.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.760
I want a new actual Bus to Move, not a puzzle bobble.

08:40.760 --> 08:46.000
Remember Bus to Move on the PlayStation 2 with the artwork that had the baby on it,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.600
and it was like, ìWhat in the fuck shit is this game?î

08:48.600 --> 08:51.880
Well, didnít they have Bus to Move on the PlayStation 1?

08:51.880 --> 08:55.280
Bus to Move was on the PlayStation 1, right, and it started on PlayStation 2, if I remember

08:55.280 --> 08:56.280
correctly.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.280
Right.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
Well, theyíve been on every platform.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.400
Iím talking about the US Bus to Move puzzle bobble.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
I know.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.400
Thatís why Iím here.

09:01.400 --> 09:08.720
The Japanese one, you know, you could emulate that on your PSP, because, you know, thereís

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
the workarounds.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
Yippee!

09:10.720 --> 09:15.880
Iím hooping and hollering and screaming out of pure joy, because Iíve never played puzzle

09:15.880 --> 09:18.720
bobble in my entire life out of the 50 times itís come out on the console.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.720
I play Puzzle de Pons, which is almost the same thing.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.920
You should play Puzzle in Deserts, fun.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.920
Anyway.

09:25.920 --> 09:26.920
Anyways.

09:26.920 --> 09:32.920
So, Warhawk, about that game thatís supposed to be coming out, I still donít know much

09:32.920 --> 09:35.680
about it, other than the fact that itís going to be multiplayer only.

09:35.680 --> 09:40.960
We do know that thereís going to be a beta and a demo, because this game needs all the

09:40.960 --> 09:44.200
exposure possible.

09:44.200 --> 09:50.600
So those should be coming soon, I know the gameís due out in June, and, yeah, should

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
be pretty exciting.

09:52.600 --> 09:59.640
Alright, whatís also exciting is people getting to take their own pictures on their camera.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.160
Itís the PSP camera.

10:02.160 --> 10:07.140
It came out in Japan already, but itís still not come out in the US, but if youíre in

10:07.140 --> 10:09.800
Europe or Australia, you do get the cam.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.920
Itís called the Go Cam, and itís coming out May 16th.

10:12.920 --> 10:18.000
It comes with a little program called Go Edit that allows you to edit sound and video all

10:18.000 --> 10:19.960
from this little camera.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.200
So check that out if youíre in Europe or Australia.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.760
If youíre in the US, you donít get a camera.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.440
Yes, in which case youíll get the free program called Go Fuck Yourself.

10:28.440 --> 10:31.920
Oh, youíre so funny, Loki.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.680
Iím so glad we have you on this program.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.680
Or Go Fuck Yourself A.

10:35.680 --> 10:47.240
Well, for anybody who likes their nifty looking skins or versions of their DS, as I point

10:47.240 --> 10:54.720
to Andrew with his old school ñ His Wal-Mart bot cover for his DS.

10:54.720 --> 11:00.880
Anyway, I have one thatís signed by Miyamoto.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.000
I have one thatís signed by me, and thatís more awesomer.

11:04.000 --> 11:15.220
Thereís a Golden DS Lite that has a backlit diecast sword and shield crest, and it has

11:15.220 --> 11:23.320
a custom charge stand, and two painted styli in silver and black.

11:23.320 --> 11:29.520
The only way that anyoneís going to be able to get one is to get it on eBay, according

11:29.520 --> 11:37.240
to this, and itís going to be going to the Childís Play charity.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.040
Good cause, stupid DS Lite.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
Or DS.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.040
I donít know.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.040
I think it sounds kind of cool.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.040
It looks kind of nice.

11:43.040 --> 11:48.520
I kind of wish they put that out officially.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.480
I know, Iím kind of waiting for Nintendo to copy this idea and put it out, but not

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
for charity.

11:53.480 --> 11:58.680
Donít get me wrong, I think itís a great cause and everything, but Iím just waiting

11:58.680 --> 12:00.080
for Nintendo to steal the idea.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.120
No, Sony will release another PSP, which will have the Zelda shield on it with the sword.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.880
It wonít make any sense, but they copied it, so thatís all that matters.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.480
Theyíll just call it Dark ñ what was that game?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
The Soul Calibur.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.480
No, what the hell was that game?

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
Dark Cloud.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.480
Dark Cloud, thank you.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.480
Theyíll call it the Dark Cloud cover.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.480
They need a new Dark Cloud game.

12:18.480 --> 12:27.480
Anyways, so there was an interview with Iwata, and he was talking a little bit about the

12:27.480 --> 12:32.840
state of Nintendo and a little bit about the releases, basically saying that theyíre going

12:32.840 --> 12:39.560
to see a brand new Mario, Metroid, and Smash Brothers game in í07, so all three of those

12:39.560 --> 12:41.640
games are probably coming around around Christmas.

12:41.640 --> 12:46.040
Theyíll make their big splash, but they are coming this year.

12:46.040 --> 12:53.520
At least thatís whatís planned so far, so donít be surprised if they move to next year.

12:53.520 --> 12:58.640
I know, dates under consideration, or dates subject to change, or whatever that crap is

12:58.640 --> 13:00.280
they always get away with doing to us.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
Soon.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.280
Theyíll be coming out soon.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.280
Soon.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.680
To be honest, whoís really surprised that Metroid Prime 3 or whatever is coming out

13:06.680 --> 13:07.680
in the fall?

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
They gotta have something for this Christmas.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.840
Whoa, I never thought that would be coming around Christmas.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.800
Tell me I can play it on the internet, and Iíll get tons more excited, seriously.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.120
Tell me I donít have to use friend codes anymore, and Iíll blow a load.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.680
Iíll be very excited.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.480
Anyway, this news made me about that excited.

13:27.480 --> 13:33.500
It really did, because this is one of my favorite, all-time favorite 80ís Commodore 64 games

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
ever.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.260
Itís Impossible Mission.

13:36.260 --> 13:40.120
This game is incredibly great for the Commodore 64.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.560
Iím sure itís one of those games that my memories of it are way fonder than the way

13:43.560 --> 13:46.760
the game actually is, so donít try to tell me any different.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.280
However, the important thing about Impossible Mission is that it is coming out on the Virtual

13:50.280 --> 13:51.280
Console.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Hereís the trick.

13:52.280 --> 14:00.760
Youíll notice itís a Commodore 64 game, or was a Commodore 64 game, but the rumors

14:00.760 --> 14:02.840
were that Commodore 64 was coming to Virtual Console.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.280
It is not simply a rehashed Impossible Mission.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
No, no.

14:06.280 --> 14:14.880
It is Impossible Mission with now updated mode with new graphics and all that stuff,

14:14.880 --> 14:18.840
so a new version of Impossible Mission with the retro one included.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.680
You can think a lot of those Xbox Live titles are kind of like this, but the interesting

14:22.680 --> 14:28.480
thing about this is that would make Impossible Mission the first Wii download title that

14:28.480 --> 14:33.400
is not simply some Nintendo game just copied over and resold.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.840
So thatís very exciting news.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.360
Iím almost more excited about this than I am ActRaiser finally freaking coming out here

14:38.360 --> 14:39.760
at some point.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.960
So Impossible Mission coming out soon.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.420
They havenít said when, but they are saying itís going to be the first.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.560
By the way, Impossible Mission also is coming to other regular platforms.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.440
Itís coming out to the PlayStation 2, the PSP, and the DS.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.240
Well, thatís pretty cool.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.600
Yeah, Iím so excited.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.440
Well guess whoís coming out to the UK Virtual Console?

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
Virtua Fighter 2!

15:05.440 --> 15:10.200
Sadly, however, it is the Mega Drive version.

15:10.200 --> 15:16.120
Yeah, which over here I do believe the Mega Drive was the Genesis.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.600
I know, itís going to be the crap version.

15:18.600 --> 15:23.480
And you know, I am not a fan of Virtua Fighter, you know, my husbandís a big Virtua Fighter

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
fan.

15:24.480 --> 15:29.040
Iím the Tekken girl of the house, but Virtua Fighter 2 made me cry, except that I did try

15:29.040 --> 15:32.560
the trick where you could hit Kage over and over and over again and knock off his mask.

15:32.560 --> 15:36.000
Fuck them both, Soul Calibur.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.440
Also though, right now thatís coming out this week for Virtual Console in the UK, now

15:42.440 --> 15:47.360
this makes me happy, is Wonder Boy and Monster World, which I would really love, because

15:47.360 --> 15:49.640
I actually do own that game.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.640
Very, very fun.

15:50.640 --> 15:57.500
Itís too bad that we donít have Master System games for Virtual Console, because I would

15:57.500 --> 15:59.800
love to have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.800
Yet.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.800
Yet.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.640
I want a new Daytona game.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.360
Is that so much to ask?

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Just for the theme song.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.440
I want any new Sega game to not suck.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.120
Is that too much to ask?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.260
So if I may continue.

16:15.260 --> 16:20.000
Also out is Shock Man, which was a PC Engine game.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.860
It was actually in the, let me start over.

16:26.860 --> 16:31.960
G-Bean Man series is called Shock Man, which is basically like, weíre going to be Mega

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
Man, but not really.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.200
There were a lot of PC Engine games that were like that.

16:36.200 --> 16:42.800
And then we have Atlas Kid and the Enchanted Castle, also a Genesis slash Mega Drive game,

16:42.800 --> 16:48.640
and like I said, Virtua Crap 2.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.200
I like Virtua Crap.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.760
Itís why I take in my Virtua toilet.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.320
Itís taking a shit in Second Life.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.240
Or PlayStation Home.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.400
Chat.org is not a strategy.com comments, Act Deft is cheering you on, Daytona on VC, Dark

17:02.400 --> 17:05.960
Tetsuya says, ìOh shit, yes Loki.î Completely pop-up?

17:05.960 --> 17:10.800
Well not on VC, Iím talking about a fucking brand new game, you know, like a redoing Sega

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
Rally.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
Who wants Daytona 2?

17:12.800 --> 17:19.040
I want a newer game, Daytona 3,000 million.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.320
Death Race Daytona edition.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.240
And PS, it doesnít suck.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.840
Yeah, and it doesnít suck.

17:24.840 --> 17:30.240
Anyways, so whatís actually pretty cool, and thank god that someoneís doing it, theyíre

17:30.240 --> 17:38.320
going to be giving out brand spanking real trophies for the leaderboards on Alien Hominid

17:38.320 --> 17:40.880
HD on Live Arcade.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
And these are so awesome.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.920
I mean that right there is an excuse to play the game.

17:44.920 --> 17:50.840
You get these nice shiny trophies and theyíre going to be doing that I guess every so often.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.800
Alien Hominid is awesome.

17:52.800 --> 17:53.800
I like the trophies.

17:53.800 --> 17:58.120
I think they should do that, or do something like the old Activision patches and stuff

17:58.120 --> 17:59.120
like that.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.680
Dude, the old Activision patches were so awesome.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.000
Why canít Microsoft mail achievements to me in jacket patch form?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Seriously.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.200
Well I think they should do that for completing a game, like getting all 1,000 achievement

18:11.200 --> 18:12.280
points or something like that.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
They should do that.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.120
I mean how expensive can this be to put out?

18:15.120 --> 18:19.040
They are charging me $60 for a goddamn video game, right?

18:19.040 --> 18:22.880
But maybe they, I guess because of rentals and stuff, maybe they want to make sure people

18:22.880 --> 18:24.120
actually own the game or something.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
I donít know.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.120
Maybe a little something special for actually owning the game.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.280
Because back in the 2600 days they didnít rent video games.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.800
I donít know.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
I miss that.

18:33.800 --> 18:38.240
One way that you might want to train for winning those trophies is playing other video games

18:38.240 --> 18:40.600
because video games are good for you.

18:40.600 --> 18:45.200
At least thatís according to Yahoo who this week ran a story about five ways that video

18:45.200 --> 18:48.600
games can make you better, stronger, and faster and I thought Iíd share those with you again

18:48.600 --> 18:50.320
coming from Yahoo.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.680
They can improve your eyesight is one.

18:53.680 --> 18:59.800
That was from a March 2007 study at the University of Rochester because it tested college folks

18:59.800 --> 19:05.200
and apparently after 30 hours of game plays the ones who played the games outperformed

19:05.200 --> 19:09.200
the ones who didnít play the games and their ability to accurately pick out objects in

19:09.200 --> 19:13.080
a cluttered space so they can play Whereís Waldo better.

19:13.080 --> 19:17.600
So if I sit close to a TV thatís supposed to ruin my eyesight, this will actually help

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
me as well.

19:18.600 --> 19:24.680
If I play a game on the TV and sit too close, itíll kind of wash.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.680
I donít know.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.160
Youíll have to run a separate study on that.

19:29.160 --> 19:36.680
Number two, they can help you focus and theyíre relating this to folks that have ADHD, they

19:36.680 --> 19:40.760
donít have the ability to focus and stuff and playing a video game forces you to focus

19:40.760 --> 19:44.040
but I beg to differ because I have gaming ADD.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.280
I never beat video games anymore.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.280
Seriously.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.840
I beat them for five hours and then get sick of them.

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
Itís sick.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.360
I think they mean not necessarily over long term.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.760
I think they mean for periods of time, not for long term.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.400
Thatís not gaming ADD.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.520
Thatís just called, this game is fucking boring.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.000
Iím sorry, what were you talking about?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.600
Oh, look a bird.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
To get the reference.

20:07.600 --> 20:13.640
They focus so much that they play and forget about their families and get divorces.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.440
Step number three, they can help you lose weight.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.320
And of course, DDR, Itoy Kinetic, Wii Sports.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.120
Or gain a lot of weight depending on which game it is.

20:23.120 --> 20:29.000
Number four, they can help you understand classic literature.

20:29.000 --> 20:38.000
For instance, Halo is being used by Roger Travis who is an associate professor of modern

20:38.000 --> 20:41.120
and classical languages at the University of Connecticut.

20:41.120 --> 20:50.760
And he uses the Halo story as some type of comparison to the Homeric epic, to his stories,

20:50.760 --> 20:51.760
the Homer epics.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.680
So, thereís a story to Halo?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.240
How does Halo sound like the Odyssey or the Iliad?

20:57.240 --> 20:59.560
Actually, specifically, I think heís citing Aenid.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.200
That was Virgil.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
That wasnít Homer.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.600
It was Virgil taking the inspirationÖ

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
What theÖ

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Yeah.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
Were there head shots in the Aenid?

21:08.600 --> 21:09.600
Wait, hold on.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.360
Iím going to read through this story here.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.960
The Aenid was by Virgil.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.360
What the hell is thatÖ

21:15.360 --> 21:16.360
Anyway.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.960
No, the story does say that.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.240
Well, then why did they sayÖ up here they say Homeric epicÖ

21:20.240 --> 21:21.720
Because it was inspired by Homer.

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
Okay, I get it.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.880
You want literature, you play Zenasaga.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.360
You want literature, you fucking read a book.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.600
How about that?

21:29.600 --> 21:33.960
And step five, they can literally save your life.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.960
And they are sayingÖ

21:34.960 --> 21:35.960
Trauma Center!

21:35.960 --> 21:38.720
Yeah, well, not just Trauma Center.

21:38.720 --> 21:44.720
The doctor, Dr. James Rosser of New Yorkís Beth Israel Medical Center says to his patients

21:44.720 --> 21:50.240
that heís awesome at Super Monkey Ball because his hand-eye coordination helps in surgeries.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.240
I donít want him to be a doctor.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.240
He co-authored a study.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.240
I know.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.240
Seriously, Iím moving to New York.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.280
There you go.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.720
Five ways that video games are good for you.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.440
Letís see, Iím looking into the chat room there.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.480
So would that be like, you know, ìHey, Iím a great proctologist.

22:05.480 --> 22:10.680
I practice a lot of Oonga Boonga.î I mean, come on.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.440
James Patrick defending Halo a little bit, Loki.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.520
Halo has a lot of story.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.880
A lot of it is just not in the game.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
I know.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.880
Itís called sarcasm.

22:17.880 --> 22:22.960
All right, then I wonít read the rest of his comment.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.480
Vandalous is making a Shakespeare reference saying, ìDo you bite your thumb at me, sir?î

22:26.480 --> 22:30.080
And I know why he did that because remember when we went miniature golfing with Vandalous

22:30.080 --> 22:31.080
the other night?

22:31.080 --> 22:32.560
We actually went to Golfland and golfed.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.480
Drunami was there, too, and I was out there quoting Shakespeare.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.800
I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.

22:38.800 --> 22:45.000
And like I think I actually impressedÖ I think I actually impressed William because

22:45.000 --> 22:53.600
he kind of looked over at me and he was kind of like, ìYou actually know Shakespeare?î

22:53.600 --> 22:57.520
And I also want to point out, you might want to turn your mic on once in a while.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.520
Fuck.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
Okay.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.120
I pointed out the best, though, Shakespeare fact of all in the play Hamlet.

23:02.120 --> 23:06.040
The word ìbungholeî isnít it?

23:06.040 --> 23:10.320
You were the type of girl that stayed after class to look up shit in the dictionary, werenít

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
you?

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
No, I was not.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.320
Because thatís what we did.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.160
I would stay behind to look up the entomology behind it.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.680
Disgusting.

23:20.680 --> 23:26.520
Originating from the Latin word ìscheitnau.î No, ìscheitî is the British deviation.

23:26.520 --> 23:33.560
And this is why Dark Sakura is in charge of the mailbag, because sheís very familiar

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
with shit.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
Yeah, thatís right.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.920
Sheís very familiar with shit, therefore sheís perfect for reading your emails.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.080
No, just kidding.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.080
We love getting emails.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.720
Itís part of what makes this show so special is that we have the interaction with our listeners,

23:45.720 --> 23:47.980
be it the Skype line, the chat room, or emails.

23:47.980 --> 23:51.920
So if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

23:51.920 --> 24:00.240
Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, and pull out some shitty email to read.

24:00.240 --> 24:06.600
Well the first email of the evening is sent to us by ion671, ìDear OLR guys and girls,

24:06.600 --> 24:11.600
I was looking at the screens for Eye of Judgment and while Iím not going to buy a PS3 for

24:11.600 --> 24:16.480
it some aspects,î anyway, ìthe fact that you can see your animated monsters in your

24:16.480 --> 24:19.560
hand on screen to me seems like a cool idea.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.720
Now developers just have to use it, maybe Iíll follow, too bad Nintendo doesnít have

24:22.720 --> 24:23.720
the camera.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.120
Seeing your Pokémon next to you on screen, think about it.î

24:27.120 --> 24:28.960
A good idea, yes.

24:28.960 --> 24:34.260
I admit when I first saw it at E3 I was kind of like, ìHuh, well thatís kind of neat.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.560
Is it a next gen system seller?

24:36.560 --> 24:40.800
No effing way.î Because seriously, I donít see why they couldnít have done this last

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
gen.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.640
Whatís so special about the Eye of Judgment, really?

24:44.640 --> 24:45.640
Nothing.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
Anyway.

24:46.640 --> 24:47.640
But I do like the idea of Pokémon.

24:47.640 --> 24:48.640
Pokémon Stadium!

24:48.640 --> 24:51.200
Do you know where that would be cool?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.200
Internet play!

24:52.200 --> 24:55.280
Wouldnít that be kind of cute to play on the internet and like you could actually have

24:55.280 --> 24:56.280
your Pokémon?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
Oh no, look at my Pokémans!

24:57.280 --> 24:58.280
Look at my Pokémans, Jamie!

24:58.280 --> 24:59.280
Let me show you them!

24:59.280 --> 25:04.720
My Pokémans brings all the boys to the yard and theyíre like, ìI got Charizard!î Anyway,

25:04.720 --> 25:05.720
whatever.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.040
Sorry, I totally fucked up that one parody.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.680
But yeah, fail.

25:09.680 --> 25:14.640
But the problem is Nintendo will never embrace internet gaming so that will never, ever happen.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.120
But nevertheless, itís a cool theory.

25:17.120 --> 25:24.640
Anyway, the next email comes from our friend overseas that wrote us last week, from Matt.

25:24.640 --> 25:25.640
ìHey, Orange Dones Radio.

25:25.640 --> 25:30.560
Iím writing you this week to answer the question posed in Part B of your podcast last week

25:30.560 --> 25:32.960
about the European and Bemani community.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.660
I can say that where I am, it is alive and well, although I wouldnít describe it as

25:36.660 --> 25:38.440
thriving like California.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.180
Finding a machine here in Italy is pretty difficult unless you go to a bigger city like

25:42.180 --> 25:43.400
Milan or Torino.

25:43.400 --> 25:48.960
The arcade culture that is so fragile and dying where we come from kind of never existed

25:48.960 --> 25:52.560
here, as cultural phenomenon video games are really frowned upon.

25:52.560 --> 25:57.140
Unless you were playing Winning Eleven, then you were automatically labeled as ìSfigato,î

25:57.140 --> 25:59.480
the Italian equivalent of a nerd.

25:59.480 --> 26:04.600
That being said, where you do find machines, theyíre always in immaculate condition and

26:04.600 --> 26:06.480
have a sizable community around them.

26:06.480 --> 26:11.280
The vibe I get from the European scene is like it was for me in 2002 in Tennessee.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.880
Websites like DDR Freak are communities of that nature, but everyone by name who plays

26:15.880 --> 26:17.280
regularly and thatís pretty cool.

26:17.280 --> 26:21.320
By the way, DDR Freak was around in 2002 because I was a moderator in 2002 when it was NorCal

26:21.320 --> 26:23.960
only on the green board.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.680
He said that itís not like it is in California, right?

26:28.680 --> 26:29.960
Where the machines are all torn up and dirty?

26:29.960 --> 26:34.600
I was going to say, I guess the perception of what the Bemani scene is like here must

26:34.600 --> 26:39.000
be different over there because Iíll tell you, go look at the DDR Freak like NorCal

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
SoCal forums.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Itís a lot of retrospective posts about how the community used to be.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.640
What was the last great DDR tournament you went to, DarkSakura?

26:48.640 --> 26:49.640
B3.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.360
Then how many years ago was that?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.360
Actually, the one I ran.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.520
And how many years ago was all this though?

26:54.520 --> 26:55.520
Couple years.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.040
It was within Orange Arms Radioís history.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.040
I think it was in 2003?

26:58.040 --> 26:59.040
2003.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
Yeah, it was ë03 is when B3 happened.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.120
That was a long time ago.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.200
Itís just not what it used to be.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.400
I donít know how else to phrase it.

27:07.400 --> 27:13.080
Either I got old or the game got old, I donít know, or both.

27:13.080 --> 27:19.520
So I would say itís not thriving in California, although I donít know.

27:19.520 --> 27:23.120
You do see folks playing the game, like when we were at Golf Land, I saw some kid playing

27:23.120 --> 27:26.860
the game and he looked pretty good and he had a little nickname that he put in the machine

27:26.860 --> 27:30.400
and everything and he probably posts on some of those DDR communities, but I donít know.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.440
I donít see the community like we used to.

27:32.440 --> 27:38.160
Remember, we would go to Golf Land, we would literally pitch a tent behind those machines,

27:38.160 --> 27:41.520
having the birthday cake or whatever was going on that night, sitting around.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.960
It was a real community.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.720
I donít see that like I used to.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.720
I donít know.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.680
Well, thereís a P.S. to this.

27:48.680 --> 27:52.920
My terrible typo in the last email should have read as ìIt never fails to please.î

27:52.920 --> 27:55.920
As Iím in Italy, my English is obviously not in the best of use.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.920
Somewhere in that dark place between ìnever fails to pleaseî and ìnever disappointsî

27:58.920 --> 28:00.840
the abortion of a sentence was formed.

28:00.840 --> 28:05.120
Thankfully, your proud line of judgement caught it and you guys made a funny joke out of it

28:05.120 --> 28:06.280
too.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
We knew it was.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.920
I always play with everybody.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.360
Yeah, Dark Sakura is an equal opportunity bitch, actually.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
Iím not.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.360
Hearts.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.120
No, Iím just, whenever the opportunity hits me.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.480
Just especially to foreigners because she hates British people, right?

28:22.480 --> 28:25.040
No, I want to move there.

28:25.040 --> 28:29.000
Dear British listeners, send me a ticket, please, and Iíll rub you.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.280
Well, she just wants to stalk David Tennant, but anyway, next email.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.120
No, I donít want to stalk David Tennant.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.800
I want to go drinking, anyway.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.120
With Billy Piper and then hope something happens.

28:40.120 --> 28:44.200
No, sheís pretty, but not my type, anyway.

28:44.200 --> 28:49.960
Next email comes from Necky, speaking of one of our listeners from the UK.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.940
Dear OLR, howís you?

28:51.940 --> 28:54.440
Last weekís ìDonít give a shitî episode was amazing.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.480
Be sure to get Warrior Bob back on as he is really cool.

28:57.480 --> 29:01.920
Also after hearing the whole Sony God of War goat fiasco, I was left feeling a little horse

29:01.920 --> 29:02.920
giggle.

29:02.920 --> 29:15.880
Jamie, Dead and Furious, Iíve heard of this game about two months ago, my home site dscommunity.co.uk,

29:15.880 --> 29:17.720
and it really doesnít look like that great.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
Have you seen the screenshots?

29:18.720 --> 29:21.480
Personally, I donít like, but youíre open to your opinion, though.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.920
On the theme of dead, touch the dead.

29:23.920 --> 29:28.120
That guy works in a fucking plug for his website every time he sends us an email, and Jamie

29:28.120 --> 29:30.520
falls for it every time, I just like to point out.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.360
No, I donít fall for it, I actuallyÖ

29:32.360 --> 29:36.320
No, itís cool, Iím all for promoting the indie website, so Iím just giving this guy

29:36.320 --> 29:39.040
a hard time, because he works it into every email.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.920
Itís cute.

29:40.920 --> 29:41.920
Okay.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.200
Oh, Lord of the Rings Online is a bitch.

29:44.200 --> 29:48.240
My mate has been trying to install it on his Vista since the day it was released.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.240
With Rob saying the game sucks kind of influences my decision.

29:51.240 --> 29:57.320
Worth it or not, nothing left to say except the new Guitar Hero 2 song packs kick ass.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.200
Oh hell yeah, they do.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.280
Why bye, Nicky.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.920
Oblivion is so my game at the moment, played at loads.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.560
Oh, Oblivion is incredible.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.320
Anyway, I just wanted to say, if you want to try Lord of the Rings, itís actually really

30:08.320 --> 30:09.320
easy.

30:09.320 --> 30:13.000
All you have to do is you can go to any computer store and you can get a trial disc for like

30:13.000 --> 30:17.940
two dollars, except the only problem is itís labeled ìWorld of Warcraftî, because the

30:17.940 --> 30:20.600
game rips it off in every single way.

30:20.600 --> 30:26.680
Rob, first of all, UK, second of all, theyíre trying to install it on Vista and itís not

30:26.680 --> 30:27.680
working.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.040
Well, you can play World of Warcraft on Vista and Iím pretty sure they have the same trial

30:30.040 --> 30:32.480
thing in the UK, because you can download them now.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.800
But I mean, itís different than World of the Rings.

30:35.800 --> 30:40.160
Iím just trying to say, Lord of the Rings is not fun and I already played it when it

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
was called World of Warcraft.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
Let them judge for themselves.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
Fine.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.280
And when you, why are you listening to this show?

30:45.280 --> 30:46.560
You want me to judge it for you.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
It sucks.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.280
If you beg to differ, email nasty things to us.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
Just email.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.640
This comes from Ospher, looks like somebody new.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.400
I wasnít a drunk, Ospher.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
I promise.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.400
Thatís Ospher, not Ospher.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
Iím sorry.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.400
Yo, this is Ospher.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.440
I just wanted to say that I love this show.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.960
You guys are sort of like a radio version of Attack from the Show, Attack of the Show

31:06.960 --> 31:10.520
from G4TV.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.440
We know you meant it as a compliment, so weíll take it that way.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.440
Okay.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.940
Actually, you know what?

31:15.940 --> 31:18.080
When I met Kevin Pereira, he was really cool.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.120
I canít say anything negative about the people on that show because they are really talented

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
and all that jazz.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.440
Itís just what that entire network has become that is sad.

31:27.440 --> 31:32.520
I watched G4 the other day because I was watching Cheaters at like 2 in the morning.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.520
So email, huh?

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
Sorry.

31:34.520 --> 31:38.320
Anyway, I just wanted to know, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky, how good are all of you at DDR and

31:38.320 --> 31:39.320
BeatMania?

31:39.320 --> 31:41.560
Personally, I suck at BeatMania, but I still love the game.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.920
As for DDR, Iím fairly decent.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.920
When it comes to difficulty, Iím able to do 10 furtors, footers like Max Unlimited

31:47.920 --> 31:52.480
getting a grade of B, and Zephyr Oni getting an A. As for my perfect attack, it needs work,

31:52.480 --> 31:56.760
but Iím not able to AAA anything in the arcade, yet Iíve triple Aíd lots of songs on Heavy

31:56.760 --> 31:58.640
at home.

31:58.640 --> 32:05.080
For me, I actually was pretty far up there, and then if youíve been listening for a while,

32:05.080 --> 32:11.080
I developed chronic fatigue syndrome after having pneumonia for three months, and since

32:11.080 --> 32:15.160
then Iíve fallen out of practice with DDR, so Iím building it back up now.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.920
Iím actually back up to seven furtors, sort of.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.960
I just get really, really, really exhausted really easily.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.480
I used to be pretty good at DDR, especially when we started this show.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.240
I was beating nines regularly.

32:28.240 --> 32:32.080
I didnít ever quite have the stamina to clear a lot of tens.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.240
I could clear bag, but I couldnít really do the max 300, so thereís just too much

32:36.240 --> 32:37.240
stamina.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
I think I got bag once.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.800
But my perfect attack was good.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.240
I actually triple Aíd quite a few seven and eight furtors in the arcades, and I actually

32:43.240 --> 32:47.120
would participate in tournaments, and I came in fourth place in a couple of them.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.800
Thatís as high as I ever got is fourth place, but to me thatís still a pretty decent showing

32:50.800 --> 32:51.800
for me.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.040
I was very proud of myself.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.920
But I suck now, but I donít have a good excuse like Jamie.

32:55.920 --> 33:01.320
My excuse is I got fat, and that makes me not so good at DDR anymore.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.680
Yeah, I lost all my stamina.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
I used to be good.

33:04.680 --> 33:10.000
I used to be able to do hard catas and even my wonderful edits on doubles all the time,

33:10.000 --> 33:15.440
and now I can do, you know, sevens and eights and stuff, but it really kicks the crap out

33:15.440 --> 33:16.440
of me.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.740
Itís just I donít have the stamina for it anymore.

33:18.740 --> 33:23.600
If I played all the time, you know, maybe, you know, just had a DDR machine in my house

33:23.600 --> 33:25.300
or something, thatíd be different, but.

33:25.300 --> 33:29.120
I got really lazy with Beatmania, though, after not having a reliable machine to play

33:29.120 --> 33:33.680
on because we were playing 2DX7 style for a long time when we had it at Scandia.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.680
Eight.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.680
Eight.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.360
In Beatmania, I went from crappy to really crappy.

33:38.360 --> 33:44.600
But I was, I had actually just started beating seven stars because you were there when I

33:44.600 --> 33:48.920
beat Nine Oí Clocks and what was the Eurobeat one?

33:48.920 --> 33:49.920
Monkey Dance.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.920
See, but hereís the thing.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.920
Hereís the thing.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.920
Seven stars isnít as hard as they come anymore.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.600
So, weíre like dating ourselves in bimani terms, you know.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.000
Yeah, but I used to keep a list of all the seven stars Iíd beaten and stuff, but now

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
itís.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.640
You remember when I used to have memorized my list of nine footers back in the day?

34:03.640 --> 34:04.640
I know.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.640
I know.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.640
Again, weíre all talking back in the day.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.920
I love Beatmania 2DX, itíll always be one of my favorite games ever and itís one of

34:09.920 --> 34:13.240
my favorite music games ever even to this day, but the series has just gotten old for

34:13.240 --> 34:14.240
me.

34:14.240 --> 34:18.360
Itís what, in its 14th version now and how much has the game changed?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
Not at all.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.360
And Iím just kind of bored of it.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.360
I donít care about 2DX anymore.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.360
Iím sorry.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.140
Well, there is another bit more to this email.

34:25.140 --> 34:28.480
Also when it comes to DDR Supernova 2, where the hell is the info?

34:28.480 --> 34:33.720
By this time last year, we practically knew most of Supernova 1ís song list.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.960
Why do you think Konami is keeping this under wraps?

34:35.960 --> 34:37.720
Thanks for reading, Oscar.

34:37.720 --> 34:42.760
And yeah, they actually tried to keep it under wraps last year, as far as I was aware.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.120
I hope they do keep it under wraps.

34:44.120 --> 34:48.160
I hope itís like Max 2, where we didnít see that shit coming until it was there.

34:48.160 --> 34:49.160
That made it exciting.

34:49.160 --> 34:50.160
I want a surprise.

34:50.160 --> 34:56.200
And extreme, or not extreme, but you know, Supernova is like, hereís everything, and

34:56.200 --> 34:57.380
itís just not exciting.

34:57.380 --> 35:03.160
I would totally love, though, to have like an unlock system the way that Max did.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.000
You know, to have stuff come out over time, which encourages people.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.360
The more that you play, the sooner youíre going to get stuff coming out.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.120
I think that that would be really fun.

35:12.120 --> 35:17.440
You know, do you remember how we would congregate around the machine and say, okay, we have

35:17.440 --> 35:20.800
to do this many more until we get our next song?

35:20.800 --> 35:28.280
Iím telling you, DDR needs a card system in the US, and it needs something more battle-y.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.880
It needs to become a more competitive game.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.360
Thatís how the game could evolve, but no oneís listening to me.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.920
And battle mode, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is not enough, because itís

35:35.920 --> 35:36.920
not the focus of the game.

35:36.920 --> 35:41.120
Thereís a PS of this, it says, ìI donít consider myself to be that great at DDR yet.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.120
Why?

35:42.120 --> 35:48.720
Iíve met Mega Man X, and he lives pretty close by here in Northeast Ohio.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
You know what?

35:49.720 --> 35:54.800
I donít really think, this is my opinion on gaming, especially in a competitive sense.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.880
Why make a competition of it?

35:56.880 --> 35:58.440
Why just not have fun?î I agree.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.480
Why not just have fun with it?

36:00.480 --> 36:04.160
You know, I remember reading, actually, you know Foxtrot, right?

36:04.160 --> 36:13.280
The Sunday comic in the paper, and how the little girl was trying to make a paper airplane

36:13.280 --> 36:15.480
or something, and her dadís like, ìOh, let me show you!

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
Donít you want to have the best?

36:16.480 --> 36:20.840
Donít you want to be this?î Sheís like, ìNo, I just want to have fun.î

36:20.840 --> 36:26.640
And no offense to this guy or his ego, but I have no idea who that guy is, he just said.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.640
I donít know who that is.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.640
Neither do I.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.640
I have no idea.

36:29.640 --> 36:34.440
Iím not sure heís nice, but Iím good at DDR, apparently, but I donít, you know, heís

36:34.440 --> 36:35.440
not that famous.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.440
Of course, neither are we.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.160
Of course, Iíve got to open up the usual can of worms.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.160
Guess what?

36:41.160 --> 36:45.920
The other game had a battle system that was actually pretty decent in the groove.

36:45.920 --> 36:49.320
Guess who saw that up?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.320
I disagree.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.520
I think In the Groove was the same damn game as DDR.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.520
Itís just a different wrapping.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.600
Guess what game had a battle system?

36:56.600 --> 36:59.680
That mania, guess which one, you know, became In the Groove.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.680
I do not want to have this debate again.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
Fuck.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.680
ìHey Jamie, just made a quick email to say pump up the volume rocks.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.480
Whatís your favorite class in Ragnarok Online?

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
I like acolytes.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.080
I did have a super acolyte, but I played assassins.

37:12.080 --> 37:17.840
I actually managed to get an assassin cross on one of my free servers.

37:17.840 --> 37:22.400
Still youngest listener who wants to blow shit up and hopes you get eaten by a group.î

37:22.400 --> 37:27.880
When I played Ragnarok Online, I played an acolyte who had a bow in his hair because

37:27.880 --> 37:29.880
he was cute and pretty.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.080
That was my wallpaper on my phone for a long time.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.080
Thatís great.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
I played a battle acolyte.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.320
I donít know how much they suck.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.080
Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

37:39.080 --> 37:44.760
We look forward to hearing from you.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.120
Back into some game news now.

37:46.120 --> 37:52.040
Anyways, so, you know, this isnít a big surprise I think because video games live usually performs

37:52.040 --> 37:59.400
at most of these big industry events, but, anyways, video games live will be performing

37:59.400 --> 38:05.920
around the same time as the E4ALL convention in October and, of course, will feature a

38:05.920 --> 38:12.800
wonderful mix of music from a bunch of different games and should be performing at the Nokia

38:12.800 --> 38:19.320
Theater around October 19th, so thatís actually pretty cool.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.320
I donít know why.

38:20.320 --> 38:24.720
I actually really want to go to E4ALL even though Iíve heard the talk about itís nothing

38:24.720 --> 38:26.960
more than a glorified EB Games, but I donít know.

38:26.960 --> 38:31.880
I just kind of want to go to that atmosphere and, obviously, the opportunist in me sees

38:31.880 --> 38:36.680
it as a great promotion opportunity for our show, but I just kind of want to go and check

38:36.680 --> 38:37.680
it out.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.680
I think it would be fun.

38:38.680 --> 38:45.380
The other thing too, to be honest, it sounds a lot more exciting than the E3 this year.

38:45.380 --> 38:51.000
Even looking at E3ís show for plans, stuff like that, itís like, ìWow, yeah, thatís

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
awesome.î

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Well, you know, the E3 wasnít supposed to have the glitziness this year, and Iím sure

38:55.000 --> 38:59.880
weíre just a little bitter for not getting invited, which is true, but I donít know.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.840
Iím kind of excited about E4ALL.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.640
I think I definitely want to go.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.320
I hope we all can go.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.480
That would be fun, but weíll see.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.000
Weíll see.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.120
Anyhow, some controversy going on this week with Blizzard, of course, itís earlier been

39:16.120 --> 39:21.120
said that they are going to be announcing a new game on May 19th, and, oh my God, is

39:21.120 --> 39:22.120
this blown up.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.320
Honestly, I donít know who to believe, because folks are saying, ìOh, leaked, itís StarCraft,

39:26.320 --> 39:30.080
the MMO, itís the StarCraft MMO thatís coming out, itís World of StarCraft,î even though

39:30.080 --> 39:32.560
that name would make no sense at all, because itís more than just a world.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.560
Drew, why are you twitching?

39:33.560 --> 39:35.300
And I donít think they would do that.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.300
You know why?

39:36.300 --> 39:37.300
Why?

39:37.300 --> 39:38.300
Compete with World of Warcraft.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.300
Drewís twitching.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.880
Number one, we donít need another MMO from Blizzard.

39:43.880 --> 39:50.040
Number two, I know competing with yourself is actually good for business sometimes, but

39:50.040 --> 39:52.520
I donít think it would be such a good idea here.

39:52.520 --> 39:59.040
And, of course, just adding fire to this rumor, Vivendi was giving a presentation to Wall

39:59.040 --> 40:04.800
Street and said, ìAll Blizzard franchises will become MMOs,î which strikes me as hilarious,

40:04.800 --> 40:08.940
because to me, and I know Blizzard fans are going to get pissed, but honestly, to me,

40:08.940 --> 40:14.280
World of Warcraft does already feel like World of Diablo to me, honestly, like the game plays

40:14.280 --> 40:18.400
very similar to me, so I donít know what the big deal is, but whatever.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.820
But then Blizzard quickly responded to that, ìThe rumor is not true in regards to Blizzard.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.960
We believe the rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of

40:25.960 --> 40:30.840
information provided to industry analysts.î Bottom line, you donít know shit until May

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
19th.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
Period.

40:32.840 --> 40:38.000
Youíre going to hear every rumor under the sun, you wonít know for sure until May 19th.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.320
Personally, personally, I think itís Starcraft 2.

40:41.320 --> 40:46.540
And thatís not an MMO, not an MMO, I think itís just Starcraft 2, the way the Starcraft

40:46.540 --> 40:48.840
fans want their sequel to Starcraft.

40:48.840 --> 40:52.460
It damn well better be Starcraft 2.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.000
I would be happy with that.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.840
All right, so there you have it, weíll see what happens when the big announcement is

40:58.840 --> 40:59.840
made.

40:59.840 --> 41:05.140
Well, speaking of big announcements, and this is actually a very, very big announcement

41:05.140 --> 41:12.320
to me personally, is that one of our gaming legends, well, I should say legends in game

41:12.320 --> 41:19.480
making, Don Bluth, who brought us, you know, Dragonís Lair, is working on a Dragonís

41:19.480 --> 41:26.840
Lair movie thatís a prequel to Dirk the Daringís whole ordeal outside of the Dragonís Lair.

41:26.840 --> 41:34.120
So hopefully it actually will legitimately have a tie-in and be, you know, a little bit

41:34.120 --> 41:37.760
better than, you know, Dragonís Lair 2 was.

41:37.760 --> 41:43.680
Dragonís Lair 2 was the acid trip game, Iím so sorry.

41:43.680 --> 41:47.760
But there better be like gruesome, gory, skeleton deaths in it, thatíd be really awesome.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.760
Awesome.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.560
I donít know how I feel about the Dragonís Lair franchise being milked to death 20 years

41:53.560 --> 41:54.560
past its prime.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.080
At least itís not, I hope itís not going to be as awful as the old cartoon was.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.520
Yeah, I donít know, I donít know how I feel about this.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.260
I mean, in the end, I will judge based on the product thatís delivered, but, you know,

42:03.260 --> 42:07.600
I donít know, I only have so much love for Dragonís Lair in my heart.

42:07.600 --> 42:12.600
And believe me, I do have a lot of love, I completely loved the Commodore 64 version

42:12.600 --> 42:15.600
of the game, if for nothing else, but I thought the music was some of the best soundtracks

42:15.600 --> 42:19.240
like ever in an 80s game, but yeah, I donít know.

42:19.240 --> 42:24.680
Speaking of 80s cartoons, you probably heard this week that they put up the first episode

42:24.680 --> 42:28.960
of the 1980s version of the Pac-Man cartoon on Xbox Live Marketplace.

42:28.960 --> 42:29.960
Really?

42:29.960 --> 42:30.960
Yeah.

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
I did not hear that.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
Itís for a free download too.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
Yeah.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
Already?

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
Already.

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
Holy shit, I missed that.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.960
I want to check that out.

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
Itís kind of cool.

42:38.960 --> 42:39.960
I thought that was funny.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.720
The Rob Dean chat says, ìDragonís Lair franchise.î It wasnít a franchise, it was one arcade

42:43.720 --> 42:44.720
game that was innovative.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.720
WellÖ

42:45.720 --> 42:46.720
Two arcade games.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.920
Yeah, there was a sequel, because they had the sequel at Golf Land, and there was a sequel

42:50.920 --> 42:54.800
on the Commodore 64 too, and then there was Space Ace, which some people kind of consider

42:54.800 --> 42:56.400
a part of that series, even though itís not.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.400
Brain Dead 13?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.400
You know what I mean?

42:58.400 --> 42:59.400
So anyway.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.400
What about Brain Dead 13?

43:00.400 --> 43:01.400
What about it?

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
It was an awesome game.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.400
It was an awesome game.

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
Okay, if you say so.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
Anyways.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.720
So, no else is an awesome game.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.720
Resident Evil 4.

43:08.720 --> 43:12.960
And of course, itís coming to the Wii in a port of sense.

43:12.960 --> 43:18.840
Itís going to be coming out though for a low, low price of $29.95.

43:18.840 --> 43:25.320
And pretty much, you know, the GameCube or PlayStation 2 version with tacked on Wii controls,

43:25.320 --> 43:28.760
and going to have the bonus content that was also available on the PlayStation 2 version

43:28.760 --> 43:29.760
as well.

43:29.760 --> 43:37.640
So, if you think thatís worth $30, then definitely worth picking up.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.640
I donít know.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.640
Well, I donít know.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.200
I mean, like, maybe Iím the only person on the planet that didnít buy this game for

43:42.200 --> 43:45.480
the GameCube or PlayStation 2, because I played my friendís copy.

43:45.480 --> 43:46.480
So I donít know.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.760
Iím actually kind of interested, because it was a fun game, and I think with the Wii

43:48.760 --> 43:51.360
controls it would be, you know, really fun.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.480
So for $30, itís not a bad deal.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.480
Itís a good game.

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
Are you going to get it?

43:57.480 --> 43:58.480
Anybody else?

43:58.480 --> 43:59.480
Iím not buying it.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.480
I donít know.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
All right.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.480
Letís see.

44:02.480 --> 44:10.280
One more story for you guys, and then weíre going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

44:10.280 --> 44:17.520
GamePro ran a story this week called, ìThe 10 Worst Selling Game Consoles of All Time.î

44:17.520 --> 44:24.960
I donít think this was done by actual sales figures, but it says, ìHere are the 10 worst

44:24.960 --> 44:31.320
selling consoles of all time in terms of high-profile systems that stood a viable chance.î

44:31.320 --> 44:32.560
The Fairchild Channel F.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.000
Well, Iím actually going to name the 10 systems.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.840
I want to know how many of these you actually own, Dark Sakura.

44:37.840 --> 44:41.960
First off, those of youóokay, Iím assuming none of you have read this story yet.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.720
If you havenít read the story yet, what would you guess is number one, the number one worst

44:45.720 --> 44:47.040
selling console of all time?

44:47.040 --> 44:48.120
The Fairchild Channel F.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
The Fairchild Channel F.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
I donít know.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.120
What would you say, Drew?

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
The Jaguar.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
The Jaguar.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.120
Loki?

44:54.120 --> 44:58.040
I would actually say the Neo Geo.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.040
Okay.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.040
All right.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.040
Jaguar, Jaguar, Neo Geo.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.600
I already know, so I canít answer.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.920
Virtual Boy says Frisbee in chat.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.600
Master Systems says GS68.

45:06.600 --> 45:07.600
All right.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
Letís see.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.840
Number 10, the Dreamcast.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.520
I own two of them.

45:12.520 --> 45:17.080
The Dreamcast sold only 10.6 million units during its short three-layer lifespan only.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.080
Yeah.

45:18.080 --> 45:21.520
I want to know how many of these systems Jamieís owns, by the way, in their house.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.520
All right.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
What do you want to say, Loki?

45:23.520 --> 45:29.480
Oh, I was just going to say, hopefully, Sony can beat 10.6 million units in three years.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.760
Letís see.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.880
Number nine, the TurboGrafx-16.

45:33.880 --> 45:36.520
I have a Turbo Duo and a PC Engine.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.720
Number eight, the Saturn.

45:37.720 --> 45:38.720
I have two of those.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.160
I have three.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.560
You guys are nerds.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.120
Number seven, the Sega CD.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.420
I have three.

45:44.420 --> 45:46.980
No love for Sega on this list.

45:46.980 --> 45:48.720
How do you have three Sega CDs?

45:48.720 --> 45:49.780
Isnít one enough?

45:49.780 --> 45:51.440
I have a drawer loader and two side loaders.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.000
Actually, no, I think one of our side loaders was broken.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.480
Fucking nerd.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.320
Number six, the 3DO.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.000
Hell no, I have taste.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
I played a 3DO.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
I know.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
I played one once in the Sears.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.440
I havenít bought a CDI.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.440
Number five, I believe, was the Virtua Boy.

46:08.440 --> 46:09.520
Number five was the Virtua Boy.

46:09.520 --> 46:12.640
I have one in one of those hard cases.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.440
Drew says it never had a chance.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.480
It never had a chance, and believe me, I own one.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.480
It never had a chance.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.840
I actually do own one, and they call them the great red migraine machine.

46:21.840 --> 46:27.000
The amazing red seizure machine of death with a horrible controller.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Oh my God.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
It was a decent controller.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.240
No, it was a horrible controller.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.800
Number four, the CDI.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.800
No.

46:32.800 --> 46:33.800
You donít have that?

46:33.800 --> 46:37.400
No, because it had those shitty not-Zelda games on them.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
But it had Myst, too.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.000
I could play that on PC.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.080
Five hundred and seventy thousand units sold to the CDI.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.000
Number three, the Atari Jaguar.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
No.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.840
The only reason I would ever want one, though, is for Tempest.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.120
And thatís exactly what the story says.

46:50.120 --> 46:53.480
The system had Tempest 2000, but every other game was garbage.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.120
Sold 250,000 units.

46:56.120 --> 46:59.160
Number two, the 32X from Sega.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
You do have that?

47:00.160 --> 47:01.160
I have two 32Xs.

47:01.160 --> 47:04.760
And you agree with it being the number two worst-selling console of all time?

47:04.760 --> 47:05.760
Selling has nothing to do with that.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.920
Itís more of an add-on than a console.

47:07.920 --> 47:13.520
Okay, by their terms, sold versus hype is a fair entry on the list.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.540
Iím surprised that Picoís not on here.

47:16.540 --> 47:18.960
Here it is, the number one.

47:18.960 --> 47:22.160
It is not the Neo Geo, although that was a good guess.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.360
I canít believe that wasnít on here.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.360
Itís one of the ten.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.400
The number one, the Apple Pippin.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.800
I do not have a Pippin.

47:27.800 --> 47:32.120
The Pippin was made between Apple and Bandai, which is funny, because thereís a lot of

47:32.120 --> 47:34.560
people who have always said, ìApple should get into gaming.

47:34.560 --> 47:38.500
Apple should get into gaming.î But Apple did get into gaming in í95 with Bandai.

47:38.500 --> 47:42.280
They launched their system for six hundred bucks, and this is in í95.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.160
See, I figured that the Neo Geo for sure would be up there, because it wasnít their game.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.880
I donít remember how much the system was, but the games were like a couple hundred bucks,

47:48.880 --> 47:49.880
werenít they?

47:49.880 --> 47:51.200
Yeah, but you get arcade perfect games.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.200
Woo-hoo!

47:52.200 --> 47:54.280
Hey, you know what, itís been worth it.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.600
Iíll buy an arcade cabinet then.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.600
I mean, seriously.

47:56.600 --> 47:57.600
You know what, itís been worth it to me.

47:57.600 --> 48:01.920
I actually, you know, I can sit down and play my Samurai Showdown 2, and on top of that,

48:01.920 --> 48:04.040
with no region lockout, you have no problem.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.440
After a while, some of the games go down in price.

48:06.440 --> 48:12.480
You know, we can pick up some of the classics, you know, Magician Lord and, you know, all

48:12.480 --> 48:13.480
kinds of games.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.480
I have GameTap.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.480
Magician Lord and GameTap.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.760
Yeah, but keep in mind, I had this, you know, five years ago.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.400
I know.

48:21.400 --> 48:25.840
Forty-two thousand units sold of the Apple Pippin, and always makes PC Worldís worst

48:25.840 --> 48:28.920
tech products of all time lists.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.640
Good job, Apple.

48:30.640 --> 48:31.640
We salute you.

48:31.640 --> 48:34.160
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.720
If you want to feed back on the worst console youíve ever played, or really anything in

48:37.720 --> 48:43.240
general, weíll take your calls right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype,

48:43.240 --> 48:48.360
if you want to call us that way, because our 800 number is only toll free in the U.S. and

48:48.360 --> 48:49.360
Canada.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.400
You can also call us on Skype.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.080
The username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.240
Letís go to the phones and take some calls.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.920
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:56.920 --> 48:57.920
Whoís this?

48:57.920 --> 48:58.920
This is Dark Tetsuya.

48:58.920 --> 48:59.920
Hi, Dark Tetsuya.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.920
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

49:02.920 --> 49:07.120
Oh, I just got an announcement I had to make.

49:07.120 --> 49:12.600
Announcements, announcements, announcements, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die,

49:12.600 --> 49:15.560
a horrible way to talk to death, a horrible way to die.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.040
Who never sang that at campfire, huh?

49:17.040 --> 49:18.040
I never sang that.

49:18.040 --> 49:20.040
I never went to camp.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.360
All right, never mind.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.240
Iím hoping somebody in chat knows that song.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.240
All right, DT, whatís the announcement?

49:25.240 --> 49:31.100
Well, okay, what would you say would be your two biggest fans?

49:31.100 --> 49:42.720
Our two biggest fans, you know, before you were on staff, I would have said you, but

49:42.720 --> 49:47.000
you write for the site now, so I canít say you, Dark Tetsuya.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.360
Definitely Misty.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.360
Probably well.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.360
Apparently.

49:52.360 --> 49:55.800
Oh, do I, maybe Misty and, well, letís see, Ramaís an op.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.320
Well, Mistyís an op, too.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.320
Maybe Misty.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
Well.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.320
All right, well.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.320
Anything.

50:01.320 --> 50:02.320
Youíre doing it wrong.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.320
All right, why?

50:03.320 --> 50:04.320
Give me your goddamn announcement.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.320
Iím getting to the point.

50:05.320 --> 50:06.320
All right.

50:06.320 --> 50:15.320
Well, as of about two weeks ago, during guys on my show, she asked me out.

50:15.320 --> 50:19.480
Ooh, like asked you out on a date or what?

50:19.480 --> 50:20.480
Whatís going on?

50:20.480 --> 50:21.480
Yeah.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.480
Sweet.

50:22.480 --> 50:27.760
So, wait, so youíre saying that some of the biggest fanboys and girls know all our history

50:27.760 --> 50:29.200
are hooking up?

50:29.200 --> 50:30.200
Yeah.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.680
This is a scary day in Orange Lawnís radio history.

50:32.680 --> 50:36.680
This is a very scary day, and this radio station might have that effect on people.

50:36.680 --> 50:42.480
Weíre going to crash Guys on a Show, and weíre planning on it in November.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.400
Wait, youíre not going to crash the real show?

50:45.400 --> 50:46.400
This show?

50:46.400 --> 50:47.400
Yeah.

50:47.400 --> 50:51.480
Guys on the Show is just kind of the, you know, Guys on a Show might be canceled by

50:51.480 --> 50:52.480
November.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.200
I donít know if you can crash a show like that.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.200
Itís kind of like beating a dead horse.

50:56.200 --> 51:00.320
You should come back to Guys on a Show so we can play what weíll be having for dinner.

51:00.320 --> 51:05.240
No, no, no, crashing Guys on a Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.

51:05.240 --> 51:07.240
All right.

51:07.240 --> 51:12.960
That is like the worst and the best analogy at the same time.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.960
I really donít know what to think of that.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.920
It would be like pissing in an ocean of denwiser.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.920
Oh, God.

51:18.920 --> 51:19.920
All right.

51:19.920 --> 51:23.880
Well, congratulations, and keep in mind, Artisia, if you should start having relationship troubles,

51:23.880 --> 51:29.280
thereíll be a new advice show coming to the station soon to help you out.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.880
So put Rice Princessís number on speed dial.

51:31.880 --> 51:36.240
And congratulations, and I hope things work out for you guys.

51:36.240 --> 51:39.960
I hope she makes you some of her arts and crafts because sheís so funny because she

51:39.960 --> 51:42.120
finds OLR inspiration.

51:42.120 --> 51:45.680
And like Iíve got these random messages from her like, ìI was at the 99 cent store and

51:45.680 --> 51:52.200
I saw these orange things and they made me think of the station.î Sheís cute.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.960
Get some OLR beats from her.

51:53.960 --> 51:54.960
Oh, yeah.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.960
All right.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.400
Well, DarkTit Show, yeah, anything you want to comment on the news going on this week

51:58.400 --> 51:59.400
in gaming?

51:59.400 --> 52:00.400
Oh, man.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.400
I donít know.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
Not really.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
I just had that.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.400
Yeah.

52:04.400 --> 52:08.400
Itís kind of a slow news week, isnít it?

52:08.400 --> 52:09.400
All right.

52:09.400 --> 52:12.520
Thanks so much for your call and, you know, good luck and everything.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.520
Yeah.

52:13.520 --> 52:14.520
Okay.

52:14.520 --> 52:15.520
Have a good night.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.520
All right.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.520
You too.

52:17.520 --> 52:18.520
Bye.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.520
I like that he calls it.

52:19.520 --> 52:23.280
Itís really not a lot of what I say about gaming.

52:23.280 --> 52:27.440
TheRobD says, ìGuys on the show, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î Can somebody

52:27.440 --> 52:33.400
put that as an iTunes review actually for this show since Guys on the Show isnít a

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
podcast?

52:34.400 --> 52:38.600
Because like when we make that request for people to make five-star reviews in iTunes

52:38.600 --> 52:42.360
with these stupid little things we come up with, people have actually been doing it.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
Itís great.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.200
Weíre up to like 41 reviews in the store and we love each and every one of them.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
You guys are awesome.

52:48.200 --> 52:51.320
Well, you just got up to go pee.

52:51.320 --> 52:52.320
Weirdo.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.800
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

52:55.800 --> 52:56.800
Look at this.

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
Legend of Zaku.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.800
Have youÖ

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
Using his pimp voice.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.960
Have youÖ Hey, have you gotten with any OLR women recently?

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
No.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.520
Actually, I think Zaku is one of our biggest fans too.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.200
Youíve been listening to us a long time, havenít you?

53:10.200 --> 53:11.840
I think over three years now.

53:11.840 --> 53:12.840
Three years now.

53:12.840 --> 53:13.840
Jesus, go outside.

53:13.840 --> 53:14.840
Iím just kidding.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.840
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
Outside today.

53:16.840 --> 53:22.840
Yeah, justÖ just drinking on Saturday, Cinco de Mayo, playing drunk TDR.

53:22.840 --> 53:23.840
Thatís whatÖ

53:23.840 --> 53:25.840
Drinking beers, beers, beers.

53:25.840 --> 53:33.680
In these three years, I used to sometimes go, ìOh, boy, here comes a Zaku call.î But

53:33.680 --> 53:38.040
now I kind of look forward to the Zaku calls because, man, Zaku just tells it like it is,

53:38.040 --> 53:39.040
you know.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.040
Yeah, Cinco de Mayo is going to get fucked up.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.560
Youíre going to be having Dave and Busters in your city.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.840
Do you know why we celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

53:44.840 --> 53:47.840
Mexican independence, even though Iím not Mexican.

53:47.840 --> 53:48.840
Beer.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.840
I know.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.840
Beer.

53:50.840 --> 53:51.840
And drinking and lots ofÖ

53:51.840 --> 53:52.840
Beer thatís not called Corona, please.

53:52.840 --> 53:56.480
Werenít you likeÖ please donít be offended if I get this wrong.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.480
Werenít you like Peruvian?

53:57.480 --> 53:58.480
Yes.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.480
Oh, I got it right.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
Yeah, Iím awesome.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
Okay.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
Sorry.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.480
Anyway.

54:03.480 --> 54:04.480
All right.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.480
Go ahead.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
Yeah, justÖ just chilling that day.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.840
Just, you know, just gettingÖ trying to get a buzz off of, you know, Corona with a shot

54:09.840 --> 54:10.840
of rum inside there.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.840
Thereís a video game story in here somewhere, right?

54:12.840 --> 54:18.160
Yeah, and justÖ and just trying to, likeÖ just trying to play DDR after two drinks

54:18.160 --> 54:19.160
after Margarita.

54:19.160 --> 54:22.320
But, yeah, and then just today, just watching Spiderman 3.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.320
Nothing much.

54:23.320 --> 54:27.120
I mean, everyÖ really had thatÖ really didnít have that much of a weekend.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.960
So youíre calling into the show tonight just to tell us this or what?

54:29.960 --> 54:30.960
What do youÖ

54:30.960 --> 54:31.960
No, thatÖ

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
Okay.

54:32.960 --> 54:36.360
That and basically Supernova 2 location test getting canceled, but thatís no big deal.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.560
Thatís what I wanted to ask you about, because you called into the show last week to talk

54:39.560 --> 54:40.560
about this.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
I know.

54:41.560 --> 54:45.720
One week I say itís actuallyÖ itís on and the other week itís not on.

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
All right, soÖ

54:46.720 --> 54:48.680
Yeah, Iím notÖ itís not going to botherÖ itís not bothering me.

54:48.680 --> 54:53.440
I can understand Konami just taking a look at the, you know, look at themselves as developers

54:53.440 --> 54:57.880
and realizing that, you know, they really want toÖ they probably, you know, for all

54:57.880 --> 55:01.760
we know, they probably might be spending the time just making it better.

55:01.760 --> 55:05.320
Because youíre making another Frogger game.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.760
Because you realize you and the rest of the internet will tear this game a new butthole

55:08.760 --> 55:09.760
if it sucks.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.760
Well, theyíve already did.

55:10.760 --> 55:12.920
I mean, theyíre already prejudging as we speak.

55:12.920 --> 55:15.600
Theyíre already saying that, ìOh, LoL is not going to get released.î

55:15.600 --> 55:16.600
I understand as a developerÖ

55:16.600 --> 55:17.600
In the groove is better.

55:17.600 --> 55:20.440
Why the fuck did you get rid of in the groove?

55:20.440 --> 55:21.440
I meanÖ

55:21.440 --> 55:26.080
As a developer, I understand that if you release a piss-poor product, youíre just going to

55:26.080 --> 55:27.200
piss people off further.

55:27.200 --> 55:32.000
So you want to prevent that by spending more time trying, you know, trying to make something

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
really presentable to the masses.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.800
I keep forgetting youíre a developer now.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.720
And you developed for cell phone games, huh?

55:37.720 --> 55:38.720
Yeah.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.960
Itís the toughest job in the industry, my friend.

55:40.960 --> 55:46.520
And we go through a lot of, you know, we had a lot of features during the development process.

55:46.520 --> 55:50.320
Even though weíre close to shipping, thereís always like one or two big features that we

55:50.320 --> 55:56.880
usually try to get on before, you know, they try to make the application better.

55:56.880 --> 56:04.120
Well, you know, yeah, I mean, itís got to be internally tested to hell before theyíre

56:04.120 --> 56:05.440
going to do an open test.

56:05.440 --> 56:09.520
So theyíre probably going to, for all we know, they could be implementing new features,

56:09.520 --> 56:13.600
adding more songs to make it a worthy location test.

56:13.600 --> 56:15.600
We donít want this game to get bubble bobbled.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
Right.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
Yeah.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.600
All right.

56:18.600 --> 56:22.400
Anything else, Zaku, before we go to another call?

56:22.400 --> 56:25.440
Just make sure to tell your arcade to get 2DX Gold.

56:25.440 --> 56:28.760
We really, because if you donít, in the next few weeksÖ

56:28.760 --> 56:32.400
Zaku, my local arcade is a golf land.

56:32.400 --> 56:36.800
Yeah, the chances of, you know, of actually being released in this country are getting

56:36.800 --> 56:38.800
slim at this point.

56:38.800 --> 56:44.280
So I urge all my Bimani brethren to please get out there, get your arcade to pick up

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
Gold.

56:45.280 --> 56:48.360
Zaku, I would love to, but my local arcade is Roseau Golf Land, where video games go

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
to die.

56:49.360 --> 56:50.360
I will, howeverÖ

56:50.360 --> 56:51.360
Yeah.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.360
Get Dave and Busters to do it.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.360
Iíll get the bowling alleyÖ

56:53.360 --> 56:54.920
Get Dave and Busters to do it.

56:54.920 --> 57:00.960
They have the biggest purse, so if they buy for all their locations, thatíll be pretty

57:00.960 --> 57:01.960
big.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.960
But that should make some sort of impact.

57:03.960 --> 57:04.960
All right.

57:04.960 --> 57:07.200
All right, Zaku, thanks so much for the call.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.200
Good luck.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.200
All right.

57:09.200 --> 57:10.200
Later.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.200
I hope the 2DX campaign works.

57:11.200 --> 57:16.520
Rob D. in chat says, ìOkay, my iTunes review has officially been changed from ìOLR, your

57:16.520 --> 57:21.960
source for the gamer lifestyle,î to ìOLR, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î

57:21.960 --> 57:22.960
Beautiful.

57:22.960 --> 57:26.560
Because I want people to look at the iTunes reviews and go, ìWhat the fuck is this show?

57:26.560 --> 57:29.720
What the fuck is this show?î I better download this show and check it out.

57:29.720 --> 57:30.720
See?

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
Reverse psychology works every time.

57:31.720 --> 57:34.840
And then they realize that youíre just scamming them and they stop it.

57:34.840 --> 57:35.840
Exactly.

57:35.840 --> 57:38.400
Well, hey, you guys said it.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.400
Hi, youíre on Orange Song Radio.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.400
Whoís this?

57:41.400 --> 57:42.400
Hey, whatís up, guys?

57:42.400 --> 57:43.400
Itís Totion.

57:43.400 --> 57:44.400
Hi, Totion.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.400
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

57:45.400 --> 57:49.120
To just have another reference to another Wednesday-related show, I went shopping this

57:49.120 --> 57:50.120
weekend for games.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.880
I had quite a couple.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.480
You went shopping this weekend for games.

57:53.480 --> 57:55.200
What did you buy?

57:55.200 --> 58:00.960
I went to a big chain store and they had a sale, so I picked up both Phoenix Wright games.

58:00.960 --> 58:04.240
I got Card Fighters DS, unfortunately.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.240
Sucker.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.240
Shut up!

58:06.240 --> 58:10.240
Itís a good game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

58:10.240 --> 58:13.520
Except for the fact tható Itís true, but none of us knew about the

58:13.520 --> 58:15.440
bug until somebody found it.

58:15.440 --> 58:16.440
Is it still in the wrapping?

58:16.440 --> 58:17.440
You can take it back.

58:17.440 --> 58:18.440
Donít worry.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.240
Theyíre probably going to offer a return program where you can send it back to SNKs.

58:21.240 --> 58:23.920
Theyíll wait six weeks for a replacement copy.

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
Yeah, I know.

58:24.920 --> 58:28.280
Theyíll probably get another free copy of Metal Slug something.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
Whoop-de-doo!

58:29.280 --> 58:32.840
Speaking of which, the Game Boy Advance in Metal Slug still hasnít come out yet and itís

58:32.840 --> 58:35.360
been in development for like months, almost a year now.

58:35.360 --> 58:36.360
Metal Slug forever?

58:36.360 --> 58:37.360
Yes, almost.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.360
All right, sorry, Toshin.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.360
Go on.

58:39.360 --> 58:42.760
Well, I picked up Metal Slug Anthology, so thatísó

58:42.760 --> 58:43.760
For the Wii?

58:43.760 --> 58:44.760
No, for the PS2.

58:44.760 --> 58:45.760
Thatís all right.

58:45.760 --> 58:46.760
Do you have a Wii?

58:46.760 --> 58:47.760
You donít have a Wii, do you?

58:47.760 --> 58:48.760
No, I donít.

58:48.760 --> 58:49.760
I was about to sayó

58:49.760 --> 58:50.760
Knock it off!

58:50.760 --> 58:52.400
Drew, I meant the system.

58:52.400 --> 58:53.400
Grow up.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.400
God.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
This is a Wednesday, man.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.400
Jeez.

58:56.400 --> 59:00.920
I know, I know, this isnít Wednesday, but Drewís in the pee-pee-poo-poo mentality of

59:00.920 --> 59:01.920
those jokes.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.920
See me for the afterbirth.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
For real.

59:04.920 --> 59:10.120
Anyway, I wasnít going to say, okay, so you donít have a Nintendo Wii, but you have a

59:10.120 --> 59:11.120
PS2.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.560
What of these games have you played so far?

59:12.560 --> 59:14.120
Have you played them all?

59:14.120 --> 59:16.520
Iím working on Phoenix Royale 1 right now.

59:16.520 --> 59:17.520
Itís pretty good.

59:17.520 --> 59:18.520
All right.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
Itís pretty good?

59:19.520 --> 59:23.120
Yeah, I mean, it took me a year and a half to get a copy, for crying out loud.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.760
I didnít find a copy anywhere.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.760
All right.

59:25.760 --> 59:26.760
Any other games?

59:26.760 --> 59:28.880
I like Metal Slug a lot.

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
I love Metal Slug anyway.

59:29.880 --> 59:31.200
Itís just a fun game.

59:31.200 --> 59:35.480
Please explain the draw of Metal Slug, because I know Jamie tries very hard, but Matt and

59:35.480 --> 59:39.560
I still tease her, so youíve got to tellóyouíve got to stick up for Jamie here a little bit.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.800
Whatís the draw of Metal Slug?

59:41.800 --> 59:46.960
Itís just old-school, run-aroundóitís likeóyou like Contra, donít you, Rob?

59:46.960 --> 59:47.960
You like 8-bit stuff.

59:47.960 --> 59:48.960
Yeah, I like Contra.

59:48.960 --> 59:55.960
I think itís just like Neo Geoís version of Contra, with better sprites andó

59:55.960 --> 59:59.080
Itís not that I donít understand the draw of Metal Slug.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.800
I donít understand why itís got to be on PlayStation 2, on the Xbox, on the 360, on

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
the Wiió

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800
Yeah, I donít understand that.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.880
Why do they have to re-release it 7 billion times?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880
Yeah.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.800
Why, hello there, Bust-A-Move, which we were talking about earlier in the program.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
Exactly.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.320
Oh, God, yeah.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.280
You know, now that I think about it, SNK kind of sucks.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.960
I mean, like, sometimes they really, really suck.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960
I mean, likeó

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
Does it all suck?

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.960
The N in SNK stands for suck, or you see, I donít know.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Itísóugh.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960
What?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960
Sorry.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.960
The N stands for suck?

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960
Yes.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.120
Hooked on phonics, worked for me.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.320
Yeah, no.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.440
O-L-R, the L stands for suck.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440
S-M-R-T.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440
No, yeah, that would be it.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.920
O-L-R, the L stands for smart.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
God.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:58.160
Sorry, I just drooled everywhere and laughing.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.640
Send those blocks of Crayolas care of Rob.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.120
Sorry, I had a secret meeting with Ken Kutaragi this week.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.120
What can I say?

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.560
You jumped ship again?

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.240
Even the entire chat room was like, ìWhat?î

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.240
Train wreck.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.400
All right, anyway, sorry.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.880
Yeah, your callís derailing this show, Toshin.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880
We need to wrap it up.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880
Any other thoughts?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.960
If Iím derailing the show, get back on the train.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960
All right.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:33.920
Itís like, you know, Toshinís call is the microwave waves to Robís pacemaker, is basically

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920
what it is.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920
Hey, at least Iím doing something right.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920
What?

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920
I think.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920
What did you say?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.760
At least Iím doing something right, I think.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760
You think?

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.760
Yeah, youíre derailing this show.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.760
Itís the right thing to do.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760
No.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760
Remember, we donít give a shit anymore.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760
All right, Toshin.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760
Oh, yeah, that.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.400
Yeah, thanks so much for calling, Toshin.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400
Have fun with the games.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400
All right, later.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400
Thanks.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.960
You know whatís funny about that phone call is he really wasnít calling to comment on

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.120
any news or anything going on.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.240
He was just kind of like, ìHey, guys, I bought some games this week.î But we love those

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240
types of calls.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.120
I forgot to mention, I played Super Paper Mario this week.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120
Oh, what did you think?

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120
Well, itís pretty fun.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120
Iím just going through the games slowly.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.520
Itís too fucking easy, though.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.040
Like, the puzzles arenít that hard.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040
For now.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.280
I think the difficulty ramps up a lot later on.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280
More calls!

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.280
Hi, youíre on Orange Lawnís Radio.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280
Whoís this?

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280
Hey, whatís up?

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.920
Itís the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. Whatís on your mind?

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
Not too much.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.920
Youíre really quiet tonight for some reason.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920
I donít know.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920
The D doesnít stand for suck.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
The D does.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920
Wait, what?

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
Youíre really, really quiet tonight for some reason.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920
Can you turn up your mic or anything?

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920
How about now?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
Is that better?

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920
A little better.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
Whatís on your mind?

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.640
I donít have a mic on my podcast, the G does.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.480
But either way, I just had a quick question for you guys about gaming.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.520
Alright, whatís up?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.320
By the way, that podcast youíre referencing, of course, this day in gaming, right?

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320
Yeah, definitely.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.000
Good, great podcast over on all games.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Check it out.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Alright, whatís the question?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.680
Well, you know, the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console both had a lot of time to

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.840
develop so far.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.680
Which would you prefer at this moment?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.360
I was having this discussion with one of my friends earlier in the week and I sided with

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.040
the Virtual Console just because I like the idea of having a lot of classic games that

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.720
are in their original form and are guaranteed to be good as opposed to the Xbox Live Arcade

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.120
where you do have a few good games on there and itís nice to have these extra features

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.120
but some of the remakes arenít that great and some of the games themselves arenít that

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120
great.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.760
But, but, and this is the big but here, the Xbox Live Arcade you can download free demos

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.480
and you can check out the game and see if it sucks before you actually have to buy it.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.640
The Nintendo system or the Virtual Console or whatever, the Nintendo games, Genesis games,

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.260
you may remember them, ìOh my God, those are so awesomeî and you download them, spend

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.120
your five bucks, whatever, and ìWow, that really sucked.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:53.000
Now itís just going to sit on my drive forever.î Also, I hate the way the shop is set up.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.360
Fucking running off of web pages with JavaScript is retarded and it should have been built

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.000
into the console anyways.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.160
And besides, I think the Xbox Live Arcade has a better selection right now and my God,

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.560
PlayStation Network put out something because one release a month isÖ

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.880
Notice how Rob D. didnít even mention them.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.880
Thereís a reason for that.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880
As far as XboxÖ

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.440
Well, I play Lemmings on the PC.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440
Iím sorry.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.440
Exactly.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.760
I played Lemmings on the PC like 15 years ago and itís just now coming out on PlayStation

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.760
Network.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.440
Anyhow, you know, I kind of have to side with Loki.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.680
I think Xbox Live, just the technology itself is superior because here it is.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.840
Nintendo wonít go online.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.560
Virtual console, I would give the trophy to in a heartbeat if I could play like Ice Climber

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.040
online with my friends.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.960
I know the technology is there.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960
Itís possible.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.960
You can do it.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.040
Lag is not an issue in this day of DSL and all this type of gaming, especially when you

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.400
can play Xbox Live games online.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.760
Why wonít Nintendo let me do this?

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:59.320
Thatís why I kind of hesitate in siding with Virtual Console because I love the fact that

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.680
on Xbox Live I can see what my friends are playing.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.640
I can compare scores.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.040
Go listen to Part A when I got mad at PK or Uno because he has a slightly bigger Boom

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.520
Boom Rocket score than I do.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.400
You donít get that on Virtual Console.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.440
Although Virtual Console in the terms of the games they offer, yeah, you know youíre getting

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.680
good shit because these games for the most part were quality games that came out many

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.880
years ago.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.720
I could go to Jamieís house and play that shit because she still has them all, right?

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:34.160
But all kidding aside, the only reason I pretty much download these is just something about

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
having them.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.600
They pretty much equate to impulse buys.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
I donít know.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.040
Yeah, I got to agree with you on most of those points.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.600
They are legitimate points that I would like to be able to play a timed demo or something

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600
on the Virtual Console.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.800
I donít see why Nintendo didnít do that.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.500
But to me, in my opinion, and this is why I do side with Virtual Console, the quality

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.520
of the average Virtual Console title, again, in my opinion, is much higher than the quality

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.520
of the average Xbox Live Arcade title.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.320
What Iíd really like to see Nintendo do though is bring over some of those games like Battle

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.480
of the Lagoon and some of those other games that didnít make it over here.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.240
Iíd like to see them translate those, localize those, and actually release them on the Virtual

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240
Console.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.240
Second Densetsu 3?

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.240
Please?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240
Exactly.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.640
Case point.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.640
There it is.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.640
If that does it, I think itís game set and mapped.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.640
Exactly, yeah.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:26.640
Second Densetsu 3 could single-handedly change my mind in all of this, but I donít know.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:33.440
I get irritated when I canít imagine the technology that Microsoft has developed is

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.440
that complicated.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.520
Itís merely ideas.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.520
Those ideas were out on the table a year ago, and yet, well, Sony, I donít know, theyíre

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
just crazy.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.200
I donít know why they havenít adopted this stuff, but Nintendo literally seems to be

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.060
saying, ìWeíre just better than that.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.520
We just donít want to do that because we want to do this whole other thing.î Although

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.760
I applaud some of the decisions they made with the Wii, I feel like theyíre living

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.240
in the 2600 era when it comes to online right now.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.560
Yeah, theyíve definitely got to do something with that for sure.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560
Itís horrible.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.240
Well, thatís all I got for you guys.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240
Well, Rob D., thanks for the discussion.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.200
It was definitely an interesting discussion and a good thing to talk about, so I appreciate

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.200
it.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
Not a problem.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200
Have fun with your show.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.200
You guys have a great show.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.200
See you later.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200
Will do.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200
Take care, buddy.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200
Thanks for the chat room.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.920
PK or Uno says, ìMy copy of iTunes is only giving me one review for the OLR podcast.î

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.080
Thatís a great point.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.160
I forgot to mention that only the US store actually has 41 reviews because the reviews

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.960
are separated by region.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.840
Last time I checked, there was one review in the Canadian store.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.560
I didnít see any in the British store or the Japanese store, but that might have changed.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.160
The reviews are based by region, so if you go to your iTunes store, hey, if youíre in

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.680
a foreign country, that just means we need your help even more, so if youíre in a foreign

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.080
country using their iTunes stores, please hype us up a little bit.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.080
Weíd appreciate it.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.080
Whoís this?

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:00.160
Hi, this is DMN, and no, Iím not living in San Francisco or New York.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:06.120
Wow, thatís a pretty blunt statement there because I thought we didnít talk about what

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.760
you did.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:15.360
Well, I figure this time I can since itís not really anything specific to the company.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.840
I havenít heard anything about this period up until a couple of people said, ìHey, are

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.000
you aware your companyís moving?î Iím like, ìHuh?î

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.280
Well, the way I read the story, it sounded like the sales department was moving, and

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.640
people are ñ I donít know if theyíre jumping to conclusions or if thereís just some evidence

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.960
I missed, but it seems like people are just kind of saying, ìOh, all of Nintendoís moving

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.520
because the sales department is moving.î

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:45.760
I think thereís some jag off in the gaming media whoís just trying to spawn a story.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760
Itís a total rumor.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:53.800
I think that certain companies should decide to move to Sacramento instead of San Francisco.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.880
Real estate is a lot cheaper, and I need another job, a better job.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.320
You just want to stalk me, Loki.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.480
I just want a better job.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.880
Okay, so thank you for clarifying that.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.080
You havenít booked travel to San Francisco or New York any time soon?

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080
Not for business.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.600
For prostitution, on the other hand, thatís a different story.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.160
I know what this is about, but we canít talk about this on the air.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.560
DMN, anything else you want to share with us then?

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.880
Completely taking this card in another direction.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
God damn it.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.280
Spider-Man 3 sucked.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.680
Did Spider-Man 3 suck, Dark Soccer?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.320
I didnít get that opinion from any of you.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.680
Most of it did, but all the parts with Mary Jane in it sucked.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680
I didnít see it.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680
I canít say it.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680
I donít want spoilers either.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680
No, I will agree with you.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.880
Kirsten Dunst was about as good as acting to let them move to the song.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.680
I loved Kirsten Dunst.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680
Shut your mouth.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.640
I kept wishing so hard that Mary Jane would die, and then why was Gwen in the movie at

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640
all?

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.960
Sheís heard no point.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.400
She was there to piss off Mary Jane, and I personally like seeing Mary Jane pissed off.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.040
That movie made me hate Toby Maguire even more.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.880
Emo Boy.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.080
I love Kirsten Dunst.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.280
Did you never see Drop Dead Gorgeous or The Virgin Suicides or The Interview with the

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Vampire?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280
Hello.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.800
Granted, things changed obviously in the movie and stuff, but I laughed because I never really

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.400
was into the comics for Spider-Man.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.320
But I laughed when they were talkingónow, this is how nerdy I amóI was watching a science

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.320
of Spider-Man 3 like these people were debating on how this actually could happen.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.240
But they were talking about how Gwen Stacy died in the comics or whatever, how her neck

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.240
snapped.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.440
And in the first movie, it was actually MJ and stuff, and he caught her and saved the

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.920
gondola and stuff.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.880
But I was really hoping they would kill MJ that way.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880
Spoilers!

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.480
Yeah, please, spoiler-free.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.160
Itís been out for years now.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160
Screw you.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.160
Oh, no.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160
Sorry.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.160
I thought you guys were talking about the third movie.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.160
No, I was talking about the first movie.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160
Okay, my bad.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.280
No, I was just saying I was hoping that her neck would snap in this movie.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.960
Iíll see it at some point.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:05.240
Again, Iím waiting for the teenagers to go away.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.160
Anything else, DMN?

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Did you play any gamesó

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.320
MCSU 20 is this week, and we have our third guestóor, our third host, as we do every

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.920
10 episodes, Kevin the Groove, will be our third host this week, so donít miss it.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.920
Good times.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.120
Hey, any actual games youíve been playing this week?

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.560
No, itís been a rough week, so I havenít really gotten a chance to play any games.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.080
All right, well, then I expect a phone call next week with a full report.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.400
Weíll see what happens.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400
All right, sounds good.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400
Take care, DMN.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400
Later.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.400
Later.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.400
Bye.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.560
And you donít want to move to San Francisco anyway.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560
The traffic sucks.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.000
All right, thatís it foró

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.640
Especially with all those freaking tanker trucks exploding on the freeways.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.120
Oh, God, that whole mess.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.640
I havenít even tried to drive to San Francisco since that happened.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.560
Iíve heard that thereís just a big chunk of the freeway missing now, like theyíve

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.800
cleaned it up and stuff, but thatís going to take months to fix.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800
Yeah.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.800
I mean, I drive by there all the time, and Iíve used that 80 to 880 interchange quite

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.440
a few times, because Iíve gone to South Bay, you know, like Hayward and stuff.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.680
I have friends in Hayward, but thatís about it.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:08.280
Iíve never used that one that actually collapsed, because thatís how you get from SF to Oakland.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.280
This is where Super Mario Kart technology would come in handy, because all you have

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.240
to do is put one of those boost panel downs and a little, you know, a little jump there

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.560
and boom, youíre done.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.440
You can clear that gap no problem.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.760
Oh, Loki, you kill me.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.120
Alright, well thatís about going to do it here for another episode of Orange Lounge

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.440
Radio, but not before I ask for any last minute stories.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440
But of course!

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.480
Thereís some interesting stuff coming out of San Francisco today actually.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.320
The Play First Person Shooter has premiered tonight, and itís kind of going into a story

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:49.040
we talked about a little bit earlier about how people are blaming video games for school

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.280
shootings and stuff like that, and itís kind of their commentary on that.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.720
So it should be pretty cool.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.800
Itís like I want to see that play, because itís really not that far away, but at the

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.800
same time I donít.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800
Does that make sense?

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.440
I mean, I feel like itís like, you know, so what, itís a play about video games, big

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440
deal.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.440
Exactly.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.860
Itís just something for the bloggers to write about.

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:11.400
And talk about in the realm of ridiculous, but you know, the way things are going, who

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.400
knows.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.580
Apparently thereís been some investigation.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:22.520
Two Belgium papers were reporting that police were investigating a virtual rape that happened

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.000
in Second Life.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:34.160
So where else, I mean, basically, insert joke here, do I even have to try tonight?

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.640
I mean, goddamn you Second Life fans are getting shit on tonightís show.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640
Iím so sorry.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
What?

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.080
Obviously you canít get any in his first life.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.520
But it begs the point, Regina Lynn over at Wired said, ìPsychologically, the upheaval

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.320
of virtual rape isnít anywhere near the trauma of real rape, and I canít see us making virtual

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.280
rape a matter for the real-life police.î

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:04.400
If personally, if it were me and someone said, ìYeah, this guy just raped me in my video

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.960
game,î Iíd probably hang up on them.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.880
Theyíd be like, ìI donít give a shit.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.280
Why are you wasting my time?

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:17.840
Weíre coming down their rescue.î ìI just got raped in a video game!î No, if they start

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.520
treating this shit as real, itís just like the whole taxing people on virtual commerce.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.800
Or that kid who got taken away from making the map of his school.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.680
Itís just people.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.360
Itís not real.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.720
Itís not real.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.480
Itís a fucking video game.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.180
They make money in the video game.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.720
You canít tax them on that.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.920
Or if youíre going to tax them, it has to be on game money, not real money.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.680
And no, you shouldnít be able to tax them on it.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.480
Anyways, moving on a little bit here, DDR.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.400
Counting the schools in Scotland.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.640
So that should be pretty cool, seeing that itís catching on in other places.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:59.360
For the Simpsons video game, they have a counter now, counting down the video gameís release

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.160
or release info on the launch.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.240
They have a mock site thatís making fun of Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240
So thatís pretty cool.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.200
It says 22 on there.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.480
And letís see, what else weíve got here.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.920
The people behind the wonderful game Puzzle Quest are actually making a new space-themed

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.880
game called Galactrix, and Iím talking a little bit about that.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.080
But it looks pretty cool.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.240
Theyíre trying to make sure that itís not just a Puzzle Quest clone.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.800
And thatís it, pretty much.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.000
Alright, anything from you, Miss Dark Sakura?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.160
One time, I fed my snakes some beer.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.080
It cleared this way and that.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.800
It was all fucked up!

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.200
Thank you for taking the IQ level of our show down a couple notches.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.000
Itís always good to be humbled like that.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.840
Oh, thereís, I was going to talk about some stupid rumors that I read.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.160
Actually, this was funny though.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.640
Remember they banned some sort of theme on Xbox Live?

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.880
The sexy girl theme or something like that?

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880
Sexy girl theme.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.720
I donít know if itís sexy girl, but yeah, itís some girl weird.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.840
Girls youíll never have theme.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.080
Itís something like that.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.720
I thought that was funny.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.680
That and how people are saying that the next PlayStation model is coming out in 18 months.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.600
Yeah, never going to happen.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600
Thatís all.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.160
Alright, letís go around and get everybodyís final thoughts.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.000
Drew, Nami, thanks so much for being here again.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
We appreciate you.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Youíve been missing a little while.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.120
Uh, yeah, Iíve been doing some entertaining in the chat room.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.600
Alright, I apologize.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.040
We were actually originally, we were thinking about doing a match game tonight.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.400
Miklotov was trying to, he said heíd stay for the show if he could, we would do a match

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.440
game tonight.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.520
But then we just did a match game like three episodes ago, so weíre holding off on match

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520
game.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.920
Will you come back for maybe the next match game or next dumb little game we play here

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
in studio?

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920
Sure.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920
Alright, sounds good.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.400
Um, Loki, your final, oh wait, did I give you your final thought?

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400
Iím sorry.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
I want pie.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Thank you.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400
Loki, your final thought.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.720
Uh, Super Mario, or Super Paper Mario, I was going to say Super Mario RPG.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720
Itís actually pretty cool.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.640
A little easy right now, but Iím only on the third level, so.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640
But I like it.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.400
It, itís, itís growing on me.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.800
I like, there is, there is a funny part, and itís kind of a spoiler a little bit, but

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.920
in one of the third levels, um, thereís a power-up you can get that turns you into a

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.240
giant version of 8-bit Mario, or whatever, and so you can go smash through stuff.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.840
Well, you go through this warp pipe, and a turtle sees you, or Koopa Troopa, and grabs

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.240
the same power-up and turns into a giant turtle, and starts chasing after you.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240
Oh, thatís cool.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.600
And you have the power-up and then stomp on it, and itís kind of funny.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.320
I just thought a little stuff like that is pretty cool.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.320
Yeah, that gameís cute.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.120
I need to play more of that game.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:55.440
Uh, my final thought is, um, Jamboreau, Boran, donít shoot fire in my face anymore, please,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.200
fucking ride, Dark Sakura.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.520
Tired.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:07.840
Alright, I want pie, it has no sugar.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.000
