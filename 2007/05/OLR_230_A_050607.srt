00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:25,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, May 6, 2007, another DS game has the Bubble Bobble curse of brokenness, Microsoft locks down on region control, and an old Commodore 64 classic returns to the Nintendo Wii.

2
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:39,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that video game podcast dedicated to gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:45,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

7
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,081
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers?

8
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:49,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

9
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:52,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll leave it at that then, I guess.

10
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,906
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm goofy.

11
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:56,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a good week?

12
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of.

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,788
[SPEAKER_01]: The parts that I wasn't at work were okay.

14
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

15
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:06,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I will when I quit, because then I'll be working full-time as a massage therapist, which means I'll be working 13 hours a week, making $60,000.

16
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:07,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, don't rub it in.

17
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:31,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my job, I do, but, you know, that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy, like, you know, it's a very exhausting job, what I do, so, you know, I enjoy that time when I get to come home.

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And even massage therapy, I know that's really exhausting, because I remember when you were doing your test thing on me, you were, like, breaking out in a sweat when you were done.

19
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:39,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

20
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, all you did was talk.

21
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how cold it is.

22
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:43,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just because you're so hot and sexy.

23
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:46,985
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Tech Master Loki with his smart-ass mouth as usual.

24
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:47,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

25
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

26
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:50,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my wrist, you see?

27
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:54,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I have swelling on my wrist again.

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:03,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I know part of it was because I was so hot and sexy, but I did not know that DarkSakura touching my butt would make her break out in a sweat.

29
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and say this.

30
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:12,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, giving an hour massage is an aerobic workout as well as strength training.

31
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:15,838
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually burn close to 320 calories doing an hour of massage.

32
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't surprise me when you stop to think about it.

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:24,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh yeah, when I give other people massages, you're doing... Why do you think I was fucking eating whatever I wanted to while I was in school?

34
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:30,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was giving our massages at least four times a week, especially when I was doing my finals.

35
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR not needed for you.

36
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:32,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no.

37
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm like, I've only been doing a couple of massages.

38
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:36,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go play DDR.

39
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:36,704
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

40
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:42,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's another smart-ass voice in studio tonight, and that could only belong to the one and only Drew Nami is back tonight.

41
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Boys and girls, say hello to Drew Nami.

42
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:44,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

43
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:45,546
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

44
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm all right.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

46
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:58,836
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and we're here in Orange Lounge Radio's chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but I noticed my chat room hasn't updated in a few seconds, which might mean... Yep, I just got disconnected.

47
00:02:58,897 --> 00:02:59,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

48
00:02:59,377 --> 00:02:59,798
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

49
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:00,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Live radio.

50
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:01,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

51
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pinged out a chat.

52
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:04,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, boys and girls, what can you do?

53
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:14,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live Sunday nights at OrangeLaunchRadio.com where we run a fully functional 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station with other awesome programming.

54
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:17,878
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, DarkSakura has a show she calls Pump Up the Volume.

55
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes.

56
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just call it crap.

57
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And Travis Donovan has a cool little sci-fi show on Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live.

58
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:28,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And brand new shows being piloted right now.

59
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't say too much more.

60
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you that have been listening on Wednesdays know about it.

61
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,943
[SPEAKER_03]: But those of you that don't...

62
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:34,598
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

63
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.

64
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play some more Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and then Dan took the game back.

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, like, fucking funny to play it with Deadpool.

66
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I've been doing.

67
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:16,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was supposed to get my Pokemans, but my husband didn't pull through for me and bring me my Pokemans.

68
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:17,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Fired!

69
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:18,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

70
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to trade him in for a more attentive model.

71
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,153
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love... What?

72
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you make it sound like you're trading Pokemans.

73
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:33,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to trade a level 32 Dan for level 69 boobs.

74
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

75
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:35,966
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

76
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll trade in my Dan for your Drew Barrymore.

77
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:42,188
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

78
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,489
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're David Tennant.

79
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:44,970
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

80
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,470
[SPEAKER_01]: But no.

81
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:54,814
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's... I've been listening to other people talk about their Pokemans and I want to show you mine.

82
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:57,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have mine yet.

83
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:02,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been playing, I've been really, really fucking pissed off at Twilight Zone.

84
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:04,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pinball.

85
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:10,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Twilight Zone is awesome, and I can get in the zone, and then it's like, you're in the zone, Drain!

86
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:11,615
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

87
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:12,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to have multiball!

88
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:13,536
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Drain!

89
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:14,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch.

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan finally fixed our little problem we had on our Guns N' Roses.

91
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Snyder is in chat.

92
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle's been listening to us for a while, and of course we know him from the DDR days.

93
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,666
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Pokemon is dead to me.

94
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering what happened.

95
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:32,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You should let me show you my Pokemans.

96
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

97
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why.

98
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, Kyle, is Pokemon dead to you?

99
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,369
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks have been eating this game up.

100
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been bringing a lot of people back into the series.

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some longtime fans feel it's just a little too much.

102
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:43,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a new Digimon game.

103
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people still play this damn game?

104
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:47,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

105
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:50,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, we added more monsters that look awesome.

106
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar to the other ones!

107
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:53,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it again!

108
00:05:53,916 --> 00:06:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer Tigerclaw, by the way, I've been... Buy our new Color of DS or something to go along with it.

109
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:15,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Tigerclaw, I've been playing on PlayStation 3, but we've decided to purchase the Xbox 360 version so that, number one, I don't have to fuck with the stupid 6-axis, and number two, we have more controllers already, so I can actually have multiplayer in my house.

110
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Snyder simply says, I got bored of Pokemon.

111
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,821
[SPEAKER_03]: SpiceWorld was fucking funny.

112
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a shitty game out of it too.

113
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, the Spice Girls video game is the best party game ever on the PlayStation 1.

114
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:53,557
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've ever played the Spice Girls game, it is so horrible.

115
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, oh my god, the funniest thing ever.

116
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:01,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the girls, you choreograph dances, and all the girls can do their dance.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we made Stupid Spice.

118
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the blonde one.

119
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,042
[SPEAKER_03]: We call her Stupid Spice.

120
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:12,926
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did is we would have her always be a count late, and then halfway through the dance, she just gives up and does the little sway back and forth.

121
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:16,078
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you can have them actually lip-sync this on.

122
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the stupidest game.

123
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Hours of entertainment, especially if you're intoxicated.

124
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,021
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

125
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Only Rob.

126
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Only Rob.

127
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else in your gaming week, DarkSakura?

128
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:28,365
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

129
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:29,806
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

130
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:31,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

131
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:32,588
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

132
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,570
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing, sorry.

133
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:35,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

134
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan downloaded that pinball game, the demo of the pinball game, and it's okay, but it's very high def.

135
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:43,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.

136
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:43,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.

137
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:45,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Pin Mame

138
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just playing it on the actual table.

140
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:30,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there is, in works, using widescreen LCD monitors to do an at-home full pinball emulation.

141
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:32,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.

142
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:33,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Using two screens.

143
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:35,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly as I was saying.

144
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I say a chat real quick?

145
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat saying, Fireboma says, Spice World is almost the worst game ever, to which Jared J says, you've obviously not played Night Trap.

146
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:47,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon says, Spice World is better than Sonic was for the Wii.

147
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,440
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

148
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

149
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

150
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:51,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

151
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:34,074
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've also been playing, I played a little bit of Boom Boom Rocket today, and that was kind of fun, and just working through some of the medium-level stuff, so I can get a little higher on the leaderboards there, and then a little bit of Crackdown.

152
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackdown's still fun.

153
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:44,421
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think I still have a top 100 score on Boom Boom Rocket, like, you know, for the grand leaderboards, and yet still there is someone on my friends list who outranks me.

154
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,903
[SPEAKER_03]: PK or Uno, I am going to beat your ass at...

155
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom Boom Rocket, mark my words, I will keep practicing until I take down your score.

156
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:20,619
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100, Matt, the only great game on Sega CD apart from Sonic CD was not fucking Night Trap.

157
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,502
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Popful Mail, there was Silphid, Revenge of the Ninja, Microcosm.

158
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there was Sewer Shark, but that doesn't count either.

159
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the Lunar games.

160
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what?

161
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:30,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

162
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, he's saying...

163
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Trap was a good game?

164
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:36,796
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only other good game.

165
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:38,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, the fuck it was?

166
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Trap wasn't even a good game.

167
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It had Dana Plato in it.

168
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:44,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.

169
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:46,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have boobies in it.

170
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:48,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it was Dana Plato, but she didn't have very big boobies.

171
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:49,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

172
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:53,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's instantly in the good game section.

173
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got the 32X one, actually.

174
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:58,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, there you go.

175
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Terminator game was good, too.

176
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:00,679
[SPEAKER_04]: The 32X is crap.

177
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Chaotix kicked ass.

178
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:02,899
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it did not.

179
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it did.

180
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

181
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Chaotix was awful.

182
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And Calibri.

183
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you play Calibri?

184
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

185
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And wasn't there an Echo game that was 32X compatible?

186
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,421
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, but it wasn't very good.

187
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mostly played Chaotix.

188
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie?

189
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:17,642
[SPEAKER_03]: After Burner.

190
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:18,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

191
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

192
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:19,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

193
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Calibri sucks.

194
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Calibri was cute.

195
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,064
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, After Burner and...

196
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, fuck.

197
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Harrier.

198
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:30,709
[SPEAKER_01]: For 32X.

199
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:31,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said it was a flop.

200
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:34,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were the actual arcade versions.

201
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fucking cool.

202
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

203
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really lame.

204
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, why the fuck are they chained to each other?

205
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is so awful.

206
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a fucking anchor being dragged behind the guy.

207
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, it was a horrible, horrible game.

208
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Bionic Commando Factor.

209
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Crackers, anyone?

210
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:54,655
[SPEAKER_02]: That works, that works.

211
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:59,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories because that game never gets old.

212
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we still get pissed off at each other.

213
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:03,311
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

214
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:08,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I've been playing WoW off and on.

215
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:12,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Neverwinter Nights 2 and some Unreal Tournament.

216
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of a return to old school stuff.

217
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:16,702
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am not an addict.

218
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:19,504
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do not plan to be an addict, but I still play WoW.

219
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,073
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was somewhat very similar to Drew Nami's.

220
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:27,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I played pretty much nothing but WoW all week.

221
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:28,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it to level 49.

222
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:31,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's that.

223
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, big WoW, huh?

224
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have not been doing a lot of console gaming this week.

225
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sad.

226
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:42,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the pinball game at least one more time, like twice or something, to just kind of see if I liked it.

227
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried the demo for the mini-golf game.

228
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:44,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hated it.

229
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just never liked mini-golf games on consoles.

230
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:48,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not the same.

231
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:49,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like pinball.

232
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my review for everything this week.

233
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same as the real thing.

234
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:54,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the problem, though, with it.

235
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: They really fucked up this whole thing when they went 3D Ultra Mini-Golf Adventures.

236
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:00,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really lame now.

237
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,001
[SPEAKER_04]: See, 3D Ultra Mini-Golf was pretty fun because you can play against other people.

238
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,063
[SPEAKER_04]: They even had some modes that people would create and stuff in it.

239
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:13,766
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite was if I was doing bad, I just hit someone's ball across the entire course, and that was worth it right there.

240
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

241
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:28,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the game's okay, graphically, I mean, I like, it's very creative, a lot of the whole is very creative, it's certainly not your typical mini-golf game, but I don't know, I just, I couldn't, I wasn't feeling it, for some reason, so I didn't buy the full version.

242
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:43,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to try Catan, but the demo wasn't working, and I guess they fixed it now, so I need to go back and try it, because I've heard lots of great things about Catan, and when somebody, it was either on my Twitter or LiveJournal, somebody compared it to Civilization, and I was like, sold!

243
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely want to check that out, because

244
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:46,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried the demo.

245
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I got a new monitor for my computer.

246
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:16,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got a widescreen monitor, which, by the way, is working out great for the show, because I can have, like, all the windows up at once.

247
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, oh, it's really pretty.

248
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:19,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to download movies.

249
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:20,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to download other games.

250
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:24,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how... Because, like, widescreen and WoW, oh, fap, fap, fap.

251
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.

252
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so awesome.

253
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:26,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even explain it.

254
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:28,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to try, like, other stuff.

255
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, oh, I'll try a driving game.

256
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:33,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried to download the Need for Speed Carbon demo for the PC.

257
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:34,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Crashed on me.

258
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was about ready to get to where I'd actually race.

259
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:38,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Crashed on me.

260
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:39,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like,

261
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded E-Duke.

262
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:09,808
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I have to ask your opinion on this, and I'm not sure who got the charm on this topic, but...

263
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:51,114
[SPEAKER_01]: JV Mon is saying I would cream for a Doctor Who MMO That's not entirely possible unless they set it before the current series because there's only one Time Lord now so you couldn't go around in your own TARDIS or anything What if they did something a while back or something else?

264
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:51,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

265
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:56,979
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was pre-movie it'd be possible but it wouldn't work

266
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:04,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, really doubt that they'd let something like that out now, given the attention to continuity.

267
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:09,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you get a little nervous, too, when you hear your favorite shows or whatever are going to be turned into games?

268
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:15,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, they're talking about turning Heroes into a video game now because, you know, the show's been very successful.

269
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love me some Heroes, but I get very nervous about a Heroes video game.

270
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,681
[SPEAKER_04]: If they said EA's making a Heroes game, that might be more confident in saying...

271
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: SNK is making a Heroes game, which would never happen because that's neither, you know, Metal Slug, Art of Fighting, King of Fighters, it's none of those, and it's not a game that they've already made, so obviously that wouldn't be one of their games.

272
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, QY brings up a good point, 24 the game, like, okay, yeah, 24 didn't work out so well.

273
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the problem, they made a game that took place between seasons 2 and 3 and it came out like after season 5 or 4 or something like that, so it's like, wow, this is a little old.

274
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,672
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before we get into gaming news this week, I noticed the chat room is all stuck on Spider-Man 3.

275
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, here we are, like, almost 20 minutes into the show.

276
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:06,775
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still talking about Spider-Man 3 as they were before the show started tonight, even though we're a video game show.

277
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:10,517
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see Spider-Man 3 is not a... The game got horrible reviews.

278
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man 3 is a popular part of culture.

279
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible reviews.

280
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the game, I was reading, like, PlayStation 2 game, they said it just looked like crap.

281
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:21,522
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 one, it was just getting average reviews.

282
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:21,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just...

283
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:30,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of things people love and turning them into bastardized video games.

284
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:31,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

285
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:39,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it had potential, but even they were showing the Wii version of it and stuff, and half of Brooklyn Bridge would be not even there.

286
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stuff like that.

287
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:43,646
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the buildings had textures on them and stuff like that.

288
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like one of the non-cool kids because I didn't bother to see the movie this weekend, but I hate seeing movies opening weekend.

289
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be the cool thing to do, but I hate teenagers at the theater.

290
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,329
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense to the teenagers that listen to this show.

291
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:00,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you guys know how to be respectful, but unfortunately not all teenagers of the world can be.

292
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It just ruins it for me.

293
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I went yesterday and I had a fairly quiet theater.

294
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:06,797
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one child that started crying and the parent escorted him out.

295
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:07,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

296
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:11,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And one phone that went off that everyone pretty much turned around and said, Turn that fucker off!

297
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I can top that.

298
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:26,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a work screening, and one dumb bitch at my work dropped her kids off at the screening, and one of her kids was recording the film with his camera phone, to which Nelly turned him in.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your wife, I really do.

300
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And the manager came over to him and told him to turn off the phone.

301
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:33,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

302
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping that he'd be dragged out and parents called and stuff like that, but

303
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:39,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

304
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Because management is afraid to be mean because they'll get sued or something.

305
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'd punch the kid in the face and then drag him out by his hair.

306
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

307
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:52,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of telling the manager, you should have called the RIAA or whatever.

308
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:52,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

309
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:52,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

310
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out of here real quick.

311
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:55,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the MPAA.

312
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, boy.

313
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:58,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get hate mail for that mistake.

314
00:18:59,496 --> 00:18:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

315
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:00,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

316
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:00,997
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

317
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:01,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

318
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:02,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about movies.

319
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:04,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to – wait.

320
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at – actually, I'm looking at chat.

321
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:06,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

322
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Blaze says, I'm a teen and I hate a lot of teens that go to the movies.

323
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Footy Monster says, I hate, hate, hate, hate teenagers.

324
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jack Ransom responds to that saying, we hate, hate, hate you.

325
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:22,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, come join in the love.

326
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:26,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com live on this Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific time.

327
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember when I was their age and stuff going, man.

328
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't act like that.

329
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:55,913
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

330
00:19:55,953 --> 00:20:05,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the people listening to this show, I would hope, if you're smart enough to download this show or listen live, you're probably smart enough to not be a jackass at the theater.

331
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:06,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not talking about you.

332
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:06,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Rob.

333
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about... I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

334
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never a teenager.

335
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: This is craziness.

336
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:13,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling me a teen.

337
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:13,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you 12?

338
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:14,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never a teenager.

339
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:15,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you 12?

340
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the jocks.

341
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:20,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always the jocks that are the problems of everything.

342
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And the nerds get the rap for it.

343
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:23,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerds.

344
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I ever tell the Grudge story on this show when I went to go see the Grudge?

345
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was with you.

346
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:32,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Several times.

347
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:32,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

348
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then I'm not going to tell it again.

349
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell it again, though.

350
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.

351
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you tell it.

352
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:38,443
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't there.

353
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:39,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were.

354
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:40,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

355
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:40,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

356
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,347
[SPEAKER_03]: When we saw the Grudge, were you there, Loki?

357
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:43,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.

358
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell it.

359
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:45,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

360
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

361
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I wasn't even there and I don't remember this fucking story.

362
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

363
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:51,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody.

364
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,049
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a sold out theater, right?

366
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:22,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a sold out theater and the jocks in the back.

367
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:27,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, I don't know if it's the Rocky Horror Picture Show goer in me or whatever, but I'm not afraid to yell in a crowded theater.

368
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So I turned around and I yelled out with the man with the little penis in the back row, please shut the fuck up.

369
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:40,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And the entire audience started applauding, because you know they were all sick of it, they just didn't want to say anything about it.

370
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:43,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So I yelled that out, everybody applauded, and he shut the fuck up.

371
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, you hear these girls in the back start going, Because his girlfriend knew it was true.

372
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was great.

373
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:54,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

374
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Good time.

375
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,441
[SPEAKER_01]: That was poon.

376
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:02,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should go to the movies more often on opening weekend, because I'm not afraid to yell at people while the movie's going on.

377
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:03,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it is fun to yell at movies.

378
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:09,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when we went and saw work screening again, because I wouldn't pay to see this, Charlie's Angels 2.

379
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see that.

380
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:23,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will never forget the one moment in the movie where it's just like, okay, you can kind of suspend disbelief for a lot of the movie and stuff, but when there's a boat exploding and they...

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:40,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab ahold of this rope and get pulled up through the ceiling and shrapnel from the explosion causes wood to splinter into snowboard-shaped pieces of wood to which the girls land on those and then grind down the ropes from the ship to the dock.

382
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, really?

383
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:43,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

384
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

385
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:49,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost like a transporter, but the transporter, they expect that.

386
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, there are right movies to MST and there are wrong movies to MST.

387
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: MST and Charlie's Angels?

388
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

389
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:00,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Snakes on a Plane?

390
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

391
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:03,563
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some movies that you just have to see that are bad.

392
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,923
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have to give some respect to movies like 300.

393
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:10,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the end of The Premonition where I started busting up laughing because it was so stupid.

394
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:16,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the end of Fracture where it was just like, wow, nothing really happened in the entire movie.

395
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:18,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So next on Movie Chat... Sorry.

396
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:19,326
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what...

397
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:22,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright to get off topic once in a while.

398
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

399
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Embrace it.

400
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.

401
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember last week?

402
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:28,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember last time we tried not to give a shit and people hated it.

403
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:33,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, speaking of Mr. Santa's Year 3000, I got a new tape for, or not tape, a DVD from work.

404
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the guys that do it are starting a new series.

405
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:37,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

406
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

407
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it's called now because I don't have the disc in front of me, but there is a new series coming out.

408
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:43,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

409
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:44,183
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a website, but...

410
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:45,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have Mike?

411
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:46,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Research it.

412
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Any chat feedback real quick?

413
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandit says, it might have been his mom laughing.

414
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking love chat.

415
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:54,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Her jeans.

416
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:58,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw says, Sky, and they didn't yell back at you saying, you shut the fuck up.

417
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,501
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't because the entire audience applauded.

418
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:04,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that kind of, if that didn't happen, maybe they would have, but yeah.

419
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there you go.

420
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:09,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Game News Game News Game News

421
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Over Memorial Day weekend.

422
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,388
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we only have one panel, not two.

423
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to do a general podcasting panel.

424
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's alright because we're still going to record our show live.

425
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And it happens at 2pm on Saturdays.

426
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:41,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hope that a lot of you guys will come out and say hello and make plans to come see us at Faname.

427
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:43,696
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all be there.

428
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:44,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're excited.

429
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:46,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.

430
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:47,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news.

431
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:52,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some news, and this is very interesting stuff.

432
00:24:54,199 --> 00:25:00,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the PlayStation 3 store is starting to stock PlayStation 1 games.

433
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:08,584
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Two Extreme, Crash Bandicoot, Destruction Derby, Jet Moto, Jumping Flash, which I fucking love Jumping Flash.

434
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:16,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Medieval, Rallycross, Syphon Filter, which is actually a good game, Tekken 2, and Wipeout.

435
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:18,088
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

436
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:30,229
[SPEAKER_01]: You will actually be able to share your PSP games between the handheld and the PS3, so you'll keep your save games with you.

437
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,069
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play them at work, play them at home.

438
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It has not yet been confirmed for Europe, however, so we've just got to wait.

439
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,072
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these downloads are $5.99 apiece.

440
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:48,674
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had them up for the PSP for a while, and it's always kind of weird how you had to have the PS3 to download the ones for the PSP,

441
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:59,656
[SPEAKER_04]: which didn't make any sense and now with the new version 1.7 patch that they had for the firmware on the PS3 now you can actually play them on the PlayStation 3 instead of just on the PSP.

442
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:02,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's good that your saves are going to work between the two.

443
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:08,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that's kind of nice and it's also nice that there's something to actually download on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.

444
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:17,561
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there was a system that tried to do this before not necessarily with having the handheld version but remember the Neo Geo tried to do this before with the arcade versions and with the

445
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,660
[SPEAKER_01]: AVS.

446
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's also the TurboGrafx-16.

447
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,062
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the TurboGrafx didn't have an arcade compatibility.

448
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:28,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have the TurboDuo, though, or the Turbo Express.

449
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:33,444
[SPEAKER_01]: The Turbo Express had no way to transfer the saves between the systems.

450
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought it was on the cartridges, though.

451
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:40,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, but that's like playing with your Super Game Boy.

452
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it would be the same as a Nomad.

453
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the same as a Nomad.

454
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,228
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, though, it was having your...

455
00:26:48,268 --> 00:26:52,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Bringing home your arcade game to play on your arcade version at home.

456
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:54,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different... Hello.

457
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:02,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandit in our chat room says, Great, now I can use my $600 investment to play really old PS1 games.

458
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thanks, Sony.

459
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I love Jumping Flash.

460
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

461
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:09,827
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

462
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:10,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

463
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:11,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the...

464
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interject this real quick.

465
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The Film Crew is what the new thing is called, the new series.

466
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:22,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It stars Kevin Murphy, Bill, looks like Corbett, and Mike Nelson.

467
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:23,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, how about some game news?

468
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:27,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay now, Mr. Demanding.

469
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:35,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so, also tying in with the PlayStation 3, Home Beta has finally kicked off in both the US and UK.

470
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I just don't care if it doesn't have Tom Servo, okay?

471
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:38,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

472
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:38,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

473
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:48,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so a lot of people are getting to try out the brand new free, you know, avatar system that's very similar to the Sims.

474
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:54,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody's saying, oh, it's so much better than Xbox Live.

475
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:54,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

476
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they all had to sign an NDA to get in that.

477
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, they did.

478
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:04,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they can still say that they're part of this, you know, service and that it's awesome.

479
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:08,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, awesome is not covered under the NDA.

480
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

481
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:17,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But, apparently also there's going to be some more entries into the beta coming out soon.

482
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to get into the beta, you need to make sure that you register your PlayStation 3 with Sony, which I haven't done yet, so I need to do that.

483
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:31,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's all random from there.

484
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good luck.

485
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you get to try out the home beta before everybody else.

486
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:38,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I don't really care.

487
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:40,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just wait for it to be done.

488
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be working correctly when it is done anyways, because everybody likes to patch shit.

489
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is in beta.

490
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:47,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's early.

491
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:48,144
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

492
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:55,947
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD, by the way, says, Kevin Murphy is Tom Servo, so he's trying to pwn me there.

493
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

494
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he have a giant underwear collection?

495
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I think not.

496
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

497
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:04,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.

498
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Vib Ribbon

499
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Matsuura was actually hinting that possibly Vib Ribbon might be on its way to the PlayStation Network.

500
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:32,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, Rhythmica is very similar in idea to Vib Ribbon.

501
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:37,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about analyzing audio and creating a game from that data, but it uses MP3 audio instead of CDs.

502
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:42,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We are discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of Vib Ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet.

503
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony only recently launched their downloadable service in Japan, so we kind of need to wait a while before releasing a title with that kind of appeal.

504
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:50,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

505
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Vibribin, if you've never played it, is so friggin' cute.

506
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:54,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad I lucked into my copy.

507
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I paid enough for it, too, didn't I?

508
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

509
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't it go into best hits in Japan, though, eventually?

510
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:01,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.

511
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:04,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought an original for like 50 bucks used.

512
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:08,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again... At the time, yeah, it was absolutely worth it.

513
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cool thing about it, though, is that you could use any CD with it.

514
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:15,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And although the results were somewhat mixed, it was just kind of fun.

515
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,861
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we try to do?

516
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:17,461
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried Max 300.

517
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:18,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It was better than Dance Factory.

518
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:19,982
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

519
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,543
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we did Dropout.

520
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:23,483
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what we used.

521
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,404
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to play it to Dropout.

522
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:26,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

523
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope this happens.

524
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:30,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a really fun game for PlayStation Network.

525
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly better than the Duck game.

526
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:38,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is, in process...

527
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:41,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for a moment while I breathe again.

528
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:48,729
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about a new Dead or Alive, Mega Man, and Kingdom Hearts for PS3.

529
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:55,513
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last issue of EGM Magazine, there were these rumors coming out.

530
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:02,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So Team Ninja has an exclusive for a new Dead or Alive for the PS3.

531
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:06,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the notice that Capcom is working on a new...

532
00:31:08,972 --> 00:31:15,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually not a new Mega Man, they were updating the original Mega Man with new graphics for a download.

533
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:20,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nipponichi is working on a new Disgaea for PS3.

534
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:29,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically Mega Man, powered up Mega Man, except without a giant head, hopefully.

535
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:30,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope.

536
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:35,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he had a giant fucking head in the game.

537
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:38,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pretty much sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be PS3.

538
00:31:40,878 --> 00:32:08,449
[SPEAKER_04]: so there is some new stuff coming out also from Square actually they're talking a little bit about Kingdom Hearts and of course the next progression for it apparently is going to be a portable spin-off and not Kingdom Hearts 3 although I'm assuming Kingdom Hearts 3 is probably in the works as well but the next game you'll see will be a portable spin-off and no word exactly what it's going to be I'm sure we'll find out a little bit more after the whole Square Enix

539
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Press Party or whatever they have in Fan Party.

540
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:19,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we'll hear a little bit more about that because I know it wasn't a Chain of Memories or whatever.

541
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't that suck really bad?

542
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:24,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Chain of Memories is a different game.

543
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:28,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not recommend playing it on a DS Micro.

544
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Not DS.

545
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game Boy Advance Micro.

546
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,416
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't that bad.

547
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually looking forward to the PS2 version.

548
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:38,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

549
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:39,397
[SPEAKER_04]: They just

550
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fuck it up, please.

551
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:47,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memory for the story, not the game.

552
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:50,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad they play it for something.

553
00:32:53,528 --> 00:33:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, last week somebody listened to us, apparently, or somebody had the same idea, because remember when last week we talked about the whole God of War promotional thing in the UK?

554
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the goat with the head chopped off and all that stuff, remember that?

555
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:09,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said somebody should email PETA.

556
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:10,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somebody did.

557
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:14,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody somehow told PETA what was going on.

558
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's because of this show or what.

559
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure somebody else had the same idea.

560
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But PETA did post in their, I guess, official blog.

561
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:27,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's just one guy that runs it, but they have a blog over at blog.peta.com.

562
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody actually posted about it.

563
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what it came down to is that they sort of said...

564
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:39,964
[SPEAKER_03]: PETA said they're kind of not going to do anything about it, that it's obviously an idiotic thing.

565
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:44,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They would not name the game in the blog entry because they have no desire to help them promote it.

566
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:50,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And they noticed that Sony obviously apologized for it, and Sony is recalling the magazine and everything.

567
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:53,889
[SPEAKER_03]: But PETA was just kind of shaking their head disapprovingly.

568
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:56,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, boys.

569
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:26,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

570
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

571
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:37,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know how Taito had that big problem with Bubble Bobble?

572
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,395
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't get past level 30?

573
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,116
[SPEAKER_03]: No, never heard of it.

574
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:42,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

575
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we made fun of it endlessly on this show.

576
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:53,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's happened to SNK and Capcom Cardfighter Clash for the DS.

577
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:53,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

578
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is funny because my husband bought the game right when it came out.

579
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:59,671
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just wondering if he's hit that point yet.

580
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to laugh.

581
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:02,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got bubble bobbled.

582
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:12,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, if you go to the ninth floor of the tower through the second playthrough, the game will crash after you talk to someone named John.

583
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to fight him to, of course, make it past that area.

584
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:19,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're pretty much just stuck.

585
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:20,637
[SPEAKER_01]: No...

586
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:29,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a message from SNK stating that we're going to hear something soon, but nothing as of yet as far as I know.

587
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:36,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope that, more than positive, they're going to recall it or do something for it.

588
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:43,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the message going to say something along the lines of, we're really fucking sorry we didn't beta test this game?

589
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because when things like this are announced, it makes me think that the game is so god-awful that not even their own internal QA department could play through the ninth floor.

590
00:35:51,286 --> 00:36:00,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's seriously the impression that I get about the game, is that if the game is so broken that not even their QA department was interested in playing it that far, what else am I left to think?

591
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:01,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

592
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's good enough.

593
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hell, if the first couple levels worked, then the whole game's probably good.

594
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all, they're not that much different.

595
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:11,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

596
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to play through the whole thing?

597
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:15,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

598
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:21,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, news about broken video games makes us a little bit angsty, and you know what that means when we get angsty.

599
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:22,539
[SPEAKER_03]: People die.

600
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

601
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, take it away.

602
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:48,598
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, FU goes towards certain people in management positions at my unlisted place of employment.

603
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:56,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really, you know, again, it's not necessarily a... I'd say it was a misthought.

604
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it that way.

605
00:36:58,226 --> 00:36:58,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming that...

606
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have enough work already to do with the one thing that I was already doing.

607
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,602
[SPEAKER_01]: True, I get a couple days a month where they don't, you know, open as many assignments to me to finish and I need extra things to do to keep busy.

608
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:18,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I told them right up front, I'm like, look, I'm not going to be able to do all this.

609
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:22,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one person and I'm sure as hell not going to work overtime.

610
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:25,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you really want me to work overtime and pay me for it, sure, yeah.

611
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:34,969
[SPEAKER_01]: and, true enough, you know, I finally said, you know what, if they're gonna do this to me, then I'm just gonna let them know when I can't get it all done in one day and we'll see what they think of that.

612
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:39,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So, finally, the realization has dawned that, oh my god, she really is only one person.

613
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:44,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And while her productivity is amazing, not everybody can do all of this.

614
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:50,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we're gonna not let, you know, this employee go nuts and kill everybody in the company.

615
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:53,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's getting taken care of.

616
00:37:54,017 --> 00:37:55,178
[SPEAKER_01]: After we discuss the situation.

617
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:59,866
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Survivor The Ride

618
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: At Great America, where I was at yesterday, we took a trip for Extrovert Sisters.

619
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I vote this ride out of the park.

620
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, first of all, how the hell do you make a ride out of Survivor?

621
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:38,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cheesy, but whatever.

622
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it where you have to starve yourself?

623
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:41,095
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

624
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:47,438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay, you start off the ride, like when you're waiting in the queue, the little line before you actually get on the ride, right?

625
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:52,861
[SPEAKER_03]: They make you do, when it's your turn to go next, first you have to do this little tribal stomp, you have to do this stupid-ass...

626
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

627
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

628
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:46,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And I scream like a little girl because, like, seriously, like, Disneyland is one thing.

629
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:57,165
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get on the thrill rides where I'm going upside down and being, like, just being twisted up like a pretzel on some of those rides and getting fire shot in my face on a ride named after a TV show that jumped the shark five years ago.

630
00:39:57,586 --> 00:39:59,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, F you.

631
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:02,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you'll do the dance next time now, won't you?

632
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

633
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll teach that fucker a lesson.

634
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do the damn dance next time.

635
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Stomp, stomp, stomp.

636
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:17,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, seriously, when my first word to her when I got off the ride, I'm like, Jamie would like this ride because it shoots fire.

637
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would.

638
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said shooting fire, I was like, hey, I like fire.

639
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,745
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you didn't find it funny.

640
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:25,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I found it funny as hell.

641
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuego es muy bien.

642
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuego.

643
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says Skye is used to things being shot in his face.

644
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:35,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Zing, my second FU of the week, goes to Fireboma.

645
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:35,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

646
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:37,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunami, your FU of the week.

647
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to DS Wi-Fi for being so damn temperamental around my router.

648
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:45,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not my router's fault it wants to be so restrictive.

649
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.

650
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, FU to the new patches that are coming out for WoW.

651
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to go into the public test room.

652
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Lactastic.

653
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing works in my UI.

654
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:02,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some serious stuff to fix before they release that publicly.

655
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:05,802
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

656
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of angst in studio tonight.

657
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You know you're going to get a good show when there's lots of angst in studio tonight.

658
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,751
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's kill the music.

659
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get back to some gaming news.

660
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

661
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, let's go have ice cream.

662
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:19,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice cream sounds good.

663
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have an ice cream podcast.

664
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally vote for ice cream.

665
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

666
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Radio is canceled tonight due to ice cream.

667
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I already had ice cream today.

668
00:41:29,025 --> 00:41:30,646
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have ice cream for two weeks.

669
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:31,767
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have ice cream again.

670
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:32,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, save us.

671
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:39,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, the only thing in combat ice cream is TNA, and there is... Hey, that sounds great!

672
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:39,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Winner!

673
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I like TNA ice cream.

674
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,020
[SPEAKER_04]: TNA-flavored ice cream.

675
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:50,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this wonderful game that's being touted as TNA Pong on Kotaku.

676
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually from a website, I guess, WeMakeMoneyNotArt, and it's, I guess, some woman named Jennifer Chowdhury's.

677
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:03,753
[SPEAKER_04]: She has an intimate game controller, and apparently...

678
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:08,400
[SPEAKER_04]: She says it's like Pong, but it's not really like Pong, it's more like DDR, I would say.

679
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:19,749
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole game is basically, there's a woman has a bra controller where you, you know, grope her, and then the guy has, like, boxers where she grabs his ass.

680
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And you watch the screen, there's, like, first there'll be shapes coming up, so, you know, you can grab anywhere.

681
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:33,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Then later on, as you progress through the levels, there's shapes with other shapes on them, like star with a circle and stuff, and you have to grab certain parts and stuff, and supposedly...

682
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to make you either, you know, piss off because you lose or go have sex.

683
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, it looked very, very, very, very awkward.

684
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a game where even when you lose, you win?

685
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:47,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

686
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, the way I figure it, you know, if you got some chick in bra and panties already and you're playing this game and grabbing her boobs, it can't be that bad of a game.

687
00:42:56,018 --> 00:43:00,220
[SPEAKER_02]: This reminds me of that one boob twirling game they released like two, three years ago.

688
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

689
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you had to make them twirl in different patterns.

690
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a fun game.

691
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:06,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching the video on here, even though I'm not supposed to.

692
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:09,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really stupid.

693
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:10,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

694
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give the show an explicit tag.

695
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:12,424
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?

696
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:16,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Warning, the show is intended for mature audiences.

697
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:24,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like, when you first started talking about this, I kind of pictured that maybe the woman, like, put a Wiimote in her twat.

698
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:27,466
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, would you play Lesbian Pong?

699
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the female perspective here on the show for a minute.

700
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:58,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a yes, you would?

701
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Score, cut, print, saved archives.

702
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,015
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's a wrap.

703
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:06,616
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR's over.

704
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: We're off to go play games.

705
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:10,498
[SPEAKER_03]: We're off to go create new games for the Wii.

706
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice knowing you for the past five years.

707
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesbian Pong has ruined this show.

708
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:14,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

709
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:26,007
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but seriously, though, they could put, like, what they could do is, like, I don't know, make some sort of a different game, you know, where they could put more sensors on their bodies or something.

710
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:26,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

711
00:44:28,908 --> 00:44:29,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Know what they need.

712
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:36,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what... Yeah, but now we have an audio clip of her saying yes, so it's done.

713
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:39,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's what they need to do.

714
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:44,028
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of ties in with that really crappy Eye of Judgment game.

715
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:47,391
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to have something with the eye toy and the Eye of Judgment.

716
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:48,391
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a sex game.

717
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:48,992
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

718
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:51,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already the brown Eye of Judgment.

719
00:44:51,994 --> 00:44:53,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, the Eye of Judgment on a sex game.

720
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

721
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:55,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Wiimote.

722
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Six Axis, right?

723
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:57,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

724
00:44:57,998 --> 00:45:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Six Axis can detect how much you're rocking the boat.

725
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:10,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, then again, though, they have all the USB ports, so you can just hook it up with your usual USB-powered vibrators and shit, and it'll just, you know...

726
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:11,706
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

727
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Total sex package.

728
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Never will happen.

729
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a dumb idea.

730
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:21,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Who the fuck would set up all this shit to have sex?

731
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:22,393
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just retarded.

732
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:26,836
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, though, they have all those sex board games, and I don't know.

733
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:27,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be fun.

734
00:45:28,797 --> 00:45:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say this real quick.

735
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:33,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the talk about the brown eye of judgment actually reminded me.

736
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:39,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a private message on my Twitter from a PK or Uno who was telling me about another game

737
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:42,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Aquarian Age Alternative

738
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:05,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

739
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:09,099
[SPEAKER_04]: That proves, once again, Sony didn't come up with an original idea.

740
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to go!

741
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Copying something subscreened.

742
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how new or old this game is, but I hope... Well, let's put it this way.

743
00:46:16,182 --> 00:46:19,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just pimp his Vox, because he has pictures and stuff all over his Vox.

744
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:22,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to see this, it's pkeruno.vox.com.

745
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: P-K-E-R-U-N-O dot vox dot com.

746
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has this whole thing, Aquarian Age Alternative.

747
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:27,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's out.

748
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:28,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Eye of Judgment is not out.

749
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, this one came out first, so...

750
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:35,696
[SPEAKER_04]: They... Way to go, Sony.

751
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:39,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking that we wouldn't find the thing that you copied, but there you go.

752
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Proves that you're still not original.

753
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:43,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still a dumb idea.

754
00:46:48,226 --> 00:46:48,666
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

755
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:50,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to play it.

756
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll try anything once.

757
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:58,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, other famous Japanese arcade games may or may not be coming to the US.

758
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:00,975
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX Gold, Beatmania 2DX Gold, of course...

759
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:02,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Tilt Arcade, GameWorks, Six Flags

760
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:27,966
[SPEAKER_03]: and really break down that we want to see Beatmania 2DX Golden Arcades.

761
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it tells you what to say and everything.

762
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:36,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So hats off to this user, BrazoLienge, and I hope I didn't horribly mispronounce that.

763
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But hats off to you for breaking that all down.

764
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:43,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to this program because that used to be our forte a couple years ago.

765
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely check out Bomani Style's forums.

766
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:47,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the forums.

767
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:50,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't let a golf land have it because you know they'll fuck it up.

768
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't let golf land have it because they'll break it.

769
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

770
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

771
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:56,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, for some reason your mic's not picking up, DarkSakura, is it?

772
00:47:57,022 --> 00:47:57,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it wasn't on.

773
00:47:57,962 --> 00:47:58,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be why.

774
00:47:58,683 --> 00:47:59,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it wasn't on.

775
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:00,544
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there you go.

776
00:48:00,804 --> 00:48:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what I said was don't let Golfland have it because you know they're going to fuck it up.

777
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:08,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the music game discussion forums on BamandiStyle.com.

778
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:17,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of information that came out on a forum, there's a rumor going on that the DDR Supernova 2 North American Field Test is canceled.

779
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:22,534
[SPEAKER_01]: It was posted by Rye19 on Aaron in Japan's forums.

780
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:25,136
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

781
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:50,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly myself don't put too much stock in something that I read on a forum until I see something official put out by the company.

782
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:57,522
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I would give a little cred to it is because they have done location tests there before at that same arcade.

783
00:48:57,962 --> 00:49:05,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was willing to believe it, but I do wonder to myself, did Konami pull it back?

784
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,627
[SPEAKER_03]: to maybe further tweak the game.

785
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:13,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it wasn't ready to be tested because you know the internet is cruel and the game better be damn good or the internet will tear it apart.

786
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:20,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was also a quote on here, apparently a quote from maybe Selenic Konami?

787
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:34,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is on a message board stating that in order to prevent dissatisfaction of SN2, we have canceled the North American SN2 test site as it may result in creating a better dance game.

788
00:49:37,245 --> 00:49:37,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds fishy.

789
00:49:38,866 --> 00:49:39,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that one.

790
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:41,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

791
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:41,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.

792
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:43,609
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

793
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would a company admit that, oh, the game kind of sucks right now?

794
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:48,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go back and tweak it.

795
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that one.

796
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:50,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We're starting over.

797
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:52,174
[SPEAKER_03]: See you in ten years.

798
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you have a nice play again.

799
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:58,137
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

800
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:02,060
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to just completely make the dance pads more durable.

801
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Ditter fans are going to have to wait a little long for their ditter.

802
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the story...

803
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,168
[SPEAKER_01]: You can diddle later.

804
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:07,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, dinner later.

805
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so certain... There's a few websites out there that got all excited after seeing an IGN mock-up of a Guitar Hero 3 controller, which I might add that is completely fake, by the way, and is no indication of what it's actually going to look like.

806
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:32,280
[SPEAKER_04]: They have basically a picture of a white guitar with the Wii remote in the neck of the guitar.

807
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:32,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's

808
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like before when they mocked what the classic controller would look like.

809
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:39,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely mocked up.

810
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,526
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why I felt that was fake when I first looked at it?

811
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because of the way the Wiimote is strapped into that controller.

812
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:50,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Because basically what they have there is they have this guitar with the handle.

813
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:53,774
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they call the long part of that?

814
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:55,135
[SPEAKER_03]: The neck?

815
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,776
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the Wii thing snapping into the neck.

816
00:50:56,816 --> 00:50:58,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is that if the Wiimote were to snap in...

817
00:50:59,477 --> 00:51:00,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks the infrared.

818
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:02,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plugs are on the bottom.

819
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't snap it in like that.

820
00:51:05,122 --> 00:51:08,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to snap it in either on the bottom of the guitar or something.

821
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:10,486
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't push it in and have it just snap.

822
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:11,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't work.

823
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:12,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be too difficult to get in there.

824
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:24,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, if I remember correctly, I think they've already said that if when they do release this, there's actually going to be a guitar that's sold separately.

825
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,980
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll hook up via USB or something like that.

826
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

827
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:50,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, but that's not what it's going to be, it's not going to be something that you strap the Wii Remote into It's not like you have to plug the Wii Remote into everything Exactly, and, I mean, I don't know, it's going to be Guitar Hero 3, it's just going to be on another fucking console, so, woohoo I know, it's like, you've never played this game before

828
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:51,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Flyin' V Flyin' V Flyin' V

829
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too much to ask for one freaking guitar to work on all consoles?

830
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,380
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

831
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,760
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all USB.

832
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they?

833
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they make one universal guitar?

834
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:30,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

835
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:34,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I know why, because they get to sell you fucking more guitars.

836
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, the Queens of the Stone Age, you might know them, they're a band, and they have basically confirmed that they are going to be in some games.

837
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:47,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I guess there's a

838
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:54,872
[SPEAKER_03]: promo ad going around for the band and it's confirming that they are going to be appearing in Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

839
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: What song?

840
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know, but you know the Queens of Stone Age are going to be in the games.

841
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:04,359
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, they're also going to be in Madden 08 and NASCAR 08 if you are so inclined to play those games instead.

842
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

843
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: EA tracks!

844
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, EA tracks!

845
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:12,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I like Junkie XL, so they always have a good Junkie XL track in there.

846
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And who doesn't love Avril Lavigne's girlfriend?

847
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:15,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no one.

848
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:16,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

849
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:17,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Nellie does.

850
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:24,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind Hey Mickey, just replace the word Mickey with girlfriend and that's pretty much the song

851
00:53:36,744 --> 00:53:37,745
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

852
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:05,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

853
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:06,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Bible Fight.

854
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:07,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a flash game.

855
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's like Street Fighter with Jesus.

856
00:54:12,694 --> 00:54:14,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played a little bit of this game last night.

857
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:16,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have included that in my gaming week.

858
00:54:17,078 --> 00:54:19,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And I battled Jesus versus Satan.

859
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It was epic.

860
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:22,183
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's great is that they have special moves.

861
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:24,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jesus throws his thorny crown.

862
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:24,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

863
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:29,189
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Jesus, Eve, Mary, Moses, Noah, and Satan.

864
00:54:30,526 --> 00:54:33,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see if she's naked.

865
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:33,208
[SPEAKER_03]: She...

866
00:54:58,072 --> 00:55:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you've got issues.

867
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:00,793
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is great.

868
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:03,373
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a snake on one arm with little leaves.

869
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

870
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:09,535
[SPEAKER_03]: The typical depiction of Eve, where there's always... Mary looks like she's got PMS.

871
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:14,456
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always, like, an animal or a fig leaf or something just conveniently placed over their naughty bits.

872
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:16,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always kind of interesting.

873
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:20,217
[SPEAKER_01]: She's fighting with a halo over her head and fucking Baby Jesus.

874
00:55:20,577 --> 00:55:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Baby Jesus is a weapon?

875
00:55:23,598 --> 00:55:25,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that be awesome?

876
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:26,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

877
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:29,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we're going to get the hate mail tonight.

878
00:55:30,072 --> 00:55:32,113
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Westboro will sue.

879
00:55:32,173 --> 00:55:33,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we didn't create it.

880
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:34,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Adult Swim did.

881
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:35,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Go take up your issues with them.

882
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so the NBA has just launched into Second Life.

883
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:43,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

884
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently a lot of people are on Second Life like it's fucking real world or something.

885
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, the NBA is on there now.

886
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, they're in the real world too.

887
00:55:54,772 --> 00:56:03,059
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently you can go there and, you know, play horse and basketball and suck it up really bad as well.

888
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

889
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:11,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised that, you know, people are going to make money off this second life.

890
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's interesting nonetheless.

891
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:16,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you can play horse and get pelted by penises.

892
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, keep the first life out of second life.

893
00:56:19,373 --> 00:56:20,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, come on.

894
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty soon people are going to get... You should put that on a bumper sticker.

895
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty soon... Seriously, that's a pretty good tagline for us.

896
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:29,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're a Second Life player, right?

897
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: From time to time, yeah.

898
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Second Life was just where people go to have virtual furry sex or something.

899
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not like to play basketball.

900
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go into Second Life, I'm going to play basketball.

901
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:49,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your friend goes, fuck that, I'm going outside and play basketball there.

902
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to worry about being pelted with flying penises.

903
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:54,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew Nami, response?

904
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go play in a sandbox then.

905
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:03,605
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get that shit if you play in a sandbox zone.

906
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so don't go playing in a sandbox because there's a virtual sandbox in Second Life.

907
00:57:13,131 --> 00:57:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had that sound effect on this program, I would have just used it.

908
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

909
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what the hell do you do in Second Life?

910
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:25,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop!

911
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find a life?

912
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,761
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

913
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine there's lots of people.

914
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:32,643
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk.

915
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:33,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at my cube I just made.

916
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:34,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome.

917
00:57:34,904 --> 00:57:36,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to buy it for $1,000?

918
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:39,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk, okay?

919
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:42,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I guess people play it because it's fun.

920
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:43,769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what games are.

921
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:44,309
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fun.

922
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:45,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Furry sex is fun.

923
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:51,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if World of Warcraft weren't set in some sort of fictional medieval time, I'm sure the NBA would be there, too.

924
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:54,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of Second Life is simple.

925
00:57:54,857 --> 00:57:56,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Step one, fly around.

926
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:57,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Step two, do shit.

927
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from chat room.

928
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD makes some comments.

929
00:58:04,423 --> 00:58:07,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Tim Hardaway there to hate you if you're gay in Second Life?

930
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Making fun of some earlier controversy.

931
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:13,308
[SPEAKER_03]: RobD says, is Dirk Nowitzki there to suck in Second Life?

932
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:13,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

933
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,228
[SPEAKER_03]: KevinTheGroove says, in second life, you waste your first life.

934
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:25,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

935
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:27,795
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

936
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:29,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Responses from chat.orangelongeradio.com

937
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:34,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is a little more interesting of a sports story, I think.

938
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:34,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

939
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:40,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Pro football players will be training with Electronic Arts Madden technology.

940
00:58:41,075 --> 00:58:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: The same technology that's used in Electronic Arts popular Madden games is now being used to create a training simulator for professional football players.

941
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,884
[SPEAKER_03]: XOS Technologies is licensing the TDT engine from EA Sports to use in what's called the Play Action Simulator.

942
00:58:57,418 --> 00:59:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: The play action of Family of Products addresses team demands to uniquely and effectively teach new plays and game plans, says Bob Simmons, who is the XOS Coaching Solutions president.

943
00:59:07,623 --> 00:59:16,748
[SPEAKER_03]: As the current provider of coaching analysis and game planning solutions to more than 200 NFL and NCAA football teams, XOS thoroughly understands how teams prepare weekly for an upcoming opponent.

944
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:20,850
[SPEAKER_03]: The simulator is built on our TDT engine, which utilizes the same technologies.

945
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:28,695
[SPEAKER_03]: and gameplay found in our popular Madden NFL game franchise, said the general manager of EA Tiburon, Steve Chang.

946
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:30,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

947
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:32,536
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a Madden fan, I bet that's pretty exciting.

948
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:41,159
[SPEAKER_03]: But my response would be, what about those poor players who train and then end up with the really low ranking in Madden?

949
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know Madden ranks all the real players, and that's got to suck if you're the lowest ranked one.

950
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:48,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember a story, either on this show or another show,

951
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:50,442
[SPEAKER_03]: What good is an actual simulator anyway?

952
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:09,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I don't know.

953
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,194
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't help me become a better driver.

954
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:12,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played Ridge Racer.

955
01:00:12,094 --> 01:00:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, you have driving simulators.

956
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops do cop scene simulators.

957
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:17,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

958
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Simulators are there to simulate the real thing.

959
01:00:19,518 --> 01:00:19,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

960
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: What good is that going to do versus actual real experience?

961
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:26,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, keep in mind, there's a lot of strategy in football, too.

962
01:00:26,562 --> 01:00:28,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not just the running around and stuff.

963
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:32,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, I don't know, maybe it has to do with strategy and processing.

964
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:33,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just play Tecmo Bowl?

965
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:34,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.

966
01:00:34,327 --> 01:00:34,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Tecmo Bowl.

967
01:00:34,907 --> 01:00:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted the engine built on Tecmo Bowl.

968
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:36,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, anyway.

969
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:40,707
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another... Why am I getting all the rumors?

970
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:45,551
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another rumor floating about that Nintendo of America is going to relocate.

971
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:56,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually posted on Kotaku that employees were told on Thursday that they had until June 1st to choose to willingly relocate or accept a severance package.

972
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:02,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sites for new offices are rumored to be San Francisco and New York.

973
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:03,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

974
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping for San Francisco!

975
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:10,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too, because I could have applied for all kinds of jobs.

976
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:14,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I actually was going to apply for a number of Nintendo jobs when I thought I was moving to Washington.

977
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:16,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm not gonna.

978
01:01:17,205 --> 01:01:19,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want jobs there.

979
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:27,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so we have GameStop over here, and of course they have Game over in the UK.

980
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:33,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently Game has bought out its competitor, GameStation, for...

981
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent of $100 million US Approximately 74 million pounds Or euros, I can't tell And now it will increase So wait, GameStop is to game as GameStation is to EB Games?

982
01:01:51,568 --> 01:02:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that, yeah So now they are about over 200 storefronts And the largest chain in Europe

983
01:02:04,076 --> 01:02:04,916
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop is now a Monopoly?

984
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:32,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say it's a monopoly, but it's pretty much as close to a monopoly as GameStop is over here.

985
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:45,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but GameStop gets, I mean, maybe that's the same perception as in Europe is that GameStop does compete with Best Buy and Walmart and online and the more, you know, the big box stores that carry more than just games.

986
01:02:45,113 --> 01:02:45,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

987
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:47,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where their competition is now.

988
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:50,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like they're the only game store on the face of the earth, so I don't know.

989
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I get pissed at GameStop, I go to, you know, either I go to GameCrazy or because that's kind of far, I'll go to Best Buy.

990
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:00,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

991
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:04,956
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend had a real horrible experience at Best Buy last week, and now I'm thinking I may not go there anymore.

992
01:03:04,976 --> 01:03:05,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Fries.

993
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bad.

994
01:03:06,276 --> 01:03:07,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Fries, I could do.

995
01:03:07,557 --> 01:03:08,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do fries.

996
01:03:08,738 --> 01:03:09,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I like fries.

997
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you hanging out over there, Drew Nami?

998
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,301
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a problem with fries?

999
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty service?

1000
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:15,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got shitty service.

1001
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:17,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

1002
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:18,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it shitty service?

1003
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had stuff that's, like, gone bad, went back there, and they're like, eh, whatever.

1004
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:22,566
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's cheap.

1005
01:03:22,626 --> 01:03:23,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll just give me a new one.

1006
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:24,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1007
01:03:25,488 --> 01:03:28,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, moving on to another story, um,

1008
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting.

1009
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,694
[SPEAKER_03]: This story somewhat struck a chord.

1010
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:39,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but this is really big in the news this week about a Chinese student who was attending Clements High School.

1011
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:42,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, because he's a high school student, they don't give us his name.

1012
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:44,640
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was removed from the high school.

1013
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: This is located in Texas in the town of Fort Benz.

1014
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:53,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents were complaining he recreated the school grounds in a game, which I believe was Counter-Strike.

1015
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:57,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And he uploaded the map and all his friends were playing in it.

1016
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,243
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically he now has to go to an alternate education school.

1017
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:04,945
[SPEAKER_03]: The police called him a terroristic threat and so on and so on.

1018
01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:10,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can't help but think this is all partially due to the Columbines and the Virginia Techs of the world.

1019
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:22,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason why this struck a chord with me is that when I go back to 10 years ago, 1996, a little more than 10 years ago, my freshman year of college,

1020
01:04:23,314 --> 01:04:25,475
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1021
01:04:48,897 --> 01:04:53,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Map editors came out, and what was the first map we tried to make in Duke Nukem?

1022
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,702
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to recreate our dorm in Duke Nukem, because we thought it would be funny.

1023
01:04:56,822 --> 01:05:03,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I tried to recreate Roundtable to play Duke Nukem 3D in Roundtable, but it doesn't mean I'm going to go shoot up the place.

1024
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because it's a place you're familiar.

1025
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:11,491
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, damn, you're sitting there bored or whatever in high school, and you're like, damn, this would be fun to run around and play paintball in or something like that.

1026
01:05:11,591 --> 01:05:15,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't actually do that, so you create a map that's familiar to you, and you go and play.

1027
01:05:15,634 --> 01:05:17,775
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like if you recreated your mall or something like that.

1028
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is these people are too fucking scared of everything that they immediately think, oh my god, it's Counter-Strike, you know, therefore he must be a terrorist.

1029
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:32,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And, no, I heard the rumors also because he's Asian.

1030
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:35,275
[SPEAKER_03]: D-Vay in chat says he actually went to jail.

1031
01:05:35,355 --> 01:05:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an update on the story.

1032
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:37,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, D-Vay.

1033
01:05:37,596 --> 01:05:38,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so stupid!

1034
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:40,258
[SPEAKER_03]: What crime did he commit?

1035
01:05:40,538 --> 01:05:41,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, what crime did he commit?

1036
01:05:41,879 --> 01:05:43,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what I'm thinking.

1037
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a component of this we don't know?

1038
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:46,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Like,

1039
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did the parents complain just about a map?

1040
01:05:49,723 --> 01:05:53,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my parents didn't know I was making... My parents thought I was doing Homeworld.

1041
01:05:53,844 --> 01:05:54,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

1042
01:05:54,164 --> 01:05:55,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even know I was playing Duke Nukem, okay?

1043
01:05:55,525 --> 01:05:55,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

1044
01:05:55,945 --> 01:06:00,405
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to be the fucking people that fucking saw 9-11 coming and stopped it.

1045
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:01,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they wanted to be.

1046
01:06:01,486 --> 01:06:03,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, oh, look, he's recreated a map.

1047
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:05,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like that Virginia Tech community.

1048
01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:06,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get the guy.

1049
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:07,927
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm curious about.

1050
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:12,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there something else that we don't know, that the video game blogs aren't talking about?

1051
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he did have a hammer in...

1052
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:16,250
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what he could do with that hammer?

1053
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,631
[SPEAKER_04]: He could hammer shit.

1054
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:18,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he make a threat?

1055
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:19,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people's skulls.

1056
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:21,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he make a threat months ago?

1057
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:23,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there something about his demeanor?

1058
01:06:23,656 --> 01:06:29,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm stopping to think there's got to be something else.

1059
01:06:29,562 --> 01:06:31,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we really this trigger happy?

1060
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:32,504
[SPEAKER_03]: No pun intended.

1061
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we really this trigger happy to arrest people?

1062
01:06:34,326 --> 01:06:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm thinking like, you know, I did this.

1063
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:37,749
[SPEAKER_03]: You did this.

1064
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:38,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

1065
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami's raising his hand, you know.

1066
01:06:41,499 --> 01:06:41,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it in Unreal.

1067
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We were playing Laser Tag.

1068
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:57,106
[SPEAKER_03]: and shoot people a lot in video games.

1069
01:06:57,587 --> 01:07:00,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not actually going to shoot a real person.

1070
01:07:00,508 --> 01:07:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a smart, intelligent person who knows the difference.

1071
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:06,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And even still, 99.99% of the population is like me.

1072
01:07:06,952 --> 01:07:08,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Counter-Strike does not make you a killer.

1073
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:10,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even teach you how to shoot a gun.

1074
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:12,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a video game.

1075
01:07:14,558 --> 01:07:16,179
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1076
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1077
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:13,817
[SPEAKER_03]: More gaming news.

1078
01:08:36,505 --> 01:08:37,165
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1079
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:37,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

1080
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:06,678
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Heroes is, again, one of those games on my big list of games I would like to play, but I just don't find the time to play them.

1081
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:08,599
[SPEAKER_03]: But I bet City of Heroes is a lot of fun.

1082
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:09,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever played that?

1083
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,080
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want to.

1084
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to try a demo.

1085
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:13,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Some point.

1086
01:09:14,681 --> 01:09:14,941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1087
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:19,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least I'll have this thing waiting for me whenever I finally play the damn game.

1088
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:21,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Something interesting to come out.

1089
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:23,576
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of neat.

1090
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dance pad for DDR type games or music rhythm games that's using lasers.

1091
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the normal pressure sensors or push button switches and stuff, this one actually uses lasers.

1092
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:38,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you cut the beam, it counts as a button press.

1093
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the brand new Laser Dance Matrix.

1094
01:09:42,226 --> 01:09:42,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a pad.

1095
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:48,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's actually kind of neat about it is it wouldn't really break down, especially since you're not really

1096
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:49,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1097
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:11,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's cool.

1098
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:15,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, definitely, they should actually kind of do this with the arcade games.

1099
01:10:16,288 --> 01:10:18,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It would probably be a whole lot less teching of the pads.

1100
01:10:20,909 --> 01:10:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I never even thought of this idea, and it seems brilliant.

1101
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,931
[SPEAKER_03]: How can this fail unless the laser goes dead?

1102
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:32,673
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, yeah, seriously, there's no way that this laser would, I mean, there's no way for a button to press the fail.

1103
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:36,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at all, unless you just didn't step far enough into the pad.

1104
01:10:36,514 --> 01:10:37,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you kick a laser.

1105
01:10:37,674 --> 01:10:38,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.

1106
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,115
[SPEAKER_01]: How could Blu-ray fail?

1107
01:10:42,124 --> 01:10:42,925
[SPEAKER_04]: This is different.

1108
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you a couple examples.

1109
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:46,348
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not competing laser technology.

1110
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:47,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe there is, but you know what I mean.

1111
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:48,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm joking.

1112
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:49,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser is a laser.

1113
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:54,709
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1114
01:11:14,947 --> 01:11:16,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And that didn't cost anything.

1115
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:18,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can get those at 99-cent stores now.

1116
01:11:19,049 --> 01:11:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I could see that there would be a problem with is if you did happen to bump the laser or something, if it's not in a very protective housing, you could unalign it and then there's some calibration issues or maybe light interference from other things.

1117
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:41,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's able to detect a certain wavelength of light or something like that, then it probably would work pretty well.

1118
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:42,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1119
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:46,146
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun in chat says, doesn't anybody else here remember the Sega Activator?

1120
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:46,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucked ass.

1121
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:47,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that run on lasers?

1122
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all infrared, though.

1123
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: That's infrared.

1124
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:51,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Infrared's different, right?

1125
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:55,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Infrared's low frequency, and it would, you know, it's not exactly a beam.

1126
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:57,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of just kind of a light source, almost.

1127
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, isn't that like, um, because the Wii... It's like the Paraparaparadise pad.

1128
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:02,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Wii, right?

1129
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that little Wii thing that's on top of your TV?

1130
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:05,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that infrared?

1131
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's infrared as well.

1132
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:11,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck they don't have a calibration thing on that is beyond me.

1133
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Nintendo!

1134
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:14,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense!

1135
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:18,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Now our chatroom is full of LaserCats jokes as well.

1136
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:20,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, everything from that sketch.

1137
01:12:20,705 --> 01:12:24,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we've talked about LaserCats the game on the program before.

1138
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:33,673
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that will definitively end the next-gen war will be the console that can get LaserCats the game as an exclusive will be the winner of the next-gen war in the OLR book.

1139
01:12:34,294 --> 01:12:36,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Frickin' LaserBeans on some frickin' cats.

1140
01:12:36,255 --> 01:12:37,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that too hard to ask?

1141
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: What if it's like the PlayStation 2?

1142
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the PlayStation 2 wins the next-gen war.

1143
01:12:44,685 --> 01:12:45,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy any of them.

1144
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:46,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your PS2.

1145
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:47,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It has laser cats.

1146
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, whoever gets laser cats wins.

1147
01:12:52,352 --> 01:12:52,633
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1148
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:57,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're a winner for listening to Orange Lounge Radio, but we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1149
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:06,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in a couple days with our Part B. This way we spread the OLR love throughout the week.

1150
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:12,015
[SPEAKER_03]: those of you listening live don't have to wait quite as long we'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio
