Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, May 6, 2007, another DS game has the bubble bubble curse of brokenness,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Microsoft locks down on region control,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and an old Commodore 64 classic returns to the Nintendo Wii.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hi.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How are you doing Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Alright, we'll leave it at that then I guess.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, I'm goofy.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Did you have a good week?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sort of. The parts that I wasn't at work were okay.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's good, I guess. Work is always good.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is there anybody who really, truly just says like,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
oh, I love every single minute at work, I just want to live there if I could?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will when I quit.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because then I'll be working full time as a massage therapist,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which means I'll be working 13 hours a week.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, don't get me wrong-

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Making $60,000.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shut, don't rub it in.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love my job, I do, but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
it's a very exhausting job, what I do, so I enjoy that time when I get to come home.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And even massage therapy, I know that's really exhausting

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
because I remember when you were doing your test thing on me,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you were like breaking out in a sweat when you were done.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And it was just like, all you did was-

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It doesn't matter how cold it is, come on.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was just because you're so hot and sexy.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's Tech Master Loki with a smart-ass mouth as usual.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi, Loki.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hello.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look at my wrist, you see I have swelling on my wrist again.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm doing massage therapy.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know part of it was because I was so hot and sexy,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but I was like, I did not know that dark Sakura touching my butt

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
would make her break out in a sweat.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to go ahead and say this.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Actually, giving an hour of massage is an actual anaerobic workout,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
as well as strength training.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You actually burn close to 320 calories doing an hour of massage.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, it doesn't surprise me when you stop to think about it.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm like, oh yeah, like when I give other people massages,

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
like you're doing-

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why do you think I was fucking eating whatever I wanted to

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
while I was in school?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because I was giving hour massages at least four times a week,

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
especially when I was doing my finals.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
DDR not needed for you.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hell no, now I'm like, I've only been doing a couple of this.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I need to go play DDR.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, there's another smart-ass voice in studio tonight,

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and that could only belong to the one and only Drew Nami is back tonight.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Boys and girls, say hello to Drew Nami.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How are you doing?

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, I'm all right.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Excellent.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, and we're here in Orange Lounge Radio's chat room,

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but I noticed my chat room hasn't updated in a few seconds,

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
which might mean, yep, I just got disconnected.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go figure.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There you go.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Live radio.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bye, guys.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I just pinged out of chat.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Live radio, boys and girls, what can you do?

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We do tape live Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com,

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
where we run a fully functional 24-hour a day, seven-day a week station

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
with other awesome programming.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For instance, Dark Sakura has a show.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She calls Pump Up the Volume.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sometimes.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sometimes I just call it crap.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And Travis Donovan has a cool little sci-fi show on Saturday nights,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Travis Donovan Live, and brand new shows being piloted right now.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can't say too much more.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Those of you that have been listening on Wednesdays know about it,

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but those of you that don't,

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you're just in the dark for a little while longer while we get the kinks worked out.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So tune in.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Some people like it kinky, though.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Some people like their kinks, and there's nothing wrong with that,

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
nothing wrong with a little kink.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right, there's also nothing wrong with starting off a podcast

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
talking about your gaming week.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As we've been doing ever since we started podcasting back in like January of 2005,

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it's always been how was your gaming week?

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It was kind of dead.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, no, no, no.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I did play some more Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and then Dan took the game back,

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but it's like fucking funny to play it with Deadpool.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So that's all I've been doing.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I was supposed to get my Pokemans,

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but my husband didn't pull through for me and bring me my Pokemans.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Fired!

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I need to trade him in for a more attentive model.

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, I love...

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What?

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now you make it sound like you're trading Pokemans.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm going to trade a level 32 Dan for...

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, he's level 31.

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Level 69 boobs.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, no, no.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll trade in my Dan for your Drew Barrymore.

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No.

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, you're David Tennant.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There you go.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But no.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But it's...

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been listening to other people talk about their Pokemans,

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and I want to show you mine.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't have mine yet.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I've been playing...

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I've been really, really fucking pissed off at Twilight Zone.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a pinball.

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because Twilight Zone is awesome, and I can get in the zone,

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and then it's like, you're in the zone, train.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm so sad.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Multiball.

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, drain.

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Bitch.

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And Dan finally fixed our little problem we had on our Guns N' Roses.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Kyle Snyder is in chat.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Kyle's been listening to us for a while, and of course we know him from the DDR days.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He says, Pokemon is dead to me.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm wondering what happened.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You should let me show you my Pokemans.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I wonder why...

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why, Kyle, is Pokemon dead to you?

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A lot of folks have been eating this game up.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's been bringing a lot of people back into the series.

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Maybe some long-time fans feel it's just a little too much.

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I need a new Digimon game.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why do people still play this damn game?

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Seriously.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, look, we added more monsters that look very similar to the other ones.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Buy it again.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
To answer Tigerclaw, by the way, I've been...

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And in fact, buy our new color of DS or something to go along with it.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Tigerclaw, I've been playing on PlayStation 3,

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but we've decided to purchase the Xbox 360 version so that, number one,

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't have to fuck with the stupid 6-axis.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And number two, we have more controllers already,

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
so I can actually have multiplayer in my house.

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Kyle Snyder simply says, I got bored of Pokemon.

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Maybe to support Loki's theory.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Loki, I can't explain the allure of Pokemon.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's kind of like when everybody bought Spice Girls albums, you know, 10 years ago.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's like you don't know why you're buying such crap.

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Everybody didn't.

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everybody didn't buy those.

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look, 7 million people beg to differ.

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Spice World was fucking funny, though.

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was.

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Meatloaf is the bus driver.

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
See, it was really funny.

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But anyway, this is a shitty game out of it, too.

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, my God, the Spice Girls video game is the best party game ever on the PlayStation 1.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If you've ever played the Spice Girls game, it is so horrible because, oh, my God,

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
like the funniest thing ever.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You have the girls, you like choreograph dances,

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and all the girls can like do their dance.

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, we made Stupid Spice, I don't know, the blonde one.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We call her Stupid Spice.

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What we did is we would have her always be a count late,

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and then halfway through the dance, she just gives up and does the little sway back and forth.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then you can have them actually lip sync the song.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's the stupidest game.

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hours of entertainment, especially if you're intoxicated.

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's all I have to say.

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Only Rob.

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Only Rob.

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hi.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Anything else in your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All right.

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How was it?

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
One last thing, sorry.

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dan downloaded that pinball game, the demo of the pinball game,

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and it's okay, but it's very high def.

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Done.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is it just me, or is like nothing ever going to be a substitute for real pinball?

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think that's the game's biggest flaw, is like, yeah, it gets really, really close

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to emulating real pinball, but it's not real pinball.

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Pinmame?

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Even pinmame.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can't play pinmame like I can a real pinball machine.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's just not the same.

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean, it's nothing against the game's ball physics or anything like that,

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which are all done fine, and the graphics are great, but it's not the same.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't explain it.

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's why you have to have a couple thousand dollars on hand

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to buy yourself a pinball machine.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, well.

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What they need to do, they need to make a full-size pinball table

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that has like a really huge LCD or plasma screen in there,

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and then you're just playing it on the actual table.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Actually, there is, in works, using widescreen LCD monitors

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to do an at-home full pinball emulation.

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, exactly.

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Using two screens.

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Exactly as I was saying.

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Anyways.

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Can I say chat real quick?

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Chat's saying Fireboma says Spice World is almost the worst game ever,

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to which Jared Jay says you've obviously not played Night Trap.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Jbmon says Spice World is better than Sonic was for the Wii.

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There you have it.

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sorry, Loki.

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Go ahead.

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's sad.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So this week, I played, of course, More Earth Defense Force 2017.

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A lot less of it, though, because I've been trying to set up

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
a network at our work with both my 360 and my friend Sean's 360,

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but for some reason, it just does not want to work.

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's defying all logic and everything.

237
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We're hooking it up correctly, and it's just like, no.

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
One of them wants to see the network,

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and the other one doesn't.

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It doesn't make any sense.

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So whatever.

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We'll have to fix that later.

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But we've also been playing.

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I played a little bit of Boom Boom Rocket today,

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and that was kind of fun,

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and just working through some of the medium-leveled stuff

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
so I can get a little higher on the leaderboards there.

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then a little bit of Crackdown.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Crackdown's still fun.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You know, I think I still have a top 100 score on Boom Boom Rocket

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
for the grand leaderboards,

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and yet still there is someone on my friends list who outranks me.

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
PK or Uno, I am going to beat your ass at Boom Boom Rocket.

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Mark my words.

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I will keep practicing until I take down your score.

256
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But now we're looking at maybe picking up a copy of Saints Row

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so we can do some Saints Row multiplayer on the two consoles as well.

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know how much fun two-player multiplayer will be,

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but it sounds fun.

260
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So that'll tide us over until Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, that game will be awesome.

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm pissed off now.

266
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why?

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SSG 100 Matt, the only great game on Sega CD apart from Sonic CD

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
was not fucking Night Trap.

269
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There was Popful Mail.

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There was Silfied, Revenge of the Ninja, Microcosm.

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, there was Sewer Shark, but that doesn't count either.

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And all the Lunar games.

273
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So you know what?

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Shut up.

275
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Wait.

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He's saying there were no good.

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then Night Trap.

278
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Was a good game?

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Was the only other good game.

280
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm like, the fuck it was.

281
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I've got the same.

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Night Trap wasn't even a good game.

283
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It had Dana Play-Doh in it.

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Shit.

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It didn't have boobies in it.

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, because it was Dana Play-Doh,

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but she didn't have very big boobies.

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, there you go.

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean, that's instantly in the good game section.

290
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But I've got the 32X one, actually.

291
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, well, there you go.

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, the Terminator game was good, too.

293
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The 32X is crap.

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey, Chaotix kidnapped you.

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No, it did not.

296
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, it did.

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, my God.

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Chaotix was awful.

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And Calibri.

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Did you play Calibri?

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wasn't there an Echo game that was 32X compatible?

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There was, but it wasn't very good.

304
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I just mostly played Chaotix.

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Jamie?

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Afterburner.

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Jamie?

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I love you.

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Calibri sucks.

311
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Calibri was cute.

312
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But, no, Afterburner and, uh, fuck, Space Harrier for 32X.

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And they said it was a flop.

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And they were the actual arcade versions.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was really fucking cool.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Anyway.

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was really lame.

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was like, why the fuck are they chained to each other?

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And this is so awful.

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's just like a fucking anchor being dragged behind the guy.

321
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It was a horrible, horrible game.

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's the Bionic Commando Factor.

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sonic Crackers, anyone?

324
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That works.

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That works.

326
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Anyway.

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Of course, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories because that game never gets old.

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Although, we still get pissed off at each other.

329
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A lot.

330
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Me, I've been playing WoW off and on.

331
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Some Neverwinter Nights 2 and some Unreal Tournament.

332
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Just kind of a return to old school stuff.

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No, I am not an addict.

334
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I do not plan to be an addict, but I still play WoW.

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My gaming week was somewhat very similar to Jiranami's.

336
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I played pretty much nothing but WoW all week.

337
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm hit to level 49.

338
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess there's that.

339
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know.

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Big WoW, huh?

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I actually have not been doing a lot of console gaming this week.

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's kind of sad.

343
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Like, I played the pinball game at least one more time.

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like, twice or something.

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
To just kind of see if I liked it.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I tried the demo for the mini golf game.

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hated it.

348
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I've just never liked mini golf games on consoles.

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's just not the same.

350
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's like pinball.

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's my review for everything this week.

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not the same as the real thing.

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Here's the problem though with it.

354
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They really fucked up this whole thing when they went 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's really lame now.

356
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
See, 3D Ultra Mini Golf was pretty fun.

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because you can play against other people.

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They even had some modes that people would create and stuff in it.

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My favorite was if I was doing bad, I just hit someone's ball across the entire course.

360
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And that was worth it right there.

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was awesome.

362
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know.

363
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The game's okay.

364
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Graphically.

365
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's very creative.

366
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A lot of the holes are very creative.

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's certainly not your typical mini golf game.

368
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But, I don't know.

369
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I wasn't feeling it for some reason.

370
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So, I didn't buy the full version.

371
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I really wanted to try Catan, but the demo wasn't working and I guess they fixed it now.

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So, I need to go back and try it.

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because I've heard lots of great things about Catan.

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was either on my Twitter or live journal.

375
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Somebody compared it to Civilization.

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I was like, sold!

377
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So, I definitely want to check that out.

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because Civilization is my favorite PC game ever.

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Ever.

380
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know what?

381
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The other game is exactly like Civilization.

382
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Civ 1.

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Civ 1 for life.

384
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You know what?

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Other games exactly like Civilization.

386
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What?

387
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Spice World.

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Totally like Civilization.

389
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Go fuck yourself, monkey.

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You gotta go buy it now.

391
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Just go fuck yourself.

392
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I guess that's it.

393
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I haven't really been playing a whole lot else.

394
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm trying to think.

395
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, I tried the demo.

396
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Because I got a new monitor for my computer.

397
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I finally got a widescreen monitor.

398
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Which, by the way, is working out great for the show.

399
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because I can have all the windows up at once.

400
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I was like, oh, it's really pretty.

401
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I want to download movies.

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I want to download other games.

403
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I want to see how.

404
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because widescreen and wow.

405
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh.

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Fap, fap, fap.

407
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's beautiful.

408
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's so awesome.

409
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't even explain it.

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I wanted to try other stuff.

411
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, I was like, I'll try a driving game.

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So, I tried to download the Need for Speed Carbon demo for the PC.

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Crashed on me.

414
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like, I was about ready to get to where I'd actually race.

415
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Crashed on me.

416
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And, like, I'm sorry.

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But I'm not going to sit here and troubleshoot a demo.

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So, I just deleted it.

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Which is sad because I had a Ladytron track in it.

420
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I like Ladytron a lot.

421
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's exactly what I did with that Dance Online.

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Crash sent me away.

423
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah, fuck it.

424
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I ain't going to play.

425
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dance Online I was able to play.

426
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's just something corrupted wanting to download.

427
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm like, I'm not downloading this thing yet.

428
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All right.

429
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Get the Command and Conquer 3 demo.

430
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It works with widescreen.

431
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, it did download, though.

432
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I downloaded eDuke, which is a modified version of Duke Nukem 3D that works on Windows XP.

433
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh.

434
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That I want to check out.

435
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That might be pretty fun.

436
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That might be very fun.

437
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you play it over the internet or something?

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think so.

439
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh my god.

440
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Loki, we need to play this game.

441
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And they also have, like, a high-res pack that you can do where all the monsters are

442
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
made into, like, 3D and stuff.

443
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They kind of, like, Quake-ified it.

444
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, Dark Soccer, I have to ask your opinion on this.

445
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,520
I'm not sure who got the job on this topic, but JVMon is saying, I would cream for a Doctor

446
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Who MMO.

447
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,040
That's not entirely possible unless they set it before the current series, because there's

448
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,140
only one Time Lord now.

449
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,160
So you couldn't, like, go around in your own TARDIS or anything.

450
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,200
What if they did something a while back or something else?

451
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Who knows?

452
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,880
If it was pre-movie, it'd be possible, but it wouldn't work.

453
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,520
And I really, really doubt that they'd let something like that out now, given the attention

454
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,680
to continuity.

455
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't you get a little nervous, too, when you hear, like, your favorite shows or whatever

456
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,880
are going to be turned into games?

457
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,680
Like, you know, they're talking about turning Heroes into a video game now, because, you

458
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,440
know, the show's been very successful, and I love me some Heroes, but I get very nervous

459
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,800
about a Heroes video game.

460
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,240
If they said EA's making a Heroes game, that might be a little more confident in saying

461
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,040
SNK's making a Heroes game, which would never happen, because that's neither, you know,

462
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Metal Slug, Art of Fighting, King of Fighters, it's none of those, and it's not a game that

463
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,640
they've already made, so obviously that wouldn't be one of their games.

464
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,620
Oh, cue what brings up a good point, 24 the game, like, okay, yeah, 24 didn't work out

465
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
so well.

466
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,720
Well, here's the problem, they made a game that took place between Seasons 2 and 3, and

467
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,040
it came out, like, after Season 5 or 4 or something like that, so it's like, wow, this

468
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
is a little old.

469
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,640
All right, before we get into gaming news this week, I noticed the chat room is all

470
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,680
stuck on Spider-Man 3, like, you know, here we are, like, almost 20 minutes into the show,

471
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,600
they're still talking about Spider-Man 3 as they were before the show started tonight,

472
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,960
even though we're a video game show, but I see, Spider-Man 3 is not a game, it's a horrible

473
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
review.

474
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Spider-Man 3 is a popular part of culture.

475
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Horrible reviews.

476
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Really?

477
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah, the game I was reading, like, PlayStation 2 game, they said it just looked like crap,

478
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,520
the PlayStation 3 one was just getting average reviews, it was just horrible, usually the

479
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,040
Spider-Man games, it was just like, everyone, you know.

480
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,800
Speaking of things people love and turning them into bastardized video games.

481
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Yeah.

482
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, I mean, it had potential, but, like, even they were showing, like, the Wii version

483
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,560
of it and stuff, and, you know, half of Brooklyn Bridge would be not even there, it's just,

484
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,340
you know, stuff like that, none of the buildings had textures on them and stuff like that.

485
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,160
I feel like one of the non-cool kids, because I didn't bother to see the movie this weekend,

486
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
but I hate seeing movies opening weekend.

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,560
Like, it used to be the cool thing to do, but I just, I hate teenagers at the theater.

488
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
No offense to the teenagers that listen to this show, I'm sure you guys know how to be

489
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,040
respectful, but unfortunately, not all teenagers of the world can be, it just ruins it for

490
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
me.

491
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
I went yesterday and I had a fairly quiet theater, there was one child that started

492
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,000
crying and the parent escorted him out.

493
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Good.

494
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,480
And one phone that went off there, everyone pretty much, you know, turned around and said,

495
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
turn that fucker off!

496
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
I can top that.

497
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,880
We had a work screening and one dumb bitch at my work dropped her kids off at the screening

498
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,360
and one of her kids was recording the film with his camera phone, to which Nellie turned

499
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
him in.

500
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,000
I love your wife, I really do.

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,280
And the manager came over to him and told him to turn off the phone, that's it.

502
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,400
I was hoping that he'd be dragged out and parents called and stuff like that, but unfortunately

503
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
that didn't happen.

504
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,160
Because management is afraid to be mean because they'll get sued or something.

505
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh, I punched the fuck.

506
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,240
I punched the kid in the face and then dragged him out by his hair.

507
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
You know what?

508
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,320
Instead of telling the manager, you should have called the RIAA or whatever, or not,

509
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
not, sorry.

510
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Not the MPAA.

511
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Not down here real quick!

512
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Sorry, the MPAA.

513
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,240
Sorry, boy, I'm going to get hate mail for that mistake.

514
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,520
All right, anyway, all right, sorry, enough about movies.

515
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,000
Moving on to, wait, I'm looking at, actually I'm looking at Chet, let's see, Blaze says,

516
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
I'm a teen and I hate a lot of teens that go to the movies.

517
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,280
Footy Monster says, I hate, hate, hate, hate teenagers.

518
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,920
And Jack Ransom responds to that saying, we hate, hate, hate you.

519
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,320
Come join in the love.

520
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,800
Chat.orangesontrader.com, live on this Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time.

521
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,440
Well, I remember when I was their age and stuff going, man, I don't act like that.

522
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,000
And now I go, man, I never acted like that, I just don't understand it.

523
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,160
Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just say when I was your age?

524
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Yes.

525
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,520
Because that was like almost 10 years ago.

526
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
You're old.

527
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
We're all old.

528
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
All right, anyhow.

529
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
No, I know.

530
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,760
We were, and Jared Jay says, well, we were all teenagers at one point.

531
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah, but I wasn't a jackass, exactly.

532
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
That's what I'm saying.

533
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,760
Probably the people listening to this show, I would hope, if you're smart enough to download

534
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,420
this show or listen live, you're probably smart enough to not be a jackass at the theater.

535
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
So I'm not talking about you.

536
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Wait, Rob.

537
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm talking about.

538
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

539
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
I was never a teenager.

540
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
This is craziness.

541
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Calling me a teenager.

542
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
What?

543
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Are you 12?

544
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
I was never a teenager.

545
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Are you 12?

546
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Only if you're 12.

547
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
It's all about the jocks.

548
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,160
It's always the jocks that are the problems of everything, and the nerds get the rap for

549
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
it.

550
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Nerds.

551
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Sorry.

552
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,600
Did I ever tell you, did I ever tell the Grudge story on this show when I went to go

553
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
see the Grudge?

554
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I think I was with you.

555
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Several times.

556
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Really?

557
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Okay, then I'm not going to tell it again.

558
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Yeah, I was with you.

559
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Tell it again, though.

560
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Tell it better.

561
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I wasn't there.

562
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I thought you were.

563
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
No.

564
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Okay.

565
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
When we saw the Grudge, were you there, Loki?

566
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I was there.

567
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
You tell it.

568
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I don't remember.

569
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Okay.

570
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Okay.

571
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I wasn't even there, and I remember this fucking story.

572
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
All right.

573
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
Some people were in the back, what, talking and hooting at the movie and being assholes.

574
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,880
They were doing that thing that jocks do, yeah, they're going, oh my god, I'm so scared.

575
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,700
Like through the whole end of the movie, through the scary parts, like they're trying to impress

576
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
their girlfriends.

577
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,360
Like, you know how jocks talk to each other?

578
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,720
Any girl that's impressed by that, by the way, needs to fucking get shot.

579
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
So it was a sold out theater, right?

580
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,580
It was a sold out theater, and the jocks in the back, so I don't know if it's the Rocky

581
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,340
Horror Picture Show goer in me or whatever, but I'm not afraid to yell in a crowded theater.

582
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,700
So I turned around and I yelled out, would the man with the little penis in the back

583
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,280
row please shut the fuck up?

584
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,000
And the entire audience started applauding, because you know they were all sick of it,

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
they just didn't want to say anything about it.

586
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,840
So I yelled that out, everybody applauded, and he shut the fuck up.

587
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,680
And yet you hear these girls in the back start going, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, because

588
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
his girlfriend knew it was true.

589
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
So it was great.

590
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,480
It was a good time, good time.

591
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,600
So maybe I should go to the movies more often on opening weekend, because I'm not afraid

592
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,240
to yell at people while the movie's going on.

593
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,160
Sometimes it is fun to yell at movies, like I remember when we went and saw, work screening

594
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,880
again because I wouldn't pay to see this, Charlie's Angels 2, and I will never forget

595
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,200
the one moment in the movie where it's just like, okay, you can kind of suspend disbelief

596
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,280
for a lot of the movie and stuff, but when the fucking, there's a boat exploding and

597
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,900
they grab ahold of this rope and get pulled up through the ceiling and shrapnel from the

598
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:36,480
explosion causes wood to splinter into snowboard-shaped pieces of wood to which the girls land on

599
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,160
those and then grind down the ropes from the ship to the dock, and I was like, oh, really?

600
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Come on.

601
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Yeah.

602
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Yeah, really.

603
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,760
It was almost like The Transporter, but The Transporter, though, you expect that.

604
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,320
You see, there are right movies to MST and there are wrong movies to MST.

605
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,880
MST and Charlie's Angels, yeah.

606
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,240
Or Snakes on a Plane, hell yeah.

607
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,600
There's some movies that you just have to see that are bad.

608
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
No, you have to give some respect to movies like 300.

609
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Or the end of the Premonition where I started busting up laughing because it was so stupid,

610
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,360
or the end of Fracture where it was just like, wow, nothing really happened in the entire

611
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
movie.

612
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
So next on Movie Chat.

613
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Sorry.

614
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,960
You know what?

615
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
It's all right to get off topic once in a while.

616
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I know.

617
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Embrace it.

618
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.

619
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Remember last week?

620
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,960
We tried not to give a shit and people hated it.

621
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
Oh, speaking of Mr. Sandstorm 3000, I got a new tape, or not tape, a DVD from work.

622
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,840
Apparently the guys that do it are starting a new series.

623
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Oh, yeah.

624
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Oh, really?

625
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,160
I don't remember what it's called now because I don't have the disc in front of me, but

626
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,680
there is a new series coming out.

627
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Cool.

628
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
They have a website, but I don't know.

629
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Does it have mics?

630
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Research it.

631
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah.

632
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Chat feedback real quick.

633
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,520
Bandit says, it might have been his mom laughing.

634
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,680
I fucking love Chat.

635
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,960
Her jeans.

636
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,440
Tigerclaw says, Sky, and they didn't yell back at you saying, you shut the fuck up.

637
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,320
No, they didn't because the entire audience applauded.

638
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,000
If that didn't happen, maybe they would have, but yeah.

639
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Anyway.

640
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
There you go.

641
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
All right.

642
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How about game news?

643
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
No.

644
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How about housekeeping?

645
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Real quick.

646
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Some housekeeping.

647
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,080
We announced it at the end of last week's show, but we wanted to say upfront, or at

648
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,640
least 25 minutes once Movie Chat's done, we wanted to say that we are going to be live

649
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
at Fauna Mae again this year.

650
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,600
We're really excited about that.

651
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,280
Fauna Mae Convention happens in San Jose, California at their convention center over

652
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,600
Memorial Day weekend.

653
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,480
This year we only have one panel, not two.

654
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,320
We're not going to do a general podcasting panel, but that's all right because we're

655
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,600
still going to record our show live, and it happens at 2 p.m. on Saturday, so we hope

656
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,520
that a lot of you guys will come out and say hello and make plans to come see us at Fauna

657
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Mae.

658
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,560
We'll all be there, so we're excited.

659
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
So that's it.

660
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,960
Let's get into some gaming news.

661
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,240
Well, I have some news, and this is very interesting stuff.

662
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,640
Now the PlayStation 3 store is starting to stock PlayStation 1 games.

663
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,640
We have Two Extreme, Crash Bandicoot, Destruction Derby, Jet Moto, Jumping Flash, which I fucking

664
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,760
love Jumping Flash, Medieval, Rally Cross, Siphon Filter, which is actually a good game,

665
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:26,520
Back in 2, and Wipeout, so you will actually be able to share your PSP games between the

666
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,280
handheld and the PS3, so you'll keep your save games with you.

667
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,680
You can play them at work, play them at home.

668
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,440
It has not yet been confirmed for Europe, however, so we just got to wait.

669
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,800
However, these downloads are $5.99 a piece.

670
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,640
They've had them up for the PSP for a while, and it's always kind of weird how you had

671
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,080
to have the PS3 to download the ones for the PSP, which didn't make any sense, and now

672
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,040
with the new version 1.7 patch that they had for the firmware on the PS3, now you can actually

673
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,120
play them on the PlayStation 3 instead of just on the PSP.

674
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,280
I just think it's good that your saves are going to work between the two.

675
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,400
Well, that's kind of nice, and it's also nice that there's something to actually download

676
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,640
on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.

677
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,120
You know, there was a system that tried to do this before, not necessarily with having

678
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,660
the handheld version, but remember the Neo Geo tried to do this before with the arcade

679
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,120
versions and with the AVS.

680
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Well, there's also the TurboGrafx-16.

681
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,880
No, the TurboGrafx didn't have arcade compatibility.

682
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Well, they had the Turbo Duo, though, or the Turbo Express.

683
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,520
The Turbo Express had no way to transfer the saves between the systems.

684
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,800
Well, I thought it was on the cartridges, though.

685
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,680
Well, yeah, I mean, but that's like playing with your Super Game Boy.

686
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,320
Well, I guess it would be the same as the Nomad in Genesis.

687
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,800
Yeah, it's the same as the Nomad.

688
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,840
In this case, though, it was having your, you know, bringing home your arcade game to

689
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,720
play on your arcade version at home.

690
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Too different.

691
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Hello.

692
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Bandit in our chat room says, great, now I can use my $600 investment to play really

693
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
old PS1 games.

694
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Great, thanks, Sony.

695
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,840
Dude, I love Jumping Flash, shut up.

696
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
That's what it was.

697
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Okay, sorry to interject this real quick.

698
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
The Film Crew is what the new thing is called, the new series.

699
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,640
It stars Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett, and Mike Nelson.

700
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Thanks.

701
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
How about some game news?

702
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,920
Okay, now, Mr. Demanding, anyways, so, also tying in with the PlayStation 3, home beta

703
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,680
has finally kicked off in both the US and UK.

704
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,080
Look, I just don't care if it doesn't have Tom Servo, okay?

705
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,520
Okay, so, a lot of people are getting to try out the brand new free, you know, Avatar system

706
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:53,520
that's very similar to The Sims, and everybody's saying, oh, it's so much better than Xbox

707
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,000
Live, yay.

708
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,400
I thought they all had to sign an NDA to get in that.

709
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,880
Oh, well, they did, but, you know, they can still say that they're part of this, you know,

710
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,240
this and that, it's awesome, because, you know, awesome is not covered under the NDA,

711
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:17,160
so, I don't know, but, apparently, also, there's gonna be some more entries into the beta coming

712
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
out soon.

713
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,200
If you really wanna get into the beta, you need to make sure that you register your PlayStation

714
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,640
3 with Sony, which I haven't done yet, so, I need to do that, and then, it's all random

715
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,640
from there, so, good luck.

716
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,320
Hopefully you get to try out the home beta before everybody else, not that I, personally,

717
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,800
I don't really care, I'll just wait for it to be done, and it won't be working correctly

718
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,480
when it is done anyways, because everybody likes to patch shit.

719
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,840
Well, it is in beta, it's early.

720
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
True.

721
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,400
The Rob D., by the way, says, Kevin Murphy is Tom Servo, so he's trying to pwn me there,

722
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
but, whatever.

723
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,040
Does he have a giant underwear collection?

724
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
I think not.

725
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,760
Alright, moving on.

726
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Please do.

727
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:12,640
Speaking of playing old PlayStation 1 games on the PlayStation 3, I think it's very interesting

728
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,240
because Masaya Matsura created, of course, Parappa the Rappa, he also created a little

729
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,040
game we love called Vib-Ribbon, which is awesome, I'm very excited.

730
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,120
Matsura was actually hinting that, possibly, Vib-Ribbon might be on its way to the PlayStation

731
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
network.

732
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Hey!

733
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,760
Parappa the Rappa is very similar in idea to Vib-Ribbon.

734
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,960
It's about analyzing audio and creating a game from that data, but it uses MP3 audio

735
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,360
instead of CDs.

736
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,200
We are discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of Vib-Ribbon for Sony,

737
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
but I don't know yet.

738
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,440
Sony only recently launched their downloadable service in Japan, so we kind of need to wait

739
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,360
a while before releasing a title with that kind of appeal.

740
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
That would be awesome.

741
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,880
Vib-Ribbon, if you've never played it, is so friggin' cute.

742
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm so glad I lucked into my copy, because I paid enough for it too, didn't I?

743
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,600
I think so, didn't it go into Best Hits in Japan, though, eventually?

744
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I can't remember.

745
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,880
Well, I bought an original for like 50 bucks used, but then again, this is fucking cool.

746
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,160
At the time, yeah, it was absolutely worth it.

747
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,640
The cool thing about it, though, is that you could use any CD with it, and although the

748
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
results were somewhat mixed, it was just kind of fun.

749
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
What did we try to do?

750
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
We tried Max 300.

751
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Yeah, it was better than Dance Factory.

752
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
That was fun.

753
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Picture-writing stuff.

754
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,840
No, we did Dropout.

755
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,240
That was what we used.

756
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,560
We tried to play it to Dropout.

757
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Good times.

758
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Good times.

759
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
So I hope this happens.

760
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,320
That would be a really fun game for PlayStation Network, certainly better than the Duck game.

761
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:43,600
Well, there is in process, excuse me for a moment while I breathe again, they're talking

762
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,360
about a new Dead or Alive, a Mega Man, and Kingdom Hearts for PS3.

763
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,660
In the last issue of EGM Magazine, there were these rumors coming out.

764
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:04,880
So Team Ninja has an exclusive for a new Dead or Alive for the PS3, and there's also the

765
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,400
notice that Capcom is working on a new, actually not a new Mega Man, they were updating the

766
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,320
original Mega Man with new graphics for a download.

767
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,120
And Nippon Ichi is working on a new Disgaea for PS3.

768
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,440
So it's basically Mega Man, powered up Mega Man, except without a giant head, hopefully.

769
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,200
Let's hope.

770
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Because he had a giant fucking head in the game.

771
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,000
And we're pretty much sure, you know, Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be PS3.

772
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Anyways, so there is some new stuff coming out, also from Square, actually.

773
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,520
They're talking a little bit about Kingdom Hearts, and of course the next progression

774
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,120
for it, apparently, is going to be a portable spin-off and not Kingdom Hearts 3, although

775
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm assuming Kingdom Hearts 3 is probably in the works as well, but the next game you'll

776
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,320
see will be a portable spin-off.

777
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,280
And no word exactly what it's going to be, I'm sure we'll find out a little bit more

778
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,780
after the whole Square Enix press party or whatever they have in Fan Party.

779
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,880
So hopefully we'll hear a little bit more about that, because I know it wasn't a chain

780
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
of memories or whatever, didn't that suck really bad?

781
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Chain of Memories is a different game.

782
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:33,800
I do not recommend playing it on a DS Micro, not DS, the Game Boy Advance Micro, but it

783
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,520
wasn't that bad, I'm actually looking forward to the PS2 version.

784
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
I don't know.

785
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,040
They just, don't fuck it up, please.

786
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,880
Most people play Kingdom Hearts for the, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memory for the story, not

787
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
the game.

788
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
I'm glad they played it for something.

789
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:59,520
Alright, well, last week somebody listened to us, apparently, or somebody had the same

790
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,620
idea, because remember when last week we talked about the whole God of War promotional thing

791
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,220
in the UK, they had the goat with the head chopped off and all that stuff, remember that?

792
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,200
And I said, somebody should email PETA?

793
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,320
Well somebody did!

794
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,360
Somebody somehow told PETA what was going on, I don't know if that's because of this

795
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
show or what, I'm sure somebody else had the same idea.

796
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,480
But PETA did post in their, I guess, official blog, it looks like it's just one guy that

797
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,260
runs it, but they have a blog over at blog.peta.com, somebody actually posted about it, and basically

798
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,040
what it came down to is that they sort of said, PETA said they're kind of not going

799
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,900
to do anything about it, that it's obviously an idiotic thing, they would not name the

800
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,800
game in the blog entry because they have no desire to help them promote it, and they noticed

801
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,660
that Sony obviously apologized for it and Sony is recalling the magazine and everything,

802
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,520
but PETA was just kind of going, just kind of like shaking their head disapprovingly.

803
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,440
But what was interesting is they took a squeak at Jack Thompson in the little blog post,

804
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,320
which was kind of cool, because in the blog post the author said, quote, always sided

805
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,420
with the video game industry against the Jack Thompsons of the world who are out to make

806
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,080
a name for themselves by blaming gamers for all of society's problems.

807
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,760
So that was kind of interesting.

808
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,860
But unfortunately no big pickets out front of Sony headquarters with topless women saying

809
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:22,880
I'd rather be naked than, you know, look at decapitated goats and all that stuff.

810
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Sorry boys.

811
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,560
Hi.

812
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,160
Hello.

813
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:38,280
Well, you know how Taito had that big problem with Bubble Bobble?

814
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,120
You can't get past level 30?

815
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,000
No, never heard of it.

816
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Rob.

817
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Of course.

818
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,600
We made fun of it endlessly on this show.

819
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Well, it's happened to SNK and Capcom Card Fighter Clash for the DS, yeah, which is funny

820
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
because my husband bought the game right when it came out.

821
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,300
So I'm just wondering if you've hit that point yet, and I'm going to laugh.

822
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
You just got Bubble Bobbled.

823
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Apparently, if you go to the ninth floor of the tower through the second playthrough,

824
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,880
the game will crash after you talk to someone named John.

825
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,000
You have to fight him to, you know, of course make it past that area so you're pretty much

826
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,960
just stuck.

827
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,780
No, there is a message from SNK stating that we're going to hear something soon, but nothing

828
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,380
as of yet as far as I know.

829
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:38,620
So let's hope that, more than positive, they're going to recall it or do something for it.

830
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,360
Is the message going to say something along the lines of, we're really fucking sorry we

831
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
didn't beta test this game?

832
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,840
I mean, because when things like this are announced, it makes me think that the game

833
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,640
is so god awful that not even their own internal QA department could play through the ninth

834
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
floor.

835
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,680
I mean, that's seriously the impression that I get about the game, is that if the game

836
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,440
is so broken that not even their QA department was interested in playing it that far, what

837
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
else am I left to think?

838
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Oh?

839
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,080
Well, it's good enough.

840
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,200
I mean, hell, if the first couple levels worked in them, the whole game's probably good.

841
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,760
I mean, after all, they're not that much different.

842
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
I mean, come on.

843
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
You want me to play through the whole thing?

844
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Whatever.

845
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,080
Well, news about broken video games makes us a little bit angsty, and you know what

846
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,920
that means when we get angsty?

847
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
People die.

848
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:33,640
It's time for the FUs of the week.

849
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,200
Dark Sakura, take it away.

850
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:47,800
You know, FU goes towards certain people in management positions at my unlisted place

851
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,560
of employment, and it's not really, you know, again, it's not necessarily a, I'd say it

852
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
was a misthought.

853
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
I'll put it that way.

854
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,600
Assuming that I don't have enough work already to do with the one thing that I was already

855
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
doing.

856
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,680
True, I get a couple days a month where they don't, you know, open as many assignments

857
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,600
to me to finish, and I need extra things to do to keep busy, but I told them right up

858
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,160
front, I was like, look, I'm not going to be able to do all this.

859
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm one person, and I'm sure as hell I'm not going to work overtime, unless you really

860
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,680
want me to work overtime and pay me for it, sure, yeah.

861
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,180
And true enough, you know, I finally said, you know what, if you're going to do this

862
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,040
to me, then I'm just going to let them know when I can't get it all done in one day, and

863
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,600
we'll see what they think of that.

864
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,680
So finally the realization has dawned, and oh my God, she really is only one person.

865
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,320
And while her productivity is amazing, not everybody can do all of this.

866
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,280
So yeah, we're going to not let, you know, this employee go nuts and kill everybody in

867
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
the company.

868
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
So it's going to take a while.

869
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
But the FV just goes to the situation.

870
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Loki.

871
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,920
Uh, FV goes to, I think, my router, because I can't get it to fucking put two 360s together.

872
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,440
It's just, one of them wants to work, the other one doesn't, and there's no rhyme or

873
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
reason to it.

874
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,440
It's just, uh-uh, I don't want to work.

875
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,840
So I guess I've got to buy a Switch instead of purchasing shit.

876
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,440
My FV of the week goes to Survivor, the ride at Great America, where I was at yesterday.

877
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,960
We took a trip for Extraverse Sisters.

878
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,280
I booked this ride out of the park.

879
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I know.

880
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,000
First of all, how the hell do you make a ride out of Survivor?

881
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's pretty cheesy, but whatever.

882
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Is it where you have to starve yourself and make it?

883
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
No, no.

884
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,040
Okay, you start off the ride, like when you're waiting in the queue, the little line before

885
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,760
you actually get on the ride, right?

886
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,120
They make you do, when it's your turn to go next, first you have to do this little tribal

887
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
stomp.

888
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,360
You have to do this stupid ass dance.

889
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,120
Nobody ever does it, but they say you have to do it, right?

890
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,040
And sometimes the little kids will get into it, but that's about it.

891
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,520
And if you don't do it, then you're going to get sprayed in the face with water on the

892
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
ride.

893
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,200
Okay, and you get on the ride, and basically what it is, it's this big disc thing with

894
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,440
a big tribal mask in the middle, right?

895
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,640
It's this big disc thing that goes around like a W-shaped track back and forth, and

896
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
it spins.

897
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
So it's kind of fun.

898
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I mean, Neil, it's really-

899
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,200
It's not something I would hate, is it?

900
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
I don't think you'd hate it.

901
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
It's just different.

902
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
It's certainly not like anything at Disneyland.

903
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,000
It's a different type of ride, but it doesn't go upside down or anything.

904
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,520
But here's the thing.

905
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,080
Sometimes the ride will spray water at you, but at the very end of the ride, I was just

906
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
in the right spot.

907
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,160
There were these huge tiki torches right at the end of the coaster.

908
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,280
The thing shot fire in my face.

909
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,600
So F.U. is a survivor of the ride for shooting fire at me.

910
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,280
That was not funny.

911
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,240
And I scream like a little girl, because seriously, Disneyland is one thing when I get on the

912
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,640
thrill rides where I'm going upside down and just being twisted up like a pretzel on some

913
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,640
of those rides, and getting fire shot in my face on a ride named after a TV show that

914
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,600
jumped the shark five years ago.

915
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Okay?

916
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
F.U.

917
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,800
I bet you'll do the dance next time now, won't you?

918
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Seriously.

919
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Hi, Cheryl.

920
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
We'll teach that fucker a lesson.

921
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Jabooroo.

922
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,640
I'll do the damn dance next time.

923
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,360
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

924
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,880
You know seriously what my first words were when I got off the ride?

925
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,080
I'm like, Jamie would like this ride because it shoots fire.

926
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
I think I would.

927
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,600
When you said shooting fire, I was like, hey, I like fire.

928
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
All right.

929
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
You didn't find it funny.

930
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I found it funny as hell.

931
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Fuego es muy bien.

932
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,480
Fireboma says Skye is used to things being shot in his face.

933
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,240
Zing, my second review of the week goes to Fireboma.

934
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Congratulations.

935
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
You're on me.

936
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
You're on F.U.'s of the week.

937
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,960
F.U. to DS Wi-Fi for being so damn temperamental around my router.

938
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I know it's not my router's fault if it wants to be so restrictive.

939
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
It must be Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.

940
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,240
Also, F.U. to the new patches that are coming out for WoW.

941
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,600
Trying to go on the public test run.

942
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,800
Oh my God, I'm lack-tastic.

943
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Nothing works in my UI.

944
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,520
They've got some serious stuff to fix before they release that publicly.

945
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,160
All right.

946
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,680
Lots of angst in the studio tonight.

947
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,240
You know you're going to get a good show when there's lots of angst in the studio tonight.

948
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Let's kill the music.

949
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,280
Let's get back to some gaming news.

950
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
I don't think so.

951
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,080
Instead, let's go have ice cream.

952
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,880
Ice cream sounds good.

953
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,920
Let's have an ice cream podcast.

954
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
I totally vote for ice cream.

955
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Okay.

956
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Orange Honors Radio is canceled tonight due to ice cream.

957
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,120
Actually, I already had ice cream today.

958
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,680
I can't have ice cream for two weeks.

959
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,840
We'll have ice cream again.

960
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Loki, save us.

961
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,280
Okay, well, the only thing that can combat ice cream is T&A and there is-

962
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Hey, that sounds great.

963
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
Winner!

964
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
I like T&A flavored ice cream.

965
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,600
So there's this wonderful game that's being touted as T&A Pong on Kotaku.

966
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,920
It's actually from a website, I guess, We Make Money Not Art.

967
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,280
And it's, I guess, some woman named Jennifer Choudhuries.

968
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,400
She has an intimate game controller and apparently, she says it's like Pong, but it's not really

969
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
like Pong.

970
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,040
It's more like DDR, I would say.

971
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:16,120
The whole game is basically there's, a woman has a bra controller where you, you know,

972
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,440
grope her and then the guy has like boxers where she grabs his ass.

973
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,560
And you watch the screen.

974
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,640
There's like, first there'll be shapes coming up so, you know, you can grab anywhere.

975
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,400
Then later on, as you progress through levels, there's shapes with other shapes on them,

976
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,480
like star with the circle and stuff.

977
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,500
And you have to grab certain parts and stuff and supposedly, it's supposed to make you

978
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,520
either, you know, piss off because you lose or go have sex.

979
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,400
Personally, it looked very, very, very, very awkward.

980
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,080
So this is a game where even when you lose, you win?

981
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
I guess.

982
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,500
But hey, the way I figure it, you know, if you got some chick in bra and panties already

983
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,080
and you're playing this game and grabbing her boobs, it can't be that bad of a game.

984
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,280
This reminds me of that one boob twirling game they released like two, three years ago.

985
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Oh yeah.

986
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,400
We had to make them twirl in different patterns.

987
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
That was a fun game.

988
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,400
I'm watching the video on here even though I'm not supposed to.

989
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,560
It's really, really stupid.

990
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Okay, here we go.

991
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm going to give the show an explicit tag.

992
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
You ready?

993
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Warning.

994
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,160
The show is intended for mature audiences.

995
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Okay.

996
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,580
Like when you first started talking about this, I kind of picture that maybe the woman

997
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:29,960
like put a wiimote in her twat to navigate the game and it vibrates, right?

998
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
It's not rez.

999
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,480
It is so not rez.

1000
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,800
Would that be like lesbian pong?

1001
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,640
I don't think it's like that at all, but, um, I don't know.

1002
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,520
It's yeah, it's a pretty dumb game.

1003
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,440
They could really take it further though, but, um, apparently they didn't dark soccer.

1004
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,160
Would you play lesbian pong when I need the female perspective here on the show for a

1005
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
minute?

1006
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Yeah.

1007
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
That's a yes.

1008
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,520
You would score, cut, print, saved archives.

1009
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
All right.

1010
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
That's a wrap.

1011
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
All ours over.

1012
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,520
We're off to go play games.

1013
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,160
We're going to, we're off to go create new games for the Wii.

1014
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,280
Nice knowing you for the past five years.

1015
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,640
Lesbian pong has ruined this show.

1016
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Good night.

1017
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,000
No, but seriously though.

1018
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,920
They could put like a, what, what they could do is like, I don't know, make some sort of

1019
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,920
a different game, you know, where they could put more sensors on their bodies or something

1020
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
here.

1021
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
I don't know.

1022
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
No.

1023
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
What they need.

1024
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
Here's what the record.

1025
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
Yeah.

1026
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,180
But now we have an audio clipper saying yes.

1027
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,180
So it's, it's done.

1028
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Okay.

1029
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,240
Here's what they need to do.

1030
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,240
And this, this kind of ties in with that really crappy eye of judgment game.

1031
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,120
They need to have something with the eye toy and the eye of judgment.

1032
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
That's a sex game.

1033
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
There you go.

1034
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,720
Oh dude, the eye of judgment on a sex game.

1035
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
I get it.

1036
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,360
And the Wiimote or, or six axis, right?

1037
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,560
Cause you know, six axis can detect how much you're rocking the boat or, but see then again

1038
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,800
though, you, they have all the USB ports so you can just, you know, hook it up with your

1039
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:12,120
usual USB powered like vibrators and shit and they'll just, you know, there you go.

1040
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:19,720
Total sex package never will happen because it's a dumb idea who the fuck would set up

1041
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,620
all this shit to have sex.

1042
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,620
That's just retarded.

1043
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,040
But then again though, they have all those sex board games and I don't know if that could

1044
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
be fun.

1045
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Um, I wanted to say this real quick, actually, um, the talk about the brown eye of judgment

1046
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,440
actually reminded me, um, I got a private message on my Twitter from a PK or Uno who

1047
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,820
was telling me about another game, um, called Aquarian Age Alternative and he says this

1048
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,960
game is actually kind of fun.

1049
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,480
It's a Japanese arcade game that's actually kind of like the eye of judgment.

1050
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,180
You place real cards on a playing service and you watch as the game senses them and

1051
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,540
react accordingly.

1052
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,880
So I just kind of sent him a message back.

1053
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,160
I'm like, okay, but is it any fun?

1054
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,980
And he says, yeah, it's actually kind of fun because he said, yes, I have.

1055
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,980
It's pretty awesome.

1056
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,120
He says there's a lot of strategy and quick thinking needed and it does sometimes get

1057
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,080
pretty chaotic.

1058
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
That's awesome.

1059
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,600
And it proves once again, Sony didn't come up with an original idea.

1060
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,680
Way to go copying something.

1061
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,680
I don't know.

1062
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,640
I don't know how old this game is, but I hope, um, I'm going to just pimp his vox because

1063
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,560
he has pictures and stuff all over his vox.

1064
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,720
So if you want to see this as PK or Uno dot vox.com, P K E R U N O dot vox.com and he

1065
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,800
has this whole thing, Aquarian Age Alternative.

1066
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Obviously it's out.

1067
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,600
Eye of judgment is not out there for this one came out first.

1068
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:38,320
So they try way to go Sony thinking that we wouldn't find the thing that you copied,

1069
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:44,560
but there you go proves that you're still not original and it's a still a dumb idea.

1070
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,480
There you have it.

1071
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm curious to play it.

1072
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,640
You know, I'll try anything once.

1073
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Anyway, uh, other famous Japanese arcade games, uh, may or may not be coming to the U S uh,

1074
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,560
two DX gold beat mania two DX gold, of course, uh, was tested previously and got some great

1075
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
reception from the music game community.

1076
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,000
Now the challenge is just getting people to pick it up.

1077
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,200
So I'll leave it to a user on Bemani style to try and get the word out.

1078
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,680
And they are trying to, uh, have a campaign, uh, to contact.

1079
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,080
They did a really good job of really breaking this down.

1080
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,820
How do I contact Dave and busters?

1081
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,880
How do I contact tilt arcade game work, six flags, and really break down that we want

1082
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,840
to see beat mania two DX golden arcades.

1083
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,320
I mean, it tells you what to say and everything.

1084
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,560
So, uh, hats off to this user, Brazil, the end, uh, for, and I hope I didn't horribly

1085
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,200
mispronounce that, but hats off to you for breaking that all down.

1086
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,520
And I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to this program because that used

1087
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,840
to be our forte a couple of years ago.

1088
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:51,080
So definitely check out the money styles forums, check out the forums, don't let golf land

1089
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,080
have it.

1090
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
Cause they'll break it.

1091
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Absolutely.

1092
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
Okay.

1093
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,920
And for some reason, your mic's not picking up dark soccer.

1094
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
Is it?

1095
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
That's because it wasn't on.

1096
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
All right.

1097
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
There you go.

1098
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Yeah.

1099
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,480
What I said was don't let golf and have it cause you know, they're going to fuck it up.

1100
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,960
Uh, check out the music game discussion forums on a bimanistyle.com.

1101
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,040
Well, speaking of information that came out on a forum, there's a rumor going on that,

1102
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,880
um, the DDR supernova two North American field test is canceled.

1103
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,320
Um, it was posted by ride 19 on Aaron and Japan's forums.

1104
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,920
Oh, you said, Oh, you saying what's fake.

1105
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
Oh, okay.

1106
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,760
Now, Oh, I thought you said the post is fake.

1107
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,760
You're talking about something else.

1108
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
No, uh, sorry.

1109
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Okay.

1110
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Don't do that to me.

1111
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
Uh, anyway, no.

1112
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,160
Um, well this guy, I think somebody that he works for the arcade that they were going

1113
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,560
to test it at or something.

1114
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,980
So I guess this guy would know, but that kind of sucks.

1115
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,920
You know, I honestly, myself don't put too much stock in something that I read on a forum,

1116
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,040
um, until I see something official put out by, by the company.

1117
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,720
So the only reason I would give a little credit to it is because they have done location tests

1118
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,040
there before that, that same arcade.

1119
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,640
So, you know, I'm, I, I, I was willing to believe it, but I do wonder to myself, did

1120
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,840
Konami pull it back to maybe further tweak the game?

1121
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,880
Maybe it wasn't ready to be tested cause you know, the internet is cruel and the game better

1122
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,160
be damn good or the internet will tear it apart.

1123
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,360
Well, there was also a quote on here, um, apparently a quote from maybe someone at Konami

1124
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,960
because again, this is on a message board, um, stating that, um, in order to prevent

1125
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,920
dissatisfaction of SN2, we have canceled the North American SN2 test site as it may result

1126
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,320
in creating a better dance game.

1127
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
That sounds fishy.

1128
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,760
I don't know about that one.

1129
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
I don't know.

1130
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
I could be wrong.

1131
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,760
All right.

1132
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,060
Cause usually why would a company admit that, Oh, the game kind of sucks right now.

1133
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,200
We're going to, we're going to go back and tweak it.

1134
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
I don't know about that one.

1135
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
I'm starting over.

1136
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,400
See you in 10 years.

1137
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,280
We hope you have a nice play again.

1138
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,600
All right.

1139
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,280
They need to have, they need to just completely make the dance pads more durable.

1140
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,400
Ditter fans are going to have to wait a little long for their ditter.

1141
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
That's that's the, that's what the story is.

1142
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
You can diddle later.

1143
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,760
I mean, didder later anyways.

1144
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,120
So certain, um, there's a few websites out there that got, you know, all excited after

1145
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:21,040
seeing an IGN mock-up of a guitar hero three controller, which I might add that is completely

1146
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,520
fake by the way.

1147
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,100
And it's no indication of what it's actually going to look like.

1148
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:31,440
They have, you know, basically a picture of a white guitar with the Wii remote in the

1149
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,440
neck of the guitar.

1150
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,240
That's, you know, just like before when they mocked up what the classic controller would

1151
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,120
look like completely mocked up.

1152
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,100
You know why I felt that was fake when I first looked at it is because of the way the Wiimote

1153
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,440
is strapped into that control.

1154
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,120
I mean, because basically what they have there is they have this guitar with a hand, you

1155
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
know, with the, what do they call it?

1156
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,320
What do they call the long part of that?

1157
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,320
The neck?

1158
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,320
The neck.

1159
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Okay.

1160
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
Like they have the Wii thing snapping into the neck.

1161
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,720
But the thing is, is that if the Wiimote were to snap in, it'd break the infrared and the

1162
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,320
plugs are on the bottom.

1163
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,200
You can't, you wouldn't snap it in like that.

1164
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,280
You'd have to snap it in either on the bottom of the guitar or something.

1165
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,860
You can't push it in and have it just snap.

1166
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,860
It wouldn't work.

1167
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,240
It'd be too difficult to get in there.

1168
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
Yeah.

1169
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,120
And besides, if I remember correctly, I think they've already said that if, when they do

1170
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,800
release this, there's actually going to be a guitar that's sold separately that'll hook

1171
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
up via USB or something like that.

1172
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,520
So sorry, but that's not what it's going to be.

1173
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,400
It's not going to be something that you strap the Wiimote into.

1174
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,760
It's not like you have to plug the Wiimote into everything.

1175
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
Exactly.

1176
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,600
And I mean, I don't know.

1177
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,240
It's going to be Guitar Hero 3.

1178
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,280
It's just going to be on another fucking console.

1179
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
So woohoo.

1180
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
I know.

1181
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,480
It's like you've never played this game before.

1182
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,720
Well, also my thought is that it wouldn't look like the Gibson guitars because the Gibson

1183
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,020
ones were heard on the PS2.

1184
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,960
For the Xbox 360, we have, what was it, not the Thunderbird, but what was the other Gibson

1185
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,200
guitar that it looks like?

1186
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Flying V?

1187
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,600
No, it doesn't look like a Flying V. But I was going to say, if they were going to do

1188
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,680
it for a different console, wouldn't they have done another guitar like the Flying V

1189
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
or maybe one in the shape of the Les Paul or something?

1190
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,760
Good thought.

1191
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,560
The only thing that would be cool is if this whole guitar rotated, kind of like ZZ Top,

1192
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,300
and then they could have cues where you swing the guitar around type thing.

1193
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,960
Is it too much to ask for one freaking guitar to work on all consoles?

1194
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
No.

1195
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,960
They're all USB.

1196
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,420
Why can't they?

1197
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,240
Why can't they make one universal guitar?

1198
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
That's right.

1199
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,240
That's what I wanted.

1200
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
I know why.

1201
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Money.

1202
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,160
Because they get to sell you fucking more guitars.

1203
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,160
Alright.

1204
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,960
Well, the Queens of the Stone Age, you might know them, they're a band, and they have basically

1205
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,360
confirmed that they are going to be in some games.

1206
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,120
Basically I guess there's a promo ad going around for the band and it's confirming that

1207
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,440
they are going to be appearing in Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

1208
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,440
What song?

1209
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,560
Don't know, but you know the Queens of the Stone Age are going to be in the games.

1210
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,300
By the way, they're also going to be in Madden 08 and NASCAR 08 if you are so inclined to

1211
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,280
play those games instead of Guitar Hero.

1212
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,280
Yay Tracks!

1213
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,280
That's right.

1214
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Yay Tracks!

1215
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,080
And again, I like Junkie XL, so they always have a good Junkie XL track in there.

1216
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,720
And who doesn't love Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend?

1217
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,120
Oh wait, no one.

1218
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,120
Alright.

1219
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Nellie does.

1220
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,280
But she doesn't count.

1221
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Your wife is weird.

1222
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
Alright, anyway.

1223
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,160
She's watched that video so many fucking times.

1224
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,120
I've never even heard it nor seen the video.

1225
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,120
I don't know why she likes the crappy Girlfriend song.

1226
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Here it is.

1227
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
Here it is.

1228
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,760
Hey Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind.

1229
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,040
Hey Mickey, just replace the word Mickey with Girlfriend and that's pretty much the song.

1230
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
Oh.

1231
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Alright.

1232
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,560
Uh, it's time for Jamie Tracks, or in this case, Jamie Websites, because Jamie likes

1233
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,000
to surf the internet up and down every week and find a favorite website of hers to share

1234
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
with y'all.

1235
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,560
Here it is, Dark Soccer's website of the week.

1236
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:01,080
Today's website of the week is, um, it's brought to us by the Adult Swim, which normally I'd

1237
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,800
be like, Adult Swim, meh.

1238
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:10,200
It's great, it's called Bible Fight, it's a Flash game, where it's like Street Fighter

1239
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
with Jesus.

1240
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,080
I actually played a little bit of this game last night, I should have included that in

1241
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,040
my gaming week, and I battled Jesus vs. Satan, it was epic.

1242
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,440
But what's great is that they have special moves, like Jesus throws his thorny crown.

1243
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,440
It's awesome.

1244
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,400
You have Jesus, Eve, Mary, Moses, Noah, and Satan.

1245
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,920
Satan looks kinda hot.

1246
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,400
Wow, get dressed with cards and letters to Jamie at Orange Laundry Radio.

1247
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,920
Eve looks kinda naked.

1248
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,160
How can folks get to this website?

1249
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,680
The website is adultswim.com slash games slash biblefight, that's one word, index.html.

1250
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,600
There you go.

1251
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:58,200
So I'm gonna have Eve versus Mary, so I can see if she's naked.

1252
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
She's got issues.

1253
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,600
No, this is great, she has a snake on one arm and little leaves.

1254
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,800
The typical depiction of Eve, where there's always, Mary looks like she's got PMS.

1255
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,760
There's always like an animal or a fig leaf or something just conveniently placed over

1256
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,260
their naughty bits.

1257
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,240
So it's always kind of interesting.

1258
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,680
She's fighting with a halo over her head and fucking baby Jesus.

1259
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,560
She has 68 sets, and baby Jesus is a weapon, because that'd be awesome.

1260
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,560
Wow.

1261
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,560
We're gonna get the hate mail tonight.

1262
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,120
GS68 says, Westboro will sue.

1263
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,720
Hey, we didn't create it, right?

1264
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
Adult Swim did.

1265
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,000
Go take up your issues with them.

1266
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,240
Anyways, so the NBA has just launched into Second Life.

1267
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,120
Who cares?

1268
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,640
Apparently a lot of people are on Second Life, like it's fucking real world or something,

1269
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,640
you know.

1270
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,260
Ooh, the NBA's on there now.

1271
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,840
So I mean, they're in the real world too.

1272
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:02,680
But apparently you can go there and play horse and basketball and suck it up really bad as

1273
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,800
well.

1274
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,480
I don't know.

1275
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,440
I'm not surprised that more people make money off of this Second Life, but it's interesting

1276
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,440
nonetheless.

1277
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,360
I guess you can play horse and get pelted by penises.

1278
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,400
Jesus, keep the First Life out of Second Life.

1279
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,200
Damn, come on.

1280
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Pretty soon people are gonna get...

1281
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,280
You should put that on a bumper sticker.

1282
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,280
Pretty soon.

1283
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,440
Seriously, that's a pretty good tagline for us, because you're a Second Life player, right?

1284
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,760
From time to time, yeah.

1285
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,880
I thought Second Life was just where people go to have virtual furry sex or something,

1286
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
I mean.

1287
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Not like to play basketball.

1288
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,880
Someone made the TARDIS.

1289
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,480
I'm virtual ass, Loki.

1290
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,640
I'm gonna go into Second Life, I'm gonna play basketball, and then your friend goes, fuck

1291
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,040
that, I'm going outside and playing basketball there, where I don't have to worry about being

1292
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,760
pelted with flying penises.

1293
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,520
Jiranami, response?

1294
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
What the...

1295
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,480
Don't go play in a sandbox, then.

1296
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,440
You don't get that shit if you play in a sandbox zone.

1297
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:13,160
Okay, so don't go playing in a sandbox, because there's a virtual sandbox in Second Life.

1298
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:19,960
If I had that wah wah wah wah sound effect on this program, I would have just used it.

1299
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,800
I don't get it, I mean, what the hell do you do in Second Life?

1300
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,960
Stop.

1301
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,840
Try to find a life?

1302
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,640
No, I don't know.

1303
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,400
I imagine there's lots of people, you know, I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk.

1304
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,440
Look at my cube I just made, it's so awesome!

1305
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,020
Would you buy it for $1000?

1306
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,640
I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk, okay?

1307
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,600
But you know, I guess people play it because it's fun.

1308
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,880
That's what games are, they're fun.

1309
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,960
Furry sex is fun.

1310
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,000
Well, if World of Warcraft weren't set in some sort of fictional medieval time, I'm

1311
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,520
sure the NBA would be there, too.

1312
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,040
Point of Second Life is simple.

1313
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,600
Step one, fly around.

1314
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,360
Step two, do shit.

1315
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,840
Comments from Chatroom.

1316
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,440
The Rob D. makes some comments.

1317
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,380
Is Tim Hardaway there to hate you if you're gay?

1318
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,720
In Second Life, making fun of some earlier controversy.

1319
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,560
Rob D. says, is Dirk Nowitz, I'm totally not going to pronounce this, you're going to see

1320
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,400
how much I totally follow sports.

1321
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,040
The Rob D. says, and is Dirk Nowitzki there to suck in Second Life?

1322
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,440
Kevin the Groove says, in Second Life, you waste your first life.

1323
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Duh!

1324
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,440
There you go, responses from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

1325
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,360
This is a little more interesting of a sports story, I think, I don't know.

1326
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,080
Pro football players will be training with Electronic Arts Madden technology.

1327
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,680
The same technology that's used in Electronic Arts popular Madden games is now being used

1328
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,320
to create a training simulator for professional football players.

1329
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:54,220
XOS Technologies is licensing the TDT engine from EA Sports to use in what's called the

1330
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,440
Play Action Simulator.

1331
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,960
The play action of family of products addresses team demands to uniquely and effectively teach

1332
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,640
new plays and game plans, says Bob Simmons, who is the XOS Coaching Solutions President.

1333
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,120
As the current provider of coaching analysis and game planning solutions to more than 200

1334
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,840
NFL and NCAA football teams, XOS thoroughly understands how teams prepare weekly for an

1335
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,160
upcoming opponent.

1336
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,680
The simulator is built on our TDT engine, which utilizes the same technologies and gameplay

1337
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,920
found in our popular Madden NFL game franchise, said the general manager of EA Tiburon, Steve

1338
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
Chang.

1339
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,800
That's kind of cool, if you're a Madden fan, I bet that's pretty exciting.

1340
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,600
My response would be, what about those poor players who train and then end up with the

1341
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,400
really low ranking in Madden?

1342
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,820
You know Madden ranks all the real players and that's got to suck if you're the lowest

1343
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,820
ranked one.

1344
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,620
I seem to remember a story, either on this show or another show, when Madden 07 first

1345
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,840
came out about the poor guy who was the lowest ranked player in the game.

1346
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:02,600
I guess you didn't use this training simulator enough, who knows?

1347
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
You know what?

1348
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
What?

1349
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,600
What good is an actual simulator anyway?

1350
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,120
It didn't help me become a better driver, I just played Ridge Racer.

1351
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:17,560
I was going to say, you have driving simulators, cops do cop scene simulators, I don't know,

1352
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,200
simulators are there to simulate the real thing.

1353
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,080
What good is that going to do versus actual real experience?

1354
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,040
Well keep in mind there's a lot of strategy in football too.

1355
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,520
Not just the running around and stuff, maybe it has to do with strategy and processing

1356
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,520
it out.

1357
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
Do you just play Tecmo Bowl?

1358
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,720
Yeah I do, Tecmo Bowl, I wanted the engine built on Tecmo Bowl.

1359
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Anyway.

1360
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,720
We can agree on that.

1361
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,920
There is another, why am I getting all the rumors?

1362
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:47,760
There's another rumor floating about that Nintendo of America is going to relocate.

1363
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,460
It was actually posted on Kotaku that employees were told on Thursday that they had until

1364
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:59,400
June 1st to choose to willingly relocate or accept a severance package and the sites for

1365
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,400
new offices are rumored to be San Francisco and New York.

1366
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,440
I'm hoping for San Francisco.

1367
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,480
Me too, because I could have applied for all kinds of jobs, and in fact I actually was

1368
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,080
going to apply for a number of Nintendo jobs when I thought I was moving to Washington,

1369
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,440
but now I'm not gonna.

1370
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,520
I want jobs there.

1371
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:29,120
Anyways, so we have GameStop over here and of course they have Game over in the UK, and

1372
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:34,800
apparently Game has bought out its competitor, GameStation, for the equivalent of $100 million

1373
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:44,120
US, approximately 74 million pounds, or euros, I can't tell.

1374
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,840
And now it will increase.

1375
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,920
So wait, GameStop is to game as GameStation is to EB Games?

1376
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,560
Something like that, yeah.

1377
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:04,220
So now they are about over 200 storefronts and the largest chain in Europe.

1378
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,400
So that's kind of interesting.

1379
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,680
I guess GameStop is over there too.

1380
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,160
There had been some speculation that GameStop had actually purchased them, but they didn't,

1381
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,200
so you snooze you lose.

1382
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,160
So does this make a game now a monopoly?

1383
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,320
Because that's what a lot of people are saying is that, oh my gosh, they have a monopoly,

1384
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,360
and even Kevin the Groove in chat says, what the hell, game is actually now a monopoly.

1385
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,520
I wouldn't say it's a monopoly, but it's pretty much as close to a monopoly as GameStop is

1386
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,520
over here.

1387
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,680
But GameStop, maybe that's the same perception as in Europe, is that GameStop does compete

1388
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:45,160
with Best Buy and Walmart and online and the big box stores that carry more than just games,

1389
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
you know what I mean?

1390
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,160
That's where their competition is now.

1391
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,080
It's not like they're the only game store on the face of the earth, so I don't know.

1392
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,960
Because when I get pissed at GameStop, I go to, either I go to GameCrazy or because that's

1393
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,840
kind of far, I'll go to Best Buy.

1394
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,120
But I don't know.

1395
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,120
My friend had a real horrible experience at Best Buy last week, and now I'm thinking I

1396
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,120
may not go there anymore.

1397
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,120
Fries.

1398
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,120
This is bad.

1399
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
Fries, I could do.

1400
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,120
I could do fries.

1401
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
I like fries.

1402
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,760
What are you hanging out over there, Drunami?

1403
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,760
You have a problem with fries?

1404
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,760
Shitty service?

1405
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
Yeah, it's got shitty service.

1406
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,360
Sorry to hear that.

1407
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Why is it shitty service?

1408
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:22,120
I've had stuff that's like gone bad, went back there, and they're like, eh, whatever.

1409
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Least it's cheap.

1410
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
And then they'll just give me a new one.

1411
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
All right.

1412
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,000
Well, anyhow, moving on to another story.

1413
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
This is interesting.

1414
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,720
This story somewhat struck a chord.

1415
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,560
I don't know about you guys, but this is really big in the news this week about a Chinese

1416
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,840
student who was attending Clements High School, and of course because he's a high school student,

1417
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,720
they don't give us his name, but he was removed from the high school.

1418
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,180
This is located in Texas in the town of Fort Benz.

1419
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,180
Parents were complaining.

1420
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:54,960
He recreated the school grounds in a game, which I believe was Counter Strike, and he

1421
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,760
uploaded the map and all his friends were playing in it.

1422
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,560
And basically, he now has to go to an alternate education school.

1423
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,960
The police called him a terroristic threat, and so on and so on.

1424
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,880
Of course, you can't help but think this is all partially due to the Columbines and the

1425
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,440
Virginia Techs of the world.

1426
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,280
But the reason why this struck a chord with me is that, okay, when I go back to 10 years

1427
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:23,360
ago, 1996, right, a little more than 10 years ago, okay, my freshman year of college in

1428
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,120
the college dorms.

1429
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,360
The game that was all the rage was Duke Nukem 3-D.

1430
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,720
We would play Duke Nukem 3-D all freaking night long, doing the modem thing, running

1431
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,720
because in the dorms you're all right next to each other, but you all have separate phone

1432
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,400
lines, because you have to do modem.

1433
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,640
There wasn't really the internet so much back then as there was modem play.

1434
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,920
We would run back and forth between the rooms and see who's where and who's doing what,

1435
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
and it was really fun.

1436
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,440
But the point is, map editors came out, and what was the first map we tried to make at

1437
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,440
Duke Nukem?

1438
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,840
We tried to recreate our dorm in Duke Nukem because we thought it would be funny.

1439
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,680
Of course, I tried to recreate Roundtable to play Duke Nukem 3-D in Roundtable, but

1440
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,000
it doesn't mean I'm going to go shoot up the place.

1441
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,880
It's because it's a place you're familiar, you're like, damn, you're sitting there bored

1442
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,320
or whatever in high school and you're like, damn, this would be fun to run around and

1443
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,920
play paintball in or something like that, but you can't actually do that, so you create

1444
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,680
a map that's familiar to you and you go and play.

1445
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,500
It's just like if you recreated your mall or something like that.

1446
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,920
The problem is these people are too fucking scared of everything that they immediately

1447
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:31,480
think, oh my god, it's Counter-Strike, therefore he must be a terrorist, and I heard the rumors

1448
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,080
also because he's Asian.

1449
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,440
D.V. in chat says he actually went to jail.

1450
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,680
There was an update on the story.

1451
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,680
Thanks, D.V.

1452
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,140
That's so stupid.

1453
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,400
What crime did he commit?

1454
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,960
Seriously, what crime did he commit?

1455
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,640
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

1456
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,600
Is there a component of this we don't know?

1457
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,440
Why did the parents complain just about a map?

1458
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:55,480
My parents thought I was doing homework, they didn't even know I was playing Duke Nukem.

1459
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,480
You know why?

1460
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,600
They wanted to be the fucking people that saw 9-11 coming and stopped it.

1461
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
That's what they wanted to be.

1462
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,080
They said, oh look, he's recreated a map.

1463
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,800
It's just like that Virginia Tech shooting.

1464
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Let's get the guy.

1465
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,200
This is what I'm curious about.

1466
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,880
Was there something else that we don't know that the video game blogs aren't talking about?

1467
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
Well, he did have a hammer.

1468
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,680
You know what he could do with that hammer?

1469
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,680
He could hammer shit.

1470
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,680
Like people's skulls.

1471
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,680
Did he make a threat?

1472
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,800
Did he make a threat months ago?

1473
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,520
Was there something about his demeanor?

1474
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,580
I'm stopping to think there's got to be something else.

1475
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,800
Are we really this trigger happy?

1476
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,920
No pun intended.

1477
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,080
Are we really this trigger happy to arrest people because I'm thinking like, I did this,

1478
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
you did this.

1479
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:43,380
I mean, I don't know, Drunami's raising his hand because they're familiar places and for

1480
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,040
me it was just kind of funny.

1481
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,880
Wouldn't it be funny to put stripper sprites in your dorm room?

1482
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,880
That's funny.

1483
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
I did it in Unreal.

1484
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,180
We were playing laser tag.

1485
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:57,480
I play video games and shoot people a lot in video games.

1486
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,440
I am not actually going to shoot a real person.

1487
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,820
I'm a smart, intelligent person who knows the difference.

1488
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:07,160
And even still 99.99% of the population is like me.

1489
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,040
Playing Counter Strike does not make you a killer.

1490
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,960
It doesn't even teach you how to shoot a gun.

1491
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,120
I mean, it's a video game.

1492
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,680
It'd be as bad as saying that Pac-Man would make you do drugs.

1493
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,040
I mean, come on.

1494
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,040
It's so ridiculous.

1495
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,520
And I would really like to know what the hell they arrested them on because making a map

1496
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,600
of your school is not a crime anywhere.

1497
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,080
So I don't know what they did.

1498
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,360
And you know, if they found guns or, you know, a cache of weapons or something like that,

1499
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,600
then that's a different story.

1500
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,320
But they didn't.

1501
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,840
So you know, what the fuck?

1502
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,200
You know, I want to know, I hope to hell that they get their, you know, what's coming to

1503
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
them.

1504
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,680
I hope that they sue this school for a whole lot of fucking money.

1505
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,160
Well, we'll see.

1506
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,880
I mean, again, I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt that there may be a component

1507
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,560
that we don't know about.

1508
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,040
But yeah, I don't know.

1509
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,160
Not happy so far.

1510
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
We'll see.

1511
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,400
All right, so if you have a comment, if you have something you want to share, email us.

1512
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,960
Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com and pretty soon we'll be going into Part B of the program

1513
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,000
and in Part B we'll get to tonight's mailbag.

1514
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,200
But in the meantime, more gaming news.

1515
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:20,240
Well, for anyone who likes their MMOs and is playing City of Heroes, Issue 9 is now

1516
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,240
released.

1517
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,240
It's called Breakthrough.

1518
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:28,680
It has a new feature called the Invention System that lets you salvage ingredients and

1519
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:34,880
recipes from your enemies and turn them into items for yourself or things that you can

1520
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,160
sell.

1521
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:43,640
You can also get different sets of equipment, things to boost your abilities.

1522
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,160
There's also new sets of wings.

1523
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,880
There's angel, demon, dragon, burned bone, bat, cherub, insect, tech, and fairy wings.

1524
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,800
So different missions, different stuff going on is supposed to give you a lot more to do

1525
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,600
instead of just fight.

1526
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,280
All right.

1527
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,040
City of Heroes is, again, one of those games on my big list of games I would like to play

1528
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,320
but I just don't find the time to play them.

1529
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,640
But I bet City of Heroes is a lot of fun.

1530
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,640
Have you ever played that?

1531
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,640
I know you were talking about that.

1532
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,640
No, I want to.

1533
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,240
I was going to try a demo.

1534
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,240
Some point.

1535
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,240
All right.

1536
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,640
Well, at least I'll have this thing waiting for me whenever I finally play the damn game.

1537
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,120
Something interesting to come out.

1538
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
It's kind of neat.

1539
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,700
It's a dance pad for DDR type games or music rhythm games.

1540
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,360
That's using lasers.

1541
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,920
Instead of the normal pressure sensors or push button switches and stuff, this one actually

1542
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,920
uses lasers.

1543
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,960
So if you cut the beam, it counts as a button press.

1544
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,640
It's the brand new laser dance matrix, not a pad.

1545
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,560
And what's actually kind of neat about it is it wouldn't really break down, especially

1546
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,540
since you're not really stepping on the switches and wearing that stuff down.

1547
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:59,680
Not available yet, although they're saying that they're going to be constructing them

1548
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,460
kind of soon.

1549
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:08,680
And right now you can check it out on apply-sciences.net and they've got a little bit of information

1550
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,160
on that and they're going to be creating those very soon.

1551
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,160
I think it's cool.

1552
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,340
I mean, definitely they should actually kind of do this with the arcade games.

1553
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,840
It would probably be a whole lot less teching of the pads.

1554
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,960
I never even thought of this idea and it seems brilliant.

1555
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,320
How can this fail unless the laser goes dead?

1556
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Seriously, there's no way for a button press to fail at all unless you just didn't step

1557
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,320
far enough into the pad.

1558
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,600
Or you kick a laser.

1559
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
I don't understand.

1560
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,040
How could Blu-ray fail?

1561
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,200
Shut up.

1562
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
This is different.

1563
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,400
I can give you a couple of examples.

1564
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,240
There's not competing laser technology.

1565
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,840
Well, maybe there is, but you know what I mean.

1566
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
I'm joking.

1567
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,840
Laser is a laser.

1568
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,680
Well I would definitely be interested in checking this out, but how expensive will one of these

1569
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
things be?

1570
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,280
I imagine it's got to be pretty pricey, wouldn't they?

1571
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,320
They haven't said yet, but I mean it doesn't look like too much.

1572
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,920
Of course the cost is really going to be coming from the laser diodes.

1573
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,440
But then again, like pocket lasers cost like nothing.

1574
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,560
I use a pocket because I'm a trainer during the day, so I have a pocket laser that I use

1575
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,000
to point at the board.

1576
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That didn't cost anything.

1577
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,080
I think you get those 99 cent stores now.

1578
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,420
The only thing I could see that there would be a problem with is if you did happen to

1579
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,540
bump the laser or something.

1580
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:29,820
If it's not in a very protective housing, you could un-align it and then there's some

1581
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,920
calibration issues or maybe light interference from other things.

1582
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,520
But if it's able to detect a certain wavelength of light or something like that, then it probably

1583
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,680
would work pretty well.

1584
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,840
I don't know.

1585
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,200
Hitstun in chat says, doesn't anybody else here remember the Sega Activator?

1586
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,200
It sucked ass.

1587
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Did that run on lasers?

1588
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,200
That's all infrared though.

1589
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,360
That's infrared.

1590
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,600
Infrared's different, right?

1591
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,960
Infrared's low frequency and it's not exactly a beam, it's more of just kind of a light

1592
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,960
source almost.

1593
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,200
It's like the Para-Para Paradise Pack.

1594
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
Or the Wii, right?

1595
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,200
Isn't that a little Wii thing?

1596
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,200
This is on TV?

1597
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,200
Isn't that infrared?

1598
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,200
Yeah, it's infrared as well.

1599
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,560
Why the fuck they don't have a calibration thing on that is beyond me.

1600
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,480
Come on, Nintendo.

1601
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,200
It makes sense.

1602
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,880
Now our chat room is full of laser cats jokes as well.

1603
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Everything from that sketch.

1604
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,160
As you know, we've talked about laser cats the game on the program before.

1605
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,880
The one thing that will definitively end the next gen war will be the console that can

1606
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,760
get laser cats the game as an exclusive will be the winner of the next gen war in the OLR

1607
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,760
book.

1608
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,280
Frickin' laser beans on some frickin' cats, is that too hard to ask?

1609
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,080
What if it's like the PlayStation 2?

1610
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,880
Then the PlayStation 2 wins the next gen war.

1611
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,880
Don't buy any of them.

1612
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,880
Keep your PS2 and have laser cats.

1613
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,680
Game Boy Advance.

1614
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
Seriously.

1615
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,520
Whoever gets laser cats wins.

1616
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,520
You're a winner for listening to Orange Lounge Radio, but we are going to take a break here

1617
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,640
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1618
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,800
For those of you listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in

1619
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,880
a couple days with our part B. This way we spread the OLR love throughout the week.

1620
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,540
Those of you listening live don't have to wait quite as long.

1621
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:22,720
We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
