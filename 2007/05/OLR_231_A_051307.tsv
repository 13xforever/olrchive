14009	19776	Tonight, May 13th, 2007, could the Xbox Live Marketplace be set to compete with iTunes?
20117	26245	The easy release of Spore faces yet another delay, and a PlayStation series is revived on cell phones?
32085	36608	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36668	42631	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle.
42971	48994	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, but you might know her as Jamie Summers.
49375	50235	I love salad.
51356	56299	I heard your TV show is getting picked up by NBC after all, The Bionic Woman, the remake.
56799	57039	What?
57059	57139	What?
57321	59121	Yeah, they're making a remake of Bionic Woman.
59342	60802	That's so fucking cool!
60822	62802	Because I think of your name and everything.
62942	67143	You know, your name, quote unquote.
67163	73065	To recap for new people, my mom was going to name me Erica.
74845	77986	And the little girl next door said, No, you should name her after the Bionic Woman.
78026	78706	Name her Jamie.
79206	81027	So my mom named me Jamie, only she spelled it right.
82167	85408	And so that's why I took Summer as my last name for my stage name.
85808	86148	There you go.
87569	91651	I am named after my mom showed her very small nerd roots.
107921	109602	Optimus Prime with Prostate Cancer Thing
138424	139785	Thanks for watching!
161417	163321	Bionic Man 6 Million Dollar Man
173467	174327	Oh, then that's lame.
174367	176088	I don't even give a shit about the Bionic Woman.
176268	180590	Unless she has a claw that comes out of her hand and she can swing on things and fight Hitler.
180750	183451	That's Bionic Commando.
183651	190293	I believe I was reading in one of those websites that in this new Bionic Woman, she's a $50 million woman.
190333	191913	They have $50 million worth of parts in her.
192193	192874	Well, yeah.
192954	194394	Inflation, you know, is a bitch.
194894	196615	That'll buy a nice pair of tits, though.
198007	199789	It better for $50 million.
199929	201851	I want Rebecca Romaine Blair.
202391	203953	No, it's some British unknown.
204433	208137	Somebody that isn't known here, but has been in some British shows.
209478	209918	Softie.
210259	212281	I want someone who looks like Jane Fonda in the 60s.
212321	212801	There's pictures.
212821	214983	Go to Dig and look at the entertainment section.
215003	216124	You can see pictures of the new Bionicle.
216144	217225	Rob, I'm doing a show right now.
218967	220529	Like that ever stopped you before.
220549	221870	All right.
222665	223925	Anyway, also say hello.
223946	225406	We'll get to video games soon, I promise.
225666	226767	We have nerd stuff to get to first.
226867	230228	Also say hello to a frequent guest of ours, but he hasn't been here in a while.
230268	231148	Say hello to Miklatov.
231408	231788	Hello.
232149	233629	And where have you been, young man?
234689	235310	I don't know.
235850	236610	Where have I been?
236630	237511	The island of Pokemon.
237671	239031	Yeah, you've been catching Pokemons.
239691	240372	I'm tired.
240912	241732	I just woke up.
241932	242252	All right.
242552	243233	What's going on?
243313	244373	But I noticed you're playing DS.
244393	245373	You're playing Pokemon now.
245413	245654	Yes.
246014	246274	Still.
246394	246714	Still.
247176	251518	Now, you started Pokemon and then you restarted your game.
251578	253259	Why did you quit and restart your game completely?
253299	257381	Because I felt like I was doing too much trading and not enough playing.
257961	261303	I was just not happy with my Pokemon, so I restarted.
261763	264804	And I started with Chimchar, who I've named Ho-Monkey.
266065	267205	Like Homo-Monkey?
267225	268566	Like Homo-Monkey, yes.
269126	270187	Like a Pokemon name.
270447	271027	It's awesome.
272178	277580	Shane Miklatov and I like to have naming contests for our Pokemon, like who can have the better names.
278220	279241	Mine wins hands down.
279301	280301	Nothing's going to top that.
280501	281722	Like, nothing ever.
282382	285183	No, Porchmonkey would not fit because he's not black.
285523	288264	I liked, you named one of them Fancy Pants.
288324	289024	Fancy Pants.
289044	291045	Because it looked like it was wearing a big fur coat.
291405	295747	And then it evolved into like this cyber grasshopper looking thing.
295847	297167	It was ridiculous.
297227	298248	I don't use it anymore.
299895	301156	Well, I like muffins.
324412	327273	You know, creative when I got that ponytail.
327433	329834	It's a fire horse, so I named it Hor-fires.
330415	332035	So I just put fire in the middle of horse.
332576	332996	That's it.
333436	334416	That's very creative.
334436	335057	It is creative.
335097	335357	Good job.
335517	336157	I enjoy it.
336357	336617	All right.
336757	338798	Actually, I caught a magic carp and named it useless.
339078	340399	I named it fish sticks.
341420	341720	All right.
341840	342140	Anyhow.
343300	343901	Wow, we're nerds.
344841	346682	Also, we have some nerds here in chat.
346722	351564	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we record.
352079	352380	DarkSakura.com
360546	362888	Happy Mother's Day if we have any moms that listen to our program.
363629	366251	Also, we are up against the finale of Survivor.
366511	371416	You know, somebody actually had the balls to come into chat and say, Oh, sorry, I can't listen to you guys tonight.
371456	372216	Survivor's on.
372357	372877	Goodbye.
373558	374779	Shut up.
374799	379203	Okay, A, this season of Survivor was spoiled a long time ago if you read the forums.
379263	382966	I can tell you who wins, but I'm going to be nice to the listeners who T-vote it.
383484	384445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
414591	419755	Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360 Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360
443601	445022	because we have more controllers.
445963	446624	That's the only reason.
446704	447044	Party.
447925	449146	Party game.
449266	451048	Can four folks play simultaneously on that one?
451248	451408	Yes.
451708	452209	That's pretty cool.
453170	454130	I've still yet to play it.
454451	456052	But I've already laid claim.
458274	458554	Alright.
459135	462218	Well, what pinball tables have been dominating your time lately?
462798	463379	Twilight Zone.
463399	464179	That game's a bitch.
464860	466882	But you haven't really been playing the pinball game on 360?
466922	469104	The new downloadable one?
469124	469164	No.
469653	470394	Dan can play it.
470434	470854	I don't care.
470894	472275	It kind of looks sucky to me.
472716	482485	The whole point of pinball to me, the last good virtual pinball besides for Alien Crush and Devil's Crush was like Revenge of the Gator on Game Boy back in the day.
482905	483826	That game was awesome.
484186	487009	It was Sonic Spinball, of course, but that's not quite the same.
487489	490732	But Devil's Crush and Alien Crush are the pinnacle of video pinball.
492233	493935	Anything else is just a pale imitation.
494853	505258	I have to say that for me it's having the flippers and the noises and the ball and having my machine go powerball and getting that ceramic ball that the magnets can't do crap to.
505818	506778	I love Twilight Zone.
506878	508259	But I've also been playing Rocky and Bullwinkle.
510020	513581	I like the pinball effects, but I think I was getting into this last week.
513641	515802	Nothing is a replacement for the real thing, sadly.
516643	517803	Nothing at all.
518103	520885	You feel the machine move.
521145	522706	Not even Revenge of the Gator, sadly.
522746	523646	Not even Revenge of the Gator.
523976	524996	Loki, how was your gaming week?
525517	526117	It was good.
526377	528818	Finally got the damn systems to land with each other.
529018	536141	Apparently the problem was Crackdown because Crackdown's a little bitch and doesn't want to land with other systems unless you do it its way.
536401	541243	So anyways, so I've been playing a little bit of Call of Duty 3 and that was fun.
541283	544084	We landed together and had a little multiplayer game.
544865	550907	And then once the Crackdown update came out with the new download content,
551377	552618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
567854	569195	A debug mode for the game.
569335	571456	You can adjust the agility of your character.
571476	577459	You can give yourself super agility to jump even higher or run super fast and then super strength.
577820	584323	Plus you can spawn vehicles, spawn explosive barrels, have all weapons, unlimited ammo, god mode, that kind of stuff.
584903	587725	Of course, none of that stuff counts if you're playing the actual game.
587745	591527	But it's just a little fun little mode to play with and you can do that in co-op.
592027	595289	Then, of course, there's also new weapons and new vehicles with the paid one.
595885	597387	And then, of course, you know, fuck.
617813	627842	Tomorrow we've got, or I should say Monday for those people listening on the podcast, the Halo 3, no I'm sorry, not Monday, Wednesday, the Halo 3 beta is going to be coming out.
628162	631585	A bunch of people on my friends list are already playing it.
632946	634727	We're just not special, nobody cares.
634747	641093	Because they had those preview events in Frisco, New York, and they were giving out those codes to basically everybody that went to the event.
641113	643135	So there's a bunch of people on live already playing it.
643155	643435	Yeah.
643820	644720	You know, I don't care.
644760	647081	I know, I'm like, eh, it's a beta.
647301	648461	It's not the real game.
648561	652622	And, like, you know, the beta's going to have issues, especially with everybody hitting it at once.
652682	657543	I think people are getting a little too excited about the Halo 3 beta, if that makes sense.
657963	659103	Like, it's not the real game.
659463	662104	I don't know, I think Microsoft's pretty ballsy to be doing this, to be honest.
662984	668305	I played Super Paper Mario some more, about halfway through the game now, and it's still very easy.
668725	669125	I don't know.
669345	671666	I've had, like, no trouble getting through the game at all.
671966	672886	And I don't know if it's just...
673365	674825	DarkSakura, some comments from chatroom.
674865	676366	Toshin asked about Pokemon Pinball.
676386	677446	Did you ever play that one?
678026	678146	Barely.
703115	704275	That was a good one.
704375	705256	I liked it.
705616	706956	There was two of them if I remember right.
706976	709377	There was one for the old games and one for the advanced games.
709397	710077	They did like two.
710097	711898	Epic Pinball.
712918	715319	On the PC, yeah, Epic Pinball was pretty awesome.
715359	716839	I had another pinball simulator.
717359	718480	I can't remember the name of it.
719780	721161	I brought it up on a previous episode.
721181	721741	Somebody named it.
721761	723881	But there were some good PC pinball games too.
724582	725682	Epic Pinball, of course, being one.
727126	734068	Also looking at chat room, RawSteelUT says Halo 3 Beta, the only reason people bought Crackdown.
734688	736589	That might be true, but they got a pretty decent game with it.
736769	737889	It's a fucking awesome game.
738809	739509	I like Crackdown.
739529	741670	It's not usually my type of game, but I like it quite a bit.
741910	745291	I would have bought it even if it didn't have Halo 3 Beta in there.
745311	746691	To be honest, I don't even know.
747371	749412	I may download it and might play it once.
749572	752953	I don't think I'm going to play it much more than that because I'm not really a huge Halo fan.
754108	760329	As far as first person shooters go, it doesn't seem like that big of a difference in Halo 2.
760689	762229	It's just like, eh, whatever.
762630	766790	I'm going to get fucking murdered by everybody on there anyway because I suck at Halo really bad.
767090	772271	I want to know if there's any really, really bad Halo players that are excited about the Halo 3 beta.
772291	772571	Me, me.
772651	776892	Because we need to form a clan and just play with each other and suck together at Halo 3.
777052	777712	I'm pretty awful.
777752	779993	I've only played Halo 2 like four times.
780273	782053	I'll play if you load me up on Mechlozine.
783093	783893	Do you have the beta?
784094	785194	Do you have Crackdown or anything?
785294	785834	Can you get the beta?
785854	786455	I've got Crackdown.
786655	787855	Okay, then you can get into the beta.
788175	791437	So we'll play an OLR We Suck night or something.
791877	793457	But we only have a few weeks to do it, I think.
794158	795878	We'll see.
795918	800760	By the way, I was at Best Buy the other day, randomly, and they still had Crackdown with the Halo 3 beta in it.
801161	802961	So you can still find copies of it.
803101	804522	So get them soon if you want to get in.
806360	809241	Well, this has nothing to do with Halo, but I did have an announcement.
809481	809741	Okay.
810941	813521	Probably in the next four months, I'm going to be a published illustrator.
814862	815342	Oh, how so?
816642	821223	I'm going to be doing flashcards of bones and muscles of what everything works out.
821563	821803	Huh.
822423	823483	For massage therapists.
823763	824263	That'll be fun.
825084	828744	So are you going to autograph them at different places for our listeners?
828924	830985	No, but I'm going to take deep tissue massage.
831265	831645	That's cool.
831905	832525	Well, good luck with that.
833996	834737	My gaming week.
835037	835477	Let's see.
836398	838319	I haven't really played video games this week.
838339	839100	They're bad for you.
839200	840461	I've been trying to avoid video games.
840861	845244	Also, I don't eat at Wendy's anymore because they support the evil company that is Nintendo.
846364	848806	And, you know, this lawyer guy told me that was bad.
849727	852008	No, kidding, of course.
852388	855030	All things considered, I actually had a pretty bad week, personally, this week.
855110	859473	But Miklatov cheered me up, which was really cool, because he bought me this.
860078	862939	Final Fantasy XII Play Arts Final Fantasy XII Play Arts Final Fantasy XII Play Arts
883459	889181	Damn, Final Fantasy XII was one of those games I started and just didn't finish because all the console launches were going on at that time.
889541	892461	I really need to go back now that... I never even started it.
892581	893562	I need to play it.
893642	894842	It's such an incredible game.
894882	895822	I need to finish it.
896322	898243	And the characters are so awesome, so there you go.
900283	900704	Let's see.
901004	904705	Also, I played World of Warcraft.
904725	907505	I got to level 51 because I don't have a life.
907905	909966	And then I played some Xbox Live.
910250	910890	Catan, Catan, Catan
940370	947511	But what I do like about the game, what it does have going for it, is because the game is a little more complicated, you have to really kind of learn it and think.
947591	949432	It's a much more thinking type game.
950072	952132	The people that are playing it are pretty intelligent.
952192	957253	So if you do play it online, you don't get a lot of the... type people.
957273	961734	That's what they say... in their headsets on Xbox Live.
961754	964795	So that's kind of, I guess, something the game has going for it.
964875	966995	Otherwise, I've been playing a little more Pinball FX and...
967600	971522	Centipede and Millipede for no good reason other than I just really like retro games.
971862	973543	So I was playing Centipede and Millipede.
973583	974304	Oh, and Double Dragon.
974784	976505	I bought Double Dragon.
977145	985850	Well, it's not that bad, but the problem is that I really remember the Nintendo one much more, and there's big differences between the Nintendo one
986351	1015801	and the arcade one and namely that the arcade one was a lot harder and some of them like the moves aren't quite the same that they were in the Nintendo one like with the Nintendo one you gain these stars as your points went up and that allowed you to do more moves like jump kick and punch people when they're on the ground and stuff and it doesn't really work the same in the arcade version but I thought it's the first port I've seen of an old arcade classic that wasn't done by that what is it Digital Eclipse is that who they are it was done by somebody else
1017019	1020582	It was kind of refreshing to see that there's other companies capable of porting over the old games.
1020762	1021963	Because they did a pretty decent job.
1022003	1024104	The high def graphics are really cleaned up.
1024144	1027727	It looks nice for an arcade game that's 20 years old.
1029568	1029848	Alright, $5.
1031009	1031309	Not bad.
1032190	1032530	That's it.
1032850	1033470	That's my gaming week.
1033510	1034811	Miklatov, how about your gaming week?
1037813	1040255	I played WoW a couple times.
1040695	1043077	I'm level 56, so I have less of a life.
1044743	1051508	I also had this sudden interest to start playing Bust a Move 2 again, because I love that game.
1052288	1061715	So I've been playing it non-stop, and there's not anything new I can do in it, because I've already unlocked everybody, beaten it with every character, always get the upper path.
1062376	1065378	So, I don't know, it's just a little fun game to play, I guess.
1065898	1067700	I've been slacking on Pokemon.
1068761	1068841	Um...
1070342	1073605	Other than that, I don't think there are any video games I play.
1073785	1076087	Hey, keep your cell phone off.
1076147	1077328	Sorry, my cell phone went off.
1077408	1079730	People forget I do this thing on Sunday night and try to call me.
1080051	1090319	Yes, and I don't know, I guess, kind of gaming related, I think I'm leaving Konami by the 4th of June.
1090940	1091280	Okay.
1092201	1093162	So hooray for me.
1094690	1098571	Well, I mean, you'll finally be able to talk openly about what you do during the day.
1098631	1099191	That'll be nice.
1099531	1100731	Oh, I can talk about it right now.
1100751	1102092	I play Bust a Move 2 all day.
1102112	1103932	That's pretty much what I do.
1105913	1106613	I don't care.
1107313	1108173	All right, well, there you go.
1108233	1111354	There's no other games you've been working on by chance?
1111414	1112714	Sometimes I play Dance Summit.
1114455	1115755	I kind of switch it out between the two.
1115775	1117215	Bring that over because I miss that game.
1117455	1118376	Okay, I'll bring it next time.
1118396	1119156	It's at work right now.
1119456	1121697	I haven't played that in forever.
1122217	1123517	I've been trying to find a copy of it to buy.
1124156	1125217	Good luck with that.
1125357	1126478	I found one on eBay for $40.
1127098	1128319	Oh, that's really cheap.
1128519	1129460	That's definitely worth it.
1129840	1133042	I'm looking actually right now to find a copy of Bust a Groove 1 US.
1134003	1135224	Do you want to borrow mine?
1136087	1136928	I want one to own.
1136948	1137468	I really, really need it.
1137488	1139529	I could probably sell you mine because I have the Japanese ones.
1139849	1140189	Oh, really?
1140510	1141150	I'll sell it to my hubby.
1141410	1149275	While you guys barter and trade over there, JVmon says in chat, if Bus to Move 2 was on the PlayStation 3 network, that would sell me a PS3.
1149495	1150695	It would sell me one, too.
1151216	1151776	Or, you know what?
1151936	1158600	If Squeenix decided to ever revisit that series, I don't care if they put a Final Fantasy character in it to ruin the game.
1158700	1159821	I would still buy another one.
1159921	1161862	I keep forgetting it was an Enix game.
1161882	1161942	Yes.
1162301	1163001	And then Square ruined them.
1193032	1196733	SSJ100 Matt asks, what, no sweet codon for you, Miklatov?
1197214	1197734	To play?
1197754	1198294	Yeah.
1198894	1214740	Um, no, because I guess, you know, I still care about the series, but after working on it, it's like, I kind of know everything that happens in the last game, and I never even finished playing it, so it's like, there's nothing to surprise me.
1215820	1218401	Is it kind of one of those things where, like, you know,
1218982	1225943	Maybe you're really excited for many years to work at, I don't know, let's say a... Taco Bell.
1226163	1228924	No, nobody's excited to work at Taco Bell.
1228944	1229704	What the hell's wrong with you?
1230024	1235245	Let's say people are excited to work at Great America, a theme park, let's say.
1235625	1237105	People are really excited, they want to work at a theme park.
1237125	1243826	And then when they get there and realize how everything really works, now the rides all function and how the magic happens, everything kind of loses its magic.
1243866	1247087	Is it kind of like that, where now that you've been on the inside, it's just not as fun anymore?
1247640	1250462	All Games.com to relay the following announcement.
1270334	1278985	which is cool because All Games is very supportive of us and replaying our show on Monday nights as well as Tuesday mornings over on AllGames.com.
1279025	1282309	If you missed the live show on Sunday, you can always hear part A and B together on All Games.
1282889	1288256	And one of their other shows, the video game show, they had a little bit of drama a couple weeks ago.
1290138	1298903	To make a long story short, a lot of folks think that the show is gone because of something that someone on the show did to the website and everything.
1298943	1300924	He's since apologized for it.
1301245	1304266	I saw the apology and I was basically like, I suck and I'm sorry.
1304687	1306928	But a lot of people still think the show is gone.
1307308	1310991	So all games is asking us to kind of put forward and, you know, the video game show.
1311091	1311852	They are not gone.
1312192	1316456	They are still around, and they are now at www.videogameshow.net.
1316796	1322060	So we know those of you guys that listen to Orange Launch Radio probably listen to other independent video game podcasts, and we encourage you to do so.
1322460	1328185	So if you're a fan of Chris Haas and Rich Bergen, they are now over at videogameshow.net.
1328265	1328765	Check it out.
1328845	1330387	Their show has moved over there.
1331307	1335591	Also in housekeeping tonight, I wanted to mention real quick, of course, our Fonamay appearance.
1335967	1339730	is going to be happening over Memorial Day weekend in San Jose, Saturday at 2 p.m.
1340050	1341191	We hope to see you guys there.
1341211	1341871	We're really excited.
1341891	1345854	Speaking of anime conventions, we're going to talk about ACEN a little later tonight.
1346375	1346755	ACEN.
1347155	1349077	Can I just say ACEN and the same thing?
1349497	1350598	What if I don't want to say ACEN?
1351058	1352099	Then no one will know what you're talking about.
1352369	1352689	Jerks.
1352829	1357492	All right, well, regardless, Chris called us, and we're going to hear her message a little bit later.
1357932	1363976	Also, we want to give a big thank you to folks who've reviewed us recently in iTunes with five-star reviews.
1364036	1367819	I was looking at some of the more recent reviewers, and there are some awesome reviews.
1368359	1374583	Some folks actually using some of the gags from our previous weeks, like somebody left a review that says, OLR, the L stands for suck.
1374883	1375743	That was pretty awesome.
1375783	1379746	So we just really want to thank you guys, because we know probably every podcast you listen to
1380708	1381749	Go vote for us here.
1382370	1383551	Leave us a review on iTunes.
1384231	1390577	It really, really, really does help because when you get more reviews, it gets you that exposure.
1390897	1397402	When we first started the video game podcasting thing a couple years ago, there was maybe 10 shows at the most.
1398423	1400725	There wasn't much to pick from, so that's how a lot of folks found us.
1400765	1405469	But now there's 10,000 video game podcasts out there because every freaking...
1405851	1406572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1427054	1436901	Yes, there's been a lot of news this week, because everyone seems to think it's like E3 all over again, because I mean, hey, about a year from now, or a year ago, we were pretty much at E3.
1437041	1438002	I was just thinking of that.
1438102	1446328	You know, Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of all games, Bobby Blackwolf had his birthday, I think it was yesterday, and that reminds me, happy birthday Bobby, by the way.
1447323	1450925	and that reminded me that he had his birthday at E3 last year.
1451245	1454487	So that was making me go, shit, it's been one year since E3.
1454547	1457368	And it was kind of sad because E3 sucks now.
1457848	1465892	The E3 rave, as we've been calling it, because they're going to take you to an abandoned airport hangar and unmarked vehicles will come pick you up and escort you there.
1466132	1469094	Don't worry though, G4 will be there as their commercials say.
1469154	1470414	Whoopee.
1470935	1471535	Yay.
1471975	1473336	One more reason I don't want to go to E3.
1474534	1476355	But I do because, you know, all the cool kids go.
1476555	1487959	But anyways, except for G4 because, you know, they just... Well, Jamie, as I understand, our very own Jamie has an invite and is basically saying, you know what, I'm not going.
1487979	1488759	I'm too cool for this.
1488839	1490279	I didn't say I wasn't going.
1490339	1491620	I just said I can't afford to go.
1491640	1492300	Oh, okay.
1492620	1498462	Unless, like, the heavens open up and, you know, God gives me money.
1499622	1500003	We'll see.
1500543	1500903	I don't know.
1501263	1502403	I have to get time off work, too.
1502884	1503944	I think you're just too cool for E3.
1504628	1504988	I know.
1505749	1506589	Alright, anyway, sorry, news.
1530689	1532870	Looks pretty sexy from what I've seen so far.
1532990	1535171	Completely redone, all 3D.
1536152	1536912	Hooray.
1536932	1538893	I don't know how I feel about this.
1539333	1542074	Final Fantasy IV is my favorite Final Fantasy game.
1542594	1545756	Mostly because it was the first one I ever really got into and beat.
1546276	1552019	So, you know, it's kind of weird to watch that get changed into this whole new, like, 3D thing.
1552219	1553099	I think it looks good.
1553540	1554020	Yeah, I know.
1554040	1555660	I'll give it a try and I'll probably love it.
1555741	1558922	But, you know, it's still, it's like somebody's messing with your baby.
1559727	1564030	I hope it just doesn't turn out as bad as Final Fantasy 3 did for the DS because that was no fun.
1564311	1564831	You didn't like it?
1565011	1565151	No.
1565712	1567153	But did you like the original Nintendo one?
1567173	1567773	Did you ever play it?
1567833	1568834	Like translation or anything?
1570215	1570615	Maybe?
1570755	1571476	I think so a little bit.
1571496	1572417	The third one was great.
1572637	1574338	Well, the original.
1574799	1576400	It's kind of slow.
1576840	1577781	I had fun with it.
1578401	1583765	It's not slow in the story sense, even though it is, but everything just seems really slow in that game.
1583945	1585327	I don't know.
1585367	1587148	It's not that fun to me.
1587368	1588489	Well, that's your opinion.
1589051	1590592	I think it looks good.
1590893	1594416	I mean, I think they need to be doing more of this on the PSP.
1595036	1597778	That's for sure, because it's kind of lacking.
1598459	1600721	But, yeah, keep it up.
1601001	1603223	I want to see Final Fantasy VI redone as well.
1603903	1605385	I'm looking at chat for comments here.
1605445	1606946	Jvmon agrees with you, Mikotov.
1606986	1609128	Final Fantasy III for the DS was boring as hell.
1609588	1611890	Drudami says, though, Final Fantasy III DS was good...
1612521	1615785	Ross Steel, UT, says Final Fantasy IV DS was uber milkage.
1616966	1617347	Let's see.
1617527	1622393	SSJ100Matt says, I really want them to remake V. Sephiroth1215 says, IV?
1622413	1623414	What was so great about IV?
1623614	1624936	V and VI are so much better.
1626418	1627919	I can't explain the allure of IV.
1628260	1628560	Sephiroth1215...
1629451	1629791	Spoonie Bard
1652728	1654169	Yeah, and they had the Spoonie Bard.
1654229	1655029	That's all they needed.
1655450	1663874	And, dear God, mark my words, if Final Fantasy IV DS did not keep the Spoonie Bard lingo intact, instant fail on Square Enix's part.
1664655	1666556	I will pick it out front of Square Enix.
1666576	1667717	They will not screw that up.
1668517	1669838	Give me my Spoonie Bard.
1670078	1672359	But, I do think, I mean, it looks nice.
1672499	1674340	At least it's not just a straight port.
1674440	1677922	That's what, you know, at least they're doing something with it.
1678263	1679683	So, that's good.
1679984	1680564	I'll give them that.
1682285	1682485	Well,
1682907	1686850	I'm actually thinking I'm going to get that one because it was one of my favorites too, but I would prefer 5.
1688231	1690292	The reason I liked 3 was because of the job change system.
1690312	1695976	I know, I was going to say, but if this sells well, I guess logically that's going to be what happens next, right?
1696537	1697077	Let's hope so.
1697597	1700680	Well, at any rate, there's some good news for our UK listeners.
1701140	1712288	For anyone who is interested in SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters for the DS, the little problem that was going on in the 9th level of the game, we were having this issue where if you...
1713342	1713942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1742122	1743762	I'm actually a victim of that.
1744183	1745683	Not that I like card games or anything.
1745763	1748043	I only bought it because it has Phoenix Wright stuff in it.
1748564	1753685	So I'm not actually going to get rid of my copy because I'm never going to get that far because it's only on the New Game Plus or whatever.
1754405	1756986	So take that, SNK.
1757106	1758666	You're not getting my cartridge back.
1759746	1763527	To be fair, though, they do have a new arcade game that's going to be coming out.
1764807	1766028	Not that we really care.
1766908	1768068	What, Capcom versus SNK?
1769028	1771729	No, SNK has actually got, I think, a new King of Fighters
1772250	1775171	Oh, sorry, I lost interest in that series a while ago.
1775191	1776671	But I liked Capcom vs. SNK.
1776691	1777372	That was kind of cool.
1778252	1781193	I didn't get into a lot of fighting games, but I liked Capcom vs. SNK.
1781253	1782753	Mai vs. Chun-Li, awesome.
1783514	1783774	Epic.
1784894	1785134	All right.
1785454	1793597	Well, anyway, speaking of epic, Loki and I were addicted for many, many, many, many, many years to Final Fantasy XI.
1793757	1794557	Actually, not that many years.
1794597	1795197	Probably about like four.
1795257	1796638	Oh, yeah, Miklatov was addicted, too.
1797318	1800059	And it's your fucking fault I went back, like, to...
1800857	1801397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1826297	1850480	I was not impressed because half of it was recycled footage from all the expansions that are already out like the original opening movie that's like five years old right and then um the rest of it I get was pretty much like Miklatov picked this out I didn't even pick this out I'm like this looks the exact same as the areas that are already in there Miklatov was like oh yeah it's the areas like before the game takes place because I guess this Wings of the Goddess is some type of like
1850984	1852165	Time Mage Class Time Mage Class
1867645	1868145	Interesting theory.
1868205	1870006	Are you going to go back to the game when this comes out?
1870126	1871127	Probably for a week.
1871587	1871827	Addict.
1872007	1875449	Well, I went back every other time a new expansion came out.
1875489	1876589	I'm not going to stop.
1876809	1883552	It's just I won't play it much, and then I'll be like, I'm too low of a level to do anything in the new area, and I just want to go get the new job classes.
1884332	1884953	Just hold off.
1884973	1887434	They're making a new fucking role-playing game anyways.
1888394	1888875	Seriously.
1889975	1896638	Just as a friendly reminder, I'd like to go around and remind everybody why we quit Final Fantasy XI, because there's probably some fans of the game who listen to the program going,
1897048	1899209	You guys are so mean to Final Fantasy XI.
1899249	1899730	I play this game.
1899770	1901651	Okay, we play this game like between us all.
1901691	1904432	We probably played this game for like many, many, many years.
1904632	1905513	Jamie, why'd you quit?
1905853	1906994	I played for six months.
1907834	1910156	And it was because the White Mage is the party bitch.
1910856	1911917	And I like playing White Mages.
1912817	1914158	So, fuck everybody in that game.
1915439	1916259	Loki, why'd you quit?
1916359	1919301	I quit because I had a girlfriend and a wife.
1920702	1921562	That became a wife.
1921622	1922603	At the same time?
1922623	1923824	That's amazing.
1924224	1925344	No, that would not be fun.
1925685	1925945	No, but...
1926753	1934439	So, you know, I couldn't play it as often as I'd like to and there was like a big six month, you know, span where I didn't actually play at all.
1935220	1940524	And it's just, you know, paying that kind of money each month, even though it's, you know, like 13, 12 bucks, whatever.
1941465	1944287	It's still, you know, money that's kind of being wasted.
1945268	1949391	I mean, hell, if I was still single and not seeing anybody, I'd probably still be playing the game.
1949926	1950767	because it was fun.
1951167	1964695	I had fun with it, but it's just you get to a point, though, you work so hard in the game, and then it's just, you know, you get in stupid parties, and the whole fact that you have to party with people really kind of sucks.
1964796	1973541	I know it's an MMO, and you're supposed to party with people, but the fact that they force you to party when you can't find a party, I mean, that kind of fucking sucks.
1973561	1978044	You go on the play, and you can't do anything, so that was lame.
1978564	1979525	Mikotov, why'd you quit?
1980816	1985598	Well, the main reason probably is that whole XP loss when you die.
1986018	1991200	But most recently, it was because getting blue mage spells sucked sometimes.
1991500	1998123	And me and one of my friends in the game, we spent all night, hours and hours, trying to get this one spell.
1998583	1999123	Never got it.
1999203	2002124	So I was like, screw this game, I'm done.
2002164	2008447	The reason why I quit was because Squeenix did nothing about the gold farmers for far too long, and the economy in that game was fucked.
2008917	2037744	and people were telling me to actually buy Gil and I was like that's where I draw the line is spending that type of real world money to buy fake money online just because you know these people who are being paid to sit here and camp these monsters are getting stuff before me and people were so elitist that if you didn't have these items it's like you suck in parties and so I finally had my fill of it I was done even I had my elitist you know plus one everything you know fucking bard character and I got nothing
2038641	2039661	No parties out of that.
2041262	2042142	Alright, so there you go.
2043282	2044903	Plus everything charisma and all that stuff.
2045063	2045203	What?
2045223	2055426	I was just going to say, it's like, they want you to party in that game, but people have in their minds the ideal party setup, and if you don't fit that, your job or anything, then what's the point?
2055446	2056506	Because you're not going to get a party.
2056786	2060787	You can be a samurai looking for a party for forever, at least back when I played, and
2061831	2062871	Your job is worthless then.
2063151	2065452	Heaven help you if you're a paladin who doesn't sub warrior.
2065612	2067613	Yeah, you have to have the right sub jobs too.
2067673	2070193	So boo on you, Final Fantasy XI.
2070393	2070734	Boo.
2071534	2071894	Let's see.
2071954	2074675	Looking at the comments in the chat room here.
2075415	2078336	RawSteelUT says, healers are the party bitch in every MMO.
2079976	2080416	Let's see.
2081056	2087258	Sephiroth1215 says, I never liked Final Fantasy XI, but it does get addicting somehow and I stopped myself before I was an addict.
2088123	2091766	Shadow Fitzslayer says Tetra Master is greater than Final Fantasy XI.
2093668	2095289	Tetra Master was kind of fun.
2095310	2095990	No, it wasn't.
2096090	2098132	I played my free month of Tetra Master.
2098152	2098612	I had fun.
2098933	2101375	It was like fun for about five minutes.
2102156	2104057	That's a very good idea, actually, Loki.
2104117	2105839	Loki says put that on Xbox Live Arcade.
2105859	2106800	Yeah, so no one will play it.
2107060	2107380	Shut up.
2107440	2108201	I'd play it once.
2108601	2109682	Because it was free.
2110083	2111104	News story, please.
2112245	2112505	Anyways.
2113560	2119505	This is very disappointing for me to read, but Parasite Eve 3 is apparently going to be a cell phone title.
2120045	2126090	You know, obviously in Japan, where cell phone titles are more popular, you know, it's not a big surprise.
2126230	2131714	But over here, though, I would hope that maybe a next-gen version of Parasite Eve, because I like that series.
2131734	2132474	I thought it was pretty good.
2133115	2134996	Although, then again, I never did play the second one.
2135156	2137738	But this was announced over at the Square Enix party.
2138799	2140340	I don't know.
2140861	2142462	Kind of disappointing.
2144056	2171623	but hopefully you know what they kind of tend to do with these kind of things though port it over to like the PSP or something later on so here's hoping for a PSP version PSP version would be hot though Ross Steel UT who I'm quoting a lot tonight but he's saying a lot of stuff here and I'm not going to tell him to shut up he's saying a lot of good stuff here heartbreaks as he hears PE3 is a cell phone title I'm sure that's how most people feel about that news
2172312	2173092	It's complete sadness.
2173152	2177633	Because everybody was kind of waiting for Parasite Eve 3 on PlayStation 2, and then it just never happened.
2178954	2183415	Well, at least, you know, maybe they translate the book for us so that some of us who wants to read it can.
2183995	2185975	I saw the Japanese movie, and that was awesome.
2186295	2190596	I've got it somewhere, but my friends read the book like five times and keep telling me how awesome the book is.
2190856	2191657	Ew, reading.
2192557	2193017	Shut up.
2193037	2193737	Boy, watch the movie.
2195097	2196818	I like the book so I get the good story.
2197338	2197658	Anyway.
2198982	2203585	Well, there is actually a bit of happiness that came out of the Tokyo Game Show.
2203945	2206167	And that was an announcement for Kingdom Hearts.
2206607	2209109	Well, it's going to happen at the Tokyo Game Show.
2209949	2210810	Still a few months off.
2211711	2213532	Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
2214973	2218255	No, you said some announcement that... It's coming out of the... Okay, whatever.
2218695	2219816	Pardon my context.
2220717	2224159	It's... At any rate, it's going to be announced at the Tokyo Game Show.
2225960	2228722	So... Who's sick of announcements of announcements?
2230071	2231072	We have an announcement to make.
2231412	2233214	We're going to make an announcement later.
2233474	2236657	I completely refrain from here on out to make announcements of announcements.
2238038	2238579	You know what?
2238779	2247066	There is an amazing trend within this industry is that, hey, stay tuned for a really big announcement about something we're going to be announcing very soon.
2249128	2250810	It's like, shut up and make a game.
2252071	2253272	Shut up and go make the game.
2255274	2255554	Anyhow.
2256566	2258767	Any hopes for what they're going to be announcing, DarkSakura?
2258947	2259467	Like Kingdom Hearts 3?
2259507	2260448	Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe.
2260608	2263249	Or do you think it's going to be like Kingdom Hearts MMO?
2263289	2264689	Kingdom Memories 2.
2264889	2267610	Some other lame- There's not going to be any way they can do a Kingdom Hearts MMO.
2267810	2269391	Kingdom Hearts minus Disney.
2270111	2271112	I think we're all fearing that.
2271132	2271732	Then it won't be good.
2274305	2274725	Let's see.
2275105	2278846	Hostile1 in chat says, Please, please, please, Kingdom Hearts for $360.
2279826	2281927	Save me the $600 for the PlayStation 3.
2282287	2286068	Kingdom Hearts 3, except it's minus Disney and with Hanna-Barbera instead.
2287428	2288348	Yabba-dabba-doo!
2291149	2292149	That'd be so horrible.
2292409	2295910	Oh, hooray, I have Quick Draw McGraw in my party and Droopy Dog.
2299531	2301251	Oh, but... Wow.
2301271	2301331	Wow.
2301923	2304044	Hey, but Jetson's world would be pretty awesome.
2305385	2306306	What do you think of that, Jamie?
2306986	2309848	Kingdom Hearts with minus the Disney plus the Hanna-Barbera.
2310449	2312370	I don't think the Hanna-Barbera so much.
2312890	2315152	They should do plus Warner Brothers.
2315992	2317073	So we get the Animaniacs.
2317634	2318634	Was that Johnny Quest 2?
2319255	2320175	Yeah, Johnny Quest.
2320195	2321036	No, that was Hanna-Barbera.
2321076	2321416	Was it?
2321997	2322517	It could be worse.
2322537	2324098	But then again, that would also give us C-Lab.
2324358	2324838	It could be worse.
2324858	2327200	They could do Kingdom Hearts 3 with Adult Swim.
2329261	2329982	I guess that's true.
2330723	2334064	Kingdom Hearts of the Robot Chicken Suyoku no Gensu What is that?
2334084	2334624	You're yaying that.
2334644	2335824	I don't even know what the hell that is.
2361021	2361962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2387761	2393583	On the PlayStation 2, you get Shining Wind from Sega on the 17th, as well as Odin Sphere coming out over there.
2394784	2396665	And I think that's about it.
2396705	2398465	Let me see if there's anything on the DS real quick.
2399906	2402427	You do get Custom Beat Battle.
2402887	2404248	Draglade is coming out.
2404688	2406048	Oh, and then, of course, Oendan 2.
2406148	2407089	I suppose that's important.
2407129	2409169	It's also coming out this week in Japan.
2410010	2411810	Elite Beat Agents, some of you know that here.
2411850	2413191	You pre-ordered that, didn't you, Shane?
2414917	2418180	You pre-ordered it, and you got next day shipping or something, right?
2418220	2422243	My shipping costs about the same as the game, because I care that much.
2422623	2423924	You have to have it that early, right?
2423944	2436874	Yes, I've watched that stupid demo that they put up on YouTube from the download kiosks in Japan a million times, and I watched the TouchDS.jp videos a million times, and I'm so excited.
2437735	2439296	I don't know any of the songs except for one.
2439356	2441137	So you spent like $80 on this game?
2441878	2442699	I would say closer to $90.
2444403	2444703	Wow.
2445043	2445303	Yes.
2446024	2451586	I do want to say actually one other game because I actually went and looked at the PC and Macintosh releases coming out.
2452006	2455568	And Korea, you know, we don't talk a whole lot about what goes on in Korea.
2455788	2457989	But they are getting a game that's worth mentioning here.
2458029	2459329	This is my favorite title of the week.
2459349	2462150	An adventure game for the PC called Princess Maker 5.
2463591	2465752	Princess Maker 5 coming out in Korea.
2466352	2466973	Looks like fun.
2467233	2469534	In this game you get to, it looks like, make princesses.
2470354	2470914	Go figure.
2471514	2472715	See, there's all their little stats.
2473663	2474223	DarkSakura.com
2490022	2491604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2510359	2513120	What was that Mana game on PlayStation 1?
2537526	2538386	Secret of Mana?
2538406	2539007	No, Legend of Mana.
2539027	2543368	Legend of Mana is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played in my entire fucking life.
2543388	2544589	Try playing it in Japanese.
2545629	2549450	Oh, that's just salt in the wound right there, because that game's... I'm sorry, it sucked.
2549470	2557733	I don't have any nice... It wasn't... If they would go back, because... Okay, what you should do, get an emulator and play the translation of Seiken Densetsu 3.
2557773	2558394	Oh, I have.
2558974	2560094	It's fucking beautiful.
2560134	2560334	It is.
2560394	2562395	We need to have a game be like that.
2562695	2563715	Wii Virtual Console?
2563755	2564076	Hello.
2564416	2564676	Maybe.
2564856	2565096	Someday.
2565116	2565196	Okay.
2565820	2569702	But yeah, I was just saying that because Dawn of Mana, I don't know, I approach with caution.
2571142	2581466	If you haven't bought Marvel Ultimate Alliance yet on the 360 and you're thinking about doing it, you definitely want to pick up Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold, which is coming out this week as well.
2581926	2587088	It's basically the same game with the download codes for the extra characters, so that's pretty awesome.
2587928	2591890	Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, is coming out on PSP this week.
2592870	2596093	Don't let that fool you, it's exactly the same damn game all over again.
2596533	2597734	And let's see here.
2598815	2604279	Etrian Odyssey, some RPG game coming out on the DS.
2604640	2608643	And then, of course, if you're a baseball fan, MLB07, The Show on PlayStation 3.
2608743	2613206	And then finally, the rounded up, really strange game, Touch the Dead.
2613907	2615188	And that's coming out on the DS.
2615308	2617010	Think House of the Dead on the DS.
2617410	2618531	I want to touch the dead.
2619351	2620352	That sounds kind of kinky.
2620913	2621413	And, of course...
2623061	2623581	Nanny Mania
2649466	2651007	I love that stage.
2651407	2653868	It makes me think of Super Nanny on TV.
2654528	2656649	Or Nanny 911, whatever those shows are.
2657269	2662191	And then I was going to say, oh yeah, that's right, Naruto Ninja Council 3 is also coming out in the DS.
2662231	2664332	I don't know how many Naruto fans are out there.
2664512	2666453	Too damn many.
2667193	2667573	Interesting.
2667733	2669794	TheRobD in chat is picking a fight with Loki here.
2669854	2671455	Why does Loki hate sequels?
2673035	2676857	And why is he not hating on MLB 07, which is a giant rehash itself?
2677648	2678809	I didn't say I didn't hate it.
2680410	2682351	I said if you like baseball.
2682591	2684012	What was I hating on sequels for?
2684052	2685473	I said Shrek the Third sucks.
2686393	2688775	I mean, Shrek the Third, I mean, obviously the games are going to suck.
2688815	2690776	If it was Shrek the First, it'd still suck.
2691997	2693557	No, we want more Shrek go-karts.
2695379	2696479	I wasn't hating on anything.
2697100	2698861	When did I hate on a sequel when I was talking there?
2698881	2700361	There wasn't any sequels I hated on.
2701322	2703603	Except for, oh, Art of Fighting Anthology, because that's not a sequel.
2703623	2704404	It's just a re-release.
2704504	2706265	TheRobD admits I'm mostly stirring up trouble.
2708178	2708618	Drama.
2708718	2709198	Well done.
2709258	2709639	Drama.
2711419	2715500	So, well, we have UK releases, like 5.
2716861	2721522	On the 15th, we have Freestyle Street Basketball for PC.
2723263	2724543	And then everything else is Sony.
2725504	2729905	We have Innocent Life, Legend of the Dragon, and SOCOM US Navy Seals.
2730645	2736487	Fire Bravo 2 on PSP, and on PlayStation 2, we have SOCOM US Navy Seals Combined Assault.
2738123	2738803	and that's it.
2740584	2740904	Awesome.
2741865	2745647	Alright, well let's get back into some news talking about upcoming releases.
2746127	2749249	Rock Band is rumored to be coming out on the Wii.
2749709	2752650	Lots and lots of rumors going around about this this week.
2753491	2757453	Apparently it's because there's focus group testing going on.
2758013	2759133	They've been testing with focus group.
2759894	2766357	MTV's been asking about packaging and pricing like how much would you pay and then the Wii was also one of the systems that
2766653	2767414	Thank you for watching!
2786128	2794953	By the way, during this focus group, the group was asked what they would think about a bundle including the game, a wireless guitar, a drum kit, and a microphone for $200.
2795473	2799335	Didn't go over well with the group.
2799375	2802357	$175 went over a little better.
2802377	2804158	$150 was when everybody in the group got on board.
2804438	2809481	It's supposed to be an actual drum set.
2809821	2811362	Can you imagine how big this box is?
2811382	2813743	Where the fuck am I going to put that in my shithole apartment?
2814104	2814604	Exactly.
2815635	2819858	What college dorm is going to fit that?
2820438	2827643	It's a cool concept for a game, but this is why they didn't have any arcade style drum mania controllers or anything.
2828103	2835028	They left it at Guitar Freaks and said, okay, those controllers are big enough, we don't need to bring the huge fucking drum set.
2835356	2843801	Do you remember when we were younger, like in junior high or whatever, they had those drumsticks that you could just hit anywhere in the air and they had a little speaker.
2843821	2845622	I think they were called like hit sticks or something.
2845943	2852827	And you could play the drums and the little crappy speaker that was attached to them would go, like you could just wave the drums in the air.
2853367	2854548	It was like 10 bucks.
2854588	2855468	That could be the controller.
2855488	2864354	Do you remember back in the day when I had the actual cabinet and everything and I was talking about how I was going to make actual drums, you know, a drum set for Guitar Freaks Drum Mania?
2865233	2866153	Yeah, I'm glad I didn't do that.
2867054	2867594	For real.
2868234	2870055	Blaze says those still exist.
2870255	2870775	I'll be damned.
2871596	2872996	DJ Dark Knight says I had one.
2873036	2874077	I think a lot of us had one.
2874577	2875498	Those things are pretty rad.
2875958	2877058	Did you have one of those, Mikhail Tov?
2877098	2878139	I see you nodding your head over there.
2880200	2883201	My cousins did, and I wasn't allowed to play with them because I was really little.
2883501	2886963	But yeah, they were really awesome looking at the time.
2887463	2889163	And kind of stupid, though, now that I think about it.
2889183	2891264	They were pretty stupid in retrospect.
2891985	2894806	But I'm thinking those were cheap, and they didn't take up any space at all.
2895708	2896408	It's pretty awesome.
2896688	2897008	I don't know.
2897068	2900730	I think this is getting a little crazy with your obsession with music games.
2900770	2910933	I mean, the thing with Guitar Hero, I mean, $80, I almost said Guitar Freaks, $80 is a really big investment, I think, for a game.
2911533	2916055	And a $200 investment in a game, you better hope this game is fucking awesome.
2916435	2918296	Because otherwise, you're going to be fucking pissed.
2918796	2924178	So, I mean, besides, if you want to buy, you know, Rock Band, boy, do we have a game for you!
2924458	2925298	The Eye of Judgment!
2926099	2931123	It too will have a lot of extra crap and will probably be expensive.
2932064	2937968	Another game that's rumored to be coming out on another system would be Table Tennis for the Wii.
2938088	2939469	Rockstar's Table Tennis, that is.
2939789	2944253	Of course, it's going to be scaled down graphically, but hey, it's Table Tennis on the Wii.
2944893	2948236	Because everybody likes Wii Tennis, so of course this is going to do well.
2950497	2951518	How would that work?
2951618	2952699	Because I seem to remember...
2953018	2955850	I mean the gameplay mechanics would have to be completely different
2956772	2956832	Yep.
2956852	2957732	If I'm not mistaking.
2958092	2958833	Well, maybe not.
2959093	2969416	Because I seem to remember, I haven't played table tennis in a while, but I seem to remember, like, you had to look very carefully at the ball to see what color it was glowing because that was showing you the type of spin that was on the ball.
2969756	2977798	And that was very important for how you could respond to that to better, you know, defeat your opponent was to, you know, counter with the appropriate type of spin.
2978078	2979359	How would you do that with the Wiimote?
2979379	2982120	Would you just have to use the one and two buttons or the D-pad or something?
2982160	2982520	I don't know.
2982660	2983540	But here's what I've been thinking.
2983560	2983600	Um...
2986909	2999099	People think because people liked Wii Sports, because it was a packing title and everybody loves the games that came with it and stuff, that people would want to buy a game that does exactly the same thing for more money.
2999760	3000540	That's why I didn't understand.
3000721	3005905	I mean, tennis itself, yeah, it was fun bringing it out and people would come over and stuff like that.
3006245	3009488	I wouldn't buy a tennis game, though, just because I like playing Wii Tennis.
3009988	3010809	Like, fuck that shit.
3010829	3011870	I've got a free game right here.
3011890	3013031	Why would I buy another game?
3015242	3019143	I'm reading chatroom and there's some comments on the previous story about Rock Band.
3019544	3028747	GS68 wrote, in all caps, Drum Mania is a blatant rip-off of Rock Band with crappy Jap techno and timing judgments and cheats, aka speed mods.
3029607	3035729	You know, and that's exactly how X-Play will probably review it if the game comes out next year from Konami for whatever crazy reason.
3037050	3044072	Although they'll say that it came out, they'll acknowledge the fact that it came out, but they'll say that it's improved on it because this actually teaches you how to play drums.
3045600	3049402	Out of all the Bomani series, I think that's the only one I thought you had to do something.
3053244	3053804	Keyboard Mania.
3054084	3059206	You could actually take the real version of Keyboard Mania and play it on a real keyboard and it would sound very similar.
3061467	3062908	Unless you played on easy like I did.
3063768	3065829	Then you'd get something that sounded kind of close.
3066829	3069350	Well, I mean, still, though, those games, it was pretty good.
3069470	3071590	It's like I saw, you know, for example, Lankstyle.
3072010	3074231	You know, I saw him start off on, you know, that.
3074251	3077811	I don't know if he was a drummer beforehand, but, you know, he got pretty good by the end.
3077851	3083993	I mean, and I've seen people that just start playing Drum Mania, and then, you know, you see them about a year later, they're just busting out like a real drummer.
3084053	3084713	So, I don't know.
3085013	3095375	It does, well, and I've learned this as a musician, that half of playing is, you know, the more you do it, it comes to a point where you're, you build the instinct for it.
3095856	3096856	Your hands will know what to do.
3097737	3103319	You know, that's what got me through band is that after a while you train yourself to know how to do these things.
3104379	3105019	And it's the same thing.
3105299	3107180	Jvmon has another interesting point in chat.
3107300	3109961	Parapara Paradise taught Parapara dancing.
3110661	3117984	Sort of, but I remember when that game first came out and people over here didn't know that it was based off the Japanese thing, people used to rave on that.
3118004	3120705	I remember that one guy who used to do all his crazy rave dancing.
3121145	3121865	That was funny.
3122629	3125410	Yeah, I'm gonna hang my head down now.
3126451	3127311	Did you do that too?
3127551	3127991	Yes.
3128071	3129172	With your glow sticks?
3129752	3130112	No.
3131813	3134354	But I remember we'd get everybody shadowing and that was great.
3134874	3137235	Especially when we ate the sign that said no shadowing.
3138410	3138930	Who did that?
3139110	3139771	That's right.
3140031	3144452	Golfland dared to put a sign on the machine that said no shadowing.
3144533	3145933	We got a picture of somebody eating it.
3146073	3146813	Rick ate it.
3146953	3147234	Rick.
3147314	3147794	That was Rick.
3147814	3148294	We got a guy.
3148334	3150115	We said, this rule sucks.
3150595	3152395	And we dared Rick to eat the sign.
3152455	3152976	So he did.
3153036	3154316	He tore the sign off the machine.
3154356	3155136	And I'm not kidding.
3155176	3156097	He fucking ate it.
3158378	3159078	Good times.
3159912	3164395	and then we all shadowed in defiance of Golfland's neo-Nazi policies.
3164635	3174942	In Rick's defense, I mean, this is the guy that didn't they have like the challenges that they would do where they would like either, I don't remember if they sniffed a whole bunch of cinnamon or ate a whole bunch of cinnamon.
3175282	3179284	Some weird shit like that, drinking a gallon of milk, you know, that kind of weird crazy shit.
3181446	3186489	GS68 has a great idea for a macro if I could find that picture.
3186529	3188310	I know there's a picture that exists with Rick
3188646	3189987	with half a sign in his mouth.
3190988	3192849	I made you a sign, but I eated it.
3193410	3196112	A cat macro.
3196132	3196812	That's beautiful.
3196932	3197553	That would be great.
3197953	3199974	Winner, GS68, Shatter of the Evening.
3200014	3200675	Congratulations.
3201135	3202196	Yeah, you win a no prize.
3203377	3204998	So I've got, though, some fun news.
3205859	3208221	You know one of my favorite games ever is Soul Calibur, right?
3208681	3210402	And I've told you about Rod Calibur, haven't I?
3211143	3212324	Using the fishing thing?
3212444	3214765	When you played on Dreamcast, use the fishing rod to play Soul Calibur.
3214826	3215486	It's hilarious.
3215866	3218028	I've also tried doing it with the Dreamcast dance pads.
3218669	3220570	And the only analog on there is the Konami symbol.
3222051	3223733	But Rod Calibur is the most fun.
3224113	3226855	I always thought Rod Calibur was a different game I played with my rod.
3227635	3229376	You know what, Rod, let me finish the story, okay?
3230597	3238062	Well now, um, and I think that this is beautiful because in my brain it's an homage to Rod Calibur.
3238723	3241465	Soul Calibur Legends is coming out on the Wii.
3243206	3246308	And it's going to be using the nunchuck and the, uh,
3247034	3247614	The Weemote.
3248134	3250355	So I'm just seeing Rod Calibur all over again.
3250375	3252876	But you know what's fucking awesome about the game, though?
3253936	3255636	It's kind of like a beat-em-up game.
3255956	3261498	Except hopefully it's not going to be like that Tekken game with... What's her name?
3262018	3263078	Death by Degrees.
3263438	3263739	Yeah.
3264139	3264899	Hope it's not like that.
3265359	3267340	Maybe it's like the Tekken Force mode from Tekken 3.
3267740	3272021	So, Jamie, to sum up, I will soon be able to play Rod Calibur with my Wii.
3272521	3272761	Yes.
3273621	3274622	Rod Calibur with your Wii.
3274822	3275382	Fabulous.
3276222	3276362	Rod...
3276747	3281311	And for anyone who still has a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur, you should try Rod Calibur if you never have.
3283092	3286114	Alright, well... You know, I just want to mention real quick.
3286294	3286554	Sure.
3287135	3292339	There will be some fishing games coming out in the fall for the Wii that actually have a fishing rod controller.
3292719	3296342	Therefore, Rod Calibur for a whole other generation.
3298844	3298924	Ah...
3299229	3308255	Well, one person that won't be playing Soul Calibur on the Wii anytime soon or any derivative of the game is this guy who emailed Kotaku earlier this week.
3308355	3310036	And this was a story here.
3310056	3312238	I'm just going to quote this story from a Kotaku article here.
3312738	3314839	Quote, Buying a Wii was a big deal for me.
3314919	3320643	Seeing those 250 hard-earned dollars and some change go flying from her hand and into the water was painful.
3321524	3324986	We would probably be together right now if she had not thrown out my beloved Wii.
3325026	3328789	But alas, you can't talk a crazy woman out of an idea of such magnitude.
3329451	3334794	This guy's wife took the Wii and threw it into a lake during a heated argument.
3335334	3338495	Anyway, and he goes on to say, Anyways, divorce is imminent.
3338655	3341617	I'm talking to a lawyer tomorrow to get the process started.
3342017	3348980	I'm not divorcing her just because of the Wii throwing, but that's the rather large straw that broke the Dromedary's back.
3350641	3352122	I would have thrown her right after that.
3354443	3355984	Throw her in the river, go get my Wii?
3356924	3358885	What would you do if Nellie threw your Wii into the lake?
3360253	3362874	I'd be pissed I'd buy another one Maybe Anyways
3384304	3386045	I don't know, this sounds pretty cool.
3386626	3392850	Last game that came out, I know like this, the Rygar game on PlayStation 2 was pretty awesome.
3393230	3395031	Now they're doing Project Rygar for the Wii.
3395492	3399575	And of course it's going to be a brand new game exclusively for the Wii.
3400715	3407420	And no real details about that, except it's supposed to have new characters, new enemies, new weapons, yada yada yada.
3408120	3413324	But one of the announcements from Tecmo's party that they did.
3413715	3417876	because everyone is having their gamers day or Tecmo's, I guess, night out of seven.
3417896	3419797	I don't know.
3419897	3421337	They have a pretty cool piece of artwork.
3421357	3424058	That's the only bit of info from the game so far.
3424458	3427019	Looks pretty Guilty Gear-ish, actually.
3427419	3427879	Interesting.
3429559	3431780	You know, I never played the Rygar game on PlayStation 2.
3432000	3434361	I somehow missed it, but I did enjoy the old NES one.
3434401	3437982	That's like one of my favorite 8-bit games ever, even if it was really different from the arcade.
3438042	3438782	Well, you know what?
3439442	3442443	Then probably when this game gets closer to coming out, Virtual Console.
3443359	3445861	Ninja Spirit, TurboGrafx Game
3474279	3476841	and also NES Open Tournament Golf.
3479443	3480043	I think that's it.
3481044	3481304	Wow.
3482045	3485868	Sucks to be in the UK because neither of those games really are that good to me.
3486468	3489010	I vaguely remember it.
3489050	3489931	I think I played it once.
3491111	3492492	Golf is more like crap.
3493153	3495895	Didn't it come out kind of in response to Ninja Gaiden?
3496823	3497563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3519500	3521501	because you do the leaning thing in the dance.
3521521	3521961	That was cool.
3522342	3524943	D-Vay has a Mother's Day message in chat here.
3525023	3527844	My mom rocked at Ninja Spirit for some reason.
3528225	3529265	Don't know why I bought it.
3530566	3532627	My mom never really played video games at all.
3532907	3534668	I couldn't get her to play anything.
3534728	3540371	So I don't know that whole experience of walking in and your mom or your dad is playing a video game of yours.
3540891	3542172	Mom, what are you doing?
3543793	3545434	Oh, I'm just beating the level 3 boss.
3547615	3547895	Anyhow.
3548434	3549915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3571616	3572737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3590635	3602059	Techmo Bowl was one of the few sports games I really, really got into on the NES because back then, sports games were so simple that you didn't really have to be a professor of the sport to do well at them.
3602499	3605861	So I'm pretty excited that Techmo Bowl is re-coming out.
3606181	3610522	Except the weird thing about it is that they're not saying what system it's coming out on.
3611043	3619946	They're just saying, quote, I can't tell you what platform we're making it for, but I can tell you that it's probably not going to be on the platform that you're expecting.
3620310	3621371	If that makes any sense.
3622211	3623812	And I actually have no idea what that means.
3623852	3625132	Does that mean Xbox Live Arcade?
3626013	3626533	Cell phone?
3626553	3627853	Well, they already have a cell phone.
3628174	3628674	Tecmo Bowl.
3628694	3631295	I actually downloaded Tecmo Bowl to my cell phone about a year ago.
3631315	3632776	I was very disappointed.
3632856	3634817	Actually, they're not working with Visual Concepts.
3635117	3637478	It's a little play on there.
3638358	3643140	They're saying they joined Visual Concepts because Visual Concepts is doing that All Pro 2K8 or whatever.
3645058	3649081	Basically, they're comparing them because they don't have the NFL license as well.
3649441	3655024	It looks like Tecmo is going to be developing it by themselves, or at least with an unnamed developer.
3655725	3658426	I'm going to guess that it's the N-Gage that they're working on.
3659347	3667032	Because they are doing that whole N-Gage 3 relaunch thing or whatever, so that's the system I least expect it on.
3668913	3669673	How about the Atari 2600?
3669713	3672255	That's the system I would least expect it on.
3673612	3674812	What about Virtual Console?
3675772	3677833	Nope, we already have Tecmo Bowl on Virtual Console.
3678353	3678633	Kinda.
3678693	3679873	Yeah, but a new one though.
3679933	3680893	Oh, that'd be cool.
3681574	3685994	But you know, the weird thing is I had like this Tecmo Collection or something like that.
3686195	3689795	It was called, I don't remember, like a Tecmo Collection that came out on Xbox.
3690115	3692856	And it had the old arcade version of Tecmo Bowl on it.
3693376	3695136	Not nearly as fun as the NES one.
3695456	3699997	And I realize a lot of people kind of only know that as the Tecmo Bowl, but it was kind of clunky to me.
3700737	3703478	It didn't have that fast pacedness that the NES one had.
3704130	3704670	So there you go.
3707473	3711336	Anyways, some interesting stuff.
3711356	3726427	Another thing that was announced over in during the Square Enix little Final Fantasy party there was that they're going to be bringing Chocobo Dungeon to actually to the Wii exclusively, which is kind of neat.
3727008	3734013	So that'll be kind of cool, I guess, with aren't they having the new, I want to say they had Dragon Quest Swords as well coming out
3736191	3737212	Lots of stuff for the Wii.
3737252	3739252	Lots of Wii love, which is good.
3740732	3748734	You know, I don't remember if any news about this made our show roll, but isn't there information as well about Crystal Chronicles that came out of the event?
3749614	3751435	I know that they're doing a DS version.
3751475	3754355	I think they may have announced a date for that.
3755016	3757196	Wasn't the Wii one supposed to be a launch title?
3759316	3759536	Maybe.
3760377	3761757	Maybe in Japan, but I don't...
3762228	3763029	I know that didn't happen.
3763049	3770876	No, I distinctly remember seeing some type of Crystal Chronicles stuff in some of the early press things for the Wii, like it was an early launch title.
3771036	3774959	They announced, what was it, the DS version is going to be coming to Japan on August 23rd.
3775019	3778102	That was the announcement that I believe was there.
3778142	3779684	I don't know about the Wii version at all.
3780184	3783107	I don't think there was anything announced there.
3784668	3788031	Alright, well, I don't know, are you excited about Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii?
3788430	3789130	Nope, don't care.
3789450	3791931	I couldn't give a crap when the DS version came out.
3792131	3795992	Especially didn't give a crap for the Japanese one.
3798053	3800613	Mikotov, have you ever played the Chocobo Dungeon games?
3800733	3803594	Are you excited about this new Wii One at all?
3804554	3806855	No, but I'm excited about Crystal Chronicles.
3807055	3807855	I'm very excited.
3808556	3810656	Me and my friends played the GameCube one a whole bunch.
3810696	3817318	We never beat it, but we had a really good time with it because we had all the Game Boy Advances linked up and it was just a really good time and
3817728	3821170	I expect the DS one will be probably a little more fun.
3822210	3827152	Ross Steel UT says in chat, will Crystal Chronicles require four DSs for multiplayer?
3827393	3827873	Of course.
3828893	3829293	I hope not.
3829313	3830254	I don't think it will.
3830274	3830514	What?
3830574	3834256	Are you going to have people share the DS when they're playing?
3834636	3839118	If it's just the DS version, everybody's going to need a copy and a DS to play.
3839298	3842820	Is that maybe one reason that they've kind of held off on putting this out on the Wii?
3843320	3847522	Is because there hasn't really been a game that has the DS connectivity yet?
3847932	3848452	So they're waiting?
3848752	3853495	Probably, but I would really like them to do a Wii one already, and the DS one.
3854276	3855636	Bring it, Square, Enix.
3856056	3861239	So even though the story was about Chocobo Dungeon, we couldn't help but throw in a little bit of Crystal Chronicles in there, so go figure.
3861259	3863080	Because we talked about a good game instead.
3864081	3864761	Well, there you have it.
3865101	3867203	Well, you have potential for something to be relatively good.
3869484	3874327	They are doing, actually, a Final Fantasy sort of fighting game.
3876108	3876548	Her Guys 2?
3877521	3879544	Final Fantasy Dissidia.
3881346	3893844	And it's looking like it's going to be more like a big... It sort of looks like it's more of a big... I'm sorry, the only thing I can really think of looking at this is like a sort of like...
3895152	3899675	Is this just an excuse to give the fangirls their Cloud X Tidus stories?
3899695	3901216	No, because Steffi is my bishy.
3924403	3924643	Yeah.
3924923	3925543	Wow, you're lame.
3926004	3926324	All right.
3926944	3927824	Just kidding, hearts.
3928225	3928725	All right, anyhow.
3928785	3929805	I was a Squall fan girl.
3930265	3936548	Well, now all of the, you could, if this is, if this ends up, you know, being what the game's all about, you could have all, all of those guys battling it out.
3937008	3937568	I know.
3938008	3938549	It's great.
3939149	3939729	All right, anyhow.
3941310	3944751	Shadows Fitzlair in chat says, Super Smash Brothers Final Fantasy Edition.
3945832	3946672	Maybe, maybe.
3947389	3948469	StarOcean1 and StarOcean2
3970656	3975777	You may remember these games were originally on the Super Nintendo and the PlayStation 1, but now they are going to be coming to the PSP.
3975857	3990481	By the way, if you would like a new Star Ocean game, Star Ocean 4 is confirmed to be under development and will be coming out soon, but they haven't exactly said which platform it's going to be coming out to yet, I believe.
3992421	3998503	Well, people are assuming it's PS3 and Xbox 360, and most people are assuming it has to be PlayStation 3, because all the other games were...
3999306	4000347	on the Sony platforms.
4000447	4003390	But, you know, anything's possible, especially with Square.
4003910	4005651	They've jumped ship before to other systems.
4005691	4008213	I mean, hello, Dragon Quest going to DS.
4008554	4009755	Who would have thought that was going to happen?
4010155	4010635	Well, there you go.
4011696	4017561	Well, I was thinking, it says it was officially announced for next-gen consoles.
4018021	4019262	Oh, never mind the DS thing.
4019302	4023265	Well, technically, I don't know.
4023365	4027529	Again, though, you can assume it's the PlayStation, but then they'll make a surprise jump to Wii.
4027549	4027949	You never know.
4029977	4030357	There you go.
4032359	4041387	Anyways, so of more, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but more rumors regarding the PSP getting a redesign.
4042388	4044330	One I had to laugh at when I saw this story.
4044670	4056340	There's a rumor that the PSPs are going to be now being shipped with downloadable, with firmwares with downloadable prevention software.
4058797	4062479	Right, like all the other ones had it so you can download.
4062859	4068402	No, I'm sorry, I don't think they're going to have it where you can enable it not to be able to be downgraded.
4069742	4071743	But they're going to try, apparently, that's the rumor.
4072364	4074625	So wait, what exactly are they blocking?
4074665	4075925	You can't download anything?
4076185	4077266	No, they're downgradable.
4077306	4079527	They're going to make it so you can't downgrade the firmware.
4080007	4080968	I don't see how that's going to happen.
4080988	4083929	Well, don't they say that every other time they release a patch?
4084089	4084389	Yes.
4085670	4085810	So...
4086505	4089926	Anyways, they're basically, that's the rumor, it's supposed to be happening.
4091266	4100128	They said all new PSPs shipping out as of next Friday, which is May 18th, will be at a higher firmware, 4 point something.
4100768	4110030	And it says they promised to include, and this is coming from an EB Games regional manager in Canada.
4111070	4113090	So I don't know how much you can believe that.
4113110	4115591	What are you trying to say about Canada?
4116092	4117533	I'm trying to say something about EB.
4118955	4120636	But basically, here's what they're saying.
4120696	4132627	Sony was sending out emails to its commercial retailers that all new PSPs will be sent out with downgradable prevention built right into them.
4132687	4139533	All new PSPs will be shipped out as of next week, Friday, May 18th, will be a higher firmware for .xx.
4140211	4141611	Isn't this just a challenge to hackers?
4141631	4142032	Yes, it is.
4161542	4162362	It's not going to happen.
4162382	4163763	And at this point, no.
4164143	4171748	The problem is, is there really... It's not when they said Blu-ray and HD DVD is uncrackable and then, you know, the code's all over the front page of Dig a few months later.
4171768	4177752	Okay, let's just say, for example, if they do release this firmware or whatever, that's for new PSPs.
4177852	4180193	There's a lot of them out there right now that do not have that.
4180794	4181034	So...
4181983	4182363	Big deal.
4182403	4193010	That's about the equivalent of them changing the $5 bill to a new version that can't be counterfeited, but the old ones are still in circulation and still being used, so it's kind of dumb.
4194391	4207920	Anywho, the other, of course, rumor that we've talked about before is saying that a new PSP redesign is going to become, and it'll be smaller and a lighter weight version of the handheld device.
4209060	4211382	No release date, no price point,
4212387	4213769	and no other info on that.
4213869	4224366	So I would say that's a big fat rumor, but I think people are thinking that's going to happen since, I don't know, that they haven't monkeyed with it yet and that they can't do that with all their console systems.
4225808	4226109	All right.
4226775	4229137	The website of the week is MyCatHatesYou.com and this is a
4255327	4258229	Big, massive collection of pissed off cats.
4259469	4260290	It's beautiful.
4261970	4263511	It's just lovely.
4263711	4265652	That's all it is, is pictures of angry cats.
4265952	4266513	Pretty much.
4266893	4269414	Our cats are doing naughty, bad things.
4269434	4276418	There's this one cat, and one of the first things is this cat with a leather jacket on it and a big hat, looking all badass.
4276798	4278379	And it's also one of those bald cats.
4280760	4281941	Interesting.
4282081	4282661	Interesting.
4288806	4294011	MyCatHatesYou.com Your cat doesn't really hate me though, right, DarkSakura?
4294231	4296333	My cat doesn't hate anybody, she just looks offended.
4297033	4298355	Alright, here you go.
4300096	4308644	Alright, well, one more story for you for this segment, this part of Orange Lounge Radio, and that's about some homebrew that's being made for the DS.
4309805	4310265	This is...
4312042	4314483	I don't know exactly how to describe this game.
4314543	4320786	I kind of look at it like a sort of like puzzle type game, but the game is called Virus DX.
4321387	4325869	It's a puzzle game, but this puzzle game has hot anime nurses with it.
4326669	4335874	Basically, and I'm assuming they must get, you know, naked if you do good, because this is being called XXX Homebrew, available on the Nintendo DS.
4336494	4337255	And that's not all.
4337295	4341577	They have like, what is it, strip rock, paper, scissors, tickle girl, and teenage queen...
4342213	4342673	NDS.
4342753	4344454	Yes, lots of fun stuff there.
4344474	4345314	I like Tickle Girl.
4345354	4346374	What's Tickle Girl about?
4346434	4349115	I don't know, but I'm thinking about buying stuff too.
4349855	4353176	Wow, you actually see a picture of a girl on the bottom screen there.
4353796	4358197	And if you tickle her with your stylus, you can see her reaction on the top screen.
4358657	4363079	And it will utilize full motion video, sampled audio, and looping background music.
4365399	4368480	And they're saying if you liked Feel the Magic, you'll love this.
4371755	4374197	I want to see strip rock, paper, scissors.
4376999	4383824	That's like when you're trying to convince someone to play strip poker with you and they're like, but I don't know how to play poker.
4383964	4386526	So you say, okay, let's play strip high card.
4386926	4394652	All it is is it's basically a rock, paper, scissor and then they have like porn pictures that they've taken off of a website that's in a series or something.
4394752	4396633	Why bother with the game, seriously?
4396753	4400176	Why not just have, you know, DS porno?
4401280	4401740	Why bother?
4401760	4402680	Let's get the web browser.
4403860	4404621	I guess that's true, too.
4406081	4407041	But this is homebrew.
4407081	4408441	This you can get for free, right?
4408461	4410202	Whereas the browser costs like 50 bucks.
4411942	4412222	Right?
4412242	4417523	Actually, Teenage Queen NDS is actually pretty... It's all hand-drawn animation.
4417543	4418183	That's kind of neat.
4418643	4420583	It's a poker game, it looks like.
4422604	4425544	Yeah, but that's probably about as good as strip poker was on the Commodore 64.
4425824	4426204	Yeah.
4429165	4430605	It's all about Custer's Revenge.
4432094	4437439	Dude, it's all about, you know, fucking, you know, putting some more adult, like, games.
4437819	4439861	What the fuck is that one game I used to play all the time?
4440062	4441183	Uh, the guy... Gals Panic!
4441243	4442864	They need to put Gals Panic on there.
4443084	4444085	Oh, I thought the guy game.
4444105	4449290	Eh, you know... Where they would have the contest between the women, like the video sequences that you'd unlock.
4449610	4451032	They have that now in Girls Gone Wild.
4451052	4451812	It's kind of retarded.
4451852	4452133	Do they?
4452353	4453173	Yeah, it's lame.
4453274	4453874	Good times, though.
4454455	4454835	Good times.
4456303	4460225	Alright, well anyway, that's going to do it here for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
