7000	14000	There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco
14000	16000	Tonight, May 13th, 2007
16000	20000	Could the Xbox Live Marketplace be set to compete with iTunes?
20000	23000	The easy release of Spore faces yet another delay
23000	27000	And a PlayStation series is revived on cell phones?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	43000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle
43000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura
47000	49000	But you might know her as Jamie Summers
49000	51000	I love salad
51000	55000	I heard your TV shows getting picked up by NBC after all
55000	57000	The Bionic Woman, the remake
57000	58000	What?
58000	59000	Yeah, they're making a remake of Bionic Woman
59000	61000	That's so fucking cool
61000	63000	Because I think of your name and everything
63000	65000	You know, your name, quote unquote
65000	70000	To recap for new people
70000	74000	My mom was going to name me Erica
74000	78000	And the little girl next door said, no, you should name her after the Bionic Woman
78000	79000	Name her Jamie
79000	82000	So my mom named me Jamie, only she spelled it right
82000	86000	And so that's why I took Summers as my last name for my stage name
86000	87000	There you go
87000	92000	Because I am named after, my mom showed her very small nerd roots
92000	96000	But you've been using that name on air for the past, you know, five years or so
96000	98000	I've been using it since under sedation
98000	102000	Yeah, so a long time, so it's just kind of funny that now the Bionic Woman is coming back, so
102000	104000	Do we get neat sound effects?
104000	105000	I don't know, well maybe
105000	108000	Dude, it will not be the same if we do not get neat sound effects when she runs
108000	112000	I do know that the people behind Battlestar Galactica have a hand in this
112000	114000	A new remake, so it should be pretty awesome
114000	118000	Because if there's one show I've been watching a shitload of lately, it's Battlestar Galactica
118000	121000	Finally, I'm like three years late, but I'm finally catching up
121000	124000	The last Battlestar Galactica thing I saw was on Robot Chicken
124000	127000	With the giant mecha things falling over
127000	128000	Alright
128000	129000	The Cylons
129000	130000	Yeah
130000	132000	And there's Techmaster Loki
132000	135000	That was a funny episode, that was like one of the first ones actually
135000	138000	I was watching the Optimus Prime with prostate cancer thing
138000	139000	Yeah
139000	142000	Well, Bionic Woman, that sounds kind of retarded actually
142000	144000	It could be cool though, I mean
144000	150000	What, is she going to run super fast with a cell phone in her hand, trip into laypeople and cause a super crash or something?
150000	152000	It's not the Bionic Soccer Mom
152000	160000	We can rebuild her, she will be even more, you know, destruction prone
160000	162000	It sounds like a horrible show
162000	165000	Bionic Man sounds even retarded
165000	166000	That sounds kind of dumb too
166000	169000	And Bionic Woman is like, I'm going to rage at you
169000	171000	That was the Six Million Dollar Man
171000	173000	I was going to say, they have the Six Million Dollar Man, so
173000	176000	Oh, well then that's lame, I don't even give a shit about the Bionic Woman
176000	177000	Well, I believe
177000	180000	Unless she has a claw that comes out of her hand and she can swing on things and fights Hitler
180000	181000	I believe
181000	183000	Bionic Commando
183000	190000	I believe I was reading in one of those websites that in this new Bionic Woman, she's a 50 million dollar woman
190000	192000	They have 50 million dollars worth of parts in her
192000	194000	Well yeah, inflation, you know, is a bitch
194000	197000	That'll buy a nice pair of tits though
197000	198000	Alright
198000	200000	It better for 50 million dollars
200000	202000	I want Rebecca Romain to play her
202000	204000	No, it's some British unknown
204000	208000	Somebody that isn't known here, but has been in some British shows
208000	209000	British, I know
209000	210000	Softy
210000	212000	I want someone who looks like Jane Fonda in the 60's
212000	216000	There's pictures, go to dig and look at the entertainment section and you can see pictures of the new Bionic Woman
216000	218000	Rob, I'm doing a show right now
218000	221000	Like that ever stopped you before
221000	222000	Alright
222000	225000	Anyway, also say hello, we'll get to video games soon, I promise
225000	227000	We have nerd stuff to get to first
227000	230000	Also say hello to a frequent guest of ours, but he hasn't been here in a while
230000	231000	Say hello to Miklotov
231000	232000	Hello
232000	234000	And where have you been young man?
234000	235000	I don't know
235000	236000	Where have I been?
236000	237000	The island of Pokemon
237000	239000	Yeah, you've been catching Pokemons
239000	240000	I'm tired
240000	241000	I just woke up
241000	242000	Alright
242000	243000	What's going on?
243000	245000	But I noticed that you're playing DS, you're playing Pokemon now
245000	246000	Yes
246000	247000	Still
247000	251000	Now, you started Pokemon and then you restarted your game
251000	253000	Why did you quit and restart your game completely?
253000	257000	Because I felt like I was doing too much trading and not enough playing
257000	261000	I was just not happy with my Pokemon, so I restarted
261000	265000	And I started with Chimchar, who I've named Homonkey
265000	267000	Like homo-monkey?
267000	268000	Like homo-monkey, yes
268000	271000	Like a Pokemon name, it's awesome
271000	278000	Shane, Miklotov, and I like to have naming contests for our Pokemon, like who can have the better names
278000	282000	Mine wins hands down, nothing's gonna top that, like nothing ever
282000	285000	No porch monkey would not fit, because he's not black
285000	288000	I liked, you named one of them Fancy Pants
288000	289000	Fancy Pants
289000	291000	Because it looked like it was wearing a big fur coat
291000	296000	And then it evolved into like this cyber grasshopper looking thing
296000	297000	It was ridiculous
297000	298000	It was ugly pants
298000	300000	I don't use it anymore
300000	301000	I like Muffins
301000	304000	Muffins is actually called Daddy Ore
304000	306000	What was the other one I just called it?
306000	309000	See the problem is, I don't know the real Pokemon names now
309000	311000	Because of my stupid names, because I named everything
311000	315000	Like I named one Sparkles, because it had a little thing on its tail
315000	317000	It had a little sparkle on its tail
317000	323000	My electric squirrel thing is named Ellinuts, because it's an electric squirrel
323000	327000	And I really got creative when I got that Ponyta
327000	330000	It's a fire horse, so I named it Hoarfires
330000	332000	So I just put fire in the middle of horse
332000	333000	That's it
333000	334000	That's very creative
334000	335000	It is creative
335000	336000	Good job
336000	337000	I enjoy it
337000	339000	Actually, I caught a Magikarp and named it Useless
339000	341000	I named it Fish Sticks
341000	342000	Alright, anyhow
342000	344000	Wow, we're nerds
344000	346000	Anyhow, also we have some nerds here in chat
346000	349000	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com
349000	352000	If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we record
352000	355000	Kind of a busy Sunday, we don't have as many people as we usually do
355000	358000	I mean, we're up against Mother's Day today
358000	360000	You know, there's a lot of people out doing stuff with their moms
360000	363000	Happy Mother's Day if we have any moms that listen to our program
363000	366000	Also, we are up against the finale of Survivor
366000	369000	You know, somebody actually had the balls to come into chat
369000	372000	And say, oh, sorry, I can't listen to you guys tonight, Survivor's on
372000	373000	Goodbye
373000	374000	Shut up
374000	379000	Okay, A, this season of Survivor was spoiled a long time ago if you read the forums
379000	381000	I can tell you who wins, but I'm going to be nice
381000	382000	He's already told me
382000	383000	For listeners to TiVo'd it
383000	385000	But, yeah, it's just, I don't know
385000	387000	I used to be the biggest Survivor fan
387000	390000	Like, I had a party when the first Survivor was ending
390000	392000	Okay, I was that hardcore nerd
392000	395000	But now, like, the game's really gotten just old
395000	398000	I haven't really gotten into any seasons since, like, maybe
398000	402000	Palau was, like, the last one I watched, which was a while ago
402000	403000	So, anyway
403000	405000	Don't you love reality television, DarkSakura?
405000	406000	No
406000	407000	Then we ought to get into our gaming weeks
407000	409000	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
409000	411000	It was kind of neat
411000	414000	I actually just played a whole lot of pinball
414000	416000	You know
416000	419000	I looked at Cooking Mama once
419000	421000	Just to show somebody
421000	423000	But, really, I've just been playing a bunch of pinball
423000	425000	And, you know, I got Guild Wars
425000	427000	Which, um, right now
427000	430000	I'm having to be really slow with moving on to my new computer
430000	434000	Because I actually have to replace all of my programs
434000	438000	So, I haven't really been playing a whole lot
438000	443000	Well, we are, though, we've decided we're getting Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360
443000	446000	Because we have more controllers
446000	447000	That's the only reason
447000	448000	Party
448000	449000	Party game
449000	451000	How many, can four folks play simultaneously on that one?
451000	452000	Yes
452000	453000	That's pretty cool
453000	454000	I've still yet to play it
454000	458000	But I've already laid claim
458000	459000	Alright
459000	462000	Well, what pinball tables have been dominating your time lately?
462000	465000	Twilight Zone, that game's a bitch
465000	468000	But you haven't really been playing the pinball game on 360
468000	469000	The new downloadable one
469000	471000	No, Dan can play it, I don't care
471000	473000	It kind of looks sucky to me
473000	475000	The whole point of pinball to me
475000	479000	The last good virtual pinball besides for Alien Crush and Devil's Crush
479000	482000	Was, like, Revenge of the Gator on Game Boy
482000	483000	Back in the day
483000	484000	That game was awesome
484000	486000	Oh, Sonic Spinball, of course
486000	488000	But that's not quite the same
488000	492000	But, you know, Devil's Crush and Alien Crush are the pinnacle of video pinball
492000	495000	Anything else is just a pale imitation
495000	500000	I have to say that, for me, it's having the flippers and the noises and the ball
500000	503000	And having my machine go Powerball and getting that ceramic ball
503000	505000	That the magnets can't do crap to
505000	507000	I love Twilight Zone
507000	509000	But I've also been playing Rocky and Bullwinkle
509000	513000	I like the pinball FX, but, you know, I think I was getting into this last week
513000	516000	Nothing is a replacement for the real thing, sadly
516000	517000	Nothing at all
517000	519000	You feel the machine move
519000	521000	And that's, I think, the
521000	523000	Not even Revenge of the Gator, sadly
523000	524000	Not even Revenge of the Gator
524000	525000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
525000	526000	It was good
526000	529000	Finally got the damn systems to land with each other
529000	530000	Apparently the problem was Crackdown
530000	534000	Because Crackdown is a little bitch and doesn't want to land with other systems
534000	536000	Unless you do it its way
536000	537000	So anyways
537000	540000	So I've been playing a little bit of Call of Duty 3
540000	541000	And that was fun
541000	544000	We landed together and had a little multiplayer game
544000	549000	And then once the Crackdown update came out
549000	551000	With the new download content
551000	555000	That pretty much screwed any chances I had with playing anything else
555000	557000	So I've been playing that
557000	559000	And the download content is pretty awesome
559000	561000	Especially the free-for-all pack
561000	565000	Which is the free stuff that basically unlocks the keys to the city
565000	569000	Which is basically a debug mode for the game
569000	571000	You can adjust the agility of your character
571000	574000	You can give yourself super agility to jump even higher
574000	577000	Or run super fast and then super strength
577000	581000	Plus you can spawn vehicles, spawn explosive barrels
581000	584000	Have all weapons, unlimited ammo, god mode, that kind of stuff
584000	588000	Of course none of that stuff counts if you're playing the actual game
588000	590000	But it's just a little fun little mode to play with
590000	591000	And you can do that in co-op
591000	595000	Then of course there's also new weapons and new vehicles with the paid one
595000	597000	Including a spear gun
597000	599000	You can spear people in the head and stick them to the walls and stuff like that
599000	600000	Which is kind of fun
600000	605000	And then they have like a dune buggy vehicle that you can spin around the air like crazy
605000	607000	Just a bunch of little fun stuff
607000	609000	Plus now they have street racing in the game
609000	613000	Which adds a little bit of, you know, kind of a little extra minigame in there
613000	615000	But overall I think it's pretty awesome
615000	617000	And then of course, you know, fuck
617000	620000	Tomorrow we've got, you know, or I should say Monday
620000	622000	For those people listening on the podcast
622000	625000	The Halo 3, er, no I'm sorry, not Monday, Wednesday
625000	628000	The Halo 3 beta is going to be coming out, so
628000	631000	A bunch of people on my friends list are already playing it
631000	634000	We're just not special, nobody cares
634000	637000	Because, you know, they had those preview events in Frisco and New York
637000	641000	And they were giving out those codes to basically everybody that went to the event
641000	643000	So there's a bunch of people on live already playing it
643000	645000	But, you know, I don't care
645000	647000	I know, I'm like, eh, it's a beta
647000	648000	It's not the real game
648000	651000	And like, you know, the beta's going to have issues
651000	653000	Especially with everybody hitting it at once
653000	657000	I think people are getting a little too excited about the Halo 3 beta
657000	658000	If that makes sense
658000	659000	Like it's not the real game
659000	662000	I don't know, I think Microsoft's pretty ballsy to be doing this to be honest
662000	665000	Uh, they played Super Paper Mario some more
665000	667000	About halfway through the game now
667000	669000	And it's still very easy, I don't know
669000	672000	I've had like no trouble getting through the game at all
672000	673000	And I don't know if it's just
673000	677000	Like even all the secret stuff and the puzzles are just so fucking easy to figure out
677000	678000	I don't know
678000	680000	But it's fun, you know, don't get me wrong
680000	681000	It's a fun game
681000	684000	I just, I would really like them to do a new Mario RPG
684000	688000	Because, you know, even if you kept the same graphic style as this game
688000	690000	It could be so awesome
690000	693000	It's just very disappointing that they're not gonna
693000	694000	Alright
694000	697000	DarkSakura, some comments from chatroom
697000	700000	Toshin asked about Pokemon Pinball
700000	701000	Did you ever play that one?
701000	702000	Did you like that one?
702000	703000	Barely
703000	705000	I was a good one, I liked it
705000	707000	There was two of them if I remember right
707000	709000	There was one for the old games and the one for the advanced games
709000	710000	They did like two
710000	712000	Dude, Epic Pinball
712000	715000	On the PC, yeah, Epic Pinball was pretty awesome
715000	717000	I had another pinball simulator
717000	718000	I can't remember the name of it
718000	721000	Somebody had, I brought it up on a previous episode
721000	722000	Somebody named it
722000	724000	But there were some good PC pinball games too
724000	726000	Epic Pinball, of course, being one
726000	728000	Also looking at chatroom
728000	731000	RawstealUT says Halo 3 Beta
731000	734000	The only reason people bought Crackdown
734000	736000	That might be true, but they got a pretty decent game with it
736000	738000	It's a fucking awesome game
738000	739000	Even I like Crackdown
739000	741000	It's not usually my type of game, but I like it quite a bit
741000	744000	I would have bought it even if it didn't have Halo 3 Beta in there
744000	745000	There you go
745000	747000	To be honest, I don't even know
747000	749000	I mean, I may download it and might play it once
749000	751000	I don't think I'm going to play it much more than that
751000	753000	Because I'm not really a huge Halo fan
753000	755000	And as far as first-person shooters go
755000	758000	It doesn't really make, it doesn't seem like
758000	760000	That big of a difference in Halo 2
760000	762000	It's just like, eh, whatever
762000	765000	I'm going to get fucking murdered by everybody on there anyway
765000	767000	Because I suck at Halo like really bad
767000	770000	I want to know if there's any really really bad Halo players
770000	772000	That are excited about the Halo 3 Beta
772000	777000	Because we need to form a clan and just play with each other and suck together at Halo 3
777000	780000	I'm pretty awful, I've only played Halo 2 like four times
780000	782000	I'll play if you load me up on meclizine
782000	785000	Do you have the Beta? Do you have Crackdown or anything?
785000	786000	Can you get the Beta?
786000	787000	I got Crackdown
787000	788000	Okay, then you can get into the Beta
788000	791000	So we'll play an OLR We Suck night or something
791000	794000	But we only have a few weeks to do it, I think, so
794000	795000	We'll see
795000	797000	You can still, by the way, I was at Best Buy the other day
797000	801000	Randomly, and they still had Crackdown with the Halo 3 Beta in it
801000	803000	So, you can still find copies of it
803000	805000	So, get them soon if you want to get in
806000	809000	Well, this has nothing to do with Halo, but I did have an announcement
809000	810000	Okay
810000	814000	Um, probably in the next four months I'm going to be a published illustrator
814000	816000	Oh, how so?
816000	821000	Um, I'm going to be doing flashcards of bones and muscles if everything works out
821000	822000	Huh
822000	824000	For my flash therapists
824000	825000	That'll be fun
825000	829000	So, are you going to autograph them at different places for our listeners?
829000	831000	No, but I'm going to take deep tissue massage
831000	832000	That's cool
832000	833000	Well, good luck with that
833000	835000	Um, my gaming week
835000	838000	Let's see, I haven't really played video games this week
838000	839000	They're bad for you
839000	840000	I've been trying to avoid video games
840000	842000	Also, I don't eat at Wendy's anymore
842000	845000	Because they support the evil company that is Nintendo
845000	849000	And, you know, this lawyer guy told me that was bad
849000	851000	No, kidding of course
851000	855000	I had, all things considered, I actually had a pretty bad week personally this week
855000	859000	But, Miklotov cheered me up, which was really cool, because he bought me this
859000	861000	This Final Fantasy XII play arts
861000	864000	And this is great radio, by the way, when I go like this in motion
864000	865000	It's something that listeners can't see
865000	869000	But I'm telling you, it's a Balthier figurine from Final Fantasy XII
869000	873000	And Balthier is the sexy, sexy, sexy pirate from Final Fantasy XII
873000	876000	And, like, the best reason to play that game is him and Fran
876000	879000	Because they have the best interactions and steal every scene
879000	880000	So, I love them
880000	882000	And so I was very happy to get this figurine
882000	885000	And it kind of made me go, damn, Final Fantasy XII was one of those games I started
885000	889000	And just didn't finish because all the console launches were going on at that time
889000	891000	I really need to go back now that
891000	892000	I never even started it
892000	894000	I need to play it, it's such an incredible game
894000	896000	I need to finish it
896000	898000	And the characters are so awesome, so there you go
898000	900000	Um, let's see
900000	904000	And, um, also I played World of Warcraft
904000	907000	I got to level 51 because I don't have a life
907000	910000	And, uh, then I played some Xbox Live
910000	912000	I finally tried out Catan this week
912000	915000	And, uh, because somebody had told me it was like Civilization
915000	918000	Lies, lies, lies, lies
918000	920000	Catan, I don't know, Catan didn't really do it for me
920000	923000	I know there's a lot of people that are really into the strategy games
923000	925000	And, you know, really got into Catan
925000	928000	But it just, it just wasn't the kind of game I was looking for on Xbox Live
928000	931000	Um, and I hear it has some real crappy multiplayer
931000	933000	That people are getting disconnected and all that stuff
933000	935000	So, I don't know, I don't know
935000	937000	Try out the demo, see if it's your type of thing
937000	940000	It's way more complicated than Uno, certainly
940000	943000	But, what I do like about the game, what it does have going for it
943000	945000	Is because the game is a little more complicated
945000	947000	You have to really kind of learn it and think
947000	949000	It's a much more, like, thinking type game
949000	952000	Uh, the people that are playing it are pretty intelligent
952000	954000	So if you do play it online, you don't get a lot of the
954000	956000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
956000	958000	type people, you know, the people, that's what they say
958000	960000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
960000	962000	You know, in their headsets on Xbox Live, so that's kind of
962000	964000	Kind of, I guess, something the game has going for it
964000	966000	Otherwise I've been playing a little more Pinball FX
966000	968000	And, uh, Centipede and Millipede
968000	971000	For no good reason, other than I just really like retro games
971000	973000	So I was playing, uh, Centipede and Millipede
973000	975000	Oh, and Double Dragon, I bought Double Dragon
975000	979000	But, I was a little, well, it's not that bad
979000	982000	But the problem is that I really remember the Nintendo one
982000	985000	Much more, and there's big differences between the Nintendo one
985000	987000	And the arcade one
987000	989000	And namely that the arcade one was a lot harder
989000	992000	And some of the, like, the moves aren't quite the same
992000	994000	That they were in the Nintendo one
994000	996000	Like, with the Nintendo one, you, um
996000	998000	Gain these stars as your points went up
998000	1000000	And that allowed you to do more moves
1000000	1002000	Like jump kick and punch people when they're on the ground
1002000	1004000	And stuff, and it doesn't really work the same in the arcade
1004000	1006000	Uh, version
1006000	1008000	But I thought
1008000	1011000	It's the first port I've seen of an old arcade classic
1011000	1013000	That wasn't done by that, what is it?
1013000	1015000	Digital Eclipse, is that what they are?
1015000	1017000	It was done by somebody else
1017000	1019000	And so it was kind of refreshing to see that there's other companies
1019000	1021000	Capable of porting over the old games
1021000	1024000	They did a pretty decent job, the high def graphics are really cleaned up
1024000	1028000	I mean, it looks nice for, you know, an arcade game that's 20 years old
1028000	1031000	So, it was alright, 5 bucks
1031000	1032000	Not bad
1032000	1034000	That's it, that's my gaming week
1034000	1036000	Miklotov, how about your gaming week?
1036000	1040000	Um, I played WoW a couple times
1040000	1044000	I'm level 56, so I have less of a life
1044000	1047000	Um, I also had the sudden interest
1047000	1050000	To start playing Bust A Move 2 again
1050000	1052000	Because I love that game
1052000	1054000	So I've been playing it like non-stop
1054000	1057000	And there's not like anything new I can do in it
1057000	1060000	Because I've already unlocked everybody, beaten it with every character
1060000	1062000	Always get the upper path
1062000	1066000	So, I don't know, it's just a little fun game to play I guess
1066000	1068000	Been slacking on Pokemon
1068000	1072000	Um, other than that
1072000	1074000	I don't think there are any video games I play
1074000	1076000	Hey, keep your cell phone off
1076000	1077000	Sorry, my cell phone went off
1077000	1079000	People forget I do this thing on Sunday night
1079000	1080000	And try to call me
1080000	1082000	Yes, and
1082000	1084000	I don't know, I guess
1084000	1086000	Kind of gaming related
1086000	1090000	I think I'm leaving Konami by the 4th of June
1090000	1092000	Okay
1092000	1094000	So hooray for me
1094000	1097000	Well, I mean, you'll finally be able to talk openly
1097000	1099000	About what you do during the day, that'll be nice
1099000	1101000	Oh, I can talk about it right now
1101000	1103000	I play Bust A Move 2 all day
1103000	1105000	That's pretty much what I do
1105000	1107000	I don't care
1107000	1109000	Alright, well there you go
1109000	1111000	There's no other games you've been working on by chance?
1111000	1113000	Sometimes I play Dance Summit
1113000	1115000	I kind of switch it out between the two
1115000	1117000	Bring that over, because I miss that game
1117000	1119000	Okay, I'll bring it next time, it's at work right now
1119000	1121000	I haven't played that in forever
1121000	1123000	And I've been trying to find a copy of it to buy
1123000	1125000	Good luck with that
1125000	1127000	I fell on eBay for 40 bucks
1127000	1129000	Oh, that's really cheap, that's definitely worth it
1129000	1133000	I'm looking actually right now to find a copy of Bust A Groove 1 US
1133000	1135000	Do you want to borrow mine?
1135000	1137000	No, I want one to own
1137000	1139000	I could probably sell you mine, because I have the Japanese ones
1139000	1141000	Oh really?
1141000	1143000	While you guys barter and trade over there
1143000	1145000	Jvmon says in chat
1145000	1147000	If Bust A Move 2 is on the Playstation 3 network
1147000	1149000	That would sell me a PS3
1149000	1151000	It would sell me one too
1151000	1153000	Or, you know what, if Squeenix decided to
1153000	1155000	Ever revisit that series
1155000	1157000	I don't care if they put a Final Fantasy
1157000	1159000	Character in it to ruin the game
1159000	1161000	I would still buy another one
1161000	1163000	I keep forgetting it was an Enix game
1163000	1165000	You don't think of that
1165000	1167000	You think of Squeenix, you think, oh, roleplaying games, roleplaying games
1167000	1169000	They don't do really anything else
1169000	1171000	I knew of Dragon Warrior, Quest, whatever
1171000	1173000	And I used to frequent the Enix boards
1173000	1175000	And I only hung out at the Bust A Groove section
1175000	1177000	That's all I knew Enix for
1177000	1179000	For the longest time
1179000	1181000	Well, I remember some of their old
1181000	1183000	Super Nintendo roleplaying games
1183000	1185000	Like Illusion of Gaia, Soul Blazer
1185000	1187000	Those were good games
1187000	1189000	An Act Racer was an Enix game, right?
1189000	1191000	I believe so
1191000	1193000	And then Square ruined them
1193000	1195000	SJ100Matt asks, what?
1195000	1197000	No Sweet Coden for you, Miklotov?
1197000	1199000	To play?
1199000	1201000	No, because
1201000	1203000	I guess, you know
1203000	1205000	I still care about the series
1205000	1207000	But after working on it
1207000	1209000	I kind of know everything that happens
1209000	1211000	In the last game
1211000	1213000	And I never even finished playing it
1213000	1215000	So it's like, there's nothing to surprise me
1215000	1217000	Is it kind of one of those things
1217000	1219000	Where like, you know
1219000	1221000	Maybe you're really excited
1221000	1223000	For many years to work at
1223000	1225000	I don't know, like let's say a
1225000	1227000	Taco Bell
1227000	1229000	Nobody's excited to work at Taco Bell
1229000	1231000	What the hell's wrong with you?
1231000	1233000	People are excited to work
1233000	1235000	At Great America, a theme park
1235000	1237000	People are really excited, they want to work at a theme park
1237000	1239000	And then when they get there and realize how everything
1239000	1241000	Really works, how the rides all function
1241000	1243000	And how the magic happens
1243000	1245000	Everything kind of loses its magic
1245000	1247000	Is it kind of like that, where now that you've been on the inside
1247000	1249000	There's no more?
1249000	1251000	No, it wasn't even that
1251000	1253000	It's just office politics go down
1253000	1255000	And then things completely change
1255000	1257000	And that's when it gets bad
1257000	1259000	Drama?
1259000	1261000	Drama, yes
1261000	1263000	Alright
1263000	1265000	Well speaking of drama
1265000	1267000	I want to get into some housekeeping this week
1267000	1269000	And this is a little atypical housekeeping for us
1269000	1271000	But we were asked by our buddies
1271000	1273000	Over at AllGames.com to relay the following announcement
1273000	1275000	Which is cool because
1275000	1277000	They have a live show on Monday nights
1277000	1279000	As well as Tuesday mornings over on AllGames.com
1279000	1281000	If you miss the live show on Sunday
1281000	1283000	You can always hear part A and B together on AllGames
1283000	1285000	And one of their other shows
1285000	1287000	The video game show, they had a little bit of drama
1287000	1289000	A couple weeks ago
1289000	1291000	And to make a long story short
1291000	1293000	A lot of folks think
1293000	1295000	That the show is gone
1295000	1297000	Because of something that someone on the show did
1297000	1299000	To the website and everything
1299000	1301000	And he's since apologized for it
1301000	1303000	I saw the apology and was basically like
1303000	1305000	I suck and I'm sorry
1305000	1307000	But a lot of people still think the show is gone
1307000	1309000	So AllGames is asking us
1309000	1311000	To put forward the video game show
1311000	1313000	They are not gone
1313000	1315000	They are still around
1315000	1317000	And they are now at www.videogameshow.net
1317000	1319000	So we know those of you who listen to Orange on the Radio
1319000	1321000	Probably listen to other independent video game podcasts
1321000	1323000	And we encourage you to do so
1323000	1325000	So if you're a fan of Chris Haas and Rich Bergen
1325000	1327000	They are now over at videogameshow.net
1327000	1329000	Check it out
1329000	1331000	Their show is moved over there
1331000	1333000	Also in housekeeping tonight
1333000	1335000	I wanted to mention real quick
1335000	1337000	Of course our FONOMAY appearance
1337000	1339000	Is going to be happening over Memorial Day weekend in San Jose
1339000	1341000	Saturday at 2pm
1341000	1343000	We hope to see you guys there
1343000	1345000	Speaking of FONOMAY conventions
1345000	1347000	We're going to talk about ACEN a little later tonight
1347000	1349000	Can I just say ACEN and the same thing?
1349000	1351000	What if I don't want to say ACEN?
1351000	1353000	Then no one will know what you're talking about
1353000	1355000	Jerks
1355000	1357000	Regardless, Chris called us
1357000	1359000	And we're going to hear her message a little bit later
1359000	1361000	Thank you to folks who've reviewed us recently
1361000	1363000	In iTunes
1363000	1365000	With 5 star reviews
1365000	1367000	I was looking at some of the more recent reviewers
1367000	1369000	And there's some awesome reviews
1369000	1371000	Some folks actually using some of the gags from our previous weeks
1371000	1373000	Somebody left a review that says
1373000	1375000	OLR the L stands for suck
1375000	1377000	That was pretty awesome
1377000	1379000	We just really want to thank you guys
1379000	1381000	Because we know probably every podcast you listen to
1381000	1383000	Says go vote for us here
1383000	1385000	Go leave us a review on iTunes
1385000	1387000	But it really really really does help
1387000	1389000	When you get more reviews
1389000	1391000	It gets you that exposure
1391000	1393000	When we first started the video game podcasting thing
1393000	1395000	A couple years ago
1395000	1397000	There was like maybe 10 shows at the most
1397000	1399000	So there wasn't much to pick from
1399000	1401000	That's how a lot of folks found us
1401000	1403000	But now there's like 10,000 video game podcasts
1403000	1405000	Out there
1405000	1407000	Because every freaking magazine has their own podcast
1407000	1409000	And every blog has a podcast
1409000	1411000	It's really tough to stand out sometimes
1411000	1413000	So we just kind of keep doing our thing
1413000	1415000	And hope people enjoy what we're doing
1415000	1417000	But we appreciate it when you guys help get the word out
1417000	1419000	So tell a friend
1419000	1421000	Leave us a review on iTunes
1421000	1423000	We do appreciate all of that
1423000	1425000	Alright enough blabber
1425000	1427000	Let's get into the gaming news
1427000	1429000	Who's going to start us off tonight?
1429000	1431000	Yes there's been a lot of news this week
1431000	1433000	Because everyone seems to think it's like E3 all over again
1433000	1435000	Because I mean hey about a year from now
1435000	1437000	Or a year ago we were pretty much at E3
1437000	1439000	I was just thinking of that
1439000	1441000	Bobby Blackwolf speaking of all games
1441000	1443000	Bobby Blackwolf had his birthday
1443000	1445000	I think it was yesterday
1445000	1447000	Happy birthday Bobby by the way
1447000	1449000	And that reminded me that
1449000	1451000	He had his birthday at E3 last year
1451000	1453000	So that was making me go
1453000	1455000	Shit it's been one year since E3
1455000	1457000	And it was kind of sad because E3
1457000	1459000	Sucks now
1459000	1461000	The E3 rave as we've been calling it
1461000	1463000	Because they're going to take you to an abandoned airport hangar
1463000	1465000	And unmarked vehicles will come pick you up
1465000	1467000	And escort you there
1467000	1469000	Don't worry though G4 will be there as their commercials say
1469000	1471000	Whoopee
1471000	1473000	One more reason I don't want to go to E3
1473000	1475000	But I do because
1475000	1477000	All the cool kids go
1477000	1479000	Except for G4
1479000	1481000	Well Jamie
1481000	1483000	Our very own
1483000	1485000	Jamie has an invite
1485000	1487000	And is basically saying
1487000	1489000	You know what I'm not going I'm too cool for this
1489000	1491000	I didn't say I wasn't going I just said I can't afford to go
1491000	1493000	Unless
1495000	1497000	Like the heavens open up and
1497000	1499000	God gives me money
1499000	1501000	We'll see
1501000	1503000	I have to get time off work too
1503000	1505000	I think you're just too cool for E3
1505000	1507000	I know
1507000	1509000	So because of that
1509000	1511000	There's been a whole bunch of announcements this week
1511000	1513000	Including some from Square Enix's
1513000	1515000	Own little party that they had
1515000	1517000	Celebrating the Final Fantasy
1517000	1519000	20th anniversary
1519000	1521000	And with that
1521000	1523000	A bunch of announcements for Final Fantasy games
1523000	1525000	And what not
1525000	1527000	Including a remake of Final Fantasy 4
1527000	1529000	Yes much like there was for the
1529000	1531000	Final Fantasy 3
1531000	1533000	Looks pretty sexy from what I've seen so far
1533000	1535000	Completely redone all 3D
1535000	1537000	Hooray
1537000	1539000	I don't know how I feel about this
1539000	1541000	Final Fantasy 4 is my favorite
1541000	1543000	Final Fantasy game
1543000	1545000	Mostly because it was the first one I ever really got into
1545000	1547000	And beat
1547000	1549000	So you know it's kind of weird to watch
1549000	1551000	That get changed into this whole new
1551000	1553000	3D thing
1553000	1555000	I think it looks good
1555000	1557000	I probably love it but you know
1557000	1559000	It's like somebody is messing with your baby
1559000	1561000	I hope it just doesn't turn out as bad
1561000	1563000	As Final Fantasy 3 did for the DS
1563000	1565000	Because that was no fun
1565000	1567000	You didn't like it? No
1567000	1569000	But did you like the original Nintendo one? Did you ever play it?
1569000	1571000	Like translation or anything?
1571000	1573000	Maybe I think so a little bit
1573000	1575000	The third one was great
1575000	1577000	It's kind of slow
1577000	1579000	I had fun with it
1579000	1581000	It's not slow in the story sense even though it is
1581000	1583000	Everything just seems really slow
1583000	1585000	In that game
1585000	1587000	I don't know it's not that fun
1587000	1589000	Well that's your opinion
1589000	1591000	I think it looks good
1591000	1593000	I think they needed to be doing
1593000	1595000	More of this on the PSP
1595000	1597000	That's for sure because
1597000	1599000	It's kind of lacking
1599000	1601000	But yeah keep it up
1601000	1603000	I want to see Final Fantasy 6 redone
1603000	1605000	As well
1605000	1607000	I'm looking at chat for comments here
1607000	1609000	JVMON agrees with you Miklotov
1609000	1611000	Final Fantasy 3 for the DS was boring as hell
1611000	1613000	I think Final Fantasy 3 DS was good
1613000	1615000	RasteelUT says Final Fantasy 4 DS was uber milkage
1615000	1617000	Let's see
1617000	1619000	SSJ100Matt says
1619000	1621000	I really want them to remake 5
1621000	1623000	Sephiroth1215 says 4
1623000	1625000	What was so great about 4? 5 and 6 are so much better
1625000	1627000	I can't explain the allure of 4
1627000	1629000	Sephiroth1215
1629000	1631000	Other than really the fact that it's the first one
1631000	1633000	I really played
1633000	1635000	I played the original one on NES
1635000	1637000	This is the first one I played all the way through
1637000	1639000	And it really just had a moving story
1639000	1641000	I think Final Fantasy 4 was really the first one
1641000	1643000	For me
1643000	1645000	Since we kind of missed most of the NES ones over here
1645000	1647000	I think it was really the first one for me
1647000	1649000	That had such a moving story
1649000	1651000	And the orchestral
1651000	1653000	The spoonie bard
1653000	1655000	Yeah and it had the spoonie bard
1655000	1657000	And dear god
1657000	1659000	Mark my words
1659000	1661000	If Final Fantasy 4 DS did not keep the spoonie bard lingo intact
1661000	1663000	Instant fail
1663000	1665000	On Square Enix's part
1665000	1667000	I will pick it
1667000	1669000	Screw that up
1669000	1671000	Give me my spoonie bard
1671000	1673000	It looks nice
1673000	1675000	At least it's not just a straight port
1675000	1677000	At least they're doing something with it
1677000	1679000	So
1679000	1681000	That's good
1681000	1683000	I'll give them that
1683000	1685000	I'm actually thinking I'm going to get that one
1685000	1687000	Because it was one of my favorites too
1687000	1689000	But I would prefer 5
1689000	1691000	The reason I liked 3 was because of the job change system
1691000	1693000	Gamezoo time
1693000	1695000	I was going to say if this sells well
1695000	1697000	What happens next right?
1697000	1699000	Let's hope so
1699000	1701000	Well at any rate there's some good news for our UK listeners
1701000	1703000	For anyone who is interested in SNK vs Capcom
1703000	1705000	Card fighters
1705000	1707000	For the DS
1707000	1709000	The little problem that was going on in the 9th level of the game
1709000	1711000	We were having this issue
1711000	1713000	Where if you
1713000	1715000	Fought the opponent
1715000	1717000	John you didn't get the card so you couldn't finish the game
1717000	1719000	That is being
1719000	1721000	Corrected for the UK release
1721000	1723000	And also
1723000	1725000	For our American listeners
1725000	1727000	SNK has offered
1727000	1729000	To replace all of your copies
1729000	1731000	It does though take up to 6 weeks
1731000	1733000	For your replacements to arrive
1733000	1735000	Aw we gotta actually do something
1735000	1737000	Instead of just re-releasing
1737000	1739000	Stuff what the hell
1739000	1741000	Making us work now? Seriously
1741000	1743000	I'm actually a victim
1743000	1745000	Of that
1745000	1747000	Not that I like card games or anything
1747000	1749000	I only bought it because it has Phoenix Wright stuff in it
1749000	1751000	So I'm not actually going to get rid of my copy
1751000	1753000	Because it's only on the new game plus
1753000	1755000	So take that
1755000	1757000	SNK
1757000	1759000	You're not getting my cartridge back
1759000	1761000	To be fair though they do have a new
1761000	1763000	Arcade game that's going to be
1763000	1765000	Coming out
1765000	1767000	Not that we really care
1767000	1769000	What Capcom vs SNK?
1769000	1771000	No SNK has actually got a new
1771000	1773000	King of Fighters
1773000	1775000	Sorry I lost interest in that series a while ago
1775000	1777000	But I liked Capcom vs SNK
1777000	1779000	That was kinda cool
1779000	1781000	A lot of fighting games but I liked Capcom vs SNK
1781000	1783000	My vs Chun-Li awesome
1783000	1785000	Epic
1785000	1787000	Well anyway speaking of epic
1787000	1789000	Loki and I were addicted
1789000	1791000	For many many many many
1791000	1793000	Many years to Final Fantasy 11
1793000	1795000	Actually not that many years
1795000	1797000	Oh yeah Miklata was addicted too
1797000	1799000	And it's your fucking fault
1799000	1801000	I went back like 2
1801000	1803000	How long ago was it? About 6 months ago?
1803000	1805000	That we went back when the 360 version came out?
1805000	1807000	Yeah and we played for like maybe a month
1807000	1809000	You bastard
1809000	1811000	Well Final Fantasy 11 fans
1811000	1813000	Those of you that have stuck with the game
1813000	1815000	You troopers you
1815000	1817000	Good news for you guys there's a brand new add on coming out
1817000	1819000	It's Wings of the Goddess
1819000	1821000	This was announced at
1821000	1823000	Square Enix Party 07
1823000	1825000	And there was a little trailer that went with it
1825000	1827000	I watched the trailer
1827000	1829000	I was not impressed because half of it was recycled footage
1829000	1831000	From all the expansions that are already out
1831000	1833000	Like the original opening movie
1833000	1835000	That's like 5 years old right?
1835000	1837000	And then the rest of it
1837000	1839000	I get was pretty much like
1839000	1841000	Miklata picked this out I didn't even pick this out
1841000	1843000	This looks the exact same as the areas that are already in there
1843000	1845000	Miklata was like oh yeah it's the areas
1845000	1847000	Like before
1847000	1849000	The game takes place because I guess this
1849000	1851000	Wings of the Goddess is some type of like
1851000	1853000	Prequel-ish thing or a time travel thing
1853000	1855000	Where you go back to the past
1855000	1857000	It's basically going back to the actual
1857000	1859000	Was it the war or whatever that they had?
1859000	1861000	The Crystal War
1861000	1863000	You know this is just an
1863000	1865000	Excuse to introduce a time mage class
1865000	1867000	That's what I think
1867000	1869000	Interesting theory. Are you going to go back to the game?
1869000	1871000	When this comes out?
1871000	1873000	Probably for a week
1873000	1875000	Well I went back every other time a new expansion came out
1875000	1877000	I'm not going to stop
1877000	1879000	It's just I won't play it much and then I'll be like
1879000	1881000	I'm too low of a level to do anything in the new area
1881000	1883000	And I just want to go get the new job classes
1883000	1885000	Just hold off
1885000	1887000	They're making a new fucking role playing game anyways
1887000	1889000	Seriously
1889000	1891000	Just as a friendly reminder
1891000	1893000	I'd like to go around and remind everybody
1893000	1895000	Why we quit Final Fantasy 11
1895000	1897000	Because there's probably some fans of the game who listen to the program going
1897000	1899000	You guys are so mean to Final Fantasy 11
1899000	1901000	I play this game
1901000	1903000	Okay we played this game between us all
1903000	1905000	We probably played this game for many many many years
1905000	1907000	Jamie why'd you quit?
1907000	1909000	I played for six months
1909000	1911000	And it was because the white mage is the party bitch
1911000	1913000	And I like playing white mages
1913000	1915000	So fuck everybody in that game
1915000	1917000	Loki why'd you quit?
1917000	1919000	I quit because I had a girlfriend and a wife
1919000	1921000	That became a wife
1921000	1923000	At the same time?
1923000	1925000	That's amazing
1925000	1927000	No that would not be fun
1927000	1929000	So I couldn't play it as often as I'd like to
1929000	1931000	And there was a big six month span
1931000	1933000	Where I didn't actually play at all
1933000	1935000	And it's just paying that kind of money each month
1935000	1937000	Even though it's 13 or 12 bucks
1937000	1939000	It's still money that's being wasted
1939000	1941000	I mean hell
1941000	1943000	If I was still single
1943000	1945000	Not seeing anybody
1945000	1947000	I'd probably still be playing it
1947000	1949000	Because it was fun
1949000	1951000	I had fun with it
1951000	1953000	But it's just you get to a point though
1953000	1955000	You work so hard in the game
1955000	1957000	And then it's just
1957000	1959000	You know you get in stupid parties
1959000	1961000	And the whole fact that you have to party with people
1961000	1963000	Really kind of sucks
1963000	1965000	I know it's an MMO
1965000	1967000	And you're supposed to party with people
1967000	1969000	But the fact that they force you to party
1969000	1971000	When you can't find a party
1971000	1973000	I mean that kind of fucking sucks
1973000	1975000	You go on the play
1975000	1977000	And you can't do anything
1977000	1979000	So that was lame
1981000	1983000	Well the main reason probably
1983000	1985000	Is that whole XP loss
1985000	1987000	When you die
1987000	1989000	But most recently it was because
1989000	1991000	Getting blue mage spells sucked sometimes
1991000	1993000	And me and
1993000	1995000	One of my friends in the game
1995000	1997000	We spent all night
1997000	1999000	Hours and hours trying to get this one spell
1999000	2001000	Never got it
2001000	2003000	So I was like screw this game I'm done
2003000	2005000	And the reason I did it was because
2005000	2007000	Squeenix did nothing about the gold farmers
2007000	2009000	For far too long and the economy in that game
2009000	2011000	Was fucked
2011000	2013000	And people were telling me to actually buy
2013000	2015000	Gill and I was like that's where I draw the line
2015000	2017000	Is spending that type of real world money
2017000	2019000	To buy fake money online
2019000	2021000	Just because you know
2021000	2023000	These people who are being paid
2023000	2025000	To sit here and camp these monsters
2025000	2027000	Are getting stuff before me
2027000	2029000	People were so elitist that if you didn't have these items
2029000	2031000	It's like you suck in parties
2031000	2033000	Even I had my elitist
2033000	2035000	Plus one everything
2035000	2037000	Fucking bard character
2037000	2039000	And I got nothing
2039000	2041000	No parties out of that
2041000	2043000	Alright so there you go
2043000	2045000	Plus everything charisma and all that stuff
2045000	2047000	What?
2047000	2049000	I was just going to say it's like
2049000	2051000	They want you to party in that game
2051000	2053000	But people have in their minds
2053000	2055000	The ideal party setup and if you don't fit that
2055000	2057000	Your job or anything then what's the point
2057000	2059000	Because you're not going to get a party
2059000	2061000	At least back when I played
2061000	2063000	And you know your job is worthless then
2063000	2065000	Heaven help you if you're a paladin who doesn't sub warrior
2065000	2067000	Yeah you have to have the right sub jobs too
2067000	2069000	So boo on you
2069000	2071000	Final Fantasy 11 boo
2071000	2073000	Let's see looking at the
2073000	2075000	Comments in the chat room here
2075000	2077000	RawsteelUT says healers are the party bitch
2077000	2079000	In every MMO
2079000	2081000	Let's see
2081000	2083000	Sephiroth1215 says I never liked Final Fantasy 11
2083000	2085000	But it does get addicting
2085000	2087000	Somehow when I stopped myself before I was an addict
2087000	2089000	ShadowFitSlayer says
2089000	2091000	Tetra Master is greater than Final Fantasy 11
2091000	2093000	Boo
2093000	2095000	Tetra Master was kind of fun
2095000	2097000	No it wasn't
2097000	2099000	I played my free month of Tetra Master
2099000	2101000	I had fun
2101000	2103000	It was fun for about 5 minutes
2103000	2105000	That's a very good idea actually Loki
2105000	2107000	Loki says put that on Xbox Live Arcade
2107000	2109000	Yes and no one will play it
2109000	2111000	Shut up I play it once
2111000	2113000	New story please
2113000	2115000	Anyways
2115000	2117000	I don't have time for me to read but
2117000	2119000	Parasite Eve 3 is apparently going to be
2119000	2121000	a cell phone title
2121000	2123000	You know obviously in Japan
2123000	2125000	where cell phone titles are more popular
2125000	2127000	You know it's not a big surprise
2127000	2129000	But over here though
2129000	2131000	I would hope that maybe a next gen version
2131000	2133000	of Parasite Eve because I like that series
2133000	2135000	I thought it was pretty good
2135000	2137000	Although then again I never did play the second one
2137000	2139000	But this was announced over at the Square Enix party
2139000	2141000	I don't know
2141000	2143000	Kind of disappointing
2143000	2145000	Hopefully you know
2145000	2147000	You know what they kind of tend to do with these kind of things
2147000	2149000	They'll port it over to the PSP or something
2149000	2151000	Later on
2151000	2153000	Here's hoping for a PSP version
2153000	2155000	PSP version would be hot though
2155000	2159000	RosteelUT who I'm quoting a lot tonight
2159000	2161000	But he's saying a lot of stuff here
2161000	2163000	I'm not going to tell him to shut up
2163000	2165000	He's saying a lot of good stuff here
2165000	2167000	Heartbreaks as he hears
2167000	2169000	PE3 is a cell phone title
2169000	2171000	I'm sure that's how most people feel
2171000	2173000	About that news
2173000	2175000	Because everybody was kind of waiting for
2175000	2177000	Parasite Eve 3 on Playstation 2
2177000	2179000	And then it just never happened
2179000	2181000	Well at least you know
2181000	2183000	Maybe they translate the book for us
2183000	2185000	Some of us who wants to read it can
2185000	2187000	I saw the Japanese movie and that was awesome
2187000	2189000	I've got it somewhere but my friends read the book
2189000	2191000	Like five times and keep telling me how awesome the book is
2191000	2193000	Ew, reading
2193000	2195000	Shut up
2195000	2197000	I like the book so I get the good story
2197000	2199000	Anyway
2199000	2201000	Well there is actually a bit of happiness
2201000	2203000	That came out of the Tokyo Game Show
2203000	2205000	And that was an announcement for
2205000	2207000	Kingdom Hearts
2207000	2209000	Well it's going to happen at the Tokyo Game Show
2209000	2211000	Still a few months off
2211000	2213000	Well that's what I said isn't it
2213000	2215000	No you said some announcement
2215000	2217000	It's coming out of the
2217000	2219000	Ok whatever
2219000	2221000	Pardon my context
2221000	2223000	Anyway it's going to be announced
2223000	2225000	At the Tokyo Game Show
2225000	2227000	So
2227000	2229000	I'm just sick of announcements of announcements
2229000	2231000	We have an announcement to make
2231000	2233000	We're going to make an announcement later
2233000	2235000	I completely refrain from here on out
2235000	2237000	To make announcements of announcements
2237000	2239000	You know what
2239000	2241000	It is an amazing trend within this industry
2241000	2243000	Is that hey stay tuned
2243000	2245000	For a really big announcement about
2245000	2247000	Something we're going to be announcing very soon
2247000	2249000	It's like
2249000	2251000	Shut up and make a game
2251000	2253000	Shut up and go make the game
2253000	2255000	Anyhow
2255000	2257000	Any hopes for what they're going to be announcing
2257000	2259000	Dark Sakura
2259000	2261000	Kingdom Hearts 3 maybe
2261000	2263000	Or do you think it's going to be like
2263000	2265000	Kingdom Hearts MMO
2265000	2267000	There's not going to be any way they can do a
2267000	2269000	Kingdom Hearts MMO
2269000	2271000	Kingdom Hearts minus Disney
2271000	2273000	Then it won't be good
2273000	2275000	Let's see
2275000	2277000	Hostile1 in chat says
2277000	2279000	Please please please
2279000	2281000	Kingdom Hearts for 360
2281000	2283000	Save me the $600 for the Playstation 3
2283000	2285000	Except it's minus Disney and with
2285000	2287000	Hanna-Barbera instead
2287000	2289000	Yabba Dabba Doo
2291000	2293000	That'd be so horrible
2293000	2295000	Oh hooray I have Quick Draw McGraw in my party
2295000	2297000	And Droopy Dog
2299000	2301000	Oh but
2301000	2303000	Wow
2303000	2305000	Hey but Jetsons world would be pretty awesome
2305000	2307000	What do you think of that Jamie
2307000	2309000	Kingdom Hearts with minus the Disney plus
2309000	2311000	The Hanna-Barbera
2311000	2313000	They should do
2313000	2315000	Plus Warner Brothers
2315000	2317000	So we get the Animaniacs
2317000	2319000	Was that Johnny Quest 2?
2319000	2321000	Yeah that was Hanna-Barbera
2321000	2323000	Was it?
2323000	2325000	But then again that would also give us C-Lab
2325000	2327000	It could be worse they could do Kingdom Hearts 3 with
2327000	2329000	Adult Swim
2329000	2331000	I guess that's true
2331000	2333000	Kingdom Hearts with Robot Chicken
2333000	2335000	Let's talk about some games we know are coming out
2335000	2337000	We're going to do some release dates real quick here
2337000	2339000	I'm going to start off with Japanese
2339000	2341000	release dates and again it's been kind of
2341000	2343000	a slow month over there in Japan
2343000	2345000	There's not a whole lot of stuff coming out
2345000	2347000	But on the Nintendo Wii they are getting Marvel
2347000	2349000	Ultimate Alliance in Japan
2349000	2351000	So the Japanese version coming out from
2351000	2353000	Inter Channel
2353000	2355000	Also they're getting a game on the 17th of May called
2355000	2357000	Detective Conan
2357000	2359000	Suyoku no Gensu
2359000	2361000	You're yaying that I don't even know what the hell that is
2361000	2363000	Give me the top microphone
2363000	2365000	There is this show
2365000	2367000	on Adult Swim a long time ago
2367000	2369000	Case closed
2369000	2371000	It's just like this little kid who solves
2371000	2373000	Detective Conan
2373000	2375000	Here it was case closed
2375000	2377000	He just solves
2377000	2379000	crimes and stuff and if you like detective
2379000	2381000	things it's really cool
2381000	2383000	I like detective things so it's pretty awesome
2383000	2385000	I want that to come out here even though I'm not a fan
2385000	2387000	of anime whatsoever
2387000	2389000	On the Playstation 2
2389000	2391000	you get Shining Wind from Sega
2391000	2393000	on the 17th as well as Odin Sphere
2393000	2395000	coming out over there
2395000	2397000	I think that's about it
2397000	2399000	Let me see if there's anything on the DS real quick
2399000	2401000	You do get
2401000	2403000	Custom Beat Battle
2403000	2405000	Draglade is coming out
2405000	2407000	Oh and then of course Oh and Dan 2
2407000	2409000	I suppose that's important is also coming out this week
2409000	2411000	in Japan
2411000	2413000	Elite Beat Agents some of you know that here
2413000	2415000	You pre-ordered that didn't you Shane?
2415000	2417000	You pre-ordered it and you got
2417000	2419000	next day shipping or something right?
2419000	2421000	My shipping costs about the same as the game
2421000	2423000	because I care that much
2423000	2425000	to have it that early
2425000	2427000	I've watched that stupid demo that they put up on
2427000	2429000	YouTube from the download kiosks
2429000	2431000	in Japan a million times
2431000	2433000	and I watched the TouchDS
2433000	2435000	.JP videos a million times
2435000	2437000	I'm so excited
2437000	2439000	I don't know any of the songs except for one
2439000	2441000	So you spent like $80 on this game?
2441000	2443000	I would say closer to $90
2443000	2445000	Wow
2445000	2447000	I do want to say actually
2447000	2449000	one other game because I actually went and looked at the
2449000	2451000	PC and Macintosh releases
2451000	2453000	coming out and Korea
2453000	2455000	you know we don't talk a whole lot about what goes on
2455000	2457000	in Korea but they are getting a game
2457000	2459000	that's worth mentioning here this is my favorite title
2459000	2461000	of the week an adventure game for the PC called
2461000	2463000	Princess Maker 5
2463000	2465000	Princess Maker 5 coming out
2465000	2467000	in Korea looks like fun
2467000	2469000	in this game you get to it looks like make
2469000	2471000	princesses go figure
2471000	2473000	see there's all their little stats
2473000	2475000	in Korean which I don't understand
2475000	2477000	any of yeah it looks cute
2477000	2479000	looks all like chibi
2479000	2481000	looks like fun I want to play Princess Maker
2481000	2483000	they do make good MMOs
2483000	2485000	I can't knock the Korean developers
2485000	2487000	there you go
2487000	2489000	okay dancing games
2489000	2491000	well didn't Korea
2491000	2493000	wasn't the easy to
2493000	2495000	DJ series out of
2495000	2497000	Korea? yeah it was all Korea
2497000	2499000	okay well then they fucking rock music games too
2499000	2501000	anyways the US
2501000	2503000	it's not entirely exciting but there are
2503000	2505000	some things coming out
2505000	2507000	of the non-exciting
2507000	2509000	like the third is finally making its way out
2509000	2511000	same day as the movie
2511000	2513000	hurrah
2513000	2515000	but if you're not into really crappy games
2515000	2517000	then you might be interested in Dawn of Mana
2517000	2519000	which is going to be coming out this week on Playstation 2
2519000	2521000	that one looks pretty good
2521000	2523000	that's happy
2523000	2525000	also if you're interested in SNK
2525000	2527000	re-releases Art of Fighting
2527000	2529000	Anthology will be making its way out
2529000	2531000	on the PS2 luckily though
2531000	2533000	it's only $14.99
2533000	2535000	so it's a chibi
2535000	2537000	it's a mana game on Playstation 1
2537000	2539000	Secret of Mana?
2539000	2541000	Legend of Mana is one of the most disappointing
2541000	2543000	games I've ever played in my entire fucking life
2543000	2545000	try playing it in Japanese
2545000	2547000	oh that's just salt in the wound
2547000	2549000	right there cause that game
2549000	2551000	I'm sorry it sucked
2551000	2553000	it wasn't, if they would go back
2553000	2555000	okay what you should do
2555000	2557000	get an emulator and play the translation
2557000	2559000	of Seiken Densetsu 3
2559000	2561000	it's fucking beautiful
2561000	2563000	we need to have a game be like that
2563000	2565000	virtual console, hello maybe someday
2565000	2567000	but yeah I'm just saying that cause
2567000	2569000	Dawn of Mana, I don't know
2569000	2571000	approach with caution
2571000	2573000	if you haven't bought Marvel Ultimate Alliance yet
2573000	2575000	on the 360
2575000	2577000	and you're thinking about doing it
2577000	2579000	you definitely want to pick up Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold
2579000	2581000	which is coming out this week as well
2581000	2583000	it's basically the same game
2583000	2585000	with the download codes for the extra characters
2585000	2587000	so that's pretty awesome
2587000	2589000	Innocent Life
2589000	2591000	a futuristic harvest moon
2591000	2593000	PSP this week
2593000	2595000	don't let that fool you it's exactly the same damn game
2595000	2597000	all over again
2597000	2599000	and let's see here
2599000	2601000	Etrion Odyssey
2601000	2603000	some RPG game coming out on
2603000	2605000	the DS and then
2605000	2607000	of course if you're a baseball fan
2607000	2609000	MLB 07 the show on Playstation 3
2609000	2611000	and then finally the rounded up
2611000	2613000	really strange game Touch the Dead
2613000	2615000	and that's coming out on the DS
2615000	2617000	think House of the Dead on the DS
2617000	2619000	I want to touch the dead
2619000	2621000	that sounds kind of kinky
2621000	2623000	and of course
2623000	2625000	last few things here
2625000	2627000	I was going to say on PC
2627000	2629000	is there anything interesting coming out
2629000	2631000	Resident Evil 4 is coming out on PC I guess
2631000	2633000	or doing a re-release of that
2633000	2635000	Nanny Mania
2635000	2637000	Nanny Mania?
2637000	2639000	Nanny Mania
2639000	2641000	is that like Diner Dash but with babies?
2641000	2643000	I don't know but
2643000	2645000	Nanny Mania
2645000	2647000	you know what that has me thinking of
2647000	2649000	mama mama mama mama mama
2649000	2651000	I love that stage
2651000	2653000	it makes me think of Super Nanny
2653000	2655000	on TV or Nanny
2655000	2657000	911 whatever those shows are
2657000	2659000	and then I was going to say
2659000	2661000	Naruto Ninja Council 3

2669000	2671000	with Loki here why does Loki hate
2671000	2673000	sequels?
2673000	2675000	and why is he not hating on MLB
2675000	2677000	Super 7 which is a giant rehash itself
2677000	2679000	I didn't say I didn't hate it

2699000	2701000	there wasn't any sequels I hated on
2701000	2703000	except for oh Art of Fighting Anthology
2703000	2705000	because that's not a sequel it's just a re-release
2705000	2707000	the Rob D admits I'm mostly stirring up trouble

2741000	2743000	alright well let's get back into
2743000	2745000	some news talking about upcoming
2745000	2747000	releases Rock Band
2747000	2749000	is rumored to be coming out on the Wii
2749000	2751000	lots and lots of rumors going
2751000	2753000	around about this this week
2753000	2755000	apparently it's because
2755000	2757000	there's focus group testing going
2757000	2759000	on they've been testing with focus group
2759000	2761000	MTV's been asking about
2761000	2763000	packaging and pricing like how much would you pay
2763000	2765000	and then the Wii was also
2765000	2767000	one of the systems that they
2767000	2769000	said the game would be coming on of course Rock Band
2769000	2771000	coming from Harmonics who made
2771000	2773000	Guitar Hero but this is a joint
2773000	2775000	venture between Harmonics, EA and
2775000	2777000	MTV well of course MTV
2777000	2779000	owns Harmonics so you gotta state that
2779000	2781000	but that's of course going to be the game that has not
2781000	2783000	just the guitar but the drums and the singing
2783000	2785000	all in one so that should be very interesting
2785000	2787000	by the way during this
2787000	2789000	focus group the group was asked
2789000	2791000	what they would think about a bundle including
2791000	2793000	the game, a wireless guitar, a drum kit
2793000	2795000	and a microphone for
2795000	2797000	$200 didn't
2797000	2799000	go over well with the group
2799000	2801000	$175 went over a little
2801000	2803000	better $150 was when everybody
2803000	2805000	in the group got on board but that would be
2805000	2807000	pushing it for all it's stuff
2807000	2809000	it's supposed to be an actual drum set
2809000	2811000	can you imagine how big this box
2811000	2813000	is gonna be?
2813000	2815000	where the fuck am I gonna put that in my shit hole apartment?
2815000	2817000	I mean I'm just
2817000	2819000	what college dorm is
2819000	2821000	gonna fit that?
2821000	2823000	it's a cool concept for a game but you know
2823000	2825000	this is why they didn't have any arcade style
2825000	2827000	you know drum mania controllers
2827000	2829000	or anything you know they left it at
2829000	2831000	Guitar Freaks
2831000	2833000	said okay those controllers are big enough
2833000	2835000	we don't need to bring the huge fucking drum set
2835000	2837000	do you remember when we were younger
2837000	2839000	like in junior high or whatever
2839000	2841000	they had those drum sticks
2841000	2843000	that you could just hit anywhere in the air
2843000	2845000	they had a little speaker I think they were called
2845000	2847000	like hit sticks or something and you could play the drums
2847000	2849000	and the little crappy speaker that was attached
2849000	2851000	to them would go
2851000	2853000	like you could just wave the drums in the air
2853000	2855000	there was like $10 that could be the controller
2855000	2857000	you remember back in the day when I had the actual
2857000	2859000	cabinet and everything and I was talking
2859000	2861000	about how I was gonna make actual drums
2861000	2863000	you know a drum set for guitar
2863000	2865000	or Guitar Freaks drum mania
2865000	2867000	yeah I'm glad I didn't do that
2867000	2869000	for real Blaze says
2869000	2871000	those still exist I'll be damned
2871000	2873000	DJ Dark Knight says I had one
2873000	2875000	I think a lot of us had one
2875000	2877000	those things are pretty rad
2877000	2879000	did you have one of those Mikl Tov I see you nodding your head over there
2879000	2881000	my cousins didn't
2881000	2883000	I wasn't allowed to play with them because I was really little
2883000	2885000	but yeah
2885000	2887000	they were really awesome looking at the time
2887000	2889000	and kind of stupid though now that I think about it
2889000	2891000	they were pretty stupid in retrospect
2891000	2893000	but I'm thinking those were cheap
2893000	2895000	and they didn't take up any space at all
2895000	2897000	it's pretty awesome
2897000	2899000	I don't know I think this is getting a little crazy
2899000	2901000	with your obsession with music games
2901000	2903000	I mean the thing with Guitar
2903000	2905000	Hero I mean
2905000	2907000	$80 I almost said Guitar Freaks
2907000	2909000	$80 is a really
2909000	2911000	big investment I think for a game
2911000	2913000	and a $200
2913000	2915000	investment in a game you better hope this game
2915000	2917000	is fucking awesome because otherwise
2917000	2919000	you're gonna be fucking pissed
2919000	2921000	so I mean besides
2921000	2923000	if you wanna buy you know Rock Band
2923000	2925000	boy do we have a game for you the Eye of Judgment
2925000	2927000	it too will have a lot of
2927000	2929000	extra crap and it'll probably be expensive
2929000	2931000	great
2931000	2933000	anyways another game though
2933000	2935000	that's scheduled to be coming or rumored to be coming
2935000	2937000	out on another system would be
2937000	2939000	Table Tennis for the Wii Rockstar's Table Tennis
2939000	2941000	that is of course it's gonna be
2941000	2943000	scaled down graphically but hey
2943000	2945000	it's Table Tennis on the Wii
2945000	2947000	because everybody likes Wii Tennis so
2947000	2949000	of course this is gonna do well
2949000	2951000	right
2951000	2953000	how would that work because I seem to remember
2953000	2955000	I mean the gameplay mechanics would have to be
2955000	2957000	completely different if I'm not
2957000	2959000	mistaking well maybe not
2959000	2961000	because I seem to remember I haven't played Table Tennis
2961000	2963000	in a while but I seem to remember like you had to
2963000	2965000	look very carefully at the ball
2965000	2967000	to see what color it was glowing
2967000	2969000	cause that was showing you the type of spin that was on
2969000	2971000	the ball and that was very important for
2971000	2973000	how you could respond to that
2973000	2975000	better you know defeat your opponent
2975000	2977000	was to you know counter with the appropriate
2977000	2979000	type of spin how would you do that with the
2979000	2981000	Wiimote would you just have to use the 1 and 2 buttons or
2981000	2983000	the D-pad or something I don't know
2983000	2985000	here's what I've been thinking
2987000	2989000	people think because
2989000	2991000	people liked Wii Sports cause it was a
2991000	2993000	packing title and everybody loves the games that came
2993000	2995000	with it and stuff that
2995000	2997000	people would want to buy a game that does
2997000	2999000	exactly the same thing for more money
2999000	3001000	that's why I didn't understand I mean
3001000	3003000	Tennis itself yeah it was fun
3003000	3005000	you know bringing it out and people
3005000	3007000	come over and stuff like that I wouldn't buy a
3007000	3009000	Tennis game though just because I like playing
3009000	3011000	Wii Tennis but like fuck that shit I've got
3011000	3013000	a free game right here why would I buy another game
3015000	3017000	I'm reading chat room and there's some
3017000	3019000	comments on the previous story about Rock Band
3019000	3021000	GS68 wrote in all
3021000	3023000	caps Drummania is a blatant
3023000	3025000	rip off of Rock Band with crappy
3025000	3027000	Jap Techno and timing judgments and
3027000	3029000	cheats aka speed mods
3029000	3031000	you know and that's exactly how
3031000	3033000	X-Play will probably review it if the
3033000	3035000	game comes out next year from Konami for whatever
3035000	3037000	crazy reason
3037000	3039000	although they'll say that it came out they'll acknowledge
3039000	3041000	the fact that it came out but they'll say that
3041000	3043000	it's improved on it because this actually
3043000	3045000	teaches you how to play drums
3045000	3047000	to be honest though out of all the Bomani
3047000	3049000	series I think that's the only one that taught you how to do
3049000	3051000	something you know
3051000	3053000	it was pretty much closest to
3053000	3055000	Keyboardmania you could actually take
3055000	3057000	the real version in Keyboardmania
3057000	3059000	play them on a real keyboard and it would sound very similar
3059000	3061000	very similar
3061000	3063000	unless you played them easy like I did
3063000	3065000	well then you'd get something that sounded
3065000	3067000	kind of close
3067000	3069000	well I mean still though those games
3069000	3071000	it was pretty good it's like I saw you know for example
3071000	3073000	Lankystyle you know I saw him
3073000	3075000	start off on you know that I don't know if he was a drummer
3075000	3077000	beforehand but you know he got
3077000	3079000	pretty good by the end I mean and I've seen people
3079000	3081000	that just start playing Drummania and then you know you see
3081000	3083000	them about a year later they're just
3083000	3085000	busting out like a real drummer so I don't know
3085000	3087000	it does well and I've learned this
3087000	3089000	as a musician that half of playing
3089000	3091000	is you know the more you do it
3091000	3093000	it comes to a point where
3093000	3095000	you're you build the instinct
3095000	3097000	for it your hands will know what to do
3097000	3099000	you know that's what got me through
3099000	3101000	through band is that after a while
3101000	3103000	you train yourself to know how to do these
3103000	3105000	things so you know it's the same thing
3105000	3107000	JVMON has another interesting point in chat
3107000	3109000	ParaparaParadise taught Parapara
3109000	3111000	dancing sorta
3111000	3113000	but I remember when that game first
3113000	3115000	came out and people over here didn't know that it was
3115000	3117000	based off like the Japanese thing like people
3117000	3119000	used to rave on that like remember that one guy who used to do
3119000	3121000	all his like crazy rave dancing
3121000	3123000	that was funny
3123000	3125000	I'm gonna hang my head down now
3125000	3127000	did you do that too?
3127000	3129000	yes with your glow sticks
3129000	3131000	no
3131000	3133000	but I remember we'd get everybody
3133000	3135000	shadowing and that was great
3135000	3137000	especially when we ate the sign that said no shadowing
3137000	3139000	I wondered if it did that
3139000	3141000	that's right Golfland dared
3141000	3143000	to put a sign on the machine that said no
3143000	3145000	shadowing and we got a picture
3145000	3147000	of somebody eating it Rick ate it
3147000	3149000	we got a guy we said
3149000	3151000	this rule sucks and we
3151000	3153000	dared Rick to eat the sign so he did
3153000	3155000	he tore the sign off the machine and I'm not
3155000	3157000	kidding he fucking ate it
3157000	3159000	good times
3159000	3161000	and then we all shadowed
3161000	3163000	in defiance of Golfland's
3163000	3165000	neo-nazi policies
3165000	3167000	in Rick's defense I mean this is
3167000	3169000	the guy that didn't have like the challenges that they would
3169000	3171000	do where they would like either
3171000	3173000	I don't remember if they sniffed a whole bunch of
3173000	3175000	cinnamon or ate a whole bunch of cinnamon
3175000	3177000	some weird shit like that drinking a gallon
3177000	3179000	of milk you know that kind of weird crazy
3179000	3181000	shit so
3181000	3183000	GS68
3183000	3185000	has a great idea for a macro
3185000	3187000	if I could find that picture I know there's a
3187000	3189000	picture that exists with Rick with half
3189000	3191000	a sign in his mouth
3191000	3193000	I made you a sign but I eat it
3195000	3197000	cat macro that's beautiful
3197000	3199000	winner GS68
3199000	3201000	chatter of the evening congratulations
3201000	3203000	yeah you win a no prize
3203000	3205000	so I've got some fun news
3205000	3207000	you know one of my favorite games ever
3207000	3209000	is Soul Calibur right and I've told you
3209000	3211000	about Rod Calibur haven't I
3211000	3213000	using the fishing thing when you play it on Dreamcast
3213000	3215000	use the fishing rod to play Soul Calibur it's
3215000	3217000	hilarious I've also tried doing it with the
3217000	3219000	Dreamcast dance pads and the only
3219000	3221000	analog on there is the Konami symbol
3221000	3223000	but Rod Calibur
3223000	3225000	is the most fun I always thought Rod Calibur
3225000	3227000	was a different game I played with my Rod
3227000	3229000	you know what Rod let me finish the story
3229000	3231000	okay well now
3231000	3233000	and I think
3233000	3235000	that this is beautiful because
3235000	3237000	in my brain it's an homage to Rod
3237000	3239000	Calibur is Soul Calibur
3239000	3241000	Legends is coming out on the Wii
3241000	3243000	and
3243000	3245000	it's going to be using the
3245000	3247000	Nunchuck and the
3247000	3249000	Wiimote so I'm just seeing
3249000	3251000	Rod Calibur all over again
3251000	3253000	but you know what's fucking awesome about the game though
3253000	3255000	it's kind of like a beat
3255000	3257000	em up game except hopefully it's not
3257000	3259000	going to be like was that that
3259000	3261000	Tekken game with
3261000	3263000	what's-her-name Death by the Greaves
3263000	3265000	yeah hope it's not like that
3265000	3267000	maybe it's like the Tekken force mode from
3267000	3269000	Tekken 3 so Jamie to sum up
3269000	3271000	I will soon be able to play Rod
3271000	3273000	Calibur with my Wii yes
3273000	3275000	Rod Calibur with your Wii
3275000	3277000	fabulous right and
3277000	3279000	if anybody still has a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur
3279000	3281000	just you should try Rod Calibur if you never
3281000	3283000	have
3283000	3285000	alright well you know
3285000	3287000	I just want to mention real quick sure
3287000	3289000	there will be some fishing games coming out in
3289000	3291000	the fall for the Wii that actually have
3291000	3293000	a fishing rod controller therefore
3293000	3295000	Rod Calibur
3295000	3297000	for a whole other generation
3299000	3301000	well one person that won't be
3301000	3303000	playing Soul Calibur on the Wii
3303000	3305000	anytime soon or any derivative of the
3305000	3307000	game is this guy who emailed
3307000	3309000	Kotaku earlier this week and
3309000	3311000	this was a story here I'm just going to quote this story
3311000	3313000	from a Kotaku article here
3313000	3315000	buying a Wii was a big deal for me
3315000	3317000	seeing those 250 hard-earned dollars
3317000	3319000	and some change go flying from her hand
3319000	3321000	and into the water was painful
3321000	3323000	we would probably be together right now
3323000	3325000	if she had not thrown out my beloved Wii
3325000	3327000	but alas you can't talk a crazy woman
3327000	3329000	out of an idea of such magnitude
3329000	3331000	yes this guy's wife took
3331000	3333000	the Wii and threw it into a lake
3333000	3335000	during a heated argument
3335000	3337000	anyway and he goes on to say anyways
3337000	3339000	divorce is imminent I'm talking
3339000	3341000	to a lawyer tomorrow to get the process
3341000	3343000	started I'm not divorcing her just
3343000	3345000	because of the Wii throwing but that's the rather
3345000	3347000	large straw that broke
3347000	3349000	the Drome Dairy's back
3349000	3351000	I would have thrown
3351000	3353000	her right after that
3353000	3355000	throw her in the river
3355000	3357000	go get my Wii
3357000	3359000	what would you do if Nelly threw your Wii into the lake
3359000	3361000	I'd be pissed
3361000	3363000	would you file papers
3363000	3365000	I'd buy another one
3365000	3367000	buy another one? buy two? just piss her off
3367000	3369000	maybe
3369000	3371000	spend savings
3371000	3373000	there you go
3373000	3375000	GS68 says too bad the woman's going to win 100%
3375000	3377000	Craven's Dolphin says I'm with Loki
3379000	3381000	alright well there you have it
3381000	3383000	anyways
3383000	3385000	I don't know this
3385000	3387000	sounds pretty cool
3387000	3389000	last game that came out I know like this
3389000	3391000	the Rygar game
3391000	3393000	on Playstation 2 was pretty awesome
3393000	3395000	now they're doing Project Rygar for the Wii
3395000	3397000	and of course it's going to be
3397000	3399000	a brand new game exclusively
3399000	3401000	for the Wii and
3401000	3403000	no real details about that
3403000	3405000	except it's supposed to have
3405000	3407000	new characters, new enemies, new weapons, yada yada yada
3407000	3409000	but
3409000	3411000	one of the announcements from
3411000	3413000	Tecmo's party
3413000	3415000	that they did because everyone was having their
3415000	3417000	gamer's day or Tecmo's
3417000	3419000	night out 07
3419000	3421000	I don't know they have a pretty cool piece of
3421000	3423000	artwork that's the only bit of info
3423000	3425000	from the game so far
3425000	3427000	looks pretty guilty gear-ish actually
3427000	3429000	interesting
3429000	3431000	you know I never played the
3431000	3433000	Rygar game on Playstation 2 I somehow missed it
3433000	3435000	but I did enjoy the old NES one
3435000	3437000	that's like one of my favorite 8-bit games ever
3437000	3439000	even if it was really different from the arcade
3439000	3441000	well know what?
3441000	3443000	then probably when this game gets closer to coming out
3443000	3445000	Virtual Console
3445000	3447000	yeah that's pretty exciting
3447000	3449000	if I remember right the 8-bit one had no save feature
3449000	3451000	or password or anything
3451000	3453000	so you had to play it all in one sitting which sucked
3453000	3455000	but now with the Virtual Console
3455000	3457000	not a problem anymore
3457000	3459000	very exciting I hope that does come out
3459000	3461000	pretty cool
3461000	3463000	well speaking of Virtual Console
3463000	3465000	I do have the list for our UK listeners
3465000	3467000	and
3467000	3469000	that is released so far
3469000	3471000	Ninja Spirit
3471000	3473000	which was a TurboGrafx game
3473000	3475000	and also
3475000	3477000	NES Open Tournament Golf
3479000	3481000	I think that's it
3481000	3483000	wow sucks to be in the UK
3483000	3485000	because neither of those games really are that good to me
3485000	3487000	Ninja Spirit was a good game
3487000	3489000	I vaguely remember it
3489000	3491000	I think I played it once
3491000	3493000	Golf was more like crap
3493000	3495000	didn't it come out kind of in response to
3495000	3497000	Ninja Gaiden
3497000	3499000	which did really well on the NES
3499000	3501000	that's how a lot of TurboGrafx games were
3501000	3503000	where's Shadow Dancer?
3503000	3505000	it could have been Shadow Dancer because Shadow Dancer had the dog
3505000	3507000	I know but where's Shadow Dancer?
3507000	3509000	I know!
3509000	3511000	or Moonwalker I mean come on
3511000	3513000	it's so bad I mean it's such a bad movie
3513000	3515000	well it was a bad movie and a bad game
3515000	3517000	but the bar scene
3517000	3519000	the bar level in Moonwalker was pretty fun
3519000	3521000	because you do the leaning thing in advance
3521000	3523000	and all that was cool
3523000	3525000	D.Vay has a Mother's Day message in chat here
3525000	3527000	my mom rocked at Ninja Spirit
3527000	3529000	for some reason
3529000	3531000	don't know why I bought it
3531000	3533000	my mom never really played video games at all
3533000	3535000	I couldn't get her to play anything
3535000	3537000	so I don't know that whole experience
3537000	3539000	of walking in and your mom or your dad
3539000	3541000	is playing a video game of yours
3541000	3543000	Mom what are you doing?
3543000	3545000	oh I'm just beating the level 3 boss
3547000	3549000	anyhow
3549000	3551000	now one game that came out on the Virtual Console
3551000	3553000	not that long ago that was pretty exciting
3553000	3555000	was Tecmo Bowl
3555000	3557000	even if they did make some changes to it
3557000	3559000	to remove players names and stuff
3559000	3561000	but people were excited to see Tecmo Bowl make a return
3561000	3563000	and hey
3563000	3565000	that return might be forthcoming
3565000	3567000	like even bigger
3567000	3569000	because Tecmo has announced
3569000	3571000	that they have plans to revive
3571000	3573000	the Tecmo Bowl franchise
3573000	3575000	in 2008
3575000	3577000	Tecmo will be joining up with Visual Concepts
3577000	3579000	to make a new version of Tecmo Bowl
3579000	3581000	now note there is no NFL licenses
3581000	3583000	going on here but who cares
3583000	3585000	Tecmo Bowl was just fun
3585000	3587000	and actually I don't talk a lot about
3587000	3589000	sports games on the program because I don't get into
3589000	3591000	a whole lot of them but
3591000	3593000	Tecmo Bowl was one of the few sports games
3593000	3595000	I really really got into on the NES
3595000	3597000	because back then sports games were so simple
3597000	3599000	that you didn't really have to be
3599000	3601000	a professor of the sport to do well
3601000	3603000	at them
3603000	3605000	so I'm pretty excited that Tecmo Bowl
3605000	3607000	is re-coming out
3607000	3609000	except the weird thing about it is that they're not saying
3609000	3611000	what system it's coming out on
3611000	3613000	they're just saying
3613000	3615000	I can't tell you what platform we're making it for
3615000	3617000	but I can tell you
3617000	3619000	that it's probably not going to be on the platform
3619000	3621000	that you're expecting if that makes any sense
3621000	3623000	and I actually have no idea
3623000	3625000	what that means
3625000	3627000	does that mean Xbox Live Arcade?
3627000	3629000	I actually have a cell phone, Tecmo Bowl
3629000	3631000	I actually downloaded Tecmo Bowl to my cell phone
3631000	3633000	about a year ago and was very disappointed
3633000	3635000	actually they're not working with Visual Concepts
3635000	3637000	it's a little play on there
3637000	3639000	they're saying they
3639000	3641000	join Visual Concepts because Visual Concepts
3641000	3643000	is doing that All Pro 2K8 or whatever
3643000	3645000	and
3645000	3647000	basically they're comparing them because they don't
3647000	3649000	have the NFL license as well
3649000	3651000	so it looks like Tecmo is
3651000	3653000	going to be developing it by themselves
3653000	3655000	or at least with an unnamed developer
3655000	3657000	I'm going to guess that it's the N-Gage
3657000	3659000	that they're working on
3659000	3661000	because they are doing that whole
3661000	3663000	N-Gage 3 relaunch thing
3663000	3665000	or whatever so
3665000	3667000	that's the system I least expect it on
3667000	3669000	How about the
3669000	3671000	Atari 2600? That's the system
3671000	3673000	I would least expect it on
3673000	3675000	What about Virtual Console?
3675000	3677000	Nope, we already have Tecmo Bowl
3677000	3679000	on Virtual Console, kinda
3679000	3681000	Yeah, a new one though, you wouldn't expect that
3681000	3683000	Oh that'd be cool, but you know the weird thing is
3683000	3685000	it had this Tecmo Collection
3685000	3687000	or something like that, it was called
3687000	3689000	I don't remember, like a Tecmo Collection
3689000	3691000	that came out on Xbox and it had the old
3691000	3693000	arcade version of Tecmo Bowl on it
3693000	3695000	not nearly as fun as the NES one
3695000	3697000	and I realize a lot of people kinda only
3697000	3699000	know that as the Tecmo Bowl, but it was kinda
3699000	3701000	clunky to me
3701000	3703000	it didn't have that fast pacedness that the
3703000	3705000	NES one had, so there you go
3707000	3709000	Anyways
3709000	3711000	some interesting
3711000	3713000	stuff, another thing that was announced over
3713000	3715000	in
3715000	3717000	during the Square Enix
3717000	3719000	little Final Fantasy party there was that
3719000	3721000	they're gonna be bringing Chocobo Dungeon
3721000	3723000	to
3723000	3725000	actually to the Wii
3725000	3727000	exclusively, which is kinda neat
3727000	3729000	so that'll be kinda cool I guess
3729000	3731000	with, aren't they having the new
3731000	3733000	I wanna say they had Dragon Quest
3733000	3735000	Swords as well coming out
3735000	3737000	lots of stuff
3737000	3739000	for the Wii, lots of Wii love
3739000	3741000	good
3741000	3743000	I don't remember if any news about this
3743000	3745000	made our show roll, but isn't there information
3745000	3747000	as well about Crystal Chronicles that came out
3747000	3749000	of the event?
3749000	3751000	I know that they're in the DS
3751000	3753000	version, I think they may have
3753000	3755000	announced a date for that
3755000	3757000	Wasn't the Wii one supposed to be a launch title?
3759000	3761000	Maybe, maybe in Japan
3761000	3763000	but I know that
3763000	3765000	I distinctly remember seeing some type of
3765000	3767000	Crystal Chronicles stuff in
3767000	3769000	like, some of the early press things
3769000	3771000	for the Wii, like it was an early launch title
3771000	3773000	They announced, what was it, the DS version is gonna
3773000	3775000	be coming to Japan on August 23rd
3775000	3777000	that was the announcement that
3777000	3779000	I believe was there, I don't know about the Wii
3779000	3781000	version at all, I don't think there was anything
3781000	3783000	announced there
3783000	3785000	Alright
3785000	3787000	well, I don't know, are you excited about
3787000	3789000	Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii?
3789000	3791000	Nope, don't care, I couldn't give a crap when the DS
3791000	3793000	version came out, especially
3793000	3795000	didn't give a crap for the Japanese one
3795000	3797000	but uh
3797000	3799000	I don't know
3799000	3801000	Miklotov, have you ever played the Chocobo Dungeon games?
3801000	3803000	Are you excited about this new
3803000	3805000	Wii one at all?
3805000	3807000	No, but I'm excited about Crystal Chronicles
3807000	3809000	I'm very excited, because me and my friends
3809000	3811000	played the GameCube one a whole bunch
3811000	3813000	we never beat it, but we had a really good time
3813000	3815000	with it, because we had all the Game Boy
3815000	3817000	advances linked up, and it was just a really good
3817000	3819000	time, and I expect that the DS one will be
3819000	3821000	probably a little more fun
3821000	3823000	RossdielUT
3823000	3825000	says in chat, will Crystal Chronicles
3825000	3827000	require 4 DS's for multiplayer?
3827000	3829000	Of course
3829000	3831000	I hope not
3831000	3833000	You're going to have people share the DS
3833000	3835000	when they're playing, if it's just
3835000	3837000	the DS version, everybody's going to
3837000	3839000	need a copy and a DS to play
3839000	3841000	Is that maybe one reason that they've kind of
3841000	3843000	held off on putting this out on the Wii?
3843000	3845000	Is because there
3845000	3847000	hasn't really been a game that has the DS connectivity
3847000	3849000	yet, so they're waiting?
3849000	3851000	Probably, but I would really like them
3851000	3853000	to do a Wii one already, and the
3853000	3855000	DS one. Bring it square
3855000	3857000	Enix. So even though the
3857000	3859000	story was about Chocobo Dungeon, we couldn't help
3859000	3861000	throwing a little bit of Crystal Chronicles in there
3861000	3863000	Because we talked about a good game instead
3863000	3865000	Well there you have it
3865000	3867000	We have potential for something to be relatively
3867000	3869000	good
3869000	3871000	They are doing, actually
3871000	3873000	a Final Fantasy sort of
3873000	3875000	fighting game
3875000	3877000	Ergize 2?
3877000	3879000	Final Fantasy
3879000	3881000	Cecidia
3881000	3883000	And it's looking like it's going to be
3883000	3885000	more like a
3885000	3887000	a big
3887000	3889000	it sort of looks like it's more of a big
3889000	3891000	I'm sorry, the only thing I can really
3891000	3893000	think of looking at this is like
3893000	3895000	a sort of like
3895000	3897000	level of Power Stone, I think
3897000	3899000	you know, with the big levels and all that
3899000	3901000	just with versus
3901000	3903000	you know, versus each other's characters, but it looks like we've got
3903000	3905000	some Final Fantasy
3905000	3907000	9, some
3907000	3909000	7, 8
3909000	3911000	and I think 12
3911000	3913000	thrown in, yeah
3913000	3915000	Is this just
3915000	3917000	an excuse to give the fangirls
3917000	3919000	their Cloud X, Tidus
3919000	3921000	stories?
3921000	3923000	No, because Steffi is my bishie
3923000	3925000	Yeah
3925000	3927000	Wow, you're lame
3927000	3929000	Just kidding, hearts
3929000	3931000	I was a squall fangirl
3931000	3933000	Well now, if this ends up
3933000	3935000	being what the game is all about, you could have all
3935000	3937000	of those guys battling it out
3937000	3939000	I know, it's great
3939000	3941000	Alright, anyhow
3941000	3943000	Shadows Fits Lair in chat says
3943000	3945000	Super Smash Brothers Final Fantasy edition
3945000	3947000	Maybe, maybe
3947000	3949000	Alright, well one thing I should mention
3949000	3951000	is that Star Ocean 1
3951000	3953000	and 2 are being made
3953000	3955000	for the PSP
3955000	3957000	Of course, you know, it seems like Square's kind of getting
3957000	3959000	big on the remakes for PSP lately because
3959000	3961000	you know, of course Final Fantasy
3961000	3963000	that's there and then of course they did the
3963000	3965000	redone version of Tactics or whatever
3965000	3967000	So Square's been showing the PSP
3967000	3969000	a lot of love lately and they are continuing
3969000	3971000	Star Ocean 1 and 2
3971000	3973000	You may remember these games were originally on the Super Nintendo
3973000	3975000	and the Playstation 1, but now they are going to be coming
3975000	3977000	to the PSP. By the way
3977000	3979000	if you would like a new Star Ocean game
3979000	3981000	Star Ocean 4 is
3981000	3983000	confirmed to be under development and
3983000	3985000	will be coming out soon
3985000	3987000	but they haven't exactly said which
3987000	3989000	platform it's going to be coming out
3989000	3991000	to yet, I believe
3991000	3993000	Well, people
3993000	3995000	are assuming it's PS3 and Xbox 360
3995000	3997000	and most people are assuming it has to be
3997000	3999000	Playstation 3 because all the other games were
3999000	4001000	on the Sony platforms, but
4001000	4003000	you know, anything's possible, especially with
4003000	4005000	Square. They've jumped ship before
4005000	4007000	to other systems. I mean, hello, Dragon Quest
4007000	4009000	going to DS. Who would have thought
4009000	4011000	that was going to happen? Well, there you go
4011000	4013000	Well, I was thinking
4013000	4015000	It says
4015000	4017000	it was officially announced for next gen
4017000	4019000	consoles, so
4019000	4021000	Well, technically, I don't know
4021000	4023000	Again,
4023000	4025000	though, you can assume
4025000	4027000	it's the Playstation, but then they'll make a surprise
4027000	4029000	jump to Wii, you never know
4029000	4031000	There you go
4031000	4033000	Anyways
4033000	4035000	So, of more
4035000	4037000	I hate to sound like a broken record, but
4037000	4039000	more rumors
4039000	4041000	regarding the PSP getting a redesign
4041000	4043000	One, I had to laugh
4043000	4045000	at when I saw this story. There's a rumor
4045000	4047000	that the PSPs are going to be
4047000	4049000	now being shipped
4049000	4051000	with
4051000	4053000	with firmwares
4053000	4055000	with downloadable
4055000	4057000	prevention
4057000	4059000	Right
4059000	4061000	Like all the other ones
4061000	4063000	had it so you can download
4063000	4065000	I'm sorry, I don't think they're going to have it
4065000	4067000	where you can enable it not
4067000	4069000	to be able to be downgraded
4069000	4071000	But they're going to try, apparently
4071000	4073000	That's the rumor
4073000	4075000	So wait, what exactly are they blocking? You can't
4075000	4077000	download anything? What? No, they're downgradable
4077000	4079000	They're going to make it so you can't downgrade the
4079000	4081000	firmware. I don't see how that's going to happen
4081000	4083000	Well, don't they say that every other time
4083000	4085000	they release a patch? Yes
4085000	4087000	So, anyways
4087000	4089000	They're basically, that's the rumor
4089000	4091000	It's supposed to be happening
4091000	4093000	They said all new PSPs
4093000	4095000	shipping out as of next Friday
4095000	4097000	which is May 18th
4097000	4099000	will be a higher firmware
4099000	4101000	4 point something
4101000	4103000	It says they promised
4103000	4105000	to include, and this is coming from
4105000	4107000	a
4107000	4109000	EB Games regional manager
4109000	4111000	in Canada
4111000	4113000	So I don't know how much you can believe that
4113000	4115000	But anyways
4115000	4117000	What are you trying to say about Canada?
4117000	4119000	I'm trying to say something about EB
4119000	4121000	But basically, here's what they're saying
4121000	4123000	Sony was sending out emails to its commercial
4123000	4125000	retailers that all new PSPs
4125000	4127000	will be
4127000	4129000	sent out with
4129000	4131000	downgradable
4131000	4133000	prevention built right into them
4133000	4135000	All new PSPs will be shipped out
4135000	4137000	as of next week, Friday, May 18th
4137000	4139000	will be a higher firmware
4139000	4141000	4.XX
4141000	4143000	Specifics not released, it says
4143000	4145000	But they were promised to include new security features
4145000	4147000	to prevent hacks and downgrades
4147000	4149000	Apparently this will be
4149000	4151000	one of the first steps to start focusing
4151000	4153000	on the PSP again instead of diverting
4153000	4155000	all the attention to the PS3
4155000	4157000	I'll believe it when I see it
4157000	4159000	Isn't this just a challenge to hackers?
4159000	4161000	Yes, it is
4161000	4163000	It's not going to happen
4163000	4165000	At this point, no
4165000	4167000	It's not when they said
4167000	4169000	Blu-ray and HD DVD is uncrackable
4169000	4171000	and then the code is all over the front page of DIG
4171000	4173000	Let's just say
4173000	4175000	for example, if they do release this
4175000	4177000	firmware, whatever, that's for new
4177000	4179000	PSPs. There's a lot of them out there
4179000	4181000	right now that do not have that
4181000	4183000	So, big deal
4183000	4185000	That's about the equivalent of them
4185000	4187000	changing the $5 bill to a new
4187000	4189000	version that can't be counterfeited
4189000	4191000	but the old ones are still in circulation
4191000	4193000	and still being used, so
4193000	4195000	It's kind of dumb
4195000	4197000	Anywho, the other
4197000	4199000	of course, rumor that we've talked about before
4199000	4201000	is saying that a new PSP
4201000	4203000	redesign is going to become
4203000	4205000	and it'll be smaller
4205000	4207000	and a lighter weight version of
4207000	4209000	the handheld device
4209000	4211000	No release date
4211000	4213000	No price point
4213000	4215000	and no other info on that
4215000	4217000	It's a big, fat rumor
4217000	4219000	but I think people are thinking that it's going to happen
4219000	4221000	since, I don't know
4221000	4223000	that they haven't muggied with it yet
4223000	4225000	and that they can't do that with all their console systems
4225000	4227000	Alright
4227000	4229000	Well, we're going to get to a segment here
4229000	4231000	we like to do every week on the program
4231000	4233000	That is DarkSakura's website of the week
4233000	4235000	because DarkSakura likes to surf the internet
4235000	4237000	all back and forth
4237000	4239000	and around and through and find a website
4239000	4241000	that she wants to share with you
4241000	4243000	DarkSakura, where should the kids
4243000	4245000	be pointing their web browsers this week?
4247000	4249000	The website of the week is
4249000	4251000	MyCatHatesYou.com
4251000	4253000	and this is
4253000	4255000	a
4255000	4257000	big, massive collection
4257000	4259000	of pissed off cats
4259000	4261000	It's beautiful
4261000	4263000	It's just lovely
4263000	4265000	That's all it is, is pictures of angry cats
4265000	4267000	Pretty much
4267000	4269000	Our cat is doing naughty bad things
4269000	4271000	There's this one cat
4271000	4273000	The first thing is this cat
4273000	4275000	with a leather jacket on it
4275000	4277000	and a big cat looking all bad ass
4277000	4279000	It's also one of those bald cats
4281000	4283000	Interesting
4285000	4287000	There's also one of the black and white cats
4287000	4289000	by a thing that's already used
4289000	4291000	MyCatHatesYou.com
4291000	4293000	Your cat doesn't really hate me
4293000	4295000	though, right DarkSakura?
4295000	4297000	My cat doesn't hate anybody, she just looks offended
4297000	4299000	Alright, here you go
4299000	4301000	Alright, well one more
4301000	4303000	story for you for this segment
4303000	4305000	this part of Orange Lounge Radio
4305000	4307000	and that's about some homebrew
4307000	4309000	that's being made for the DS
4309000	4311000	This is
4311000	4313000	I don't know exactly how to
4313000	4315000	describe this game
4315000	4317000	I kind of look at it like a
4317000	4319000	puzzle type game, but the game is called
4319000	4321000	Virus DX
4321000	4323000	It's a puzzle game
4323000	4325000	but this puzzle game has hot anime
4325000	4327000	nurses with it
4327000	4329000	and I'm assuming they must get
4329000	4331000	naked if you do good
4331000	4333000	because this is being called
4333000	4335000	Triple X homebrew
4335000	4337000	available on the Nintendo DS
4337000	4339000	That's not all, they have strip rock
4339000	4341000	paper scissors, tickle girl and
4341000	4343000	teenage queen NDS
4343000	4345000	Yes, lots of fun stuff there
4345000	4347000	I like tickle girl, what's tickle girl about?
4347000	4349000	I'm thinking about buying stuff too
4349000	4351000	Wow, you actually see a picture
4351000	4353000	of a girl on the bottom screen there
4353000	4355000	and if you tickle her
4355000	4357000	with your stylus you can see her reaction
4357000	4359000	on the top screen and it will
4359000	4361000	utilize full motion video sampled
4361000	4363000	audio and looping background music
4363000	4365000	and
4365000	4367000	they're saying if you liked Feel
4367000	4369000	the Magic, you'll love this
4369000	4371000	Wow
4371000	4373000	I want to see strip rock
4373000	4375000	paper scissors
4375000	4377000	That's
4377000	4379000	like when you're trying to convince
4379000	4381000	someone to play strip poker with you
4381000	4383000	and they're like, but I don't know how to
4383000	4385000	play poker, so you say, okay
4385000	4387000	let's play strip high card
4387000	4389000	All it is is it's basically a rock
4389000	4391000	paper scissor and then they have
4391000	4393000	porn pictures that they've taken off
4393000	4395000	a website that's in a series or something
4395000	4397000	Why bother with the game, seriously?
4397000	4399000	Why not just have
4399000	4401000	DS porno?
4401000	4403000	Why bother?
4403000	4405000	I guess that's true too
4405000	4407000	But this is homebrew
4407000	4409000	this you can get for free, right?
4409000	4411000	Whereas the browser costs like 50 bucks
4411000	4413000	Actually, Teenage Queen
4413000	4415000	NDS is actually
4415000	4417000	pretty, it's all hand drawn
4417000	4419000	animation, that's kind of neat
4419000	4421000	It's a poker game, it looks like
4421000	4423000	Yeah, but that's
4423000	4425000	probably about as good as strip poker was
4425000	4427000	on the Commodore 64
4427000	4429000	Yeah
4429000	4431000	It's all about Custer's Revenge
4431000	4433000	Dude, it's all
4433000	4435000	about, you know, fucking
4435000	4437000	putting some more adult
4437000	4439000	games, what the fuck is that one game
4439000	4441000	that needs to play all the time?
4441000	4443000	Gals panic! They need to put gals panic on there
4443000	4445000	Oh, I thought the guy game
4445000	4447000	Where they would have the contest
4447000	4449000	between the women, like the video sequences
4449000	4451000	that you'd unlock
4451000	4453000	They have that now in Girls Gone Wild
4453000	4455000	It's kind of retarded
4455000	4457000	Alright, well anyway
