[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:20,919
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk a little more about some of the other consoles.

4
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:54,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, we need to start with the Xbox.

5
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:58,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Because huge news this week with Halo 3, of course, finally getting its beta.

6
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:00,368
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit delayed.

7
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what, about 13 hours before the folks on Crackdown could get in there?

8
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Bungie said, okay, because, you know, we made a boo-boo in getting you guys in when we said we would.

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,830
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to extend the beta for four days.

10
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

11
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And you shouldn't bitch about things that are free anyway.

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the beta was followed up immediately with the news that

13
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: When Halo 3 is going to come out in Fall 2007, they mean September 25th, 2007.

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you guys in Europe that feel like you always get screwed, you have to wait one day.

15
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: September 26th for you guys in Europe.

16
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys finally not having to wait as long.

17
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:42,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So September 2007, which I... May I point out that September 26th will be occurring at the same time as September 25th here.

18
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:45,694
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an eight-hour time difference.

19
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

20
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:46,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

21
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:48,295
[SPEAKER_08]: At least between here and London time.

22
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

23
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically it's a simultaneous release.

24
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:52,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Not what?

25
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,777
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an eight-hour difference.

26
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: As close as you can get to it, we should say.

27
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty rad for them.

28
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,620
[SPEAKER_04]: No word about Japan yet, but I don't know.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,382
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably not as anxious about Halo 3, although they can sell some copies of it there.

30
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:07,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

31
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you've mentioned September before on this show, haven't you?

32
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't.

33
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,800
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a blog post which I took away during that whole... Yeah, when people were threatening to beat you up.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Take you out of the back parking lot and beat you up if you keep squealing.

35
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I was off by 13 days, but I was close.

36
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably closer than most people, though.

37
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:26,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, though.

38
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:28,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so there it is.

39
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your pre-orders in now.

40
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,046
[SPEAKER_04]: September 25th is the date.

41
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:38,989
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want Halo 3... Especially get those pre-orders in if you're looking for the Legendary Edition because it's going to be fucking impossible to find.

42
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:39,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

43
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:55,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so yeah, immediately once the Halo 3 beta came out, people started, you know, the modders out there were already taking notice and trying to grab any sort of information that they possibly can.

44
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:07,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, no actual word on what exactly that meant, but apparently they're looking at the code in the beta to see how they can exploit the game when it comes out.

45
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:10,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Not surprising.

46
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,676
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly are they doing to it?

47
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really sure.

48
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:26,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're trying to rip code out of the, you know, like, I don't know, basically taking the demo that's on your, you know, or beta that's on your hard drive and just kind of trying to dissect it.

49
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:34,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are they these typical type of multiplayer exploits where they're trying to make themselves invincible so they can go in there and just blow people up and no one can shoot them?

50
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, lag stuff.

51
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:35,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

52
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're really going to be able to do much because it's a beta.

53
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:48,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone can really decrypt the games anyways, so that'll be interesting.

54
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:56,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is actually a little bit more in regards to the news.

55
00:03:56,028 --> 00:04:01,950
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about the accounts on Xbox Live a week or so ago.

56
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:11,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Just another update for the same thing is that they are actually banning modified consoles from live.

57
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, the folks that are trying to fuck with their systems to do this beta by hack storing their consoles, they're getting the ban hammer.

58
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:19,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

59
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:21,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Smacking it down.

60
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they have this little text, right?

61
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:32,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember Major Nelson, I was reading his blog earlier this week, had a post of the actual little picture that would come up if you are a recipient of the Banhammer.

62
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:39,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was interesting because it read to me like it was saying, don't call us, there's nothing you can do, you've been banned, F you, bye.

63
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what it said.

64
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of like, what if you get banned accidentally?

65
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you'd be screwed.

66
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Microsoft basically says, screw you.

67
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:55,566
[SPEAKER_04]: If this ever happened to me and I didn't actually mod my console or whatever, I would be livid.

68
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure this can't be 100% foolproof.

69
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:04,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think, though, that they're counting on there being such a minority of people that that happens to.

70
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:11,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Because honestly, if you haven't put anything in your system that doesn't belong there, I've never opened the case to do anything to it.

71
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:18,808
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the chances going to be that there's going to be some sort of flaw that comes up saying that you've modified your system?

72
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:20,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

73
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystic Gohan in chat is talking about what's happened.

74
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:26,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystic Gohan says they unlocked the locked content.

75
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,650
[SPEAKER_04]: They found out that there's a vehicle called the Chopper in it.

76
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bandit says there's a band cannon.

77
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a band hammer, but a band cannon.

78
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:35,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Band cannon.

79
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:37,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of a man cannon, a band cannon.

80
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:39,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the man cannon?

81
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:45,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I've yet to see one of those in the beta, the man cannon.

82
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:48,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this is an appropriate response to the hackers?

83
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:50,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

84
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:53,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it, but I hope they're damn right every time.

85
00:05:53,406 --> 00:06:04,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there ought to be some type of way to appeal just in case because if this ever happens to somebody who runs a podcast or a blog, it's going to be a PR nightmare for Microsoft.

86
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my opinion.

87
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think they care.

88
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not, but, you know, still, if they ban the wrong person, it's going to be trouble.

89
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:19,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, you heard the fuss I made when I got the red rings.

90
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they don't accidentally ban me.

91
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to quote Raul Steele in here.

92
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Hackers deserve to have their consoles bricked.

93
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

94
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:26,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

95
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I just, as long as they are 100% positive that the people they are banning are those that deserve it.

96
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't hack your system until the next gen comes out.

97
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:36,601
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

98
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:43,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those of you guys that have not gotten your Xbox consoles banned, you have plenty to look forward to.

99
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:54,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade is getting a Bomberman port, and if you're still crying in the corner in the fetal position over Bomberman Act Zero, fear not!

100
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,742
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a traditional Bomberman-style game.

101
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Hudson's putting it together.

102
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:04,087
[SPEAKER_04]: They have confirmed after much speculation on the Internet, which I believe we talked a little bit about last week on the show.

103
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a trailer and stuff.

104
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Hudson has stepped out and said, okay, you got us.

105
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out, and it's going to have eight-player support online.

106
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, this has been one of our most requested games.

107
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Our fans have been clamoring for it.

108
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:20,099
[SPEAKER_04]: We are thrilled to finally be able to deliver the game they want.

109
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

110
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,362
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be pretty awesome there.

111
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Also new to the Xbox Live Arcade version.

112
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:29,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman Customizability.

113
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:33,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers will be able to design a unique bomber to identify themselves with online.

114
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Hudson promises enough options for 10,000 possible combinations, 9,900 of which are ugly.

115
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:48,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, something kind of funny coming out from Edge Magazine in the U.K.,

116
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is coming from Mark Reim.

117
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:56,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about Gears of War and how they've modified it into a golf game.

118
00:07:56,452 --> 00:08:04,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they were trying to sell the Unreal 3 engine to a Korean publisher that was looking to make casual games from it and possibly a golf game out of it.

119
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they did to kind of demonstrate this is they modified one of the levels of Gears of War to make it more like a golf course with holes and stuff like that and mounds.

120
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:17,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And then actually had their animator

121
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:45,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Create a golf swing for Marcus Fenix And, you know, kind of demonstrate it using the actual I think it was the grenade throwing engine in the actual game So, that's kind of neat Don't expect it to actually come to, you know, live or anything as download content But, you know, hey, if they wanted to do that, that'd be kind of neat Will Gears of War Golf, this tech demo here Become the Final Fantasy on Nintendo 64 tech demo of the future?

122
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of those highly sought after things?

123
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

124
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:49,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

125
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fun to have a downloadable demo or something like that.

126
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see a YouTube.

127
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:53,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

128
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever a story like this is to be found, there's soon a YouTube to be found.

129
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see a YouTube of this in action.

130
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus Phoenix on the golf course.

131
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

132
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:06,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is actually something that makes me pretty happy.

133
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:15,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Recent submissions to the ESRB has been Echo the Dolphin and Summit the Hedgehog for Xbox 360.

134
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:22,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, you remember when we were talking about the Sega Vintage rumor that was going out?

135
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this seems to sort of support that theory.

136
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:29,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, it's not going to be called Sega Vintage.

137
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:32,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, they are going to call it Sega Ages something.

138
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's just Sega.

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So, whatever.

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Ages is Sega backwards?

141
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:38,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

142
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Cute.

143
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Not cute.

144
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:45,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, they've been doing the Sega Ages collection since the day of the Saturn.

145
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,349
[SPEAKER_08]: That name is not going anywhere.

146
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time there was a good Wayne's World reference anywhere?

147
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, I had to do it not.

148
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, I killed the joke.

149
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, are you excited about this?

150
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this is like the five gazillionth time we've seen Sonic the Hedgehog.

151
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:00,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I have both of those games.

152
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But there'll be achievements and high-def graphics.

153
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,416
[SPEAKER_08]: How much do I give a shit about achievements, Rob?

154
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:08,855
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen my Xbox Live account.

155
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you have like zero points?

156
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:11,297
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

157
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:17,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one achievement, and that's from playing Uno and winning with a draw four.

158
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: The one time I've played on live.

159
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,147
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not really a big 360.

160
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's all your Marvel Ultimate Alliance achievements?

161
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing on PS3.

162
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're going to be playing on Xbox 360, yes?

163
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then it'll have Cheater all over it.

164
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm going to be level 99, 100k, max out my characters.

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

166
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,270
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be me.

167
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

168
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:44,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

169
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:48,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you are a fan of retro, are you interested in this, Loki?

170
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: The Echo of the Dolphin?

171
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:49,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

172
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, KaneVM, guess what?

173
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:52,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Dragon Force.

174
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:53,294
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

175
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,175
[SPEAKER_04]: KaneVM says I want Dragon Force.

176
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me Dragon Force.

177
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it.

178
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

179
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Saturn going over to the Wii of course they love their virtual console stuff over on the Wii and again the ESRB spills the dirt on what we can be looking forward to on the Wii Virtual Console including Streets of Rage 2 coming to the Wii Virtual Console ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron boy they're really reaching with the Sega Genesis games now aren't they and World Sports Competition from Hudson

180
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,021
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

181
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:33,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Three games that are all but confirmed, basically, for the Virtual Console.

182
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:35,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody downloaded anything on Virtual Console lately?

183
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:37,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

184
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:40,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm the only sucker for it.

185
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Legend of the Mystical Ninja because that game was awesome.

186
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:43,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

187
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an awesome game.

188
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,450
[SPEAKER_03]: World Sports Competition.

189
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a generic name.

190
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:52,913
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Nintendo.

191
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Nintendo and Squeenix.

192
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I am still waiting for ActRaiser.

193
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:02,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Japan and Europe have had it how long now?

194
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:03,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still waiting?

195
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:04,834
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's the holdup?

196
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Actraiser!

197
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,936
[SPEAKER_03]: On my Super Mario RPG!

198
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:08,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Now!

199
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry, I'm done being a little kid.

200
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:22,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so something else we talked about on a previous podcast, which later disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle.

201
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:24,852
[SPEAKER_04]: which we will speak no longer of on this program.

202
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:29,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Namco Museum Remix is coming to the Wii.

203
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,215
[SPEAKER_03]: First time I've ever heard that.

204
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:35,238
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I never heard you say this on a previous podcast at all that suddenly disappeared a few weeks later.

205
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:36,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard it.

206
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:36,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Never ever.

207
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Never.

208
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:48,886
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to actually, they're kind of remixing a few different things than you would normally expect like pack and rolls actually being remade into a Wii game.

209
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,266
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

210
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be on there.

211
00:12:51,786 --> 00:13:01,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Motos, which is going to be a Mario Kart type game, but basically Pac-Man knocks his opponents out of dangerous arenas.

212
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:10,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Rally-X Remix, they're redoing it in 3D, so it's a little bit different than the remixed ones on the PSP.

213
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Gator Panic Remix, which is like Whack-A-Mole.

214
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:31,321
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course you're going to also see Galaxian, DigDog, Mappy, Xevious, Galplus, Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Mania, and QQ.

215
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:38,282
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all have remakes and I guess, oh, no, the originals.

216
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:44,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's set to release, I guess, it says in the fall.

217
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I have issues with Namco lately for certain unsaid personal reasons, this game looks pretty cool.

218
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:59,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't let that get in the way of the fact that the game does look pretty cool.

219
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, pack and roll on the Wii does seem like kind of a natural progression.

220
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a sucker for these retro things.

221
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,890
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

222
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just such a fucking sucker for this crap.

223
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And this looks kind of neat.

224
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and unfortunately, it's going to be the only rolling game this year on the Wii.

225
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I know you're a Namco fan

226
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,484
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,209
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you excited about this whole remix thing on the Wii?

228
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this something that should be remixed, or should Namco Games be untouched and preserved in a bubble forever?

229
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:27,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, given that I was picking up the Sega Ages 2900, and you know what those are, they're all the touched-up, redone versions of the old Sega games, then I have absolutely no problem with this.

230
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:34,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see D3 release all the simple 2000 series over here.

231
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:39,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there have been a few titles from the Simple 2000 series that snuck over.

232
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, of course, are different titles.

233
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:50,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Bandit says, bring me BurgerTime now, and Ross Steele has to remind Bandit the BurgerTime is by Data East, so it won't be in a minute.

234
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have BurgerTime now?

235
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:52,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

236
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have BurgerTime now?

237
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,492
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell ever happened to Data East?

238
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they still around?

239
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,153
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing pinball.

240
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They should remake Breakthrough.

241
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my first Nintendo games, and I loved it.

242
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:08,279
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura loves to look at the internet up and down and all over every week and share her favorite website with you.

243
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:11,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's DarkSakura's website of the week and she's going to tell you what it is right now.

244
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided not to do a website of the week, sorry.

245
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:36,402
[SPEAKER_08]: No, really.

246
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:45,066
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one that was suggested by our very own Loki, and it's fucking addicting.

247
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:50,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Dofiblog, and let me see if I can read what this says.

248
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:55,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it just says Dofiblog in Hiragana, I'm sorry.

249
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:58,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bunch of flash games.

250
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:00,073
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really crazy.

251
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Cat with Bo Golf, which is crazy.

252
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:27,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's also Stick Remover, and Double Wires, Eggway, San San San, X Snow Cats, Neko Breakout, War of the Hell, Slug Slayer, New Rolling Omosubi, Rolling Omosubi, and a bunch of other weirdo games involving cats.

253
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend...

254
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: X Snowcats Eggway Double Wires Ishii.blog2.fc2.com

255
00:17:57,463 --> 00:18:01,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Ishi, I-S-H-I dot B-L-O-G 2 dot F-C-2 dot com.

256
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:04,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Which you have conveniently posted in chat for our listeners, I see.

257
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course I have.

258
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, DarkSakura, upstanding citizen.

259
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

260
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:15,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Data East, I looked them up on Wikipedia to figure out what went on.

261
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:32,548
[SPEAKER_04]: They went under on June 25, 2003 is when they filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court, and their intellectual properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, who is a Japanese mobile game content provider, which explains how we have burger time on cell phones, because I have seen that game in recent years.

262
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe you'll see bad dudes in a few years on phones.

263
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:37,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

264
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:39,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a bad enough dude to have a milkshake?

265
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:40,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But Data East went under.

266
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:45,108
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have a brief stint in pinball, and they did some pretty good tables.

267
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Guns N' Roses, The Simpsons, Robocop.

268
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:48,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Guns N' Roses.

269
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else?

270
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,394
[SPEAKER_04]: They purchased Stern Electronics, and then something changed, and they made Stern Pinball, I think.

271
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:57,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, Stern Pinball.

272
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:58,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they sold it all to Sega.

273
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,123
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

274
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:01,564
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

275
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:01,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Stern.

276
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, pinball goddess.

277
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Stern is their own company.

278
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:11,271
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, Stern is the company that released the Pirates of the Caribbean pinball like a couple months ago.

279
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think they also released the Family Guy pinball.

280
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:16,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I get it.

281
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:16,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

282
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Data East exited the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 96.

283
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And the USA division had already been transferred to Sega as part of a debt settlement.

284
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:33,700
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the Pinball Factory changed hands one more time with Gary Stern purchasing the factory in 99 and renaming it Stern Pinball.

285
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

286
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,201
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened.

287
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And Stern is still giving us our pinball.

288
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:38,402
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

289
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, no more Data East.

290
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: No more Kid Nicky Radical Ninja, I'm sorry to say.

291
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:46,925
[SPEAKER_04]: No more Bump and Jump Kids or Ring King.

292
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Bump and Jump.

293
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Bump and Jump was rad.

294
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:53,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but you do get plenty of Super Smash Bros.

295
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl because that wasn't by Data East.

296
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:56,948
[SPEAKER_04]: That's by people completely different

297
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

298
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:57,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl

299
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Tingle in it!

300
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Your favorite Nintendo character of all time, Tingle.

301
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:25,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo.

302
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,142
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Zelda series, of course.

303
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:31,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Tingle is the... He's every fairy's fairy, let's just put it that way.

304
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,325
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes around spilling rupees, and good times.

305
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember he was in the Four Swords game on GameCube.

306
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

307
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:44,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be great if Tingle shows up in the game.

308
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:48,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Has not been confirmed by Nintendo, it's still a rumor, but that would be pretty awesome if Tingle showed up in the game.

309
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,017
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, but to drop power-ups in.

310
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that Tingle is a character.

311
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:59,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be that Tingle, you know, because, like, remember how, like, Pokemon showed up?

312
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:02,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the Pokeballs would show up in the old one on GameCube?

313
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just throw the Pokeballs and you had random, like, you know, like, what were some of the Pokemon that showed up randomly?

314
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:11,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the Charizard and stuff would blow fire or whatever.

315
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:13,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

316
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And with any luck, maybe Loki is secretly recording the voice of Tingle as we speak for this upcoming game.

317
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not recording the voice for Tingle.

318
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:22,441
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

319
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.

320
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:25,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible, horrible.

321
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:27,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

322
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:36,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently now, if you're flying Delta Air, you can check out some free demos for the DS.

323
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now they have DS demo stations right there.

324
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,554
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're waiting in line.

325
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:50,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And some demos you'll be able to try out, Brain Age, Cooking Mama, Elite Beat Agents, and Tomb Raider Legend.

326
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, all those are free.

327
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this all the same shit that's in there usual?

328
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say yes.

329
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:01,985
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

330
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:06,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, but this isn't much incentive to fly Delta because if you think about it,

331
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

332
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,053
[SPEAKER_08]: There is some good news for our friends in Europe.

333
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VI Advance will be released on June 29th.

334
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually got the game, although to be honest I have yet to play it.

335
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:56,489
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the Soul Shrine that gives you a bunch of monsters to beat up and...

336
00:22:57,202 --> 00:23:01,105
[SPEAKER_08]: A Kaiser Dragon Boss, and a music player.

337
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,348
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, it's the same game.

338
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Except that you have no Vanish Egg Zone.

339
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they took Egg Zone out of the game?

340
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:10,994
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

341
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:12,815
[SPEAKER_08]: You have no Vanish Egg Zone.

342
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the trick you used to do.

343
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:15,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The combo.

344
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,959
[SPEAKER_08]: No Vanish Egg Zone.

345
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,902
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the Vanish Egg Zone combo?

346
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:24,165
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens if you cast Vanish is that it makes the enemies disappear, but...

347
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:31,476
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes them, I think, vulnerable to all magic attacks, and then X-Zone sends them to another dimension.

348
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, it ends the battle.

349
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,497
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Zone was like an insta-kill.

350
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,897
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Zone was an insta-kill, but it didn't always work.

351
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:39,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you used Vanish on the enemy first, it would always work.

352
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:41,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

353
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I always used to just, like, cast and reflect on all my characters and then just balancing the spells off there, even though I don't know if it did anything.

354
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just nice to see, like, lightning hit, you know, four times or whatever.

355
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:53,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

356
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:56,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew Nami would like to point out that Vanished Doom will also work.

357
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,258
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vanished Doom combo.

358
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:03,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, but still my favorite attack, though, in that entire game was Meteor, just because it looks cool.

359
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:05,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I never used the Vanished Exon TD.

360
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:12,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought Exon was kind of a dumb spell, just because, I don't know, I like to kill in the old-fashioned way, by the hand of my sword.

361
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:14,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or spamming Ultima.

362
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:15,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

363
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:25,674
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing, though, that I really... Okay, what was... In the Final Fantasy games, overall, what would you say is your one most useful spell?

364
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:27,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

365
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:27,935
[SPEAKER_08]: That isn't Cure.

366
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:28,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say Cure.

367
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:30,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Cureaga?

368
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,596
[SPEAKER_08]: That isn't in the family of Cure.

369
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Protect.

370
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:38,658
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I rarely use Protect unless it's Final Fantasy XI.

371
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,139
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one spell I would use?

372
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire III, I guess.

373
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Demi.

374
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where it has their MP every time?

375
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:53,128
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Demi quarters their HP every time.

376
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, quarters their HP.

377
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Demi I thought was... Demi was an HP attack.

378
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:01,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And you cast Demi 3 and it was like even more than that.

379
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:01,615
75%.

380
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the... And it would work on big enemies.

381
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,620
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one for MP.

382
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:12,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

383
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't care about their NP as long as I could kill them before they hit me.

384
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Jvmon says Demi and Bio for me.

385
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:21,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Bio was the other one.

386
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:22,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Bio.

387
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,213
[SPEAKER_08]: But Demi was like my big favorite.

388
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:28,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Virus in 4 was pretty rad because it made that hideous noise whenever you cast it.

389
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:30,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded like cats getting hit.

390
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded like cats in a burlap bag being hit with a bat when you cast Virus on the enemy.

391
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:38,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the chainsaw.

392
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:41,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That was rad.

393
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:45,798
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I love 6, was that, you know, you did the little commands with, what was it, Saban was his name, right?

394
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,619
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was Edgar, I think.

395
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:51,881
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Edgar, well, Edgar had the chainsaw, but Saban had the ones where you did, like, the... The Street Fighter stuff?

396
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Street Fighter stuff, and he did special moves.

397
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:54,782
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so rad.

398
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,043
[SPEAKER_08]: He was really cool.

399
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,043
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn, that game is great.

400
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:57,744
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to remake that.

401
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,144
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome if they do.

402
00:25:59,444 --> 00:25:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

403
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still, you know, I don't know.

404
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:03,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't mess with something that ain't broken, right?

405
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:04,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

406
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am curious to check out this Final Fantasy 6 Advance.

407
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:09,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I need to buy the Advance one.

408
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:09,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

409
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:18,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, GSucks68 in chat says, Demi sucks, especially against most stronger enemies since they're immune to it.

410
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if you make them not immune to it.

411
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:26,565
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteelUT says, virus equals bio, translations.

412
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was virus and four and then bio in the later games.

413
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was translations, I don't know.

414
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But it still made the dying cat noise.

415
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:38,156
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love Final Fantasy, then you must have this in your collection.

416
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a Chocobo Magic Book Mug.

417
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course, NCSX.

418
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know how you guys feel about this company, NCSX.

419
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you use them, DarkSakura?

420
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

421
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:50,285
[SPEAKER_08]: NCSX is great.

422
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:51,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

423
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:51,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

424
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Byrite is the one you hate.

425
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But they went under, right?

426
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:55,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hell yes.

427
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

428
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So NCSX.

429
00:26:58,372 --> 00:26:58,952
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

430
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,293
[SPEAKER_04]: NCSX.

431
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:01,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio.

432
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:05,039
[SPEAKER_04]: is a place where you can buy these mugs for $18 a piece.

433
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,100
[SPEAKER_04]: These Chocobo mugs, and damn, they look cute.

434
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

435
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:09,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at those little Chocobo mugs.

436
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:10,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they look cute?

437
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminds me of my... I got you your Batsmaroo one.

438
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:17,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, my Batsmaroo mug, which I do use once in a while for coffee for my Hello Kitty coffee maker.

439
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:20,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should get a Chocobo mug to go along with this.

440
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You should get me one, too.

441
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:22,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Cute coffee mugs are awesome.

442
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can drink out of a bird's head.

443
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm going to go on a shopping spree at NCSX any day now.

444
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to think about that.

445
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:31,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I buy a present for you?

446
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:32,144
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you done for me?

447
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:33,525
[SPEAKER_08]: What haven't I done for you?

448
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:34,765
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

449
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:38,466
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you done for me lately?

450
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:47,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, like most of those promo deals out there, there's a new one now to get a Wii for free.

451
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way you do it is Gamefly, they're running a promotion where you persuade five of your friends to sign up and in return they'll send you a free Wii six weeks later.

452
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:05,600
[SPEAKER_03]: What people are doing is having their friends sign up, giving them like $10 each to do that, and then canceling it after a set amount of time.

453
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:08,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go, free Wii for $50.

454
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I did that for an iPod.

455
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's kind of like that scheme.

456
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, my guess is they're going to catch on to this pretty quick, and they will change something.

457
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So that shit really works, huh?

458
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we can get the free Xboxes.

459
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I keep hearing this commercial on the radio for the free Xbox.

460
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:34,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always like, oh, schemes are so reek of shenanigans.

461
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But they really work, huh?

462
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you how I did mine.

463
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:39,376
[SPEAKER_08]: They had this Blockbuster online thing.

464
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:41,677
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like Netflix but Blockbuster, so it sucked.

465
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:48,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you sign up, they don't charge you for like two weeks during their trial, right?

466
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:58,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but it takes six days for them to transfer to the iPod site that you signed up for, so you cancel before they charge your credit card.

467
00:28:59,326 --> 00:29:02,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And so me and five people did that, and I got an iPod.

468
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:02,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

469
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:03,709
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my iPod broke.

470
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got a cheap iPod.

471
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:06,452
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a refurb.

472
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one of the third edition iPods that they had the recall on.

473
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:10,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that sucks.

474
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:12,016
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well.

475
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,994
[SPEAKER_04]: The first email comes from a French nun

476
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:44,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Bonjour, DarkSakura.

477
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:49,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And please pardon my bad pronunciation because I am way, way out of practice.

478
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:50,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Christ.

479
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Are all our emails actually in French this week?

480
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:53,419
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're not.

481
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, did they actually listen to you?

482
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:03,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Vous avez une très belle voix et j'adore vous entendre à la radio orange.

483
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:04,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

484
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:05,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm really good.

485
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:08,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically said I had a really good voice and they like listening to the show.

486
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:10,669
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I have a general comment.

487
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I find your show a little Xbox 360 heavy.

488
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:19,915
[SPEAKER_08]: While I understand that there is little to talk about in the PS3 world, my PS3 is accumulating dust extremely effectively.

489
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:27,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to hear you chat, argue, fight about other platforms such as DS, PSP, cell phone games, and insert obscure platform here.

490
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:28,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the GDI.

491
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

492
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:30,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

493
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:31,383
[SPEAKER_08]: We did, didn't we?

494
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:32,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

495
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:33,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to Part A this week.

496
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:35,766
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like nothing but non-Xbox 360 stuff.

497
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I tune in to hear about stuff I know nothing about, and to be honest, I buy games you guys recommend.

498
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So talk about as many platforms as possible, fair enough?

499
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:46,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm going to translate this.

500
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:52,221
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, thank you.

501
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, still, my reading is not so bad.

502
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:59,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And good luck with the new massage profession.

503
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a French-Canadian listener who...

504
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:10,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Demands that we speak in French more.

505
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Parlez-vous freeze-pop?

506
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:19,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

507
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:19,486
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

508
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:34,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, thank you very much for the well wishes, and I'm actually going to be going, when I go back to school, I'm actually planning on, I took, you know, a whole bunch of French, and I used to be fairly conversational, so I'm going to go back and finish French.

509
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:39,032
[SPEAKER_08]: and Robert M. I'm sorry, but this made me crack up.

510
00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:42,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Poisson de Babel for Babelfish.

511
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:44,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, are you going on to another email?

512
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:45,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on another email.

513
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, can I respond to the last one real quick?

514
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:47,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

515
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:50,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Rob D. in chat says, OLR should cover the Sega CD more.

516
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should.

517
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:52,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

518
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,196
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just want to say about the Xbox 360 thing.

519
00:31:54,396 --> 00:32:00,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to realize, though, what platform has something coming out every week on it with the Xbox Live Arcade?

520
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,278
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the Xbox 360.

521
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

522
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:19,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

523
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a game you want us to talk about, email it and we'll talk about it.

524
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:55,815
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

525
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:56,835
[SPEAKER_04]: A taco.

526
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's okay.

527
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:01,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't you on the show this week?

528
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take the stuff inside of it.

529
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I got back too late.

530
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:10,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm better than you guys.

531
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take the stuff inside the taco.

532
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:12,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

533
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Just start digging.

534
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a fork?

535
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not, but I can go get you one.

536
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:17,881
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week real quick?

537
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of Oendan 2, and I've already beaten it.

538
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:22,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

539
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, nobody even mentions it.

540
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:27,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry to interrupt your mailbag, but we need to hear about Oendan 2.

541
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:28,061
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it?

542
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:40,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me first stress that I'm not a Japanophile in the least, so I don't care about J-pop, and I don't like J-pop, but I like these games.

543
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:46,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So the music for me is sorely lacking, but it's harder than Oendan 1.

544
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:52,006
[SPEAKER_09]: and... It doesn't quite have the same charm as the first game.

545
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Either Owen Don 1 or Elite Beat Agents.

546
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:56,189
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like it.

547
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I would still say Elite Beat Agents is my favorite of the three.

548
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: But Owen Don 2 is better than Owen Don 1 and I like that.

549
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard.

550
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they change anything with the basic game mechanics?

551
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:06,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not really?

552
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:16,625
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but they brought over the cool features from Elite Beat Agents where you can skip the intro and the last stage is actually divided into two songs.

553
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:17,206
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

554
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:23,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Oddly enough, you can skip the endings for each song now too once you've beaten them, so it's kind of weird.

555
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you're just replaying to get a better score.

556
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's good.

557
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been playing Puzzle Quest also.

558
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:30,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how's that?

559
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

560
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:33,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try that out before you leave.

561
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:36,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well I'm leaving like sometime tomorrow.

562
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:37,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

563
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a terrible backlog of DS games now.

564
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:45,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like six that I need to play or beat, and it's depressing because I keep finding more I want.

565
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,670
[SPEAKER_09]: How hard was it to find a copy of Puzzle Quest?

566
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:49,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hard for me at the time.

567
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:50,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it last weekend.

568
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I found one at Best Buy.

569
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:57,821
[SPEAKER_09]: But I went to EB and Best Buy this week, and yeah, it's not hard anymore.

570
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:58,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, good.

571
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:02,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So they finally put out enough so people can get it if they want.

572
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:03,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you, Mikotov.

573
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:04,947
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

574
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:05,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

575
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:05,688
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

576
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you get her napkins for her taco?

577
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm going to eat it.

578
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:09,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just going to eat the taco?

579
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

580
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:10,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's delicious.

581
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:12,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start back tomorrow.

582
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:15,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Shane.

583
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:16,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Ruining diets everywhere.

584
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:25,396
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've been good all day, but I think my headache is because I had so much sugar for two days and then dropped all of it, so I need a buffer.

585
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you're a good-looking gal.

586
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:27,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Just eat the taco.

587
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:29,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry about that stuff.

588
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:30,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

589
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,019
[SPEAKER_04]: The chatters.

590
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie needs some love.

591
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell her she has nice boobies or something.

592
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,782
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't because I figured I dropped 80, right?

593
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:40,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

594
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:42,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I gained back 15.

595
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:42,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

596
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to be going back to the gym and everything because I still have a little bit more to go.

597
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:50,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to lose some too.

598
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:51,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the gym with me.

599
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:52,184
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

600
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:52,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

601
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:54,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

602
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:57,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just did the most foul thing with his belly.

603
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:59,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That was disgusting.

604
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:03,068
[SPEAKER_04]: He like shook it.

605
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:03,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

606
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:04,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That was weird.

607
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

608
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:05,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry.

609
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:05,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag.

610
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:06,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

611
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Robert M., you're funny.

612
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, there was not.

613
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at chat.

614
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,570
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

615
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:13,851
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Jamie Love.

616
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:15,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

617
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you do this show, right, for your ego?

618
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not starving myself.

619
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:24,381
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not, but... I eat... No, no, no, no.

620
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:30,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what I wanted to tell you guys is that diabetes, there's a tendency toward it in my family.

621
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:35,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not a matter of aesthetics or anything like that.

622
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a matter of preventing disease on the way.

623
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, that taco's not going to give you diabetes.

624
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but I'm...

625
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike isn't on.

626
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Say the joke again.

627
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,680
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you something else that starts with a D. No, no.

628
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:58,103
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole reason being is that I'm cutting back on my sugars because my blood sugar actually was fairly borderline at my last blood test.

629
00:36:59,064 --> 00:37:00,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm trying to avoid diabetes.

630
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the reason why.

631
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:04,806
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

632
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:08,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to get on the tangent and get all depressing here on the program.

633
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:13,210
[SPEAKER_08]: That and exercise is supposed to actually help with chronic fatigue syndrome because I'm also trying to get myself off my meds.

634
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Just eat the fucking taco.

635
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:18,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I will after I'm done doing the fucking email.

636
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:19,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

637
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd eat it, but I don't like Mexican food, so, you know, this is kind of weird.

638
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:23,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Email!

639
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:24,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite my ass.

640
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, there was not a home release of Dragonflare on Laserdisc.

641
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:31,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

642
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:33,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the email?

643
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:36,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was from... You didn't even read the poor guy's email.

644
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:37,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You just yelled at it.

645
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in really bad grammar.

646
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.

647
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,007
[SPEAKER_08]: He said so himself.

648
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: He's Babblefish.

649
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:44,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

650
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:45,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Poisson de Babble.

651
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, next email.

652
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, DarkSakura, Loki, and Skye.

653
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:52,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait.

654
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:53,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Time out.

655
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:58,355
[SPEAKER_03]: GZDR4EV Dude, those boobs.

656
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,696
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those nipples is a fucking comma.

657
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:02,037
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you trying to say?

658
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,718
[SPEAKER_03]: One of her nipples is fucked up looking?

659
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

660
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Derail the whole show.

661
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

662
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that how that was about my boobs?

663
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: He was making asking nipples.

664
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:10,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

665
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you asked for an email in French, so you... Okay, whatever.

666
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,107
[SPEAKER_08]: JVmon drew my boobs bigger than yours.

667
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:40,267
[SPEAKER_08]: JVmon drew my boobs bigger than yours.

668
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You have special pumped up boobs.

669
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:13,916
[SPEAKER_04]: My nipples are the size of like dollars.

670
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Nights, um, I don't know.

671
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a Christmas game for me, I think.

672
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:20,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

673
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:22,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it has that kind of night Christmas.

674
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:23,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have Christmas nights?

675
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:24,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

676
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:26,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's more of a Christmas game for me.

677
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:26,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

678
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:28,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah.

679
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:29,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You think Knights could be around Christmas?

680
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they should release a Christmas Knights as well.

681
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

682
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:35,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know if I've told, well, I've mentioned this several times.

683
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:40,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas Knights is actually a tradition at my house.

684
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:43,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We break out the Saturn and we play Christmas Knights up until Christmas Day.

685
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:44,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

686
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,020
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the other part of the question?

687
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Games that should be redone or something?

688
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
[SPEAKER_08]: RPGs that should be re-released for the DS.

689
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs that should be re-released for the DS.

690
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:53,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Guardian Legends?

691
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe that wasn't an RPG.

692
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a game that I want.

693
00:39:58,796 --> 00:39:59,856
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an adventure shooter.

694
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:00,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Close enough.

695
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the Guardian Legend, love.

696
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So do I, oh my god.

697
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:07,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to stop whining.

698
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:10,901
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the Illusion of Gaia series?

699
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:14,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the whole Enix Soul Blazer, what was it?

700
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Blazer.

701
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:19,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, Shane, this is a good taco.

702
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:21,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And Illusion of Gaia, and there was a third one.

703
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:23,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Lord, that's the other one, Brain Lord.

704
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that whole series on DS.

705
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, next email.

706
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:27,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

707
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you had anyone that you wanted to seek him out?

708
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:31,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

709
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:33,462
[SPEAKER_07]: What RPG would you like to seek him out for the DS?

710
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:34,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco the RPG.

711
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:35,862
[SPEAKER_03]: For the DS?

712
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:38,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, remake, remake.

713
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario RPG!

714
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:42,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the fuck is my game?

715
00:40:44,204 --> 00:40:44,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Taco.

716
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:46,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

717
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:49,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Juranami says it was not Brain Lord, it was Terranigma.

718
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:50,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up.

719
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:52,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

720
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:57,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, with the Xbox 360 keyboard, do you think World of Warcraft will come to the 360?

721
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Why or why not?

722
00:40:59,141 --> 00:40:59,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no.

723
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:01,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't need to know why.

724
00:41:02,283 --> 00:41:02,723
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

725
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:04,083
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from Daniel.

726
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not.

727
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:13,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time the Vividi rep comes down to our work, we ask him that same question.

728
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,209
[SPEAKER_03]: When's World of Warcraft coming to the 360?

729
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time he says it's never coming to the 360.

730
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

731
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's happening either.

732
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:30,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Blizzard, if they're going to do something on the consoles, they will make a game specifically for consoles.

733
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're going to port their game.

734
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:33,557
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really need to.

735
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everybody has a computer.

736
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:38,000
[SPEAKER_04]: People that don't even play PC games play World of Warcraft.

737
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're only seeing games that are ported to that when they need more users.

738
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft is not really having any trouble with

739
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:48,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a large enough user base.

740
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard probably figures, if you have an Xbox 360, you also probably have a computer capable of playing World of Warcraft.

741
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and also, I mean, World of Warcraft runs on almost anything.

742
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:02,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as far as Linux, Mac OS, Windows.

743
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:07,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's not like it's a graphically intensive game.

744
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:09,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

745
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last email, oh my god, Rob, I'm so sorry.

746
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:13,939
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

747
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the chat?

748
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:18,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got unbanned from... I'm just ignoring the chat now.

749
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:21,210
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is from SakuraMax.

750
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:23,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got unbanned from Orange Lounge.

751
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:25,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember to plug that if you haven't.

752
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:27,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to say, screw you, Rob.

753
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:28,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is cooler than you.

754
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:28,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you.

755
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to respond to it.

756
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:36,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that the thing is, the signature is the funny part.

757
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopes Rob gets eaten by a Gru youngest OLR member.

758
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Wishes World of Warcraft would work on his computer.

759
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Pocky lover and Vietnamese otaku.

760
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:44,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah.

761
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:46,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

762
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:47,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

763
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob Hart.

764
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever.

765
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, is that all the emails?

766
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:51,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

767
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:52,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

768
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:58,104
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com How about some Rob fan mail next week?

769
00:42:58,644 --> 00:42:59,284
[SPEAKER_04]: After that email.

770
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:02,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some Rob fan mail that Jamie has to read word for word on the air.

771
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:04,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob fan mail in French.

772
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:07,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in Spanish or something.

773
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:10,088
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a language Jamie doesn't know that I know a little bit of?

774
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:10,769
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Spanish?

775
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Spanish love for me.

776
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,371
[SPEAKER_04]: No love for Loki ever.

777
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:16,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

778
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:17,253
What?

779
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:18,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to, yeah, that's right.

780
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to another story talking about Nintendo.

781
00:43:22,655 --> 00:43:26,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is following up a contest in some ways.

782
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:33,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft has recently said that they would like original TV pilots because something that they're going to distribute on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

783
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:39,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now Nintendo has come out and said they're going to be holding this contest called the Shortcut Shortcase.

784
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And the top three entries will be premiered at Rockefeller Center's annual Summer Film Showcase.

785
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Shortcase?

786
00:43:47,812 --> 00:43:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking of Shortcake.

787
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:49,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I must be hungry.

788
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:51,374
[SPEAKER_04]: The theme is Nintendo.

789
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:58,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The movies can be action, comedy, drama, whatever, as long as it has Nintendo hardware or Nintendo characters.

790
00:43:59,238 --> 00:43:59,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

791
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:08,903
[SPEAKER_04]: The first place winner gets $10,000 and a trip to New York for the premiere and a lunch meeting with the Tribeca Film Festival co-founder, Craig Hatkoff.

792
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: The top three entries all get Nintendo goodies.

793
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:14,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You have until June 6th to get it together.

794
00:44:15,046 --> 00:44:16,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's already a lot of Nintendo...

795
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,321
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already a lot of Nintendo fanboy stuff on YouTube, so this shouldn't be too hard for most people.

796
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:25,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So, get crackin' if you want to be a famous filmmaker.

797
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:27,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

798
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, so one person that's not going to be featured in an upcoming live-action Metal Gear Solid movie would unfortunately be the voice of Snake, David Hayter.

799
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:45,271
[SPEAKER_03]: He will not have anything to do with the movie Fangirls Cry.

800
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:46,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me sad.

801
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake right now, because man, the dude needs a haircut.

802
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:16,674
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like Joey Fatone.

803
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake was running around with a mullet.

804
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:24,777
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like he's about ready to join a Ren Faire.

805
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:26,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

806
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Snake was running around Metal Gear Solid 2 with a mullet.

807
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but he has guns and he's not a real special op guy, so... I don't know.

808
00:45:39,023 --> 00:45:39,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

809
00:45:41,184 --> 00:45:42,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of whatever...

810
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,469
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a next generation Wolfenstein in the works.

811
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:55,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're stating that it should be actually out in 2008.

812
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,494
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being put out by Raven.

813
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:02,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's happy.

814
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it be like the old school Wolfenstein 3D or the more meh Castle Wolfenstein game that came out later?

815
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that called?

816
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:08,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Return to Wolfenstein or whatever that game was?

817
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Return to Castle Wolfenstein?

818
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't care for that one.

819
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, Shane, this was the best taco.

820
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:21,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more like one of those, like, you know, War Sim games.

821
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:25,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I just liked being able to shoot up like Hitler in the War Mac.

822
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:27,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome in the old school 3D game.

823
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:27,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

824
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

825
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:32,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, oh boy.

826
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of things of a questionable nature, there was a Flash game created about the Virginia Tech Rampage.

827
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Flash game.

828
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: and this game was created by this guy, Ryan Lamborn.

829
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is interesting, is the response, basically, you know, he made a flash game that was basically, you know, it, you know, kind of glamorized the whole Virginia Tech shooting.

830
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:57,305
[SPEAKER_04]: You could, you know, take part in it, whatever.

831
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:59,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, this is very controversial.

832
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:03,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's interesting is what this author chose to do in response to it.

833
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, attention, angry people.

834
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:10,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take this game down from Newgrounds if the donation amount reaches $1,000 U.S.,

835
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it down from here if it reaches $2,000 US and I will apologize if it reaches $3,000 US.

836
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:23,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, he never really says what the donations will go to besides his pocket.

837
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Newgrounds ended up taking the damn thing down anyway.

838
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:32,192
[SPEAKER_04]: But kind of interesting that he kind of blackmailed the internet to take his game down.

839
00:47:32,212 --> 00:47:36,975
[SPEAKER_03]: He also said that he was joking about the whole, you know, wanting to collect money.

840
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:39,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, unfortunately, a lot of people didn't really take it that way.

841
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he did.

842
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:41,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, there was an update

843
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,907
[SPEAKER_04]: The donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game down.

844
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:49,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think anyone would donate money to it, and so far my PayPal account has proven me right.

845
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:51,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

846
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like an afterthought excuse, doesn't it?

847
00:47:54,051 --> 00:48:01,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's just probably thinking, well, maybe some dumb sucker will, you know... If it was a joke, he would have probably not put his PayPal account on there.

848
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:03,135
[SPEAKER_03]: What a weirdo.

849
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:04,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

850
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:09,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just some dumbass trying to get attention just like... I mean, I'm all for freedom of speech and all, but...

851
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:10,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

852
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:12,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a way, the media just shouldn't even cover it.

853
00:48:12,775 --> 00:48:13,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really what it should be.

854
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:18,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you don't want this guy to make any money off it, don't fucking cover it so people don't know about it.

855
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:19,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody would have found it otherwise.

856
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Media should take some responsibility.

857
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the gaming blogs and stuff.

858
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fucking cover it if it's in poor taste.

859
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't write about it.

860
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably shouldn't even... God, I'm being a hypocrite right now.

861
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:33,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably shouldn't have said anything about it, but it's... Well, it sounds like the game's already down.

862
00:48:33,603 --> 00:48:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm going off of, so whatever.

863
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:37,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And we come full circle...

864
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,812
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap has announced that they're doing an animated series called Revisioned.

865
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:45,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Each season is going to focus on a game series or game character.

866
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, the first series that's up is Tomb Raider, and it's also going to be animated by Warren Ellis, Peter Chung, and Jim Lee.

867
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:15,064
[SPEAKER_03]: To give you an idea, it's basically Animatrix, but for games.

868
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:20,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's yet another original thing that they're actually doing that's going to be pretty awesome.

869
00:49:20,886 --> 00:49:25,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see some DVDs for this, because that might be something worth checking out.

870
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:27,054
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

871
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I never even saw the movies, ever.

872
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:56,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, if you're interested in checking out to see what it's going to look like, they are going to have a little bit on the Tomb Raider GameTap collection website.

873
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:02,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tombraider.gametap.com You can check out a trailer for this new cartoon series.

874
00:50:04,015 --> 00:50:04,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

875
00:50:04,555 --> 00:50:07,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel in chat says, Animated series on GameTap.

876
00:50:07,357 --> 00:50:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

877
00:50:07,857 --> 00:50:09,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Captain N all over again.

878
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:14,181
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun says, I think Tomb Raider Legend was going to be sold cheap on GameTap, if not free.

879
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

880
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:45,177
[SPEAKER_04]: is a toll-free number, but only in the U.S.

00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:45,737
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada.

[SPEAKER_04]: So if you use the Skype line instead, you can be anywhere in the world and still call us for free.

883
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,080
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

884
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones, and we'll take this call right here.

885
00:50:57,342 --> 00:50:58,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

00:50:58,863 --> 00:50:59,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

887
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:02,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, am I kidding?

888
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:02,945
[SPEAKER_11]: It's DMN.

889
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:03,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, DMN.

890
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:04,666
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want?

891
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so glad.

892

[SPEAKER_04]: It's really you this week.

00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:07,667
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

894
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:10,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm glad, too.

895
00:51:10,528 --> 00:51:12,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm out of impersonations right now.

896
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:23,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, however, I'm calling on behalf of DJ Tyrant, um, to say one thing, and, um, if you'll excuse me, I'll put the phone away from my mouth, because I don't want everyone speaking to it, so, one second.

897
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:24,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

898
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:31,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we've gotten that out of the way.

899
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is, uh, DJ Tyrant so excited about StarCraft 2?

900
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:38,310
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Tyrant is OLR's resident Blizzard fanboy.

901
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I may actually watch the first ten seconds as opposed to the first five.

902
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:14,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I played StarCraft a little bit in my youth, you know, all those ten years ago.

903
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a huge fan of the real-time strategy genre.

904
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, that's my problem.

905
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:25,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really played StarCraft because I wasn't a fan of the real-time strategy series.

906
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:29,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, if this announcement, though, had been Diablo 3, I would have had a total fangasm.

907
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:32,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think you and I both would have.

908
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:37,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Diablo, but seeing as the announcement was happening in Korea, I think everyone did their math.

909
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:41,853
[SPEAKER_11]: 2 plus 2 equals 5 and all that stuff.

910
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:47,838
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm also calling to announce the Phoenix Down usage on SDFU.

911
00:52:47,978 --> 00:52:48,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what's this all about?

912
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:59,567
[SPEAKER_11]: We put our show on hiatus, one, because I've been going through a lot of personal turmoil, and now that's kind of subsided and I feel my crazy normal self.

913
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:02,512
[SPEAKER_11]: We're revamping the format of SPFU.

914
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:11,937
[SPEAKER_11]: For any people who were introduced to my antics in the chat room earlier last year, you know I used to do a little around the horn thing and I scored people's arguments.

915
00:53:11,977 --> 00:53:13,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now we're turning it into a show.

916
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:24,664
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Tyrant and three chatters from OLR's chat room will face each other off each week, and the winner gets to finish the show with me.

917
00:53:26,779 --> 00:53:29,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, wait, now I know you have a lot of special guests that come on.

918
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you've had some of the Destructoid bloggers on the program, and you've had bigger names on your program than we've had on this program.

919
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:38,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So, are you going to invite them to play along with you guys?

920
00:53:40,002 --> 00:53:40,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

921
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:42,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess you guys can come play, too.

922
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we get to come play DMN's little game, too?

923
00:53:45,763 --> 00:53:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: How nice.

924
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:46,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Aww.

925
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

926
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I don't want to play your game.

927
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:49,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

928
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll come on at some point, for sure.

929
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:52,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak for the others, but I will.

930
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:59,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't think of anything else, so I guess it's time to hang up on me

931
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:23,373
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with... What's... Wait, wait.

932
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you booing Pump It Up Pro for over here, Shane?

933
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:26,656
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.

934
00:54:27,436 --> 00:54:28,237
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

935
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:31,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I... Sorry, there's confusion in studio.

936
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Give Shane a mic.

937
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:33,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

938
00:54:34,156 --> 00:54:36,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, boo, Pump It Up Pro.

939
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:37,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Why boo Pump It Up Pro?

940
00:54:37,697 --> 00:54:42,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's by the guys that do In The Groove and the step charts suck from what I've seen.

941
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:43,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's that one.

942
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:47,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's got crap music and it's terrible.

943
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,059
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright though.

944
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:48,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.

945
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:51,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like In The Groove and Pump It Up having a love child.

946
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane, put it down for a minute.

947
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You're obviously biased.

948
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear Zago's opinion.

949
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

950
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I mean, I played it.

951
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it pretty much is step mania.

952
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:03,842
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like End of Mirror found step mania and found a good use for it

953
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:08,376
[SPEAKER_00]: and just mash Cowboy songs in addition to their banya and K-pop.

954
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:11,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So Pump It Up and In The Groove had sex and this is their baby.

955
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:15,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you pretty much have modifiers that you would normally find in Step Mania Mines.

956
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,422
[SPEAKER_00]: C400 speed.

957
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:27,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it plays pretty much better since it's on the breakout at the high-end cabinet for beta testing.

958
00:55:28,106 --> 00:55:30,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a nice high-def TV to go with it.

959
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:35,039
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was talking with Kyle on email like last month trying to get him on the show and we just lost time.

960
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:36,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to email him again and try to get him on the show.

961
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have him and Shane on the same show.

962
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,480
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good time.

963
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt he'll be able to spill the beans.

964
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:41,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

965
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,821
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pretty tight-lipped.

966
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll still be fun.

967
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so what else have you been up to in your gaming world lately?

968
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:57,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as I said, not only does Aiden on the breakout pump it up for beta testing, but New Jersey also has 2DX Distorted and Poppin' Music 14.

969
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:00,746
[SPEAKER_04]: How is Poppin' Music 14?

970
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus Christ, they keep cranking those things out.

971
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:08,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're catching up to TGA at this point.

972
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:12,032
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing?

973
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Opening a candy bar?

974
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:15,954
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just an oatmeal bar.

975
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:17,635
[SPEAKER_04]: How is Poppin' Music 14?

976
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,037
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot better, though.

977
00:56:21,137 --> 00:56:26,180
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot better than the one that I'm used to over in Queens, the Poppin' 8 that I go to.

978
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a case of the Munchies right now?

979
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:30,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost, I'm not high though.

980
00:56:30,644 --> 00:56:31,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a little hungry tonight.

981
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:40,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, besides that, just, you know, I just heard, you know, just, you know, pretty up over the whole StarCraft 2 thing.

982
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:42,387
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard about that.

983
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about StarCraft 2?

984
00:56:43,787 --> 00:56:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a big RTS fan?

985
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:52,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been, yeah, it's been almost a decade since they actually, you know, it was actually released, the first one, so I've been itching to play it.

986
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:57,650
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that'll bother me is if Koreans, you know, the South Koreans start cheating on it.

987
00:56:58,177 --> 00:57:00,158
[SPEAKER_00]: and start, you know, bringing it down and battling it.

988
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Korea, no cheating.

989
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:10,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the only thing I worry about, but if anything, we'll just keep it to a land, you know, we'll just keep it to strictly land games.

990
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:10,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

991
00:57:10,824 --> 00:57:12,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something you can do after work.

992
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:16,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I still wish it had been Diablo 3, though, but hey, I'll give it a try.

993
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:18,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard puts out some quality shit.

994
00:57:18,808 --> 00:57:21,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, what has Blizzard done wrong?

995
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really, I can't think of a lot.

996
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:26,112
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing they need is World of Starcraft and that's it.

997
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:27,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

998
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:29,697
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

999
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Saku, we've got to let you go.

1000
00:57:32,018 --> 00:57:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But have another oatmeal bar for me, buddy.

1001
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:34,758
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1002
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:35,158
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1003
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:36,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1004
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:38,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just say whatever to me?

1005
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you did.

1006
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

1007
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:45,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1008
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1009
00:57:47,241 --> 00:57:48,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Raven Stolfen.

1010
00:57:48,141 --> 00:57:49,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Raven Stolfen.

1011
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1012
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:54,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me turn down the thing, and I'll tell you.

1013
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, rule number one of radio, turn down the speakers when you're going to be on the program.

1014
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get that annoying ass echo.

1015
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, boys and girls.

1016
00:58:03,865 --> 00:58:04,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry about that.

1017
00:58:05,326 --> 00:58:11,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that you played that old To Go song from OLR, from OLR To Go, and the music break that no one knows about.

1018
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:14,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, the podcast listeners have no idea what you're talking about.

1019
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:19,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we played during the break, because we do a break between A and B, we play some music.

1020
00:58:19,156 --> 00:58:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play a clip.

1021
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:22,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing clips of music is okay on podcasts.

1022
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:24,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a little clip of Gradius Full Speed.

1023
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,241
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our old theme song.

1024
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:36,492
[SPEAKER_04]: How was our old team music back in the day when we were doing a live show and a separate podcast?

1025
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:37,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good times.

1026
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:39,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that good times when we'd be in the studio for like five hours?

1027
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:40,334
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1028
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:42,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

1029
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:44,817
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you want to say about the song?

1030
00:58:46,779 --> 00:58:51,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It just brings back good memories of listening to you go like, Oh, it's the last radio to go, week of whatever.

1031
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, Oh, it's the last radio.

1032
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,045
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the really good memories.

1033
00:58:56,765 --> 00:58:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a retro thing for you.

1034
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:01,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I didn't just call about that.

1035
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:03,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I did call about Fear in Halo 3 Beta.

1036
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:04,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, what about that?

1037
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:12,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've been playing a lot of FPSs in Xbox, and I played Fear for the Xbox.

1038
00:59:12,408 --> 00:59:13,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it from Gamefly.

1039
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:14,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1040
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:15,669
[SPEAKER_10]: How was that?

1041
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:16,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the game was good.

1042
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:20,791
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing I hate is about the corridors, and everything looks the same when you walk.

1043
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:22,271
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing I hate.

1044
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:26,432
[SPEAKER_10]: You always, like, have an hour of looking at it, and then you finally figure it out.

1045
00:59:26,492 --> 00:59:27,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I hate about it.

1046
00:59:28,113 --> 00:59:28,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1047
00:59:35,558 --> 00:59:37,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that Halo 3 will outsell Halo 2?

1048
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:40,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, I do.

1049
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it has my favorite gun, the assault rifle.

1050
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because of the assault rifle?

1051
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:49,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just because of the assault rifle.

1052
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:54,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's been bitching about it on the forums going, we need the assault rifle, we need the assault rifle.

1053
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:55,663
[SPEAKER_10]: The battle rifle sucks.

1054
00:59:57,123 --> 00:59:57,403
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1055
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other quick words here before we get to another call?

1056
01:00:01,717 --> 01:00:03,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech and Game Podcast, that's it.

1057
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:03,498
Bye.

1058
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:04,278
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1059
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:09,061
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want more of the Raven's Dolphin, he has his own podcast, Tech and Games.

1060
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:09,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

1061
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:11,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he has an OLR community page, too.

1062
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,863
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I dug up something out of the archive.

1063
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what Raven was referring to.

1064
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:19,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 11, 2005.

1065
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,901
[SPEAKER_05]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

1066
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:27,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good times.

1067
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Old school memories.

1068
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:28,883
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1069
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:33,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't miss the five-hour studio marathons?

1070
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:34,465
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Rob.

1071
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:38,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would go home literally sick with exhaustion.

1072
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:39,027
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1073
01:00:39,507 --> 01:00:41,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you glad we're much shorter now?

1074
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:42,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1075
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:42,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1076
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,089
[SPEAKER_04]: We picked up another call.

1077
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1078
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:44,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1079
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's Dr. Burst.

1080
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dr. Burst.

1081
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not recognize your name as a caller.

1082
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:51,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a new caller?

1083
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:51,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1084
01:00:52,475 --> 01:00:52,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1085
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:53,916
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1086
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: New caller?

1087
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:58,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I want to comment on the World of Warcraft on 360.

1088
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:01,638
[SPEAKER_04]: World of Warcraft on 360, a very popular topic.

1089
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,378
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say about it?

1090
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:05,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I just think, why not?

1091
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:11,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, people want the game, and Blizzard makes more money.

1092
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:12,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1093
01:01:13,602 --> 01:01:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But do they make more money?

1094
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:21,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, again, what about the argument earlier about most people that have an Xbox 360 probably have a computer, be it PC or Mac,

1095
01:01:21,826 --> 01:01:23,467
[SPEAKER_04]: It's capable of playing World of Warcraft.

1096
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:32,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have a computer, and I tried the demo for World of Warcraft, and it doesn't work that well.

1097
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1098
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:34,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

1099
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's something to be said for the achievement point whores of the world, Loki, that might have fun just playing the game to get achievements from it.

1100
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:42,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1101
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:43,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1102
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:44,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1103
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else in the room care to comment?

1104
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:46,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not WoW on the 360?

1105
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:48,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd actually be for it.

1106
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:52,195
[SPEAKER_09]: because, like, it's kind of the same thing they did with Final Fantasy XI.

1107
01:01:52,615 --> 01:02:06,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it on the 360 because my computer, you know, it could run it well enough, but the 360, it's got a set, you know, spec for it, so they're putting it on a system knowing that everybody's going to have the same amount of... It's, like, optimized for 360.

1108
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's optimized for that.

1109
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:07,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1110
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, if they did that with World of Warcraft, give me a keyboard and mouse, I like my TV better than I like my computer monitor, so I would do it.

1111
01:02:15,991 --> 01:02:21,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And voice chat built in right there too because you could just do your own little private room with your friend.

1112
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:26,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumor is, rumor is that PC version is getting a voice chat patch, but that's a rumor.

1113
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:33,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the thing is too, you probably couldn't do mods on World of Warcraft or 360.

1114
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:34,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1115
01:02:34,336 --> 01:02:34,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's true.

1116
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:35,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good point.

1117
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:39,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, you know, one thing that PC gamers on their World of Warcraft love are all the mods.

1118
01:02:40,387 --> 01:02:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Spam Sentry I tried it on a demo

1119
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:05,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a Guild Wars player.

1120
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:12,923
[SPEAKER_09]: The demo that you downloaded is leading other websites that sell gold to download those demos and spam us.

1121
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:14,264
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you're a Guild Wars player.

1122
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:15,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not Guild Wars on the 360?

1123
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:17,406
[SPEAKER_13]: That too.

1124
01:03:17,446 --> 01:03:24,211
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that because it's instance-based and there's so many load screens, it probably wouldn't work that well.

1125
01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:28,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, WoW has a lot of instances too, especially when you get into Endgame.

1126
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:29,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1127
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I think about Final Fantasy XI.

1128
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI had freaking loading screens every time you went to a new area.

1129
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:37,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the reasons I like WoW is that it's very seamless.

1130
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You only really do loading screens when you go into instances or new continent or when you go to the other continent.

1131
01:03:43,477 --> 01:03:44,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I don't know.

1132
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:46,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, tell us a little more.

1133
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:47,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't often get new callers.

1134
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:50,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Dr. Burst, what types of games have you been playing this week?

1135
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:52,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much Guild Wars.

1136
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:53,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Guild Wars?

1137
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:53,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1138
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:55,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting back on Guild Wars.

1139
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:57,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1140
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,940
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys should be looking for a guild.

1141
01:03:59,520 --> 01:03:59,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got one.

1142
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:03,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I had one like five seconds after I made my account.

1143
01:04:03,888 --> 01:04:04,849
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really a best class.

1144
01:04:22,774 --> 01:04:24,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I made the Doctor as a Mesmer.

1145
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:55,493
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my dream.

1146
01:04:55,693 --> 01:05:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing about Guild Wars is that every job, sub-job combination kind of makes sense.

1147
01:05:00,757 --> 01:05:02,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they kind of built it a little smarter in that regard.

1148
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So, props to Guild Wars for that.

1149
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, even the most hated class, Warrior Monk, still works.

1150
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:10,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1151
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:12,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think I played a Warrior Monk.

1152
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:14,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was like Ghetto Paladin.

1153
01:05:15,948 --> 01:05:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Dr. Burst, thanks so much for the call and have fun in Guild Wars.

1154
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you see Jamie, you know, nuke her for me.

1155
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till I'm at least a comparable level.

1156
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:26,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm five right now.

1157
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:27,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep working.

1158
01:05:27,944 --> 01:05:28,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Dr. Burris.

1159
01:05:28,544 --> 01:05:28,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1160
01:05:29,945 --> 01:05:30,225
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1161
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:31,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I love new callers.

1162
01:05:31,185 --> 01:05:31,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you love new callers?

1163
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:33,407
[SPEAKER_07]: For dinner.

1164
01:05:34,627 --> 01:05:40,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I mind the old callers because I like the old callers too, but it's nice to get some new blood in once in a while.

1165
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:40,691
[SPEAKER_12]: For dinner.

1166
01:05:40,831 --> 01:05:41,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1167
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:42,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1168
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's Kane.

1169
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:47,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Kane, what's on your mind?

1170
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear myself a little bit, so just make sure you turn down your speakers.

1171
01:05:50,615 --> 01:05:51,975
[SPEAKER_08]: We hear Rob all the time.

1172
01:05:52,055 --> 01:05:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's too much of me.

1173
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,897
[SPEAKER_09]: We should turn down our speakers.

1174
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:55,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1175
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll just... I'm turning down my ears.

1176
01:05:57,298 --> 01:05:57,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.

1177
01:05:57,799 --> 01:05:58,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you all.

1178
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be quiet for this entire phone call.

1179
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to pee anyway.

1180
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys talk to the caller.

1181
01:06:02,341 --> 01:06:03,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, caller.

1182
01:06:03,162 --> 01:06:03,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is this again?

1183
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:06,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's too much of me.

1184
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:07,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, come here and fix it.

1185
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:10,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1186
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now we can hear you.

1187
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:13,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to talk about the whole...

1188
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:28,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it would probably be better for most users, but honestly, who wants to pay that extra money just because you have to pay for the subscription and Xbox Live?

1189
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:31,298
[SPEAKER_08]: People do it for PSU.

1190
01:06:32,178 --> 01:06:33,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're idiots because PSU sucks.

1191
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:34,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it does.

1192
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:38,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I played that game for like two days and canceled it.

1193
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:40,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a Phantasy Star fanboy.

1194
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:41,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave that alone.

1195
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:42,776
[SPEAKER_09]: PSO was great.

1196
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:43,737
[SPEAKER_09]: PSU was terrible.

1197
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:45,017
[SPEAKER_08]: PSO was awesome.

1198
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:46,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Blue Burst, though.

1199
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:51,960
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're worried about paying an extra fee to play on Xbox Live, do it the smart way and pay for a year.

1200
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you're not going to really worry about it anymore.

1201
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:58,603
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to be thinking, oh, I'm paying this on top of my Xbox Live fee.

1202
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:00,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It really works out nice.

1203
01:07:01,544 --> 01:07:03,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, you've got the Xbox Live anyway, right?

1204
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Who, me?

1205
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:05,285
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1206
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:06,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, if you're...

1207
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:12,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't... Well, if you've got the silver... You got silver, and they made Final Fantasy XI, if I remember right.

1208
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,833
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have silver, you could play it online.

1209
01:07:15,133 --> 01:07:16,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Why couldn't they do that with WoW also?

1210
01:07:18,816 --> 01:07:19,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Owned.

1211
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:19,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

1212
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:20,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they will.

1213
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:27,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at any rate, I don't think that it's that good of an idea, because... I mean...

1214
01:07:28,362 --> 01:07:33,404
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft already is... They don't even have any type of controller support on it for PC.

1215
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:37,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that it would be very interesting to see how they'd map something like that over.

1216
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:42,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're probably going to really, really screw up on it when they do.

1217
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:45,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to hold my breath on it.

1218
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:48,088
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know until it happens.

1219
01:07:48,988 --> 01:07:49,549
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

1220
01:07:51,629 --> 01:07:54,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rob spent the entire time not in this room.

1221
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.

1222
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing like...

1223
01:07:58,321 --> 01:07:59,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here now!

1224
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:02,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to break Rob's head.

1225
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:04,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob and Loki yell.

1226
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1227
01:08:08,946 --> 01:08:10,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Did this guy just threaten to break my head?

1228
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:11,848
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1229
01:08:11,928 --> 01:08:12,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I will break you.

1230
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't break my head.

1231
01:08:15,649 --> 01:08:16,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nice.

1232
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:17,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1233
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:19,711
[SPEAKER_04]: For that, you get hung up on.

1234
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:21,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

1235
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:22,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1236
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1237
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:25,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1238
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:28,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is Chainsaw Juggling.

1239
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Chainsaw, what's, uh, wait, what is his name?

1240
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Chainsaw Juggling.

1241
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:40,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just wanted to say I have the new issue of games for Windows, and they have it confirmed that voice chat is coming.

1242
01:08:41,427 --> 01:08:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Voice chat is coming.

1243
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God we don't have to buy a vent now, because our guild was seriously thinking about getting a vent.

1244
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:51,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And, dear God, I can hear myself echoing.

1245
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I really that loud?

1246
01:08:52,854 --> 01:08:53,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Rob, you are.

1247
01:08:54,594 --> 01:08:55,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, because you have the speakers up right now.

1248
01:08:56,055 --> 01:08:56,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe that's why.

1249
01:08:56,775 --> 01:08:57,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll back up a little bit.

1250
01:08:58,656 --> 01:08:59,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh, that's cool.

1251
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So they confirmed that for the next patch.

1252
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:00,957
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1253
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:02,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So did they say about how long?

1254
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:06,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's saying it's coming after the next patch.

1255
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:16,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also that what they're going to try and do is make it so that the person's talking their name lights up and you can click on it and then heal that person or trade with them.

1256
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:17,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh, that's kind of cool.

1257
01:09:17,924 --> 01:09:18,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, so is it...

1258
01:09:20,638 --> 01:09:23,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, it's going to be voice chat even not in parties?

1259
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in the Barrens, everybody could have voice chat?

1260
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:26,642
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be horrible.

1261
01:09:27,723 --> 01:09:29,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's supposed to be more than a party.

1262
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't want to be walking through the Barrens and then suddenly some asshole comes on with a Chuck Norris joke on the speakers.

1263
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:37,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That would kind of ruin the game.

1264
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:40,111
[SPEAKER_11]: That would probably be one of the worst things ever.

1265
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:41,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It would make it better.

1266
01:09:42,392 --> 01:09:43,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki says it would make it better.

1267
01:09:44,033 --> 01:09:44,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1268
01:09:45,574 --> 01:09:47,636
[SPEAKER_04]: ChainsawJuggling, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1269
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:49,637
[SPEAKER_11]: They're adding guild names.

1270
01:09:51,664 --> 01:09:52,325
[SPEAKER_04]: They're adding what?

1271
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:54,205
[SPEAKER_04]: A guild bank.

1272
01:09:54,866 --> 01:09:55,746
[SPEAKER_04]: A guild bank.

1273
01:09:55,846 --> 01:09:56,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

1274
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the entire guild can share one bank?

1275
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:04,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and it's supposed to be set up so certain members can only access certain items within the bank.

1276
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:07,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool because some people are doing that already, right?

1277
01:10:07,991 --> 01:10:10,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they'll set up a dummy character that the guild members can log into.

1278
01:10:10,553 --> 01:10:13,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to let nobody have access to our stuff but me.

1279
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a jerk.

1280
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:15,595
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1281
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, come join our guild if you're a WoW player.

1282
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more people.

1283
01:10:19,505 --> 01:10:20,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've got to start over again.

1284
01:10:21,005 --> 01:10:23,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a lot of time, but I'll do it.

1285
01:10:23,926 --> 01:10:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1286
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes like an hour to get to 10.

1287
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:25,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1288
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:27,647
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a casual guild.

1289
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want a lot of time from you.

1290
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:29,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We just tell dick and fart jokes.

1291
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:30,668
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we don't.

1292
01:10:31,968 --> 01:10:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me about a year and a half to get 40.

1293
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:35,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, snap.

1294
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:37,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's a player like me.

1295
01:10:37,429 --> 01:10:37,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1296
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:38,770
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a player like me.

1297
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:39,490
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still cool.

1298
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:39,970
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1299
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still come join us.

1300
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:41,550
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1301
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for calling Chase on Juggling, and we'll hopefully have you in the WoW guild at some point.

1302
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,730
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, see you guys.

1303
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

1304
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:50,731
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, see you.

1305
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:51,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you too.

1306
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of noobs tonight.

1307
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:55,873
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an interesting change here.

1308
01:10:56,613 --> 01:10:57,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one more call.

1309
01:10:57,814 --> 01:10:58,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1310
01:10:58,854 --> 01:10:59,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1311
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:00,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it's Ranma.

1312
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:01,635
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everyone?

1313
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Ranma.

1314
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1315
01:11:03,556 --> 01:11:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1316
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:04,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you all ready?

1317
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:06,097
[SPEAKER_04]: For Fonamay?

1318
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:07,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

1319
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:08,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually very excited.

1320
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:09,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited, DarkSakura?

1321
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:17,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I am, but I have to find a sewing machine to put my... I'm not... I actually got the skirt for my Jessica costume.

1322
01:11:18,558 --> 01:11:23,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But it might not happen, so I'm going to focus on the ninja costume and do that one.

1323
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:25,821
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.

1324
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:31,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if I knew enough people on the West Coast, I bet you a dollar one of them would be bringing their sewing machine to the con.

1325
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:33,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1326
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you probably have that anyway.

1327
01:11:35,005 --> 01:11:39,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the only problem being is that I actually need the red ponytail wig, and I cannot find one.

1328
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:45,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have, though, a long red wig that I'm thinking about just sort of pulling back into a ponytail and faking it.

1329
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:47,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Cosplay!

1330
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:47,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Cosplay!

1331
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:16,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we still down for Part A?

1332
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:42,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I bring my Patron from my last year's birthday?

1333
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1334
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:08,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been drinking some of it, but I can't drink all that tequila by myself.

1335
01:13:08,745 --> 01:13:09,946
[SPEAKER_08]: You know me and tequila.

1336
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:10,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You know me and tequila.

1337
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:12,868
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get along, so you'll be drinking it by yourself.

1338
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Even good tequila makes me go crazy.

1339
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:16,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a bottle of Malibu.

1340
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:16,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We're good.

1341
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, let's put in some money for some Grey Goose.

1342
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:18,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1343
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:20,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got five on that.

1344
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1345
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Rama, anything else besides liquor chat?

1346
01:13:25,215 --> 01:13:26,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Just about anything.

1347
01:13:26,816 --> 01:13:27,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1348
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,398
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week, Rama.

1349
01:13:29,918 --> 01:13:30,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Next week?

1350
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:31,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see you Friday.

1351
01:13:31,299 --> 01:13:31,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, that's right.

1352
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: See you Friday.

1353
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:32,980
[SPEAKER_04]: See you Friday.

1354
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:34,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah, later!

1355
01:13:59,278 --> 01:13:59,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be 12.

1356
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:01,800
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be 30-12?

1357
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to be 30-12.

1358
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:04,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be 24.

1359
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:05,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's terrible.

1360
01:14:05,823 --> 01:14:06,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm actually going to go 22.

1361
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:08,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go down a year.

1362
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:10,086
[SPEAKER_09]: At least this year.

1363
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:12,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe next year I'll go back up to 23.

1364
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:13,909
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I don't have any plans yet.

1365
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:21,895
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the hopes that I come up with something better than going to the anime, I'm going to ditch it.

1366
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:24,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I didn't have fun last year, really.

1367
01:14:24,477 --> 01:14:26,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not my thing.

1368
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:27,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to buy stuff.

1369
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:28,980
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

1370
01:14:51,005 --> 01:14:53,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Jahi, he's one of my favorite people ever.

1371
01:14:53,786 --> 01:15:00,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wendell, didn't he completely swear off Tequila because of this?

1372
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:08,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to embarrass him over the air, especially since I don't know if he's listening or not, but oh my god, I heard the story.

1373
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It was monumental.

1374
01:15:12,185 --> 01:15:14,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited to drink with all my friends.

1375
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seriously, during one part of the program, we just gave Jahi the mic.

1376
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:49,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And for like an hour, he just spouted off these random insane babblings.

1377
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:52,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredible, riveting radio.

1378
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we really probably should wrap up the show now, huh?

1379
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now we're starting to talk about stuff that... Yeah.

1380
01:15:57,824 --> 01:15:59,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all these personal stories.

1381
01:15:59,025 --> 01:15:59,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Afterbirth FTW.

1382
01:16:00,165 --> 01:16:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1383
01:16:00,946 --> 01:16:01,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, we're going to wrap it up.

1384
01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:04,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So any last minute stories in studio, folks?

1385
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:08,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I like beer.

1386
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a level 11 wizard on Puzzle Quest, because it's really awesome.

1387
01:16:13,345 --> 01:16:14,045
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're not a nerd at all.

1388
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:17,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I just like playing the duels.

1389
01:16:17,349 --> 01:16:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what the fuck is that you're playing?

1390
01:16:22,354 --> 01:16:24,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing Stick Remover.

1391
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:25,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds exciting.

1392
01:16:25,737 --> 01:16:28,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the Duffy blog, the same one that had the cat golf thing.

1393
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:28,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1394
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:29,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1395
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:31,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last minute stories, Loki?

1396
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:32,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1397
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:35,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's a few things.

1398
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:36,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get free game.

1399
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:39,792
[SPEAKER_03]: They just posted something on Kotaku about it called Echoes.

1400
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:43,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks kind of like Geometry Wars and Asteroids, so that's pretty cool.

1401
01:16:43,414 --> 01:16:44,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

1402
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:49,900
[SPEAKER_03]: King of Fighters is being made into a live-action movie.

1403
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear God, no.

1404
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:56,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being directed by Gordon Chan, a guy from Hong Kong who... Okay, then maybe it'll be cool.

1405
01:16:57,005 --> 01:17:02,590
[SPEAKER_03]: ...spawned other Asian martial arts flicks like The Medallion, starring Jackie Chan, Fists of Fury, starring Jet Li...

1406
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

1407
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:07,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then I have a little bit of hope.

1408
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:24,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it looks like Axis Entertainment's Joseph Cho, Appleseed, Ex Machina, and Convergence Entertainment's Tim Kwok of Wicked City, I guess, will handle the production.

1409
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:28,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like it'll be out in Asia early 2008.

1410
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also one game that's going to be coming out as well for 2008.

1411
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:37,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning Eleven 2008.

1412
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:44,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And Konami, apparently, this is coming from Game Wave, a print magazine in Germany.

1413
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:50,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to have, it says it will be released on multiple platforms, even on the PlayStation 3.

1414
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:55,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Improved defense, more realistic and changed dribbling animations.

1415
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:58,259
[SPEAKER_03]: One-on-one tackles and offside traps will have better results.

1416
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:04,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Better online service, no lag, and full HD support with 18GB storage.

1417
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:07,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you could dump the game onto the hard drive.

1418
01:18:09,295 --> 01:18:09,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1419
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:16,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like that's pretty much it.

1420
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Microsoft is asking gamers for Xbox Live Arcade game ideas.

1421
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:24,205
[SPEAKER_04]: LaserCat's the game.

1422
01:18:24,245 --> 01:18:25,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm so going to suggest that.

1423
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:33,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I demand, no, I demand the OL Army to mobilize to this thread and request LaserCats the games.

1424
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:34,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is this at?

1425
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:35,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that on the Gamerscore blog?

1426
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:36,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it?

1427
01:18:36,364 --> 01:18:37,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember where it was.

1428
01:18:37,324 --> 01:18:40,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Activision wants your input for the next Spider-Man game.

1429
01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:42,947
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Don't Suck?

1430
01:18:43,587 --> 01:18:44,767
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Don't Make Another One?

1431
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1432
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:50,910
[SPEAKER_04]: How about be able to set Kirsten Dunst on fire?

1433
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,491
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be great!

1434
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Kill Gwen Stacy the game.

1435
01:18:57,553 --> 01:18:59,574
[SPEAKER_08]: with special supplement KillMJ.

1436
01:19:00,655 --> 01:19:03,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the evening.

1437
01:19:03,456 --> 01:19:05,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, since you have the mic right now, your final thought.

1438
01:19:06,918 --> 01:19:11,181
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I want to play more Earth Defense Force.

1439
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:16,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, thanks for piping in for the last part of the show here.

1440
01:19:16,864 --> 01:19:20,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though you've been playing Puzzle Quest the whole time, we will still give you an opportunity.

1441
01:19:20,305 --> 01:19:22,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I talked while you were in the bathroom.

1442
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:22,587
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine.

1443
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:23,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Give your final thought.

1444
01:19:24,565 --> 01:19:28,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like that YouTube video of the little kid getting kicked in the face by the breakdancer.

1445
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:30,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've been watching it a whole lot.

1446
01:19:30,789 --> 01:19:32,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times, good times.

1447
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have no heart.

1448
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:38,954
[SPEAKER_04]: On some really wrong LiveJournal community, I won't mention that I watch once in a while, there was a picture of...

1449
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:41,908
[SPEAKER_04]: That, and it just said, Babality.

1450
01:19:42,388 --> 01:19:45,189
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid, because it didn't turn somebody into a baby.

1451
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:45,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It was funny.

1452
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:46,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Kick the baby in the head.

1453
01:19:46,589 --> 01:19:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.

1454
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a Street Fighter one, too, where they made it look like he did a little flash kick, and it said Guile.

1455
01:19:53,152 --> 01:19:55,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show it to you, maybe during the afterbirth.

1456
01:19:56,893 --> 01:20:02,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, real quick, I was going to say, there was a funny thing that, this is on HMV, I guess, they're going to be doing,

1457
01:20:03,491 --> 01:20:08,333
[SPEAKER_03]: They're advertising their Manhunt 2 since it's coming out later this summer.

1458
01:20:08,853 --> 01:20:14,436
[SPEAKER_03]: They're adding in that little sticker on it that says, Jack Thompson becomes angry, but then again, he's always.

1459
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:16,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it has the date.

1460
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:30,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It just occurred something to me that I think part of the reason why, even though it's just to get his face all over everything, I think that lawyers are required to do a certain number of hours of things that are

1461
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:32,498
[SPEAKER_08]: for the public good.

1462
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,158
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1463
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1464
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:39,021
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly it.

1465
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:43,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that might be his consideration.

1466
01:20:44,525 --> 01:20:47,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's still a twat.

1467
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:48,027
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.

1468
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:52,009
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got like a yeast infection or something.

1469
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:53,250
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1470
01:20:55,611 --> 01:20:56,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay me.

1471
01:20:57,952 --> 01:21:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is reject false icons and

1472
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,211
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura never says it anymore.

1473
01:21:03,952 --> 01:21:05,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And why don't you ever say that anymore?

1474
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:06,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me a little sad.

1475
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Reject false icons, Rob.

1476
01:21:08,215 --> 01:21:08,736
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1477
01:21:09,216 --> 01:21:12,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And my other final thought would be Balthier.

1478
01:21:15,861 --> 01:21:16,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great week.

1479
01:21:16,382 --> 01:21:18,824
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time on Orange Launch Radio.

1480
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:21,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, thank you, as always, for supporting independent podcasts.

1482

[SPEAKER_04]: or leave us a kind review on iTunes or Yahoo Podcast or one of those awesome little sites there.

[SPEAKER_04]: The Pimp Podcast for a living.

1485
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:40,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Word of mouth is how our show succeeds and makes us stand out amongst the 50 billion choices that exist out there for gaming podcasts.

1486
