3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this May 20th, 2007 with part B of episode number 232, if you can believe it, of our podcast.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, we've been doing this that long.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Anyhow, we talked a lot about some various Sony news in part A.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We talked a lot about some of the new games coming out from their press event.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How Warhawk is actually going to be on Blu-ray now and SOCOM and the Heavenly Sword multiplayer and so on and so on.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So this segment we're going to talk a little more about some of the other consoles.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And, of course, we need to start with the Xbox because huge news this week with Halo 3, of course, finally getting its beta.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A little bit delayed. I mean, what, about 13 hours before the folks on Crackdown could get in there.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Although Bungie said, okay, because, you know, we made a boo-boo in getting you guys in when we said we would.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're going to extend the beta for four days. Hooray.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And you shouldn't bitch about things that are free anyway.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, the beta was followed up immediately with the news that when Halo 3 is going to come out in fall 2007, they mean September 25th, 2007.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And for those of you guys in Europe that feel like you always get screwed, you have to wait one day, September 26th, for you guys in Europe.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So you guys finally not having to wait as long.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So September 2007, which I...

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
May I point out that September 26th will be occurring at the same time as September 25th here.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ah, so it really...

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's an eight-hour time difference.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, that's right. Good point.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
At least between here and London time.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right. So basically it's a simultaneous release.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Not what? It's an eight-hour difference.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As close as you can get to it, we should say.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So that's pretty rad for them.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't worry about Japan yet, but don't know.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They can wait.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They're probably not as anxious about Halo 3, although, you know, if they can sell some copies of it there, why not?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Loki, you've mentioned September before on this show, haven't you?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, and there was a blog post, which I took away during that whole, you know...

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, when people were threatening to beat you up.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Take you out of the parking lot and beat you up if you keep stealing.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was off by 13 days, but I was close.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's probably closer than most people, though. Good job, though.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right, so there it is.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Get your pre-orders in now. September 25th is the day.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you want Halo 3...

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Especially get those pre-orders in if you're looking for the Legendary Edition, because it's going to be fucking impossible to find.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Just so you know.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, yeah, immediately once the Halo 3 beta came out, people started...

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know, the modders out there were already taking notice and trying to grab any sort of information that they possibly can.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Of course, no actual word on what exactly that meant, but apparently they're looking at the code in the beta to see how they can exploit the game when it comes out.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not surprising.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What exactly are they doing to it?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not really sure.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I guess they're trying to rip code out of the...

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know, basically taking the demo or beta that's on your hard drive and just trying to dissect it.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, are they these typical type of multiplayer exploits where they're trying to make themselves invincible so they can go in there and just blow people up and know when to shoot them?

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, lag stuff. I don't know.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't think they're really going to be able to do much because it's a beta.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And I don't think anyone can really decrypt the games anyways, so that would be interesting.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, there is actually a little bit more in regards to the news.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We were talking about the accounts on Xbox Live a week or so ago.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just another update for the same thing is that they are actually banning modified consoles from Live.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, in other words, the folks that are trying to fuck with their systems to do this beta by hack storing their consoles, they're getting the ban hammer.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Pretty much.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Smacking it down.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now, they have this little text, right, because I remember Major Nelson, I was reading his blog earlier this week, had a post of the actual little picture that would come up if you are a recipient of the ban hammer.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was interesting because it read to me like it was saying, don't call us, there's nothing you can do, you've been banned, F you, bye, is basically what it said.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I was kind of like, what if you get banned accidentally?

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I mean, you'd be screwed because Microsoft basically says, screw you.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I would be, if this ever happened to me and I didn't actually mod my console or whatever, I would be livid.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure this can't be 100% foolproof.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I would think, though, that in most, that they're counting on there being such a minority of people that that happens to, because honestly, if you haven't put anything in your system that doesn't belong there, never opened the case to do anything to it, what are the chances going to be that there's going to be some sort of flaw that comes up saying that you've modified your system?

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Interesting.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
MysticGohan in chat is talking about what's happened.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
MysticGohan says, they unlocked the locked content.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They found out that there's a vehicle called the chopper in it.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And Bandit says, there's a ban cannon.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Not a ban hammer, but a ban cannon.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ban cannon.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Instead of a man cannon, a ban cannon.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Remember the man cannon?

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have yet to see one of those in the beta, the man cannon.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you think this is an appropriate response to the hackers?

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sure.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I understand it, but I hope they're damn right every time.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think there ought to be some type of way to appeal just in case, because if this ever happens to somebody who runs a podcast or a blog, it's going to be a PR nightmare for Microsoft.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's just my opinion.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Anyhow.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't really think they care.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess not, but still.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If they ban the wrong person, it's going to be trouble.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Anyhow.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You heard the fuss I made when I got the red rings.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I hope they don't accidentally ban me.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have to quit raw steel in here.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hackers deserve to have their consoles bricked.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I agree.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But again, as long as they are 100% positive that the people they are banning are those that deserve it.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't hack your system until the next gen comes out.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, those of you guys that have not gotten your Xbox consoles banned, you have plenty to look forward to.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Xbox Live Arcade is getting a Bomberman port, and if you're still crying in the corner in the fetal position over Bomberman Act Zero, fear not.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is a traditional Bomberman style game.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hudson's putting it together.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They have confirmed after much speculation on the internet, which I believe we talked a little bit about last week on the show.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There was a trailer and stuff.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A little bit.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hudson has stepped out and said, okay, you got us.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It is coming out, and it's going to have eight player support online.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Quote, this has been one of our most requested games.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Our fans have been clamoring for it.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We are thrilled to finally be able to deliver the game they want.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So there you have it.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's going to be pretty awesome there.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Also new to the Xbox Live Arcade version.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bomberman customizability.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Gamers will be able to design a unique bomber to identify themselves with online.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hudson promises enough options for 10,000 possible combinations.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
9,900 of which are ugly.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So anyways, something kind of funny coming out from Edge Magazine in the UK.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is coming from Mark Raim.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They're talking about Gears of War and how they modified it into a golf game.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Apparently they were trying to sell the Unreal 3 engine to a Korean publisher that was looking to make casual games from it and possibly a golf game out of it.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So what they did to kind of demonstrate this is they modified one of the levels of Gears of War to make it more like a golf course with holes and stuff like that and mounds.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then actually had their animator create a golf swing for Marcus Fenix.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And kind of demonstrated it using the actual grenade throwing engine in the actual game.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So that's kind of neat.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't expect it to actually come to live or anything as download content.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But hey, if they wanted to do that, that would be kind of neat.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Will Gears of War Golf, this tech demo here, become the Final Fantasy on Nintendo 64 tech demo of the future?

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like one of those highly sought after things?

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Maybe not.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It'd be fun to have a downloadable demo or something like that.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's see a YouTube. Come on.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wherever a story like this is to be found, there's soon a YouTube to be found.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So let's see a YouTube of this in action.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Marcus Fenix on the golf course. Amazing.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, this is actually something that makes me pretty happy.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is that in recent submissions to the ESRB has been Echo the Dolphin and Sonic the Hedgehog for Xbox 360.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you remember when we were talking about the Sega Vintage rumor that was going out?

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, this seems to sort of support that theory.

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Although it's not going to be called Sega Vintage.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They are going to call it Sega Ages something because that's just Sega.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So whatever.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because ages is Sega backwards?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Cute.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Rob, they've been doing the Sega Ages collection since the day of the Saturn.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That name is not going anywhere.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When was the last time there was a good Wayne's World reference anywhere?

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Come on. I had to do it not.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Anyway, sorry. I killed the joke.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Anyhow, are you excited about this?

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know. This is like the five gazillionth time we've seen Sonic the Hedgehog.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have both of those games.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But there'll be achievements and high def graphics?

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How much do I give a shit about achievements, Rob?

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You've seen my Xbox Live account.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't you have like zero points?

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No. I have one achievement and that's from playing Uno and winning with a draw four.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The one time I've played on live.

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're not really a big 360.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where's all your Marvel Ultimate Alliance achievements?

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm playing on PS3.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But you're going to be playing on Xbox 360, yes?

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, and then it'll have Cheater all over it.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because I'm going to be level 99, 100K, max out my characters.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah. That'll be me.

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Interesting.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Alright.

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, if you are a fan of Retro, are you interested in this, Loki?

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The echo of the dolphin?

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Nope.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, KainVM, guess what? I have Dragon Force.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
KainVM says I want Dragon Force. Give me Dragon Force.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I have it.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Alright.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
On the Saturn.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Going over to the Wii.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Of course, they love their virtual console stuff over on the Wii.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And again, the ESRB spills the dirt on what we can be looking forward to on the Wii Virtual Console.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Including Streets of Rage 2 coming to the Wii Virtual Console.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Boy, they're really reaching with the Sega Genesis games now, aren't they?

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And World Sports Competition from Hudson.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There you go.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Three games that are all but confirmed, basically, for the Virtual Console.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Anybody downloaded anything on Virtual Console lately?

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nope.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I guess I'm the only sucker for it. I got Legend of the Mystical Ninja because that game was awesome.

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, that was pretty fun.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was an awesome game.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
World Sports Competition.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's such a generic name.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
By the way, Nintendo.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hello, Nintendo and Squeenix.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I am still waiting for Actraiser.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you.

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Japan and Europe have had it how long now and we're still waiting?

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What the hell's the holdup? Actraiser.

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
On my Super Mario RPG.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now.

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, sorry. I'm done being a little kid.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Anyways, so something else we talked about on a previous podcast.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Which later disappeared.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Into the Bermuda Triangle.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Which we will speak no longer of on this program.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Namco Museum Remix is coming to the Wii.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
First time I've ever heard that.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, I've never heard you say this on a previous podcast at all that suddenly disappeared a few weeks later.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Never heard it.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Never ever.

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Never.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But it's going to actually, they're kind of remixing a few different things than you would normally expect.

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Like Pac-Man rolls actually being remade into a Wii game.

214
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's kind of neat.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So that's going to be on there.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Pac-Motos, which is going to be a kind of a Mario Kart type game, sort of.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Basically Pac-Man knocks his opponents out of dangerous arenas.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Rally X Remix, they're redoing it in like 3D.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So it's a little bit different than the remixed ones I guess on the PSP.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Gator Panic Remix, which is I guess like whack-a-mole.

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then of course you're going to also see in Galaxian, Dig Dug, Mappy, Xevious,

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Galpus I guess, I don't know, Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Mania, and QQ.

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We'll all have remakes and I guess, oh no the originals.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's set to release I guess, it says in the fall, August.

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
As much as I have issues with Namco lately for certain unsaid personal reasons, this

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
game looks pretty cool.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't let that get in the way of the fact that the game does look pretty cool.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And Pac and Roll on the Wii does seem like kind of a natural progression.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I'm a sucker for these retro things.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What can I say?

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm just such a fucking sucker for this crap and this looks kind of neat.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, and unfortunately it's going to be the only rolling game this year on the Wii, this

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
year.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, you mean any other rolling games that people might have been thinking about, perhaps

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
they will see instead in 2008, is that what you're saying?

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Maybe.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, okay, I see, alright.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What other types, I've never heard of other rolling games, oh you're talking about Kororimpa

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
2 of course, right?

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Of course.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, Sakura, I know you're a Namco fan.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,520
Are you excited about this Namco museum remix?

244
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,580
You have, now, freaking, I know on the Playstation you take great pride, a little too much pride

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,800
in the fact that you have the NAMCO and trademark CDs, right?

246
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,380
No, I'm actually missing the, I think I'm missing the A, which is the one I want because

247
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,500
it has Super Pac-Man.

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,360
Your collection fails at life.

249
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, they're really hard to find, although I can get the trademark one easy.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,800
But, okay, so, are you excited about this whole remix thing on the Wii, I mean, is this

251
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,960
something that should be remixed or should Namco games be untouched and preserved in

252
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
a bubble forever?

253
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, given that I was picking up the Sega Aegis 2900, and you know what those are, they're

254
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,760
all the touched up, redone versions of the old Sega games, then I have absolutely no

255
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
problem with this.

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,040
I would love to see D3 release all the Simple 2000 series over here.

257
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,800
Actually, there have been a few titles from the Simple 2000 series that snuck over.

258
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,240
They just, of course, are different titles, and, you know.

259
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,920
Bandit says, bring me Burger Time now, and Ross Steele has to remind Bandit that Burger

260
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,120
Time is by Data East, so it won't be an image.

261
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I missed Data East.

262
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I can has Burger Time now?

263
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Huh?

264
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
I can has Burger Time now?

265
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,520
What the hell ever happened to Data East?

266
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Are they still around?

267
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
They're doing pinball.

268
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,760
They should remake Breakthrough.

269
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,240
That was one of my first Nintendo games, and I loved it.

270
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,640
Okay, while we do our next segment, I'm going to research what happened to Data East.

271
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,480
I'm sure someone in chat wants to ruin it for me, but I'm not going to pay attention

272
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
to them for me.

273
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
That's my guess.

274
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Bring me into triangle.

275
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm going to do the research on my own.

276
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,840
All right, so we'll do our next segment in the meantime.

277
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Speaking of internet, things we love to do.

278
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,680
Dark Sakura loves to look at the internet up and down and all over every week, and share

279
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,400
her favorite website with you.

280
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,920
So it's Dark Sakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right

281
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,640
now.

282
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,360
I decided not to do website of the week, sorry, no really.

283
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,880
This is one that was suggested by our very own Loki, and it's fucking addicting.

284
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,600
It's Dofi blog, and let me see if I can read what this says.

285
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,660
Oh, it just says Dofi blog in Hiragana, I'm sorry.

286
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,400
It's a bunch of Flash games.

287
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
It's really crazy.

288
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:09,880
I've been playing Cat with Bo Golf, which is crazy, and there's also Stick Remover and

289
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:18,600
Double Wires, Egg Way, San San San, X Snow Cats, Neko Breakout, War of the Hell, Slug

290
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:28,160
Slayer, rolling Omosubi, and a bunch of other weirdo games involving cats.

291
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,120
I highly recommend X Snow Cats, that one's fun.

292
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,520
Egg Way is kind of retarded, and gets really weird, and then Double Wires is kind of neat.

293
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,240
It's almost like a stick Spiderman, and you have to navigate your way across the screen.

294
00:17:48,240 --> 00:18:01,960
The website is ishi.blog2.fc2.com, and you can get to everything from there, ishi.blog2.fc2.com.

295
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,440
Which you have conveniently posted in chat for our listeners, I see.

296
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Of course I have.

297
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,960
Thank you, DarkSakura, upstanding citizen.

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Moving on, Data East, I looked them up on Wikipedia to figure out what went on.

299
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,400
They went under on June 25, 2003, is when they filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court,

300
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,280
and their intellectual properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, who's a Japanese

301
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,760
mobile game content provider, which explains how we have burger time on cell phones, because

302
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,960
I have seen that game in recent years.

303
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
So maybe you'll see bad dudes in a few years on phones, I don't know.

304
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you a bad enough dude to have a milkshake?

305
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,440
But Data East went under, they did have a brief stint in pinball, and they did some

306
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:53,360
pretty good tables, Guns N' Roses, The Simpsons, Robocop, and they purchased Stern Electronics,

307
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,560
and then something changed and they made Stern Pinball, I think, and then they sold it all

308
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
to Sega.

309
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, Stern is their own company.

310
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,880
In fact, Stern is the company that released the Pirates of the Caribbean pinball a couple

311
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,400
months ago, and I think they also released the Family Guy pinball.

312
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,640
Okay, I get it, I see.

313
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,000
Data East exited the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 96, and the USA

314
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,720
division had already been transferred to Sega as part of a debt settlement, and then the

315
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,400
pinball factory changed hands one more time with Gary Stern purchasing the factory in

316
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,040
99 and renaming it Stern Pinball.

317
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,520
So there you go, that's what happened.

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,640
And Stern is still giving us our pinball.

319
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
There you go.

320
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,240
But unfortunately no more Data East.

321
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,640
No more Kid Nicky Radical Ninja, I'm sorry to say.

322
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,560
No more Bump N' Jump kids, or Ring King.

323
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,240
I know, Bump N' Jump was rad.

324
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,360
Anyway, but you do get plenty of Super Smash Brothers Brawl because that wasn't by Data

325
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,160
East, that's by people completely different, and of course that is one of the most anticipated

326
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,720
games coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and Loki, guess what, Loki, you're gonna love

327
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,040
this news, Loki.

328
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,160
Joo France, who is a Nintendo in France, they report on stuff.

329
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,760
They have reported that the Japanese gaming magazine Game Lab has given word that Super

330
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,640
Smash Brothers Brawl will have Tingle in it, your favorite Nintendo character of all time,

331
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Tingle.

332
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Boo.

333
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
From the Zelda series, of course.

334
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,600
Tingle is the, he's every fairy's fairy, let's just put it that way, and he goes around

335
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,720
spilling rupees and good times.

336
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,200
I remember he was in the Four Swords game on GameCube, good times.

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,560
So that would be great if Tingle shows up in the game.

338
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,760
Has not been confirmed by Nintendo, it's still a rumor, but that would be pretty awesome

339
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,880
if Tingle showed up in the game.

340
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,200
If nothing else but to drop power-ups in, because, you know, it doesn't necessarily

341
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,160
mean that Tingle is a character, could be that Tingle, you know, because, like, remember

342
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,600
how like Pokemon showed up, like the Pokeballs would show up in the old one on GameCube,

343
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,760
and you could just throw the Pokeballs and you had random, like, you know, like, what

344
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,560
were some of the Pokemon that showed up randomly, like the Charizard and stuff would blow fire

345
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,820
or whatever.

346
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,040
So there you go.

347
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,760
And with any luck, maybe Loki is secretly recording the voice of Tingle as we speak

348
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
for this upcoming game.

349
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,560
I am not recording the voice for Tingle.

350
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
God.

351
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
It's horrible.

352
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Horrible, horrible.

353
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:36,440
Apparently now, if you're flying Delta Air, you can check out some free demos for the

354
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,320
DS, because now they have DS demo stations right there while you're waiting in line.

355
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,960
And some demos you'll be able to try out, Brain Age, Cooking Mama, Elite Beat Agents,

356
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
and Tomb Raider Legend.

357
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,120
Of course, all those are free.

358
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,360
Um, isn't this all the same shit that's in there usual?

359
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
I want to see yes.

360
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Alright.

361
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,280
So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, but this isn't much incentive to fly Delta, because

362
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,720
if you think about it, like the Delta terminals are always right across from the airline you're

363
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,680
really flying, so, you know, you're within range of the Nintendo kiosk, right?

364
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,360
So you don't necessarily have to fly Delta.

365
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
True.

366
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
Unless you're in a place like the Sacramento Airport, where like Southwest dominates an

367
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,800
entire wing of the airport and there's no Delta to be seen anywhere.

368
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,920
I don't know, maybe that's just me.

369
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Moving right along.

370
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,840
Well, there is some good news for our friends in Europe, is that Final Fantasy VI Advance

371
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,760
will be released on June 29th.

372
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,140
It has, you know, I've actually got the game, although to be honest I have yet to play it.

373
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:57,560
You have the Soul Shrine that gives you a bunch of monsters to beat up and a Kaiser

374
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:05,640
Dragon boss and a music player, but other than that it's the same game, except that

375
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,280
you have no Vanish X-Zone.

376
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,920
Oh, they took X-Zone out of the game?

377
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
No.

378
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
You have no Vanish X-Zone.

379
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh, the trick.

380
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
The combo.

381
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Okay, yeah, yeah.

382
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
No Vanish X-Zone.

383
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,280
What was the Vanish X-Zone combo?

384
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:26,240
If you cast, what happens if you cast Vanish, is that it makes the enemies disappear, but

385
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,000
it makes them I think vulnerable to all magic attacks, and then X-Zone sends them to another

386
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
dimension.

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So basically it ends the battle.

388
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
X-Zone was like an insta-kill.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,280
X-Zone was an insta-kill, but it didn't always work.

390
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
But if you used Vanish on the enemy first, it would always work.

391
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,520
So interesting.

392
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,280
I always used to just like casting reflect on all my characters and then just bouncing

393
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,320
the spells off there, even though I don't know if it did anything.

394
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,000
It was just nice to see lightning hit four times or whatever.

395
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Good times.

396
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,320
Drunami would like to point out that Vanish Doom will also work.

397
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,600
The Vanish Doom combo.

398
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,520
I like, but still my favorite attack though in that entire game was Meteor, just because

399
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,000
it looks cool.

400
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,560
I never used the Vanish X-Zone CD.

401
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,340
I actually thought X-Zone was kind of a dumb spell, just because, I don't know, I like

402
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,080
to kill in the old-fashioned way, by the hand of my sword.

403
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Ultima?

404
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Yeah, or spamming Ultima.

405
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, the other thing though that I really, okay, what was, in the Final Fantasy games

406
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,920
overall, what would you say is your one most useful spell?

407
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh my.

408
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
That isn't Cure.

409
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Yeah, I was just going to say Cure.

410
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Curaga?

411
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
That isn't in the family of Cure.

412
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Protect.

413
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, no, I rarely use Protect, unless it's Fantasy XI.

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,600
The number one spell I would use, Fire III, I guess.

415
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,280
Oh, where it has their MP every time?

416
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,120
No, Demi quarters their HP every time.

417
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,440
Oh, yeah, quarters their HP.

418
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,920
No, Demi I thought was- Demi was a HP attack, and you had cast Demi III, and it was even

419
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,200
more than that.

420
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
75%.

421
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Yeah.

422
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
What was the MP?

423
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,680
And it would work on big enemies.

424
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,120
There was one for MP.

425
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,040
I don't remember.

426
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,200
I didn't care about their MP as long as I could kill them before they hit me.

427
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
No.

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,800
JVMON says Demi and Bio for me.

429
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,920
Bio was the other one.

430
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,600
I love Bio, but Demi was like my big pro.

431
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,440
Virus in IV was pretty rad, because it made that hideous noise whenever you cast it.

432
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,920
It sounded like cats getting hit, and it sounded like cats in a burlap bag being hit with a

433
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,120
bat when you cast Virus on the enemy.

434
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,480
I just like the chainsaw.

435
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
That was rad.

436
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,200
That's why I love VI, was that you did the little commands with, what was it, Sabin was

437
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
his name, right?

438
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
No, that was Edgar, I think.

439
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,520
No, Edgar had the chainsaw, but Sabin had the ones where you did the Street Fighter

440
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,880
stuff and he did special moves.

441
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
That was so rad.

442
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
He was really cool.

443
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
God damn, that game was great.

444
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
They're going to remake that.

445
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,320
That'd be awesome if they do.

446
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I don't know.

447
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm still, I don't know.

448
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,280
Don't mess with something that ain't broken, right?

449
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,160
I don't know, but I am curious to check out this Final Fantasy VI advance.

450
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,720
I know, I need to buy the advance one.

451
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
It's awesome.

452
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
All right.

453
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,920
Hey, Gsuck68 in chat says, Demi sucks, especially against most stronger enemies since they're

454
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,880
immune to it.

455
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,680
Not if you make them not immune to it.

456
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,400
RasteelUT says, Virus equals bio, translations.

457
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,680
I thought it was Virus and 4 and then bio in the later games.

458
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,280
Maybe it was translations, I don't know, but it still made the dying cat noise.

459
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,240
If you love Final Fantasy, then you must have this in your collection.

460
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,280
You can get a Chocobo Magic Book mug.

461
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,880
Yes, of course, NCSX, now I don't know how you guys feel about this company, NCSX.

462
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,480
Do you use them, Dark Sakura?

463
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh, yeah.

464
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
NCSX is great.

465
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Okay.

466
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,760
I wasn't, oh no, it's BuyRight is the one you hate, but they went under, right?

467
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
Oh, hell yes.

468
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:02,880
Okay, so NCSX, N-C-X-X, God damn it, N-C-S-X, live radio, is a place where you can buy these

469
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,680
mugs for $18 a piece, these Chocobo mugs, and damn, they look cute.

470
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Look at that.

471
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Look at those little Chocobo mugs.

472
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't they look cute?

473
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
It reminds me of my- I thought you'd eat your Batsmaru one.

474
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,840
I know, my Batsmaru mug, which I do use once in a while for coffee for my Hello Kitty coffee

475
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
maker.

476
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,560
Maybe I should get a Chocobo mug to go along with this.

477
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,640
You should get me one too.

478
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Cute coffee mugs are awesome.

479
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Second drink out of a bird's head.

480
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,160
Maybe I'm going to go on a shopping spree at NCSX any day now.

481
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
I might have to think about that.

482
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,280
You can buy the handheld beat manias too.

483
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,400
Why should I buy a present for you?

484
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
What have you done for me?

485
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,320
What haven't I done for you?

486
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
A lot.

487
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Oh.

488
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,040
What have you done for me lately?

489
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,720
Anyways, like most of those promo deals out there, there's a new one now to give a Wii

490
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
for free.

491
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,800
The way you do it is Gamefly, they're running a promotion where you persuade five of your

492
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,200
friends to sign up, and in return, they'll send you a free Wii six weeks later.

493
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,080
What people are doing is having their friends sign up, giving them like 10 bucks each to

494
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,800
do that, and then canceling it after a set amount of time, and there you go, free Wii

495
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
for 50 bucks.

496
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
I did that for an iPod.

497
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,160
So yeah, it's kind of like that scheme.

498
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,520
Of course, my guesses are going to catch on to this pretty quick, and they will change

499
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
something.

500
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,160
That shit really works, huh?

501
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,080
Like we can get the free Xboxes, because I keep hearing this commercial on the radio

502
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:34,600
for the free Xbox, and I'm always like, oh, schemes are so reek of shenanigans, but they

503
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
really work, huh?

504
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
I'll tell you how I did mine.

505
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,480
They had this Blockbuster online thing.

506
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,840
It was like Netflix, but Blockbuster, so it sucked, and if you sign up, they don't charge

507
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,660
you for like two weeks during their trial, right, but it takes six days for them to transfer

508
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,840
to the iPod site that you signed up for, so you cancel before they charge your credit

509
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,800
card, and so me and five people did that, and I got a iPod, and then my iPod broke.

510
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
So you got a cheap iPod.

511
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
You got a reaper.

512
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,880
I got one of the third edition iPods that they had the recall on.

513
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,360
Ah, it sucks.

514
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,320
All right, well, another scheme, of course, here on this program is our mailbag, and the

515
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,560
joke is you can interact with us every week on our program by sending us emails to mailbag

516
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,360
at orangesloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura likes to jump in there and pull out a few

517
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,960
of her favorites and read them to you here live on air.

518
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:38,400
So let's open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we got in this week's mailbag.

519
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,880
The first email comes from a French nun.

520
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,880
It says, Bonjour, DarkSakura, and please pardon my bad pronunciation because I am way, way

521
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
out of practice.

522
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Christ, are all our emails actually in French this week?

523
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
No, they're not.

524
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
No, they're not.

525
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I was like, did they actually listen to you?

526
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,000
It says, Vous avez une tres bevoir et j'adore vous entendre à la radio orange.

527
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,120
Okay, yeah, I'm really good.

528
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,640
Basically said I had a really good voice, and they like listening to the show.

529
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,720
So I have a general comment.

530
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,200
I find your show a little Xbox 360 heavy.

531
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,440
While I understand that there is little to talk about in the PS3 world, my PS3 is accumulating

532
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,800
dust extremely effectively, I'd love to hear you chat, argue, fight about other platforms

533
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,600
such as DSPSP, cell phone games, and insert obscure platform here.

534
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, the CDI.

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh my God.

536
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Anyway.

537
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We did, didn't we?

538
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

539
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Listen to part A this week.

540
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,280
It's like nothing but non-Xbox 360 stuff.

541
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I tuned in to hear about stuff I know nothing about, and to be honest, I buy games you guys

542
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
recommend.

543
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,880
So talk about as many platforms as possible, fair enough, and then I'm going to translate

544
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
this.

545
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Thank you, Sakura.

546
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Thank you.

547
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Okay.

548
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,400
I'm still, my reading is not so bad.

549
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,680
And good luck with the new massage profession.

550
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:08,600
And this is a French Canadian listener who demands that we speak in French more.

551
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
That's all I know.

552
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Anyway.

553
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Parlez vous, freeze pop.

554
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:26,640
Thank you very much for the well wishes, and I'm actually going to be going, when I go

555
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,860
back to school, I'm actually planning on, I took a whole bunch of French, and I used

556
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,600
to be fairly conversational, so I'm going to go back and finish learning.

557
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:44,000
And Robert M., I'm sorry, but this made me crack up, Poisson to Babble, for Babblefish.

558
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,880
Are you going on to another email?

559
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
Can I respond to the last one real quick?

560
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Please.

561
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Sorry.

562
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
Oh, the Rob D. in chat says, OLR should cover the Sega CD more.

563
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Maybe we should.

564
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
I don't know.

565
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
No, I just want to say about the Xbox 360 thing.

566
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,160
You got to realize, though, what platform has something coming out every week on it

567
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,800
with the Xbox Live Arcade?

568
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
There is the Xbox 360.

569
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,600
It's kind of got the most steam when it comes to game releases right now.

570
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Let's face it.

571
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,080
We're in a lull right now when it comes to the Wii.

572
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,840
Yeah, we had Super Mario RPG, but there's really been no A-list titles since then or

573
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,080
really anywhere near it.

574
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,200
There was just that one.

575
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,040
And then the PlayStation 3, well, you said yourself, your system's gathering dust.

576
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,400
So I think that's why the show feels a little Xbox 360 heavy right now is because there's

577
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
a little bit more to talk about there.

578
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,040
But trust me, we're fans of all the systems.

579
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,200
We don't want to be partial.

580
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,280
We realize that if you do want Xbox 360 only content, there's other podcasts out there

581
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
that'll give it to you.

582
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,960
There's plenty of indie ones out there that are great that really focus on the Xbox.

583
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,160
We do want to talk a little bit about everything, but when the news is Xbox heavy, our show's

584
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,720
going to be Xbox heavy.

585
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,440
But on a week like this where Sony had their gamer's day, part A was pretty much nothing

586
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
but Sony.

587
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
So we try.

588
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
We try.

589
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,240
But if you have a game you want us to talk about, email it and we'll talk about it.

590
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
What is that?

591
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
A taco.

592
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Oh, that's okay.

593
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
People are always offering us tacos.

594
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,400
Why aren't you on the show this week?

595
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I'll take the stuff inside of it.

596
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,320
Because I got back too late and I'm better than you guys.

597
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,960
I'll take the stuff inside the taco.

598
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Here you go.

599
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Just start digging.

600
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,320
Do you have a fork?

601
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,760
I do not, but I can go get you one.

602
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,480
How was your gaming week real quick?

603
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,400
I played a lot of Oh Andon 2 and I've already beaten it.

604
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm done.

605
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Oh shit.

606
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Nobody even mentions it.

607
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,680
I'm so sorry to interrupt your mailbag, but we need to hear about Oh Andon 2.

608
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,880
How is it?

609
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,320
Let me first stress that I'm not a Japanophile in the least.

610
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,720
So I don't care about J-pop.

611
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,460
I don't like J-pop, but I like these games.

612
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:50,000
So the music for me is sorely lacking, but it's harder than Oh Andon 1 and it doesn't

613
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,560
quite have the same charm as the first game.

614
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Either Oh Andon 1 or Elite Beat Agents.

615
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
But I like it.

616
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,620
I would still say Elite Beat Agents is my favorite of the three, but Oh Andon 2 is better

617
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,920
than Oh Andon 1 and I like that.

618
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
It's really hard.

619
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,080
Did they change anything with the basic game mechanics or not really?

620
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,720
No, but they brought over the cool features from Elite Beat Agents where you can skip

621
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,280
the intro and the last stage is actually divided into two songs and oddly enough, you can skip

622
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,120
the endings for each songs now too, once you've beaten them.

623
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,720
So it's kind of weird.

624
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,240
Like if you're just replaying to get a better score.

625
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,720
And it's good.

626
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,280
And I've been playing Puzzle Quest also.

627
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Oh, how's that?

628
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
I love it.

629
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,040
I want to try that out before you leave.

630
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Okay.

631
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,440
Well, I'm leaving like sometime tomorrow.

632
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Okay.

633
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Good.

634
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,880
And I have a terrible backlog of DS games now.

635
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,320
I have like six that I need to play or beat and it's depressing because I keep finding

636
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
more I want.

637
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,400
How hard was it to find a copy of Puzzle Quest?

638
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,960
It was hard for me at the time.

639
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I found it last weekend.

640
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,120
I found one at Best Buy, but I went to like EB and Best Buy this week and yeah, it's not

641
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
hard anymore.

642
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Oh, okay.

643
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Good.

644
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,720
So they finally put out enough so people can get that if they want.

645
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, thank you Mikoltov.

646
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
You're welcome.

647
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
All right.

648
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
And can you get her napkins for her taco?

649
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Actually, I'm going to eat it.

650
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
Okay.

651
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
You're just going to eat the taco?

652
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Yeah.

653
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
It's delicious.

654
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm going to start back tomorrow.

655
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Well, no.

656
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Good job, Shayne.

657
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Ruining diets everywhere.

658
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,920
No, I've been good all day, but I think my headache is because I had so much sugar for

659
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,320
two days and then like dropped all of it.

660
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
So I need a buffer.

661
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,400
Jamie, you're a good looking gal.

662
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Just eat the taco.

663
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
You don't have to worry about that stuff.

664
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Yes, I do.

665
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
The chatters.

666
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,640
Jamie needs some love.

667
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,880
Tell her she has nice boobies or something.

668
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't.

669
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,040
No, I don't because I figured I dropped 80, right?

670
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Right.

671
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,720
And then I gained back 15.

672
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,480
So I'm going to be going back to the gym and everything because I still have a little bit

673
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
more to go.

674
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I need to lose some too.

675
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'm starting to get a little bit.

676
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Go to the gym with me.

677
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
We'll see.

678
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Okay.

679
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
We'll see.

680
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh, God.

681
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Loki just did the most foul thing with his belly.

682
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
That was disgusting.

683
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
He shook it.

684
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Oh, my God.

685
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
That was weird.

686
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
All right.

687
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
Anyhow, sorry, mailbag.

688
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Okay.

689
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Yeah.

690
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,160
Robert M., you're funny.

691
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
And by the way, there was not.

692
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Look at chat.

693
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Look at chat.

694
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
What?

695
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
There's Jamie Love.

696
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,400
Look at that.

697
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
That's why you do this show, right?

698
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
For your ego.

699
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm not starving myself.

700
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
She's not, but.

701
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I eat.

702
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
I'm not eating.

703
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
No, no, no, no.

704
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Okay.

705
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,000
What I want to tell you guys is that diabetes, there's a tendency toward it in my family.

706
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,920
And it's not a matter of aesthetics or anything like that.

707
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,720
It's a matter of preventing disease on the way.

708
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,440
Jamie, that taco's not going to give you diabetes.

709
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
I know, but I'm.

710
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Your mic isn't on.

711
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Say the joke again.

712
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,720
It'll give you something else that starts with a D.

713
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,240
No, no.

714
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,160
The whole reason being is that I'm cutting back on my sugars because my blood sugar actually

715
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,120
was fairly borderline at my last blood test.

716
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,800
So I'm trying to avoid diabetes.

717
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
And that is the reason why.

718
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
All right.

719
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
All right.

720
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,440
Sorry to get on the tangent and get all depressing here on the program.

721
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,800
That and exercise is supposed to actually help with chronic fatigue syndrome because

722
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,960
I'm also trying to get myself off my meds.

723
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Just eat the fucking taco.

724
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I will after I'm done doing the fucking email.

725
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Oh my God.

726
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,960
I'd eat it, but I don't like Mexican food.

727
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,240
So you know, that's just kind of weird.

728
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Email.

729
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,640
Bite my ass.

730
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,880
And no, there was not a home release of dragon flare on laser desk.

731
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay.

732
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Was that the email?

733
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yes.

734
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That was from.

735
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
You didn't even read the poor guy's email.

736
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
You just yelled at it.

737
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,320
It wasn't in really bad grammar.

738
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
He said so himself.

739
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
He's babble fish.

740
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Plus song to babble.

742
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Anyway.

743
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Next email.

744
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,080
Hey dark Sakura, Loki in sky.

745
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Wait, wait.

746
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Time out.

747
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,640
Um, GZ, DR for Evie, dude, those boobs.

748
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,520
One of those nipples is a fucking comma.

749
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,180
So what are you trying to say?

750
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,600
One of her nipples is fucked up looking.

751
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Sorry.

752
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Derail the whole show.

753
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What was that?

754
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I hope that wasn't about my boobs.

755
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,560
He was making asking nipples and apparently one of your boobs is leaking because I used

756
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,080
a comma instead of a dot.

757
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,040
That's that's how come no one draws my boobs in chat.

758
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Yeah.

759
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
That's lactating.

760
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Boob.

761
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Can I read the email?

762
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Yes.

763
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Thank you.

764
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Sorry guys.

765
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
In the other room.

766
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:38,080
Um, dark Sakura to add the Monday on email and for say don't to uh, no, okay, whatever.

767
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Okay.

768
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I asked for an email in French.

769
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,920
Therefore I'm getting an email in French.

770
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,040
Um, and he loves our podcast.

771
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,720
So my friend just gotten really rusty, but I tried anyway.

772
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,040
I wanted to know a couple of things.

773
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,240
One, what is the deal with nights on the, we, is it still happening and when?

774
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Um, yeah.

775
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,280
I don't know.

776
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,240
And what SNES RPG needs a DS remake the most?

777
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,920
And I'm going to say, um, Rob, second Densetsu three, but I want them to put out mother three

778
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
in America.

779
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,520
JVMON drew my boobs bigger than yours.

780
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,080
You have special pumped up boobs.

781
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,680
My nipples are the size of like dollars.

782
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,800
Nights um, I don't know.

783
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,680
It's more of a Christmas game for me, I think.

784
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Oh really?

785
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,960
Because it has that kind of night Christmas, didn't they have Christmas nights?

786
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Yeah.

787
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Yeah.

788
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
It's, it's more of a Christmas game for me.

789
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
You think?

790
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I think.

791
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Yeah.

792
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I think nights could be around Christmas.

793
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Yeah.

794
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
They should release a Christmas nights as well.

795
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Okay.

796
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Well, um, I don't know if I've told, well, I've mentioned this several times.

797
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,440
Um, Christmas nights is actually, um, a, uh, a tradition at my house.

798
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,800
We break out the Saturn and we play Christmas nights up until Christmas day.

799
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Nerd.

800
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,280
What was the other part of the question?

801
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
Games that should be redone or something?

802
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,120
Um, RPGs that should be released for the DS.

803
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,600
RPGs that should be released for the DS.

804
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Guardian legend.

805
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Okay.

806
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Maybe that was an RPG.

807
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,840
Well, it's, it's, it's still a game that I want.

808
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,400
It's an adventure shooter.

809
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Close enough.

810
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,960
I just want the guardian legend love.

811
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,680
Um, and I want to stop whining.

812
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,800
Um, how about the illusion of Gaia series or the whole, uh, Enix like soul blazer.

813
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
What was it?

814
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Um, soul blazer.

815
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,720
Oh my God, Shane, this is a good taco.

816
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Yes.

817
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,760
And illusion of Gaia and there was a third one, brain Lord.

818
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
That's the other one.

819
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Brain Lord.

820
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I want that whole series on DS.

821
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Okay.

822
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Next email.

823
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Yes.

824
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Unless you had anyone that you wanted to seek him out.

825
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Huh?

826
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,800
What RPG would you like to see come out for the DS?

827
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Taco the RPG.

828
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
For the DS?

829
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,400
Uh, remake, remake.

830
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,360
Super Mario RPG.

831
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,240
Where the fuck is my game?

832
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,560
Taco.

833
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,520
Jiranami says it was not brain Lord, it was Terra Nigma.

834
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Next up.

835
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Um, okay.

836
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,440
With the Xbox 360 keyboard, do you think World of Warcraft will come to the 360?

837
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Why or why not?

838
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Um, no.

839
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
And you don't need to know why.

840
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,220
No, I'm kidding.

841
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,220
That's from Daniel.

842
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,560
I kid you not.

843
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,960
Every time the, the video rep comes down to our work, we ask them that same question.

844
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,640
Is World of Warcraft coming to the 360?

845
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,820
And every time he says it's never coming to the 360 ever, probably because he hates us

846
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,360
asking him that question.

847
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't think it's happening either.

848
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,720
I think Blizzard, if they're going to do something on the consoles, they will make a game specifically

849
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
for consoles.

850
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
I don't think they're going to port their game.

851
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
They don't really need to.

852
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,400
I mean, everybody has a computer.

853
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,040
People that don't even play PC games play World of Warcraft.

854
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Okay.

855
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,080
You're only seeing games that are ported to that when they need more users.

856
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,000
World of Warcraft is not really having any trouble with not a large enough user base.

857
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,200
I mean, Blizzard probably figures if you have an Xbox 360, you also probably have a computer

858
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,680
capable of playing World of Warcraft.

859
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Yeah.

860
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
And also, I mean, World of Warcraft runs on almost anything.

861
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,500
I mean, as far as like, you know, Linux, Mac OS, you know, Windows.

862
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,880
So it's not like it's a graphically intensive game.

863
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Right.

864
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,160
And, uh, the last email, oh my God, Rob, I'm so sorry.

865
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
What?

866
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Oh, the chat?

867
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,880
I just got unbanned from- I'm just ignoring the chat now.

868
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
This is from SacraMax.

869
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,080
I just got unbanned from Orange Lounge.

870
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,740
Remember to plug that if you haven't, and I want to say, screw you, Rob Jamie is cooler

871
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,740
than you.

872
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
I hate you.

873
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,420
I'm not even going to respond to it.

874
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,600
But I think that the thing is, the signature is the funny part.

875
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,480
Whoops, Rob gets eaten by a grew youngest OLR member, wishes World of Warcraft would

876
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,680
work on his computer, Pocky lover and Vietnamese otaku, hell yeah.

877
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Whatever.

878
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Okay.

879
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Rob, heart.

880
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Yeah, whatever.

881
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
All right.

882
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Is that all the emails?

883
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Yes.

884
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
All right.

885
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

886
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,760
How about some Rob fan mail next week?

887
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
After that email.

888
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,120
I want some Rob fan mail that Jamie has to read word for word on the air.

889
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,840
Rob fan mail in French.

890
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Or in Spanish or something.

891
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,240
How about a language Jamie doesn't know that I know a little bit of?

892
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
How about Spanish?

893
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,400
I want Spanish love for me.

894
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,600
No love for Loki ever.

895
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
What?

896
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,720
Moving on to, yeah, that's right.

897
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,200
Moving on to another story talking about Nintendo.

898
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,760
Nintendo is following up a contest in some ways.

899
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,480
Microsoft just recently said that they would like original TV pilots because something

900
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,080
that they're going to distribute on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

901
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,120
Well, now Nintendo has come out and said they're going to be holding this contest called the

902
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,760
Shortcut Shortcase.

903
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,640
The top three entries will be premiered at Rockefeller Center's annual summer film

904
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
showcase.

905
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Shortcase?

906
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm thinking of shortcake.

907
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,920
I must be hungry.

908
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,440
The theme is Nintendo.

909
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,560
The movies can be action, comedy, drama, whatever, as long as it has Nintendo hardware or Nintendo

910
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
characters.

911
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,920
There you have it.

912
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
The first place winner gets 10 grand and a trip to New York for the premiere and a lunch

913
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,400
meeting with the Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatcoff.

914
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,440
The top three entries all get Nintendo goodies.

915
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,720
You have until June 6th to get it together, so there's already a lot of Nintendo fanboy

916
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,540
stuff on YouTube, so this shouldn't be too hard for most people.

917
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:31,280
Get crackin' if you want to be a famous filmmaker.

918
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,840
One person that's not going to be featured in an upcoming live action Metal Gear Solid

919
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,400
movie would unfortunately be the voice of Snake David Hayter.

920
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,560
He will not have anything to do with the movie Fangirls Cry.

921
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,640
That makes me sad.

922
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,200
Basically they were asking him what his thoughts were on it and he's basically saying they're

923
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,640
taking Metal Gear as an apocalypse now of the digital age or something like that.

924
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I don't know.

925
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,400
Hopefully it's not going to suck, but after looking at his headshot here I can see why

926
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,720
they don't want to go with him for Snake right now because man, the dude needs a haircut.

927
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
He looks like Joey Fatone.

928
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,560
That snake was running around with a mullet.

929
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:29,320
He looks like he's about ready to join a ren fair.

930
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,680
Snake was running around Metal Gear Solid 2 with a mullet.

931
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:41,200
Yeah, but he has guns and he's not a real special op guy, so I don't know, whatever.

932
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:52,660
Speaking of whatever, there's a next generation Wolfenstein in the works and they're stating

933
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,400
that it should be actually out in 2008.

934
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,420
It's being put out by Raven, so that's happy.

935
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,280
Will it be like the old school Wolfenstein 3D or the more met Castle Wolfenstein game

936
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
that came out later?

937
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
What was that called?

938
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Return to Wolfenstein or whatever that game was?

939
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
Return to Castle Wolfenstein?

940
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,760
Yeah, I didn't care for that one.

941
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,720
Oh my gosh, Shane, this was the best taco.

942
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,280
It was more like one of those war sim games.

943
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,600
I just liked being able to shoot up Hitler and the war mech.

944
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,680
That was awesome in the old school 3D game.

945
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Remember that?

946
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
Forget it.

947
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:40,260
Speaking of things of a questionable nature, there was a Flash game created about the Virginia

948
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,260
Tech rampage.

949
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,440
It was a Flash game.

950
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,440
This game was created by this guy, Ryan Lamborn.

951
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
This is interesting.

952
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:55,120
Basically, he made a Flash game that kind of glamorized the whole Virginia Tech shooting.

953
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,480
You could take part in it, whatever.

954
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,480
Obviously, this is very controversial, but what's interesting is what this author chose

955
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,840
to do in response to it, quote, Attention angry people, I will take this game down from

956
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,880
Newgrounds if the donation amount reaches $1,000 US.

957
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,760
I'll take it down from here if it reaches $2,000 US, and I will apologize if it reaches

958
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
$3,000 US.

959
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,560
Of course, he never really says what the donations will go to besides his pocket.

960
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,540
I believe Newgrounds ended up taking the damn thing down anyway, but kind of interesting

961
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,040
that he kind of blackmailed the internet to take this game down.

962
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,400
He also said that he was joking about the whole wanting to collect money.

963
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,160
Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't really take it that way.

964
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
He did.

965
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Later, there was an update.

966
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,660
The donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game

967
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,660
down.

968
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,500
I didn't think anyone would donate money to it, and so far, my PayPal account has proven

969
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
me right.

970
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
I don't know.

971
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,840
That seems like an afterthought excuse, doesn't it?

972
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Yeah.

973
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,960
He's just probably thinking, well, maybe some dumb sucker will... If it was a joke, he

974
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,760
would have probably not put his PayPal account on there.

975
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,480
What a weirdo.

976
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,960
Who cares?

977
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
It's just some dumb ass trying to get attention just like...

978
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,320
I'm all for freedom of speech and all, but I don't know, and in a way, the media just

979
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,040
shouldn't even cover it, and that's really what it should be.

980
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,560
If you don't want this guy to make any money off it, don't fucking cover it so people don't

981
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
know about it.

982
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,360
I don't think anybody would have found it otherwise.

983
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,640
Media should take some responsibility, even the gaming blogs and stuff.

984
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,680
Don't fucking cover it if it's in poor taste.

985
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
Don't write about it.

986
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,080
I probably shouldn't even... God, I'm being a hypocrite right now.

987
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,220
I probably shouldn't have said anything about it, but it sounds like the game's already

988
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,220
down.

989
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,000
That's what I'm going off of, so whatever.

990
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,920
We come full circle to talking about GameTap again and what they're doing correct.

991
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,800
This is actually very cool.

992
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,840
GameTap has announced that they're doing an animated series called Revisioned, and what

993
00:48:50,840 --> 00:49:01,720
it basically is, each season is going to focus on basically a game series or a game character.

994
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,600
For example, the first series that's up is Tomb Raider, and it's also going to be animated

995
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,040
by Warren Ellis, Peter Chung, and Jim Lee, to give you an idea.

996
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
That's cool.

997
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,000
It's basically Animatrix, but for games, so it's yet another original thing that they're

998
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
actually doing.

999
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's going to be pretty awesome.

1000
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,520
I'd like to see some DVDs for this because that might be something worth checking out.

1001
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,800
I want to see what they do beyond Tomb Raider, though, because that'd be pretty cool.

1002
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,440
Doesn't GameTap have some type of deal with Tomb Raider right now?

1003
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,960
There's going to be a Tomb Raider thing, a special edition thing?

1004
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,240
There's a ton of stuff coming out of there.

1005
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm not feeling the Tomb Raider love, I'm sorry to say.

1006
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,040
Oh well.

1007
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,040
Whatever.

1008
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,840
If that's what they want to do, I guess.

1009
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,480
I never even saw the movies, ever.

1010
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,360
Although if you're interested in checking out to see what it's going to look like, they

1011
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:56,520
are going to have a little bit on the Tomb Raider GameTap collection website.

1012
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,960
It's TombRader.GameTap.com.

1013
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,120
You can check out a trailer for this new cartoon series.

1014
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Let's see.

1015
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,240
Ross Steel in chat says, animated series on GameTap.

1016
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,160
Oh God, it's Captain N all over again.

1017
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,040
It Stun says, I think Tomb Raider Legend was going to be sold cheap on GameTap, if not

1018
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,040
free.

1019
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,040
All right.

1020
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,560
That's why we love having a chat nearby.

1021
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,240
They always like to correct us when we're wrong.

1022
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,640
Tap.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1023
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,600
If you don't want to do it by chat, well, shit, you can always call us.

1024
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,160
You can call us 1-877-GAME-OLR and I'm pleased to say the Skype line is open.

1025
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,400
You need to pick up the phone and call us at that number 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give

1026
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,520
us a call on Skype.

1027
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,920
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1028
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,320
All one word because the nice thing about that is that the 1-877 is a toll free number

1029
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,280
but only in the US and Canada.

1030
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,400
If you use the Skype line instead, you can be anywhere in the world and still call us

1031
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
for free.

1032
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,040
All right.

1033
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,040
Let's go to the phones and we'll take this call right here.

1034
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,920
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1035
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Who's this?

1036
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Hi, DMN.

1037
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,920
What do you want?

1038
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,960
Oh, I'm so glad.

1039
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,440
It's really you this week.

1040
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
What's up?

1041
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Yeah, I'm glad to.

1042
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,920
I'm out of impersonations right now.

1043
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:19,680
However, I'm calling on behalf of DJ Tyrant to say one thing and if you'll excuse me,

1044
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,680
I'll put the phone away from my mouse because I don't want everyone's speakers to explode.

1045
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
One second.

1046
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
Okay.

1047
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
StarCraft 2!

1048
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Oh my God!

1049
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
Okay.

1050
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,720
Now we've gotten that out of the way.

1051
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,000
Why is DJ Tyrant so excited about StarCraft 2?

1052
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,720
DJ Tyrant is OLR's resident Blizzard fanboy.

1053
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Yeah.

1054
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Just real quick.

1055
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,720
Sorry.

1056
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
I'm sorry to interrupt real quick.

1057
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,800
I'm just going to come back to that Tomb Raider animated series thing.

1058
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,240
It's being animated and written by the guy that did Aeon Flux.

1059
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
So that's pretty awesome.

1060
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
Suddenly this has scored a lot of cool points in my book.

1061
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,160
Yes.

1062
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
Interesting.

1063
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
Maybe I'll like Tomb Raider.

1064
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
Now I may actually watch the first ten seconds.

1065
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Oh wait.

1066
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
This is the first five.

1067
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
It's coming July 10th.

1068
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
That's when the series is starting.

1069
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Thank you.

1070
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
So OMG!

1071
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,160
StarCraft 2!

1072
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
Well, what about you?

1073
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,640
What are you feeling about StarCraft 2?

1074
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:17,240
I've played StarCraft a little bit in my youth almost ten years ago.

1075
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,760
Not a huge fan of the real-time strategy genre.

1076
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,760
Yeah.

1077
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
You know, that's my problem.

1078
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,160
I never really played StarCraft because I wasn't a fan of the real-time strategy series.

1079
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,200
I'll tell you, if this announcement had been Diablo 3, I would have had a total fan-gasm.

1080
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Yeah.

1081
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,720
I think you and I both would have.

1082
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,200
I love Diablo, but seeing as the announcement was happening in Korea, I think everyone did

1083
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
their math.

1084
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,200
2 plus 2 equals 5 and all that stuff.

1085
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,880
But I'm also calling to announce the Phoenix Down usage on SDFU.

1086
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,640
Okay, what's this all about?

1087
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,440
We put our show on hiatus, one, because I've been going through a lot of personal turmoil

1088
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,240
and now that's kind of subsiding and I feel my crazy, normal self.

1089
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,640
We're revamping the format of SDFU.

1090
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,840
For any people who were introduced to my antics in the chat room earlier last year, you know

1091
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
I used to do a little around the horn thing and I scored people's arguments.

1092
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,480
Well, now we're turning it into a show.

1093
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:22,560
DJ Tyrant and three chatters from OLR's chat room will face each other off each week and

1094
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,840
the winner gets to finish the show with me.

1095
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,080
So wait, now I know you have a lot of special guests that come on, like you've had some

1096
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,640
of the Destructoid bloggers on the program and you've had bigger names on your program

1097
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,960
than we've had on this program.

1098
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,520
So are you going to invite them to play along with you guys?

1099
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,160
Oh, absolutely.

1100
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,200
And I guess you guys can come play, too.

1101
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,960
Oh, we get to come play DMN's little game, too?

1102
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Oh, nice.

1103
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Aww.

1104
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Aww.

1105
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Well, maybe I don't want to play your game.

1106
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
I'm just kidding.

1107
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Well, I'll come on at some point, for sure.

1108
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,520
I can't speak for the others, but I will.

1109
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Okay.

1110
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
All right.

1111
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,900
I can't think of anything else, though.

1112
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,960
I guess it's time to hang up on me.

1113
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
All right.

1114
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Bye.

1115
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
All right.

1116
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Let's go to another call.

1117
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,960
I really did hang up on him, by the way.

1118
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Hi.

1119
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1120
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Who's this?

1121
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Legend of Zaku.

1122
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1123
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,960
What's up?

1124
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Fine.

1125
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Uh, yeah.

1126
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
Just nothing much.

1127
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,520
I just went in on the break yesterday, played some Distorted, Poppin' 14, Pump It Up Pro.

1128
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
What's wrong with...

1129
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
What's...

1130
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,520
Wait, wait.

1131
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,040
What are you booing Pump It Up Pro for over here, Shane?

1132
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
No, I'm not.

1133
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
What?

1134
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
I'm sorry.

1135
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,040
Sorry.

1136
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
There's a confusion in the studio.

1137
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
Give Shane a mic.

1138
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Damn it.

1139
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,360
I said boo Pump It Up Pro.

1140
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,080
Why boo Pump It Up Pro?

1141
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,120
Because it's by the guys that do In The Groove, and the step charts suck from what I've seen.

1142
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
Oh, I see.

1143
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
That one.

1144
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
Yeah.

1145
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
And it's got crap music.

1146
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
It's all right, though.

1147
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Okay.

1148
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
Think about it.

1149
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
It's like In The Groove.

1150
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
It's already bad.

1151
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
It's already Pump It Up having a love child.

1152
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
Shane, put it down for a minute.

1153
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
You're obviously biased.

1154
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
I want to hear Zaku's opinion.

1155
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
What?

1156
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
No, I mean, I played it.

1157
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,320
It pretty much is step mania.

1158
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:05,360
It's like End of Mural found step mania and found a good use for it, and just mashed Cold

1159
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,680
War songs in addition to their banya and K-pop.

1160
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,560
So Pump It Up and In The Groove had sex, and this is their baby.

1161
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
Yeah.

1162
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,280
You pretty much have modifiers that you would normally find in step mania.

1163
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,520
Mines, C400, Speed.

1164
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,440
It plays pretty much better.

1165
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,960
Since 8 on the Breakout, the high end cabinet for beta testing, so that's a nice high def

1166
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,500
TV to go with it.

1167
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,000
You know, I was talking with Kyle on email last month trying to get him on the show,

1168
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and we just lost...

1169
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,680
I need to email him again and try to get him on the show.

1170
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,680
I'd love to have him and Shane on the same show.

1171
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,680
That would be a good time.

1172
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,360
I doubt he'll be able to spill the beans.

1173
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,360
I know.

1174
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
He's pretty tight-lipped.

1175
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
Yeah, it'll still be fun.

1176
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,480
Anyway, so what else have you been up to in your gaming world lately?

1177
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,400
Yeah, as I said, not only does 8 on the Breakout Pump It Up for beta testing, but New Jersey,

1178
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,680
he also has 2DX distorted and Pop'n Music 14.

1179
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
How is that?

1180
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,640
Pop'n Music 14, Jesus Christ, they keep cranking those things out.

1181
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,520
I mean, we're catching up to...

1182
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,240
You know, 8 on the Break's catching up to TGA at this point.

1183
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,520
So what are you doing, opening a candy bar?

1184
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,400
No, it's just an oatmeal bar.

1185
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,140
How is Pop'n Music 14?

1186
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,220
It's a lot better, though.

1187
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,280
It's a lot better than the one that I'm used to over in Queens, the one that we, the Pop'n

1188
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,280
8 that I go to.

1189
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Do you have a case of the Munchies right now?

1190
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
Almost.

1191
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
I'm not high, though.

1192
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,840
I'm just a little hungry tonight.

1193
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,380
Yeah, besides that, just, you know, I just heard, you know, just, you know, pretty up

1194
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,880
over the whole StarCraft II thing.

1195
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,440
I've heard about that.

1196
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,720
Are you excited about StarCraft II?

1197
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,720
Are you a big RTS fan?

1198
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,360
Well, it's been, yeah, it's been almost a decade since they actually, you know, it was

1199
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,760
actually released the first one, so I've been itching to play it.

1200
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,320
The only thing that'll bother me is if Koreans, you know, the South Koreans start cheating

1201
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,560
on it and start, you know, bringing it down and battling it.

1202
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,000
All right, Korea, no cheating.

1203
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,160
Yeah, that's the only thing I worry about, but if anything, we'll just keep it to a land,

1204
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,120
you know, we'll just keep it to strictly land games.

1205
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,120
All right.

1206
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,960
Like something you can do after work.

1207
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,240
I still wish it had been Diablo III, though, but hey, I'll give it a try.

1208
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,760
Blizzard puts out some quality shit.

1209
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,920
I mean, they, I mean, seriously, what has Blizzard done wrong?

1210
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,800
They're really, I can't think of a lot, a lot.

1211
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,800
The only thing they need is World of StarCraft, and that's it, and they're set.

1212
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,360
I don't know about that.

1213
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
All right.

1214
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,240
All right, Zaku, we gotta let you go, but have another oatmeal bar for me, buddy.

1215
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,240
All right.

1216
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,240
All right.

1217
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,240
Later.

1218
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,840
Did he just say whatever to me?

1219
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,840
I think he did.

1220
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,320
Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

1221
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1222
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
Who's this?

1223
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,920
Raven Stalton.

1224
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
Hello, Raven Stalton.

1225
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,840
What's on your mind, my friend?

1226
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,800
Let me turn down the thing, and I'll tell you.

1227
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,960
Yes, rule number one of radio, turn down the speakers when you're gonna be on the program.

1228
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,240
Oh, we don't get that annoying ass echo.

1229
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,760
Live radio, boys and girls.

1230
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm sorry about that.

1231
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,640
I'm glad that you played that old To Go song from OLR, from OLR To Go, and the music break

1232
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,640
that no one knows about.

1233
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, the podcast listeners have no idea what you're talking about, but

1234
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,120
we played, during the break, because we do a break between A and B, we play some music.

1235
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,560
I can play a clip.

1236
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,440
Playing clips of music is okay on podcasts.

1237
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,360
Here's a little clip of Gradius, Full Speed.

1238
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,360
This is our old theme song.

1239
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:36,120
That was our old theme music back in the day when we were doing a live show and a separate

1240
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
podcast.

1241
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
That was a good time.

1242
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,280
Wasn't that good times when we'd be in the studio for like five hours?

1243
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,280
No.

1244
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,280
Anyway, sorry.

1245
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,000
What did you want to say about the song?

1246
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,720
It just brings back good memories of listening to you go like, OLR To Go, We Cup, whatever,

1247
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,720
and I'm like, ooh, OLR To Go.

1248
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
Oh, the old song.

1249
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,160
It's one of those really good memories.

1250
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,920
Aw, so it's like a retro thing for you.

1251
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,440
Yeah, and I didn't just call about that.

1252
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,600
I did call about Fear and Halo 3 beta.

1253
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,600
What about that?

1254
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:12,400
Well, I've been playing a lot of FPSs and Xbox, and I played Fear for the Xbox.

1255
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
I got it from Gamefly.

1256
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,400
How was that?

1257
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
I thought the game was good.

1258
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,600
The thing I hate is about the corridors, and everything looks the same when you walk.

1259
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
That's the thing I hate.

1260
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,640
You always have an hour of looking at it, and then you finally figure it out.

1261
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
That's what I hate about it.

1262
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:34,560
My favorite gun is the particle gun, and you get to shoot things, and it turns into skeletons.

1263
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,600
It's awesome.

1264
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,880
Do you think that Halo 3 will outsell Halo 2?

1265
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,880
I do.

1266
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,880
I do.

1267
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,280
Because it has my favorite gun, the assault rifle.

1268
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,680
Just because of the assault rifle?

1269
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,280
Yeah, just because of the assault rifle.

1270
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,200
Everyone's been bitching about it on the forum, going, we need the assault rifle!

1271
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,640
We need the assault rifle!

1272
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,440
The battle rifle sucks!

1273
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
Alright.

1274
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,520
Any other quick words here before we get to another call?

1275
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,800
A Tekken game podcast, that's it.

1276
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Alright.

1277
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,400
If you want more of the Raven's Dolphin, he has his own podcast, Tekken Games, check it

1278
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
out.

1279
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,000
I know he has an OLR community page, too.

1280
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,020
By the way, I dug up something out of the archive, here's what Raven was referring to.

1281
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,680
Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, week of July 11th, 2005.

1282
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:26,160
You're to be into the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

1283
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,520
Oh, good times, old school memories, there you go.

1284
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,480
You don't miss the five hour studio marathons?

1285
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
No, Rob.

1286
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,120
Well, I would go home literally sick with exhaustion.

1287
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,120
No.

1288
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,240
Aren't you glad we're much shorter now?

1289
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
Seriously.

1290
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,240
Hold on, we picked up another call.

1291
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1292
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,800
Hey, it's Dr. Burst.

1293
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,480
Hey, Dr. Burst!

1294
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,520
I do not recognize your name as a caller.

1295
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
You a new caller?

1296
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
Yes.

1297
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
Awesome.

1298
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
What's on your mind, buddy?

1299
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,520
New caller?

1300
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,520
Yeah, I want to comment on the World of Warcraft on 360.

1301
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,760
World of Warcraft on 360, a very popular topic.

1302
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,440
What do you want to say about it?

1303
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,440
Well, I just think, why not?

1304
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,080
People want the game and Blizzard makes more money.

1305
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,720
Why not?

1306
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,640
But do they make more money?

1307
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,480
Because again, what about the argument earlier about most people that have an Xbox 360 probably

1308
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:24,080
have a computer via PC or Mac that's capable of playing World of Warcraft?

1309
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:31,640
Well, I have the computer and I tried the demo for World of Warcraft and it doesn't

1310
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
work that well.

1311
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,640
Okay.

1312
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,360
So, I don't know, maybe there's something to be said for the achievement point whores

1313
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,920
of the world, Loki, that might have fun just playing the game to get achievements from

1314
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,920
it.

1315
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,920
Who knows?

1316
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,920
I don't know.

1317
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Why not?

1318
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
Anybody else in the room care to comment?

1319
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
Why not while on the 360?

1320
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,520
I'd actually be for it because it's the same thing they did with Final Fantasy XI.

1321
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,560
I got on the 360 because my computer, it could run it well enough, but the 360, it's got

1322
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:04,320
a set spec for it, so they're putting it on a system knowing that everybody's going to

1323
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,320
have the same amount of...

1324
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
It's like optimized for 360.

1325
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
Yeah, it's optimized for that.

1326
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,520
And so, if they did that with World of Warcraft, give me a keyboard and mouse.

1327
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,100
I like my TV better than I like my computer monitor, so I would do it.

1328
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,660
And voice chat built in right there too, because you could just do your own little private

1329
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,080
room with your friends.

1330
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:28,200
Rumor is that PC versions getting a voice chat patch, but that's a rumor.

1331
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,840
Well, the thing is too, you probably couldn't do mods on World of Warcraft for a 360.

1332
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
That's true.

1333
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Okay, that's true.

1334
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah, good point is that one thing that PC gamers on their World of Warcraft love are

1335
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,780
all the mods.

1336
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:45,040
You can have the mods for what, Spam Century is a popular mod, or Titan Bar if you want

1337
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,680
to get really popular, all that stuff.

1338
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:52,600
You can't have that on the 360, or could you in downloadable content through Marketplace?

1339
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,720
I'm not paying for Spam Century.

1340
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,240
Well, what if Blizzard put out some of the popular ones for free?

1341
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,640
Do you play WoW right now?

1342
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,560
You would pay for Spam Century.

1343
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,560
It's pretty bad.

1344
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,800
I tried it on a demo.

1345
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,800
I'm a Guild Wars player.

1346
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:11,120
The demo that you downloaded is leading other websites that sell gold to download those

1347
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,080
demos and spam us.

1348
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,400
You said you're a Guild War player.

1349
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,160
Why not Guild Wars on the 360?

1350
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,440
That too.

1351
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,840
Because it's instance based and there's so many load screens, it probably wouldn't work

1352
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,160
that well.

1353
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,440
Well, WoW has a lot of instances too, especially when you get into Endgame.

1354
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
I think about Final Fantasy XI.

1355
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,840
Final Fantasy XI had frickin' loading screens every time you went to a new area.

1356
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,760
That's one of the reasons I like WoW is that it's very seamless.

1357
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,200
You only really do loading screens when you go into instances or when you go to the other

1358
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
continent.

1359
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,080
But yeah, I don't know.

1360
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
Tell us a little more.

1361
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,360
We don't often get new colors, so Dr. Burst, what types of games have you been playing

1362
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
this week?

1363
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,480
Pretty much Guild Wars.

1364
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Guild Wars?

1365
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Yeah.

1366
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,480
I'm getting back on Guild Wars.

1367
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Oh.

1368
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,480
You guys should...

1369
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,480
You looking for a guild?

1370
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,480
I've got one.

1371
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,480
Oh.

1372
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,800
I've had one like five seconds after I made my account.

1373
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
You guys should go...

1374
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
Well, because you're a really good buddy.

1375
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
I was playing with one of them.

1376
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1377
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,840
Well, you guys can do battle, right?

1378
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
That's what Guild Wars is all about, right?

1379
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,840
Yeah.

1380
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,840
Yeah.

1381
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,840
That's cool.

1382
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,520
What is the best class in Guild Wars to play?

1383
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,840
There's not really a best class.

1384
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,840
Mesmer.

1385
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,200
I made the doctor as a Mesmer.

1386
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Yeah, I saw.

1387
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,200
Mesmers are so fun.

1388
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
I kind of like the Mesmers too.

1390
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
I like my ranger.

1391
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,000
I guess you have to say Mesmers are pretty awesome looking at least.

1392
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah.

1393
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They are.

1394
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
There you go.

1395
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah.

1396
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
That's one thing...

1397
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You know, that is one thing I really did like about Guild Wars when I was playing it is

1398
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
that the game is extremely balanced.

1399
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,400
I hate to keep dogging on Final Fantasy XI, we're going to have some angry Final Fantasy

1400
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,880
XI fans, but the problem with Final Fantasy XI is that some job-sub-jobs combinations

1401
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,560
just didn't work.

1402
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,720
If you wanted to be a ranger black mage, good luck fighting a party, right?

1403
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,720
Right, Miklotov?

1404
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,720
Right?

1405
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,720
That was my dream.

1406
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,600
But the thing about Guild Wars is that every job-sub-job combination kind of makes sense.

1407
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,920
They kind of built it a little smarter in that regard.

1408
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,000
So props to Guild Wars for that.

1409
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,800
I think the most hated class, Warrior Monk, still works.

1410
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
Yeah.

1411
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Even though...

1412
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Actually, I think I played a Warrior Monk.

1413
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,200
I mean, it was like Ghetto Paladin.

1414
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,080
All right, well, Dr. Burst, thanks so much for the call and have fun in Guild Wars.

1415
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,360
And if you see Jamie, you know, nuke her for me.

1416
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,360
Okay.

1417
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
See you.

1418
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
Wait till like M at least a comparable level.

1419
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,360
All right.

1420
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Bye.

1421
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
I'm five right now.

1422
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Bye.

1423
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,360
Well, keep working.

1424
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,360
Bye, Dr. Burst.

1425
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,360
Take care.

1426
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
All right.

1427
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
I love new collars.

1428
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,360
Don't you love new collars?

1429
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,360
For dinner.

1430
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,880
I'm going to find the old collars because I like the old collars too, but it's nice

1431
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,260
to get some new blood in once in a while.

1432
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,260
For dinner.

1433
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,260
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

1434
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,260
Who's this?

1435
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,260
All right.

1436
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,260
I love new collars.

1437
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,260
Hi.

1438
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,260
It's Kane.

1439
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,260
Hi, Kane.

1440
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,260
What's on your mind?

1441
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,660
I can hear myself a little bit, so just make sure you turn down your speakers.

1442
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,960
We hear Rob all the time.

1443
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,960
I know.

1444
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
It's too much of me on this phone.

1445
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
We should turn down our speakers.

1446
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
I know.

1447
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Maybe I'll just...

1448
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
I'm putting down my ears.

1449
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
Okay.

1450
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,960
That's fine.

1451
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,960
Screw you all.

1452
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,960
I will be quiet for this entire phone call.

1453
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,960
I got to pee anyway.

1454
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,960
You guys talk to the caller.

1455
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,960
You talk to the caller, it's fine.

1456
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,960
I know.

1457
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,960
It's too much of me.

1458
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
Rob, come here and fix it.

1459
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,960
That's better.

1460
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
I'm sorry.

1461
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Anyways.

1462
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
Okay.

1463
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,960
Now we can hear you.

1464
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,360
I just wanted to talk about the whole console thing with the WoW.

1465
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:23,280
Yeah, it would probably be better for most users, but honestly, who wants to pay that

1466
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,120
extra money just because you have to pay for the subscription and the Xbox Live?

1467
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,240
People do it for PSU.

1468
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,040
And they're idiots because PSU sucks.

1469
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,040
Yes, it does.

1470
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,040
Oh my God.

1471
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,040
I played that game for two days and canceled it.

1472
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,040
Hey, hey.

1473
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,360
I'm a fantasy star fanboy.

1474
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,360
Leave it alone.

1475
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,880
You know, PSO was great.

1476
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
PSU is terrible.

1477
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,880
PSO was awesome.

1478
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,880
Yeah.

1479
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,080
I played Blue Burst, though.

1480
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,120
If you're worried about paying an extra fee to play on Xbox Live, do it the smart way

1481
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,440
and pay for a year.

1482
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,160
Then you're not going to really worry about it anymore.

1483
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,440
You're not going to be thinking, oh, I'm paying this on top of my Xbox Live fee.

1484
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,440
It really works out nice.

1485
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,440
Well, yeah.

1486
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,760
You've got the Xbox Live anyway, right?

1487
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,760
Who me?

1488
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
No.

1489
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,760
Well, I mean, if you're...

1490
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,760
Well, you don't...

1491
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,560
Well, if you've got the silver...

1492
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,160
You got silver, and they made Final Fantasy XI, if I remember right.

1493
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,220
If you have silver, you could play it online.

1494
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,080
Why couldn't they do that with WoW also?

1495
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,080
Owned.

1496
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,680
That's what it is.

1497
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,680
I don't know if they will.

1498
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:28,560
Well, at any rate, I don't think that it's that good of an idea because, I mean, World

1499
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,200
of Warcraft already is, they don't even have any type of controller support on it for PC,

1500
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,680
so I think that it would be very interesting to see how they'd map something like that

1501
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,680
over.

1502
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,720
Yeah, they're probably going to really, really screw up on it when they do.

1503
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,920
I'm not going to hold my breath on it.

1504
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,160
You'll never know until it happens.

1505
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,160
That is true.

1506
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,160
Mm-hmm.

1507
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,680
And Rob spent the entire time not in this room.

1508
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,420
Oh, that's cool.

1509
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,040
I was playing that stick figure game.

1510
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,040
I'm here now!

1511
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,040
And I'm going to break Rob's head.

1512
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,760
Rob and Loki yell.

1513
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,760
Okay.

1514
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,440
Did this guy just threaten to break my head?

1515
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,440
That's okay.

1516
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,440
I will break you.

1517
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,800
Don't break my head.

1518
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
That's not nice.

1519
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
All right.

1520
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
What?

1521
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
For that, you get hung up on.

1522
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
Aww.

1523
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Thanks for calling.

1524
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,800
All right.

1525
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1526
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,960
Hi, this is Chainsaw Juggling.

1527
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,960
Chainsaw!

1528
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,440
Wait, what is his name?

1529
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Chainsaw Juggling.

1530
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:38,480
Yeah, I just wanted to say I have the new issue of games for Windows, and they have

1531
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,600
it confirmed that voice chat is coming.

1532
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,600
Voice chat is coming.

1533
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,000
So if you don't want that.

1534
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,880
Thank God we don't have to buy Event now, because our guild was seriously thinking about

1535
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,880
getting Event.

1536
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,040
And dear God, I can hear myself echoing.

1537
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,000
Am I really that loud?

1538
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yes, Rob, you are.

1539
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,120
Actually, because you have the speakers up right now.

1540
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Oh, maybe that's why.

1541
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Okay, I'll back up a little bit.

1542
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,480
So, oh, that's cool.

1543
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,760
So they confirmed that for the next patch.

1544
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,760
That's good.

1545
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,760
So did they say about how long?

1546
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,760
Yeah.

1547
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,760
Well, it's saying it's coming after the next patch, and then also that what they're

1548
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,080
going to try and do is make it so that the person's talking their name, like, so that

1549
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,440
you can click on it and then heal that person or trade with them.

1550
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
Huh, that's kind of cool.

1551
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:24,880
Wait, so wait, it's gonna be voice chat, even not in parties, like in the barons, everybody

1552
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
could have voice chat.

1553
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
That could be horrible.

1554
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,440
I think it's supposed to be more than a party.

1555
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,040
Because I don't want to be walking through the barons and then suddenly some asshole

1556
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,200
comes on with a Chuck Norris joke on the speakers.

1557
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
That would kind of ruin the game.

1558
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,600
That would probably be one of the worst things ever.

1559
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,400
Or make it better.

1560
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,040
Loki says we'll make it better.

1561
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,040
All right.

1562
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,880
Chainsaw, Juggling, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1563
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,760
They're adding guild bank.

1564
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,400
They're adding what?

1565
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,800
A guild bank.

1566
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,800
A guild bank?

1567
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Oh, that's kind of cool.

1568
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,840
So like the entire guild can share one bank?

1569
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,360
Yeah, and it's supposed to be set up so certain members can only access certain items within

1570
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,160
the bank.

1571
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,080
That's kind of cool, because some people are doing that already, right?

1572
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,560
Like they'll set up a dummy character that the guild members can log into.

1573
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,760
I'm going to let nobody have access to our stuff but me.

1574
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,320
You're a jerk.

1575
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,320
All right.

1576
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,720
Hey, come join our guild if you're a wild player.

1577
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
We need more people.

1578
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Yeah, I got to start over again.

1579
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,480
I'm having a lot of time, but I'll do it.

1580
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,480
What?

1581
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,480
It takes like an hour to get to 10.

1582
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,480
Come on.

1583
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,480
Yeah.

1584
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,480
We're a casual guild.

1585
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,480
We don't want a lot of time from you.

1586
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,480
That's right.

1587
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,480
We just tell dick and fart jokes.

1588
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,480
No, we don't.

1589
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,680
It took me about a year and a half to get 40.

1590
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,680
Oh, snap.

1591
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,680
That's...

1592
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
Oh, he's a player like me.

1593
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,680
Yeah.

1594
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,680
He's a player like me.

1595
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,680
That's still cool.

1596
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,680
All right.

1597
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,680
You can still come join us.

1598
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,640
We'll call and chase out Juglin and we'll hopefully have you in the wild guild at some

1599
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,640
point.

1600
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
All right.

1601
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,640
See you guys.

1602
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Have a good night.

1603
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,640
All right.

1604
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,640
See you.

1605
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,640
Thanks.

1606
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,640
You too.

1607
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,640
Lots of noobs tonight.

1608
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,640
This is an interesting change here.

1609
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,640
Let's do one more call.

1610
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,640
Hi.

1611
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,640
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1612
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,640
Who's this?

1613
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,640
Hey, it's Ron.

1614
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,640
What's up, everyone?

1615
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,640
Hi, Rama.

1616
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
How you doing?

1617
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,640
Good.

1618
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,640
Are you all ready?

1619
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,640
For Fauna Mae?

1620
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Hell, yeah.

1621
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
I'm actually very excited.

1622
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,640
Are you excited, Darksucker?

1623
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,880
I'm going to find a sewing machine to put my... I actually got the skirt for my Jessica

1624
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,000
costume, but it might not happen, so I'm going to focus on the ninja costume and do that

1625
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
one.

1626
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,480
That's cool, because if I knew enough people on the West Coast, I bet you a dollar one

1627
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,160
of them would be bringing their sewing machine to the con.

1628
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Probably.

1629
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,720
I mean, you'll probably have that anyway.

1630
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,720
Well, the only problem being is that I actually need the red ponytail wig and I cannot find

1631
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
one.

1632
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,360
I have, though, a long red wig that I'm thinking about just sort of pulling back into a ponytail

1633
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,360
and faking it.

1634
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,360
Well, if you want, I can do some last minute wig shopping for you, if you like.

1635
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,200
If it's not too expensive.

1636
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,760
I've been hunting one down like crazy.

1637
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,160
I can't find anything.

1638
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,520
Well, I know a couple of nice spots.

1639
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,440
I'll check them out on my way to work this week, because I just have to pick up a couple

1640
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,440
of stuff.

1641
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,440
You are so my hero.

1642
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
I try.

1643
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,640
Anything you want to share with the listeners, besides Rama and Jamie talked to each other

1644
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,240
about private things hour.

1645
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,240
Cosplay!

1646
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,240
Well, I...

1647
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:19,360
I missed the first half hour, so I don't know if you guys pimped out that you guys are going

1648
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,760
to be at Fond of May this year.

1649
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,560
Yes, we mentioned, because we're not going to have a live show on Sunday because of it,

1650
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,800
so yeah, we definitely pimped the fact that we're going to be at Fond of May 2 p.m. Saturday.

1651
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,200
Just a reminder for those who may not have heard Part A yet, we're not going to be live

1652
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:36,240
next week, because we are going to be live at Fond of May on Saturday, taping.

1653
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,200
Now, are we still down for Part A?

1654
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,560
I believe so.

1655
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,520
I don't think Loki's going to be there, but the rest of us can have some fun.

1656
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,960
I don't know if it's going to be an official podcast.

1657
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,880
We're thinking of having it be a special show for live journal MySpace, like our fan communities.

1658
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,520
So basically, anybody that wants it can get it, but it won't be a part of the official

1659
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,520
podcast.

1660
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
Okay, because I like rum and Cokes.

1661
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,160
We'll see what we can come up with.

1662
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,520
Why don't I bring my Patrón from my last year's birthday?

1663
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,800
Ooh, that's expensive stuff, girl, don't bring that.

1664
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,800
I've been drinking some of it, but I can't drink all that tequila by myself.

1665
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,040
You know me in tequila.

1666
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,040
You know me in tequila.

1667
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,040
We don't get along.

1668
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,040
So you'll be drinking it by yourself.

1669
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,040
Even good tequila makes me go crazy.

1670
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,040
Give me a bottle of Malibu.

1671
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,040
We're good.

1672
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,600
Rob, let's put in some money for some Grey Goose.

1673
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,600
All right.

1674
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
Oh, I got five on that.

1675
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,600
All right.

1676
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,560
Rama, anything else besides liquor chat?

1677
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,760
Just about it.

1678
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,760
All right.

1679
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,080
See you next week, Rama.

1680
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,480
Next week, give me See You Friday.

1681
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Fuck, that's right.

1682
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,480
See You Friday.

1683
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
Hell yeah.

1684
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
Later.

1685
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Later.

1686
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,480
All right.

1687
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,800
Ooh, do we even have a meetup planned for him at the con?

1688
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,400
Oh, no, I've got to figure out where I'm going to park my car overnight and all that crazy

1689
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,400
stuff.

1690
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,400
I decided I'm not going to go.

1691
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,400
You're not going to Fonomay?

1692
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,400
No, it's my birthday weekend.

1693
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,200
Why would I spend it with people I'm just going to make fun of?

1694
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,200
I'd do that anyway.

1695
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,200
I'm not going to pay to get into that.

1696
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,440
What are you going to do for your birthday?

1697
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,440
Your birthday's Wednesday, right?

1698
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,440
Yeah.

1699
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
Happy birthday.

1700
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,440
I'm going to-

1701
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,440
How old are you going to be, 30?

1702
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,440
12.

1703
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
I'm going to be 12.

1704
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,840
You're going to be 30, 12?

1705
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,400
I'm not going to be 30, 12.

1706
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,920
I'm going to be 24, and it's terrible.

1707
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
So I'm actually going to go 22.

1708
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,280
I'm going to go down a year, at least this year.

1709
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Maybe next year, I'll go back up to 23, but no, I don't have any plans yet, but in the

1710
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:21,600
hopes that I come up with something better than going to the anime, I'm going to ditch

1711
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,160
it because I didn't have fun last year, really, so it's not my thing, but I want to buy stuff

1712
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,040
like Power Ranger things because I know they have them there.

1713
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,720
Mr. Wendell is in chat right now saying, Rob, at least you're not Jahi.

1714
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,760
Oh God, I would kill to have Jahi on the Friday thing.

1715
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,280
Oh my God, no.

1716
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,480
You don't- do you know the story about Jahi and Tequila?

1717
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,480
Probably really funny.

1718
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,720
He threw up so bad at Iguana Girl's apartment.

1719
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,920
I love Jahi.

1720
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,520
He's one of my favorite people ever.

1721
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
He's just-

1722
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
And Wendell didn't.

1723
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
He completely swore off-

1724
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
Oh God, and I love Wendell, too.

1725
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
I'm so excited to see everybody.

1726
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,580
Wendell, didn't he completely swear off Tequila because of this?

1727
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:06,200
I'm not going to embarrass him over the air, especially since I don't know if he's listening

1728
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,560
or not, but oh my God, I heard the story.

1729
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,040
It was monumental.

1730
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,840
I'm so excited to drink with all my friends.

1731
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,840
I miss Jahi.

1732
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,340
You know, I randomly ran into Jahi one time when Kristen and I were in San Francisco.

1733
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,880
If he's not on the show somehow, I'm going to cry.

1734
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,080
Jahi has to be on our party podcast.

1735
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,200
Okay, remember back in the day when we would do our live events?

1736
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,660
We broadcasted all day from one of the tournaments.

1737
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,880
We did the Sacramento DDR tournament at Scandi.

1738
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,760
I remember we broadcasted all day on the live stream, like eight hours of tournament coverage,

1739
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,760
right?

1740
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Okay, seriously, during one part of the program, we just gave Jahi the mic, and for like an

1741
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,680
hour, he just spun off these random, insane badlings.

1742
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:54,840
It was incredible, riveting radio, and yeah, we really probably should wrap up the show

1743
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,840
now, huh?

1744
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,840
Because now we're starting to talk about stuff that-

1745
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
Yeah.

1746
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Like all these personal-

1747
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
Afterbirth FTW.

1748
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
All right.

1749
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,160
So anyway, we're going to wrap it up.

1750
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,440
So any last minute stories in studio, folks?

1751
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,740
I like beer.

1752
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:13,200
I'm a level 11 wizard on Puzzle Quest, because it's really awesome.

1753
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
But you're not a nerd at all.

1754
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,160
Dude, I just like playing the-

1755
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:22,120
Lucky, what the fuck is that you're playing?

1756
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,080
I'm playing Stick Remover.

1757
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
Sounds exciting.

1758
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,760
It's on the Zoffy blog, the same one that had the cat golf thing.

1759
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,760
Oh, okay.

1760
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,760
That's a good story.

1761
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,760
Any last minute stories, Loki?

1762
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,440
Well, here's a few things.

1763
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,880
You can get free game.

1764
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,640
They just posted something on Kotaku about it called Echoes.

1765
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,480
It looks kind of like Geometry Wars and Asteroids, so that's pretty cool.

1766
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,160
So check that out.

1767
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,680
King of Fighters is being made into a live action movie.

1768
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,880
Dear God, no.

1769
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,360
It's being directed by Gordon Chan, a guy from Hong Kong who-

1770
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,000
Okay, then maybe it'll be cool.

1771
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,320
It's spawned other Asian martial arts flicks, like The Medallion, starring Jackie Chan,

1772
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,720
Fist of Fury, starring Jet Li, and let's see-

1773
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,520
Okay, then I have a little bit of hope.

1774
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:18,520
Also it looks like AXIS Entertainment's Joseph Cho, Appleseed, ex Machina, and let's see,

1775
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:26,980
Convergence Entertainment's Tim Kwok of Wicked City, I guess, will handle the production.

1776
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:32,160
Sounds like it'll be out in Asia early 2008.

1777
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:37,440
And then also one game that's going to be coming out as well for 2008, Winning Eleven

1778
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:45,800
2008, and Konami, apparently this is coming from Game Wave, a print magazine in Germany,

1779
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,360
and it says it'll be released on multiple platforms, even on the PlayStation 3, improved

1780
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,880
animations, more realistic and change-dribbling animations, one-on-one tackles and offside

1781
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,920
traps will have better results, better online service, no lag, and full HD support with

1782
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,920
18GB storage.

1783
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:09,400
So I guess you could dump the game onto the hard drive.

1784
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:15,360
Nice.

1785
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,640
Looks like that's pretty much it.

1786
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:23,480
Oh, and Microsoft is asking gamers for Xbox Live Arcade game ideas.

1787
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,240
Laser Cats the Game, dude I'm so going to suggest that.

1788
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:34,320
I demand the OL Army to mobilize to this thread and request Laser Cats the Games, where is

1789
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,320
this at?

1790
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
Is that on the Gamerscore blog, wasn't it?

1791
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
I don't remember where it was.

1792
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,320
Major Nelson's site-

1793
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,080
Also, Activision wants your input for the next Spider-Man game.

1794
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,680
How about Don't Suck?

1795
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,240
How about Don't Make Another One?

1796
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,240
That's it.

1797
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,680
How about be able to set Kirsten Dunst on fire?

1798
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,440
That would be great!

1799
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,640
I want Kill Gwen Stacy the game.

1800
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,800
Would Special Supplement kill MJ?

1801
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the evening.

1802
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,940
Loki, since you have the mic right now, your final thought.

1803
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:13,280
My final thought is I want to play more Earth Defense Force.

1804
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,160
Miek Latov, thanks for piping in for the last part of the show here, even though you've

1805
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,240
been playing Puzzle Quest the whole time.

1806
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
We will still give you an opportunity-

1807
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,920
Hey, I talked while you were in the bathroom.

1808
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,920
All right, fine.

1809
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,480
Give your final thought.

1810
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,240
I really like that YouTube video of the little kid getting kicked in the face by the Breakdancer,

1811
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,880
because I've been watching it a whole lot.

1812
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,880
Good times, good times.

1813
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,120
I think I have no heart.

1814
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,040
On some really wrong LiveJournal community, I won't mention that I watch once in a while,

1815
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,560
there was a picture of that and it just said, Bay-bality.

1816
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,640
That's stupid, because it didn't turn somebody into a baby.

1817
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,640
Keep the baby in the head.

1818
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
It was funny.

1819
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,960
Then there was a Street Fighter one too, where they made it look like he did a little flash

1820
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,840
kick and it said, Guile, and then the baby... I'm going to show it to you, maybe during

1821
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,840
the afterbirth.

1822
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:03,680
Real quick, I was going to say, there is a funny thing that... This is on HMV, I guess.

1823
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:08,920
They're advertising their Manhunt 2, since it's coming out later this summer.

1824
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,120
They're adding in that little sticker on it, it says, Jack Thompson becomes angry, but

1825
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,400
then again, he's always, and then it has the date.

1826
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,400
It just occurred something to me, that I think part of the reason why, even though it's just

1827
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,260
to get his face all over everything, I think that lawyers are required to do a certain

1828
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:32,640
number of hours of things that are for the public good.

1829
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,640
You know what I mean?

1830
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,120
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it, but they're supposed... I think that that might be his

1831
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
consideration.

1832
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,680
Well, he's still a twat.

1833
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
He is.

1834
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,680
All right, anyway.

1835
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,000
He's got a yeast infection or something.

1836
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,680
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1837
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,960
Pay me.

1838
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:04,200
My final thought is, reject false icons, since Dark Soccer never says it anymore, and why

1839
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,640
don't you ever say that anymore?

1840
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,160
It makes me a little sad.

1841
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,160
Reject false icons, Rob.

1842
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,520
All right, thank you.

1843
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,900
My other final thought would be, both here.

1844
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,900
Have a great week.

1845
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,600
