Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this May 20th, 2007 with part B of episode number 232, if you can believe it, of our podcast.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Yes, we've been doing this that long.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Anyhow, we talked a lot about some various Sony news in part A.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
We talked a lot about some of the new games coming out from their press event.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
How Warhawk is actually going to be on Blu-ray now and SOCOM and the Heavenly Sword multiplayer and so on and so on.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
So this segment we're going to talk a little more about some of the other consoles.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
And, of course, we need to start with the Xbox because huge news this week with Halo 3, of course, finally getting its beta.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
A little bit delayed. I mean, what, about 13 hours before the folks on Crackdown could get in there.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Although Bungie said, okay, because, you know, we made a boo-boo in getting you guys in when we said we would.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
We're going to extend the beta for four days. Hooray.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And you shouldn't bitch about things that are free anyway.

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, the beta was followed up immediately with the news that when Halo 3 is going to come out in fall 2007, they mean September 25th, 2007.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
And for those of you guys in Europe that feel like you always get screwed, you have to wait one day, September 26th, for you guys in Europe.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
So you guys finally not having to wait as long.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
So September 2007, which I...

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
May I point out that September 26th will be occurring at the same time as September 25th here.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Ah, so it really...

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
There's an eight-hour time difference.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, that's right. Good point.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
At least between here and London time.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
That's right. So basically it's a simultaneous release.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Not what? It's an eight-hour difference.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
As close as you can get to it, we should say.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
So that's pretty rad for them.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Don't worry about Japan yet, but don't know.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
They can wait.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
They're probably not as anxious about Halo 3, although, you know, if they can sell some copies of it there, why not?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Loki, you've mentioned September before on this show, haven't you?

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, and there was a blog post, which I took away during that whole, you know...

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, when people were threatening to beat you up.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Take you out of the parking lot and beat you up if you keep stealing.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I was off by 13 days, but I was close.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
That's probably closer than most people, though. Good job, though.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
All right, so there it is.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Get your pre-orders in now. September 25th is the day.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
If you want Halo 3...

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Especially get those pre-orders in if you're looking for the Legendary Edition, because it's going to be fucking impossible to find.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Just so you know.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
All right.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
So, yeah, immediately once the Halo 3 beta came out, people started...

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
You know, the modders out there were already taking notice and trying to grab any sort of information that they possibly can.

02:55.000 --> 03:08.000
Of course, no actual word on what exactly that meant, but apparently they're looking at the code in the beta to see how they can exploit the game when it comes out.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Not surprising.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
What exactly are they doing to it?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Not really sure.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I guess they're trying to rip code out of the...

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
I don't know, basically taking the demo or beta that's on your hard drive and just trying to dissect it.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
I mean, are they these typical type of multiplayer exploits where they're trying to make themselves invincible so they can go in there and just blow people up and know when to shoot them?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, lag stuff. I don't know.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't think they're really going to be able to do much because it's a beta.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
And I don't think anyone can really decrypt the games anyways, so that would be interesting.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, there is actually a little bit more in regards to the news.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
We were talking about the accounts on Xbox Live a week or so ago.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
Just another update for the same thing is that they are actually banning modified consoles from Live.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
So, in other words, the folks that are trying to fuck with their systems to do this beta by hack storing their consoles, they're getting the ban hammer.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Pretty much.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Smacking it down.

04:21.000 --> 04:32.000
Now, they have this little text, right, because I remember Major Nelson, I was reading his blog earlier this week, had a post of the actual little picture that would come up if you are a recipient of the ban hammer.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
It was interesting because it read to me like it was saying, don't call us, there's nothing you can do, you've been banned, F you, bye, is basically what it said.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
And I was kind of like, what if you get banned accidentally?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I mean, you'd be screwed because Microsoft basically says, screw you.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
I would be, if this ever happened to me and I didn't actually mod my console or whatever, I would be livid.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm sure this can't be 100% foolproof.

04:58.000 --> 05:19.000
I would think, though, that in most, that they're counting on there being such a minority of people that that happens to, because honestly, if you haven't put anything in your system that doesn't belong there, never opened the case to do anything to it, what are the chances going to be that there's going to be some sort of flaw that comes up saying that you've modified your system?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Interesting.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
MysticGohan in chat is talking about what's happened.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
MysticGohan says, they unlocked the locked content.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
They found out that there's a vehicle called the chopper in it.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And Bandit says, there's a ban cannon.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Not a ban hammer, but a ban cannon.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Ban cannon.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Instead of a man cannon, a ban cannon.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Remember the man cannon?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I have yet to see one of those in the beta, the man cannon.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
Do you think this is an appropriate response to the hackers?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Sure.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I understand it, but I hope they're damn right every time.

05:53.000 --> 06:05.000
I think there ought to be some type of way to appeal just in case, because if this ever happens to somebody who runs a podcast or a blog, it's going to be a PR nightmare for Microsoft.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
That's just my opinion.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Anyhow.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I don't really think they care.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I guess not, but still.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
If they ban the wrong person, it's going to be trouble.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Anyhow.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You heard the fuss I made when I got the red rings.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I hope they don't accidentally ban me.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I have to quit raw steel in here.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Hackers deserve to have their consoles bricked.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I agree.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
But again, as long as they are 100% positive that the people they are banning are those that deserve it.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Don't hack your system until the next gen comes out.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, those of you guys that have not gotten your Xbox consoles banned, you have plenty to look forward to.

06:44.000 --> 06:54.000
Xbox Live Arcade is getting a Bomberman port, and if you're still crying in the corner in the fetal position over Bomberman Act Zero, fear not.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
This is a traditional Bomberman style game.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Hudson's putting it together.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
They have confirmed after much speculation on the internet, which I believe we talked a little bit about last week on the show.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
There was a trailer and stuff.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
A little bit.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Hudson has stepped out and said, okay, you got us.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
It is coming out, and it's going to have eight player support online.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Quote, this has been one of our most requested games.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Our fans have been clamoring for it.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
We are thrilled to finally be able to deliver the game they want.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So there you have it.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
That's going to be pretty awesome there.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Also new to the Xbox Live Arcade version.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Bomberman customizability.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Gamers will be able to design a unique bomber to identify themselves with online.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Hudson promises enough options for 10,000 possible combinations.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
9,900 of which are ugly.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
So anyways, something kind of funny coming out from Edge Magazine in the UK.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
This is coming from Mark Raim.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
They're talking about Gears of War and how they modified it into a golf game.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
Apparently they were trying to sell the Unreal 3 engine to a Korean publisher that was looking to make casual games from it and possibly a golf game out of it.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
So what they did to kind of demonstrate this is they modified one of the levels of Gears of War to make it more like a golf course with holes and stuff like that and mounds.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
And then actually had their animator create a golf swing for Marcus Fenix.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
And kind of demonstrated it using the actual grenade throwing engine in the actual game.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So that's kind of neat.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Don't expect it to actually come to live or anything as download content.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
But hey, if they wanted to do that, that would be kind of neat.

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
Will Gears of War Golf, this tech demo here, become the Final Fantasy on Nintendo 64 tech demo of the future?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Like one of those highly sought after things?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I don't know.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Maybe not.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It'd be fun to have a downloadable demo or something like that.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Let's see a YouTube. Come on.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Wherever a story like this is to be found, there's soon a YouTube to be found.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So let's see a YouTube of this in action.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Marcus Fenix on the golf course. Amazing.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, this is actually something that makes me pretty happy.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
Is that in recent submissions to the ESRB has been Echo the Dolphin and Sonic the Hedgehog for Xbox 360.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
So you remember when we were talking about the Sega Vintage rumor that was going out?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, this seems to sort of support that theory.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Although it's not going to be called Sega Vintage.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm sorry.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
They are going to call it Sega Ages something because that's just Sega.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
So whatever.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Because ages is Sega backwards?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Cute.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
Rob, they've been doing the Sega Ages collection since the day of the Saturn.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
That name is not going anywhere.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
When was the last time there was a good Wayne's World reference anywhere?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Come on. I had to do it not.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Anyway, sorry. I killed the joke.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Anyhow, are you excited about this?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't know. This is like the five gazillionth time we've seen Sonic the Hedgehog.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I have both of those games.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
But there'll be achievements and high def graphics?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
How much do I give a shit about achievements, Rob?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You've seen my Xbox Live account.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Don't you have like zero points?

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
No. I have one achievement and that's from playing Uno and winning with a draw four.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
The one time I've played on live.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
You're not really a big 360.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Where's all your Marvel Ultimate Alliance achievements?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm playing on PS3.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But you're going to be playing on Xbox 360, yes?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, and then it'll have Cheater all over it.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Because I'm going to be level 99, 100K, max out my characters.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah. That'll be me.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Interesting.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Alright.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, if you are a fan of Retro, are you interested in this, Loki?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
The echo of the dolphin?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Nope.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Hey, KainVM, guess what? I have Dragon Force.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
What?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
KainVM says I want Dragon Force. Give me Dragon Force.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I have it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Alright.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
On the Saturn.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Going over to the Wii.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Of course, they love their virtual console stuff over on the Wii.

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
And again, the ESRB spills the dirt on what we can be looking forward to on the Wii Virtual Console.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Including Streets of Rage 2 coming to the Wii Virtual Console.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Boy, they're really reaching with the Sega Genesis games now, aren't they?

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
And World Sports Competition from Hudson.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
There you go.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Three games that are all but confirmed, basically, for the Virtual Console.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Anybody downloaded anything on Virtual Console lately?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Nope.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
I guess I'm the only sucker for it. I got Legend of the Mystical Ninja because that game was awesome.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Oh, that was pretty fun.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It was an awesome game.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
World Sports Competition.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
That's such a generic name.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
By the way, Nintendo.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Hello, Nintendo and Squeenix.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I am still waiting for Actraiser.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Thank you.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Japan and Europe have had it how long now and we're still waiting?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
What the hell's the holdup? Actraiser.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
On my Super Mario RPG.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Now.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Okay, sorry. I'm done being a little kid.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Anyways, so something else we talked about on a previous podcast.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Which later disappeared.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Into the Bermuda Triangle.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Which we will speak no longer of on this program.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Namco Museum Remix is coming to the Wii.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
First time I've ever heard that.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
No, I've never heard you say this on a previous podcast at all that suddenly disappeared a few weeks later.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Never heard it.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Never ever.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Never.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
But it's going to actually, they're kind of remixing a few different things than you would normally expect.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
Like Pac-Man rolls actually being remade into a Wii game.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
That's kind of neat.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So that's going to be on there.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
Pac-Motos, which is going to be a kind of a Mario Kart type game, sort of.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Basically Pac-Man knocks his opponents out of dangerous arenas.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Rally X Remix, they're redoing it in like 3D.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
So it's a little bit different than the remixed ones I guess on the PSP.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
Gator Panic Remix, which is I guess like whack-a-mole.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
And then of course you're going to also see in Galaxian, Dig Dug, Mappy, Xevious,

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
Galpus I guess, I don't know, Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Mania, and QQ.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
We'll all have remakes and I guess, oh no the originals.

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
It's set to release I guess, it says in the fall, August.

13:47.000 --> 13:56.000
As much as I have issues with Namco lately for certain unsaid personal reasons, this

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
game looks pretty cool.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I can't let that get in the way of the fact that the game does look pretty cool.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
And Pac and Roll on the Wii does seem like kind of a natural progression.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And I'm a sucker for these retro things.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
What can I say?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm just such a fucking sucker for this crap and this looks kind of neat.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah, and unfortunately it's going to be the only rolling game this year on the Wii, this

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
year.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
Oh, you mean any other rolling games that people might have been thinking about, perhaps

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
they will see instead in 2008, is that what you're saying?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Maybe.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh, okay, I see, alright.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
What other types, I've never heard of other rolling games, oh you're talking about Kororimpa

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
2 of course, right?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Of course.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Of course.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
So, Sakura, I know you're a Namco fan.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.520
Are you excited about this Namco museum remix?

14:42.520 --> 14:48.580
You have, now, freaking, I know on the Playstation you take great pride, a little too much pride

14:48.580 --> 14:52.800
in the fact that you have the NAMCO and trademark CDs, right?

14:52.800 --> 14:59.380
No, I'm actually missing the, I think I'm missing the A, which is the one I want because

14:59.380 --> 15:00.500
it has Super Pac-Man.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.360
Your collection fails at life.

15:02.360 --> 15:07.000
Well, they're really hard to find, although I can get the trademark one easy.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.800
But, okay, so, are you excited about this whole remix thing on the Wii, I mean, is this

15:11.800 --> 15:15.960
something that should be remixed or should Namco games be untouched and preserved in

15:15.960 --> 15:16.960
a bubble forever?

15:16.960 --> 15:22.800
Well, given that I was picking up the Sega Aegis 2900, and you know what those are, they're

15:22.800 --> 15:26.760
all the touched up, redone versions of the old Sega games, then I have absolutely no

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
problem with this.

15:27.760 --> 15:35.040
I would love to see D3 release all the Simple 2000 series over here.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.800
Actually, there have been a few titles from the Simple 2000 series that snuck over.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.240
They just, of course, are different titles, and, you know.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.920
Bandit says, bring me Burger Time now, and Ross Steele has to remind Bandit that Burger

15:47.920 --> 15:50.120
Time is by Data East, so it won't be an image.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
I missed Data East.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
I can has Burger Time now?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
Huh?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
I can has Burger Time now?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.520
What the hell ever happened to Data East?

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
Are they still around?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.520
They're doing pinball.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.760
They should remake Breakthrough.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.240
That was one of my first Nintendo games, and I loved it.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.640
Okay, while we do our next segment, I'm going to research what happened to Data East.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.480
I'm sure someone in chat wants to ruin it for me, but I'm not going to pay attention

16:10.480 --> 16:11.480
to them for me.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
That's my guess.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.480
Bring me into triangle.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
I'm going to do the research on my own.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.840
All right, so we'll do our next segment in the meantime.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.840
Speaking of internet, things we love to do.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.680
Dark Sakura loves to look at the internet up and down and all over every week, and share

16:23.680 --> 16:25.400
her favorite website with you.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.920
So it's Dark Sakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right

16:28.920 --> 16:33.640
now.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.360
I decided not to do website of the week, sorry, no really.

16:38.360 --> 16:45.880
This is one that was suggested by our very own Loki, and it's fucking addicting.

16:45.880 --> 16:50.600
It's Dofi blog, and let me see if I can read what this says.

16:50.600 --> 16:57.660
Oh, it just says Dofi blog in Hiragana, I'm sorry.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.400
It's a bunch of Flash games.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
It's really crazy.

17:00.400 --> 17:09.880
I've been playing Cat with Bo Golf, which is crazy, and there's also Stick Remover and

17:09.880 --> 17:18.600
Double Wires, Egg Way, San San San, X Snow Cats, Neko Breakout, War of the Hell, Slug

17:18.600 --> 17:28.160
Slayer, rolling Omosubi, and a bunch of other weirdo games involving cats.

17:28.160 --> 17:35.120
I highly recommend X Snow Cats, that one's fun.

17:35.120 --> 17:42.520
Egg Way is kind of retarded, and gets really weird, and then Double Wires is kind of neat.

17:42.520 --> 17:48.240
It's almost like a stick Spiderman, and you have to navigate your way across the screen.

17:48.240 --> 18:01.960
The website is ishi.blog2.fc2.com, and you can get to everything from there, ishi.blog2.fc2.com.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.440
Which you have conveniently posted in chat for our listeners, I see.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.440
Of course I have.

18:05.440 --> 18:10.960
Thank you, DarkSakura, upstanding citizen.

18:10.960 --> 18:15.760
Moving on, Data East, I looked them up on Wikipedia to figure out what went on.

18:15.760 --> 18:21.400
They went under on June 25, 2003, is when they filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court,

18:21.400 --> 18:26.280
and their intellectual properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, who's a Japanese

18:26.280 --> 18:30.760
mobile game content provider, which explains how we have burger time on cell phones, because

18:30.760 --> 18:32.960
I have seen that game in recent years.

18:32.960 --> 18:37.200
So maybe you'll see bad dudes in a few years on phones, I don't know.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.920
Are you a bad enough dude to have a milkshake?

18:39.920 --> 18:44.440
But Data East went under, they did have a brief stint in pinball, and they did some

18:44.440 --> 18:53.360
pretty good tables, Guns N' Roses, The Simpsons, Robocop, and they purchased Stern Electronics,

18:53.360 --> 18:58.560
and then something changed and they made Stern Pinball, I think, and then they sold it all

18:58.560 --> 18:59.560
to Sega.

18:59.560 --> 19:06.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, Stern is their own company.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.880
In fact, Stern is the company that released the Pirates of the Caribbean pinball a couple

19:10.880 --> 19:15.400
months ago, and I think they also released the Family Guy pinball.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.640
Okay, I get it, I see.

19:17.640 --> 19:23.000
Data East exited the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 96, and the USA

19:23.000 --> 19:27.720
division had already been transferred to Sega as part of a debt settlement, and then the

19:27.720 --> 19:31.400
pinball factory changed hands one more time with Gary Stern purchasing the factory in

19:31.400 --> 19:34.040
99 and renaming it Stern Pinball.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.520
So there you go, that's what happened.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.640
And Stern is still giving us our pinball.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
There you go.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.240
But unfortunately no more Data East.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.640
No more Kid Nicky Radical Ninja, I'm sorry to say.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.560
No more Bump N' Jump kids, or Ring King.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.240
I know, Bump N' Jump was rad.

19:50.240 --> 19:55.360
Anyway, but you do get plenty of Super Smash Brothers Brawl because that wasn't by Data

19:55.360 --> 19:59.160
East, that's by people completely different, and of course that is one of the most anticipated

19:59.160 --> 20:04.720
games coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and Loki, guess what, Loki, you're gonna love

20:04.720 --> 20:07.040
this news, Loki.

20:07.040 --> 20:13.160
Joo France, who is a Nintendo in France, they report on stuff.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.760
They have reported that the Japanese gaming magazine Game Lab has given word that Super

20:17.760 --> 20:24.640
Smash Brothers Brawl will have Tingle in it, your favorite Nintendo character of all time,

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
Tingle.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
Boo.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.320
From the Zelda series, of course.

20:28.320 --> 20:34.600
Tingle is the, he's every fairy's fairy, let's just put it that way, and he goes around

20:34.600 --> 20:36.720
spilling rupees and good times.

20:36.720 --> 20:41.200
I remember he was in the Four Swords game on GameCube, good times.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.560
So that would be great if Tingle shows up in the game.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.760
Has not been confirmed by Nintendo, it's still a rumor, but that would be pretty awesome

20:47.760 --> 20:49.880
if Tingle showed up in the game.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.200
If nothing else but to drop power-ups in, because, you know, it doesn't necessarily

20:54.200 --> 20:58.160
mean that Tingle is a character, could be that Tingle, you know, because, like, remember

20:58.160 --> 21:02.600
how like Pokemon showed up, like the Pokeballs would show up in the old one on GameCube,

21:02.600 --> 21:06.760
and you could just throw the Pokeballs and you had random, like, you know, like, what

21:06.760 --> 21:11.560
were some of the Pokemon that showed up randomly, like the Charizard and stuff would blow fire

21:11.560 --> 21:12.820
or whatever.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.040
So there you go.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.760
And with any luck, maybe Loki is secretly recording the voice of Tingle as we speak

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
for this upcoming game.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.560
I am not recording the voice for Tingle.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.560
God.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.560
It's horrible.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.360
Horrible, horrible.

21:27.360 --> 21:36.440
Apparently now, if you're flying Delta Air, you can check out some free demos for the

21:36.440 --> 21:43.320
DS, because now they have DS demo stations right there while you're waiting in line.

21:43.320 --> 21:49.960
And some demos you'll be able to try out, Brain Age, Cooking Mama, Elite Beat Agents,

21:49.960 --> 21:50.960
and Tomb Raider Legend.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.120
Of course, all those are free.

21:54.120 --> 21:58.360
Um, isn't this all the same shit that's in there usual?

21:58.360 --> 22:00.360
I want to see yes.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
Alright.

22:01.360 --> 22:06.280
So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, but this isn't much incentive to fly Delta, because

22:06.280 --> 22:09.720
if you think about it, like the Delta terminals are always right across from the airline you're

22:09.720 --> 22:13.680
really flying, so, you know, you're within range of the Nintendo kiosk, right?

22:13.680 --> 22:16.360
So you don't necessarily have to fly Delta.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.360
True.

22:17.360 --> 22:21.280
Unless you're in a place like the Sacramento Airport, where like Southwest dominates an

22:21.280 --> 22:24.800
entire wing of the airport and there's no Delta to be seen anywhere.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.920
I don't know, maybe that's just me.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.920
Moving right along.

22:30.920 --> 22:38.840
Well, there is some good news for our friends in Europe, is that Final Fantasy VI Advance

22:38.840 --> 22:42.760
will be released on June 29th.

22:42.760 --> 22:47.140
It has, you know, I've actually got the game, although to be honest I have yet to play it.

22:47.140 --> 22:57.560
You have the Soul Shrine that gives you a bunch of monsters to beat up and a Kaiser

22:57.560 --> 23:05.640
Dragon boss and a music player, but other than that it's the same game, except that

23:05.640 --> 23:07.280
you have no Vanish X-Zone.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.920
Oh, they took X-Zone out of the game?

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
No.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
You have no Vanish X-Zone.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
Oh, the trick.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.920
The combo.

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
Okay, yeah, yeah.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
No Vanish X-Zone.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.280
What was the Vanish X-Zone combo?

23:19.280 --> 23:26.240
If you cast, what happens if you cast Vanish, is that it makes the enemies disappear, but

23:26.240 --> 23:31.000
it makes them I think vulnerable to all magic attacks, and then X-Zone sends them to another

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
dimension.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
So basically it ends the battle.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
X-Zone was like an insta-kill.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.280
X-Zone was an insta-kill, but it didn't always work.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.640
But if you used Vanish on the enemy first, it would always work.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.520
So interesting.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.280
I always used to just like casting reflect on all my characters and then just bouncing

23:46.280 --> 23:48.320
the spells off there, even though I don't know if it did anything.

23:48.320 --> 23:53.000
It was just nice to see lightning hit four times or whatever.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Good times.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.320
Drunami would like to point out that Vanish Doom will also work.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.600
The Vanish Doom combo.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.520
I like, but still my favorite attack though in that entire game was Meteor, just because

24:02.520 --> 24:04.000
it looks cool.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.560
I never used the Vanish X-Zone CD.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.340
I actually thought X-Zone was kind of a dumb spell, just because, I don't know, I like

24:09.340 --> 24:13.080
to kill in the old-fashioned way, by the hand of my sword.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
Ultima?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.080
Yeah, or spamming Ultima.

24:15.080 --> 24:22.000
Well, the other thing though that I really, okay, what was, in the Final Fantasy games

24:22.000 --> 24:25.920
overall, what would you say is your one most useful spell?

24:25.920 --> 24:26.920
Oh my.

24:26.920 --> 24:27.920
That isn't Cure.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.920
Yeah, I was just going to say Cure.

24:30.920 --> 24:31.920
Curaga?

24:31.920 --> 24:32.920
That isn't in the family of Cure.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.920
Protect.

24:33.920 --> 24:39.000
Oh, no, I rarely use Protect, unless it's Fantasy XI.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.600
The number one spell I would use, Fire III, I guess.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.280
Oh, where it has their MP every time?

24:48.280 --> 24:53.120
No, Demi quarters their HP every time.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.440
Oh, yeah, quarters their HP.

24:54.440 --> 25:00.920
No, Demi I thought was- Demi was a HP attack, and you had cast Demi III, and it was even

25:00.920 --> 25:02.200
more than that.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
75%.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.200
Yeah.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.200
What was the MP?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.680
And it would work on big enemies.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.120
There was one for MP.

25:09.120 --> 25:14.040
I don't remember.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.200
I didn't care about their MP as long as I could kill them before they hit me.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
No.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.800
JVMON says Demi and Bio for me.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.920
Bio was the other one.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.600
I love Bio, but Demi was like my big pro.

25:24.600 --> 25:29.440
Virus in IV was pretty rad, because it made that hideous noise whenever you cast it.

25:29.440 --> 25:33.920
It sounded like cats getting hit, and it sounded like cats in a burlap bag being hit with a

25:33.920 --> 25:37.120
bat when you cast Virus on the enemy.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.480
I just like the chainsaw.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.480
That was rad.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.200
That's why I love VI, was that you did the little commands with, what was it, Sabin was

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
his name, right?

25:46.200 --> 25:47.760
No, that was Edgar, I think.

25:47.760 --> 25:52.520
No, Edgar had the chainsaw, but Sabin had the ones where you did the Street Fighter

25:52.520 --> 25:53.880
stuff and he did special moves.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.280
That was so rad.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.280
He was really cool.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.280
God damn, that game was great.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
They're going to remake that.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.320
That'd be awesome if they do.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.320
I don't know.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.920
I'm still, I don't know.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.280
Don't mess with something that ain't broken, right?

26:04.280 --> 26:08.160
I don't know, but I am curious to check out this Final Fantasy VI advance.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.720
I know, I need to buy the advance one.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.720
It's awesome.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.720
All right.

26:11.720 --> 26:17.920
Hey, Gsuck68 in chat says, Demi sucks, especially against most stronger enemies since they're

26:17.920 --> 26:20.880
immune to it.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.680
Not if you make them not immune to it.

26:22.680 --> 26:26.400
RasteelUT says, Virus equals bio, translations.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.680
I thought it was Virus and 4 and then bio in the later games.

26:30.680 --> 26:35.280
Maybe it was translations, I don't know, but it still made the dying cat noise.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.240
If you love Final Fantasy, then you must have this in your collection.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.280
You can get a Chocobo Magic Book mug.

26:41.280 --> 26:46.880
Yes, of course, NCSX, now I don't know how you guys feel about this company, NCSX.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.480
Do you use them, Dark Sakura?

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
Oh, yeah.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
NCSX is great.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
Okay.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.760
I wasn't, oh no, it's BuyRight is the one you hate, but they went under, right?

26:53.760 --> 26:55.160
Oh, hell yes.

26:55.160 --> 27:02.880
Okay, so NCSX, N-C-X-X, God damn it, N-C-S-X, live radio, is a place where you can buy these

27:02.880 --> 27:08.680
mugs for $18 a piece, these Chocobo mugs, and damn, they look cute.

27:08.680 --> 27:09.680
Look at that.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.680
Look at those little Chocobo mugs.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.680
Don't they look cute?

27:11.680 --> 27:12.680
It reminds me of my- I thought you'd eat your Batsmaru one.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.840
I know, my Batsmaru mug, which I do use once in a while for coffee for my Hello Kitty coffee

27:16.840 --> 27:18.840
maker.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.560
Maybe I should get a Chocobo mug to go along with this.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.640
You should get me one too.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.640
Cute coffee mugs are awesome.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.640
Second drink out of a bird's head.

27:23.640 --> 27:27.160
Maybe I'm going to go on a shopping spree at NCSX any day now.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
I might have to think about that.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.280
You can buy the handheld beat manias too.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.400
Why should I buy a present for you?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
What have you done for me?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.320
What haven't I done for you?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.320
A lot.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.320
Oh.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.040
What have you done for me lately?

27:39.040 --> 27:45.720
Anyways, like most of those promo deals out there, there's a new one now to give a Wii

27:45.720 --> 27:48.240
for free.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.800
The way you do it is Gamefly, they're running a promotion where you persuade five of your

27:52.800 --> 27:58.200
friends to sign up, and in return, they'll send you a free Wii six weeks later.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.080
What people are doing is having their friends sign up, giving them like 10 bucks each to

28:01.080 --> 28:08.800
do that, and then canceling it after a set amount of time, and there you go, free Wii

28:08.800 --> 28:09.800
for 50 bucks.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.400
I did that for an iPod.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.160
So yeah, it's kind of like that scheme.

28:13.160 --> 28:19.520
Of course, my guesses are going to catch on to this pretty quick, and they will change

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
something.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.160
That shit really works, huh?

28:23.160 --> 28:26.080
Like we can get the free Xboxes, because I keep hearing this commercial on the radio

28:26.080 --> 28:34.600
for the free Xbox, and I'm always like, oh, schemes are so reek of shenanigans, but they

28:34.600 --> 28:35.600
really work, huh?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.200
I'll tell you how I did mine.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.480
They had this Blockbuster online thing.

28:39.480 --> 28:45.840
It was like Netflix, but Blockbuster, so it sucked, and if you sign up, they don't charge

28:45.840 --> 28:53.660
you for like two weeks during their trial, right, but it takes six days for them to transfer

28:53.660 --> 28:58.840
to the iPod site that you signed up for, so you cancel before they charge your credit

28:58.840 --> 29:04.800
card, and so me and five people did that, and I got a iPod, and then my iPod broke.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
So you got a cheap iPod.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
You got a reaper.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.880
I got one of the third edition iPods that they had the recall on.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.360
Ah, it sucks.

29:11.360 --> 29:17.320
All right, well, another scheme, of course, here on this program is our mailbag, and the

29:17.320 --> 29:21.560
joke is you can interact with us every week on our program by sending us emails to mailbag

29:21.560 --> 29:25.360
at orangesloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura likes to jump in there and pull out a few

29:25.360 --> 29:28.960
of her favorites and read them to you here live on air.

29:28.960 --> 29:38.400
So let's open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we got in this week's mailbag.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.880
The first email comes from a French nun.

29:41.880 --> 29:48.880
It says, Bonjour, DarkSakura, and please pardon my bad pronunciation because I am way, way

29:48.880 --> 29:49.880
out of practice.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.720
Christ, are all our emails actually in French this week?

29:52.720 --> 29:53.720
No, they're not.

29:53.720 --> 29:54.720
No, they're not.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.720
I was like, did they actually listen to you?

29:55.720 --> 30:03.000
It says, Vous avez une tres bevoir et j'adore vous entendre à la radio orange.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.120
Okay, yeah, I'm really good.

30:05.120 --> 30:09.640
Basically said I had a really good voice, and they like listening to the show.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.720
So I have a general comment.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.200
I find your show a little Xbox 360 heavy.

30:13.200 --> 30:18.440
While I understand that there is little to talk about in the PS3 world, my PS3 is accumulating

30:18.440 --> 30:22.800
dust extremely effectively, I'd love to hear you chat, argue, fight about other platforms

30:22.800 --> 30:27.600
such as DSPSP, cell phone games, and insert obscure platform here.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, the CDI.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Oh my God.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Anyway.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
We did, didn't we?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Listen to part A this week.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.280
It's like nothing but non-Xbox 360 stuff.

30:38.280 --> 30:42.280
I tuned in to hear about stuff I know nothing about, and to be honest, I buy games you guys

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
recommend.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.880
So talk about as many platforms as possible, fair enough, and then I'm going to translate

30:46.880 --> 30:47.880
this.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
Thank you, Sakura.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.880
Thank you.

30:49.880 --> 30:50.880
Okay.

30:50.880 --> 30:55.400
I'm still, my reading is not so bad.

30:55.400 --> 31:01.680
And good luck with the new massage profession.

31:01.680 --> 31:08.600
And this is a French Canadian listener who demands that we speak in French more.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
That's all I know.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
Anyway.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.600
Parlez vous, freeze pop.

31:15.600 --> 31:26.640
Thank you very much for the well wishes, and I'm actually going to be going, when I go

31:26.640 --> 31:31.860
back to school, I'm actually planning on, I took a whole bunch of French, and I used

31:31.860 --> 31:36.600
to be fairly conversational, so I'm going to go back and finish learning.

31:36.600 --> 31:44.000
And Robert M., I'm sorry, but this made me crack up, Poisson to Babble, for Babblefish.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.880
Are you going on to another email?

31:45.880 --> 31:47.440
Can I respond to the last one real quick?

31:47.440 --> 31:48.440
Please.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.440
Sorry.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.840
Oh, the Rob D. in chat says, OLR should cover the Sega CD more.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.840
Maybe we should.

31:52.840 --> 31:53.840
I don't know.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.840
No, I just want to say about the Xbox 360 thing.

31:54.840 --> 31:59.160
You got to realize, though, what platform has something coming out every week on it

31:59.160 --> 32:00.800
with the Xbox Live Arcade?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.080
There is the Xbox 360.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.600
It's kind of got the most steam when it comes to game releases right now.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.600
Let's face it.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.080
We're in a lull right now when it comes to the Wii.

32:07.080 --> 32:11.840
Yeah, we had Super Mario RPG, but there's really been no A-list titles since then or

32:11.840 --> 32:13.080
really anywhere near it.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.200
There was just that one.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.040
And then the PlayStation 3, well, you said yourself, your system's gathering dust.

32:18.040 --> 32:22.400
So I think that's why the show feels a little Xbox 360 heavy right now is because there's

32:22.400 --> 32:24.000
a little bit more to talk about there.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.040
But trust me, we're fans of all the systems.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.200
We don't want to be partial.

32:28.200 --> 32:32.280
We realize that if you do want Xbox 360 only content, there's other podcasts out there

32:32.280 --> 32:33.280
that'll give it to you.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.960
There's plenty of indie ones out there that are great that really focus on the Xbox.

32:36.960 --> 32:41.160
We do want to talk a little bit about everything, but when the news is Xbox heavy, our show's

32:41.160 --> 32:42.720
going to be Xbox heavy.

32:42.720 --> 32:46.440
But on a week like this where Sony had their gamer's day, part A was pretty much nothing

32:46.440 --> 32:47.440
but Sony.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.440
So we try.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.440
We try.

32:49.440 --> 32:55.240
But if you have a game you want us to talk about, email it and we'll talk about it.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
What is that?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
A taco.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
Oh, that's okay.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.840
People are always offering us tacos.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.400
Why aren't you on the show this week?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
I'll take the stuff inside of it.

33:03.400 --> 33:10.320
Because I got back too late and I'm better than you guys.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.960
I'll take the stuff inside the taco.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
Here you go.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
Just start digging.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.320
Do you have a fork?

33:15.320 --> 33:16.760
I do not, but I can go get you one.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.480
How was your gaming week real quick?

33:19.480 --> 33:22.400
I played a lot of Oh Andon 2 and I've already beaten it.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.400
I'm done.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.400
Oh shit.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.400
Nobody even mentions it.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.680
I'm so sorry to interrupt your mailbag, but we need to hear about Oh Andon 2.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.880
How is it?

33:29.880 --> 33:36.320
Let me first stress that I'm not a Japanophile in the least.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.720
So I don't care about J-pop.

33:37.720 --> 33:41.460
I don't like J-pop, but I like these games.

33:41.460 --> 33:50.000
So the music for me is sorely lacking, but it's harder than Oh Andon 1 and it doesn't

33:50.000 --> 33:52.560
quite have the same charm as the first game.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.600
Either Oh Andon 1 or Elite Beat Agents.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
But I like it.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.620
I would still say Elite Beat Agents is my favorite of the three, but Oh Andon 2 is better

34:00.620 --> 34:02.920
than Oh Andon 1 and I like that.

34:02.920 --> 34:03.920
It's really hard.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.080
Did they change anything with the basic game mechanics or not really?

34:07.080 --> 34:11.720
No, but they brought over the cool features from Elite Beat Agents where you can skip

34:11.720 --> 34:19.280
the intro and the last stage is actually divided into two songs and oddly enough, you can skip

34:19.280 --> 34:22.120
the endings for each songs now too, once you've beaten them.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.720
So it's kind of weird.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.240
Like if you're just replaying to get a better score.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.720
And it's good.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.280
And I've been playing Puzzle Quest also.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.280
Oh, how's that?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.280
I love it.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.040
I want to try that out before you leave.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
Okay.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.440
Well, I'm leaving like sometime tomorrow.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
Okay.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
Good.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.880
And I have a terrible backlog of DS games now.

34:40.880 --> 34:45.320
I have like six that I need to play or beat and it's depressing because I keep finding

34:45.320 --> 34:46.320
more I want.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.400
How hard was it to find a copy of Puzzle Quest?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.960
It was hard for me at the time.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
I found it last weekend.

34:50.960 --> 34:57.120
I found one at Best Buy, but I went to like EB and Best Buy this week and yeah, it's not

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
hard anymore.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.120
Oh, okay.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.120
Good.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.720
So they finally put out enough so people can get that if they want.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.520
Well, thank you Mikoltov.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
You're welcome.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
All right.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
And can you get her napkins for her taco?

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
Actually, I'm going to eat it.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.520
Okay.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
You're just going to eat the taco?

35:10.520 --> 35:11.520
Yeah.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.520
It's delicious.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
I'm going to start back tomorrow.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.520
Well, no.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.520
Good job, Shayne.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.520
Ruining diets everywhere.

35:16.520 --> 35:20.920
No, I've been good all day, but I think my headache is because I had so much sugar for

35:20.920 --> 35:24.320
two days and then like dropped all of it.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.840
So I need a buffer.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.400
Jamie, you're a good looking gal.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
Just eat the taco.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
You don't have to worry about that stuff.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
Yes, I do.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.400
The chatters.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.640
Jamie needs some love.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.880
Tell her she has nice boobies or something.

35:34.880 --> 35:35.880
I don't.

35:35.880 --> 35:41.040
No, I don't because I figured I dropped 80, right?

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
Right.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.720
And then I gained back 15.

35:44.720 --> 35:48.480
So I'm going to be going back to the gym and everything because I still have a little bit

35:48.480 --> 35:49.480
more to go.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.480
I need to lose some too.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.480
I'm starting to get a little bit.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
Go to the gym with me.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
We'll see.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
Okay.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.480
We'll see.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.480
Oh, God.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
Loki just did the most foul thing with his belly.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.480
That was disgusting.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.480
He shook it.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.480
Oh, my God.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
That was weird.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
All right.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.960
Anyhow, sorry, mailbag.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.960
Okay.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
Yeah.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.160
Robert M., you're funny.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
And by the way, there was not.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
Look at chat.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.160
Look at chat.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
What?

36:13.160 --> 36:14.160
There's Jamie Love.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.400
Look at that.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.400
That's why you do this show, right?

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
For your ego.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.880
I'm not starving myself.

36:19.880 --> 36:20.880
She's not, but.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
I eat.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.880
I'm not eating.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.880
No, no, no, no.

36:23.880 --> 36:24.880
Okay.

36:24.880 --> 36:31.000
What I want to tell you guys is that diabetes, there's a tendency toward it in my family.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.920
And it's not a matter of aesthetics or anything like that.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.720
It's a matter of preventing disease on the way.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.440
Jamie, that taco's not going to give you diabetes.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
I know, but I'm.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.440
Your mic isn't on.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.440
Say the joke again.

36:44.440 --> 36:48.720
It'll give you something else that starts with a D.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.240
No, no.

36:51.240 --> 36:56.160
The whole reason being is that I'm cutting back on my sugars because my blood sugar actually

36:56.160 --> 36:59.120
was fairly borderline at my last blood test.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.800
So I'm trying to avoid diabetes.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.400
And that is the reason why.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
All right.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.400
All right.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.440
Sorry to get on the tangent and get all depressing here on the program.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.800
That and exercise is supposed to actually help with chronic fatigue syndrome because

37:11.800 --> 37:14.960
I'm also trying to get myself off my meds.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
Just eat the fucking taco.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
I will after I'm done doing the fucking email.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
Oh my God.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.960
I'd eat it, but I don't like Mexican food.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.240
So you know, that's just kind of weird.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
Email.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.640
Bite my ass.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.880
And no, there was not a home release of dragon flare on laser desk.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.000
Okay.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Was that the email?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Yes.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
That was from.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.800
You didn't even read the poor guy's email.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.680
You just yelled at it.

37:38.680 --> 37:42.320
It wasn't in really bad grammar.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.320
He said so himself.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.320
He's babble fish.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.320
I'm sorry.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.320
Plus song to babble.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.320
Anyway.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.320
Next email.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.080
Hey dark Sakura, Loki in sky.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
Wait, wait.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
Time out.

37:53.080 --> 37:58.640
Um, GZ, DR for Evie, dude, those boobs.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.520
One of those nipples is a fucking comma.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.180
So what are you trying to say?

38:02.180 --> 38:04.600
One of her nipples is fucked up looking.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.000
Sorry.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Derail the whole show.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
What was that?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I hope that wasn't about my boobs.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.560
He was making asking nipples and apparently one of your boobs is leaking because I used

38:16.560 --> 38:20.080
a comma instead of a dot.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.040
That's that's how come no one draws my boobs in chat.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.040
Yeah.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.040
That's lactating.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.040
Boob.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.040
Can I read the email?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.040
Yes.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.040
Thank you.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
Sorry guys.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.040
In the other room.

38:31.040 --> 38:38.080
Um, dark Sakura to add the Monday on email and for say don't to uh, no, okay, whatever.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.080
Okay.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
I asked for an email in French.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.920
Therefore I'm getting an email in French.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.040
Um, and he loves our podcast.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.720
So my friend just gotten really rusty, but I tried anyway.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.040
I wanted to know a couple of things.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.240
One, what is the deal with nights on the, we, is it still happening and when?

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
Um, yeah.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.280
I don't know.

38:53.280 --> 38:57.240
And what SNES RPG needs a DS remake the most?

38:57.240 --> 39:03.920
And I'm going to say, um, Rob, second Densetsu three, but I want them to put out mother three

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
in America.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.520
JVMON drew my boobs bigger than yours.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.080
You have special pumped up boobs.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.680
My nipples are the size of like dollars.

39:14.680 --> 39:17.800
Nights um, I don't know.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.680
It's more of a Christmas game for me, I think.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
Oh really?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.960
Because it has that kind of night Christmas, didn't they have Christmas nights?

39:23.960 --> 39:24.960
Yeah.

39:24.960 --> 39:25.960
Yeah.

39:25.960 --> 39:26.960
It's, it's more of a Christmas game for me.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
You think?

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
I think.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.960
Yeah.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
I think nights could be around Christmas.

39:30.960 --> 39:31.960
Yeah.

39:31.960 --> 39:32.960
They should release a Christmas nights as well.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.960
Okay.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.720
Well, um, I don't know if I've told, well, I've mentioned this several times.

39:35.720 --> 39:40.440
Um, Christmas nights is actually, um, a, uh, a tradition at my house.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.800
We break out the Saturn and we play Christmas nights up until Christmas day.

39:43.800 --> 39:44.800
Nerd.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.280
What was the other part of the question?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.760
Games that should be redone or something?

39:48.760 --> 39:51.120
Um, RPGs that should be released for the DS.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.600
RPGs that should be released for the DS.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Guardian legend.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.600
Okay.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.600
Maybe that was an RPG.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.840
Well, it's, it's, it's still a game that I want.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.400
It's an adventure shooter.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
Close enough.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.960
I just want the guardian legend love.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.680
Um, and I want to stop whining.

40:07.680 --> 40:13.800
Um, how about the illusion of Gaia series or the whole, uh, Enix like soul blazer.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.800
What was it?

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
Um, soul blazer.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.720
Oh my God, Shane, this is a good taco.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
Yes.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.760
And illusion of Gaia and there was a third one, brain Lord.

40:22.760 --> 40:23.760
That's the other one.

40:23.760 --> 40:24.760
Brain Lord.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.760
I want that whole series on DS.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.760
Okay.

40:26.760 --> 40:27.760
Next email.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.760
Yes.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.960
Unless you had anyone that you wanted to seek him out.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.960
Huh?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.800
What RPG would you like to see come out for the DS?

40:33.800 --> 40:34.800
Taco the RPG.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.800
For the DS?

40:36.800 --> 40:39.400
Uh, remake, remake.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.360
Super Mario RPG.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.240
Where the fuck is my game?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.560
Taco.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.520
Jiranami says it was not brain Lord, it was Terra Nigma.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.520
Next up.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.520
Um, okay.

40:52.520 --> 40:58.440
With the Xbox 360 keyboard, do you think World of Warcraft will come to the 360?

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
Why or why not?

40:59.440 --> 41:00.440
Um, no.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.440
And you don't need to know why.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.220
No, I'm kidding.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.220
That's from Daniel.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.560
I kid you not.

41:06.560 --> 41:13.960
Every time the, the video rep comes down to our work, we ask them that same question.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.640
Is World of Warcraft coming to the 360?

41:16.640 --> 41:21.820
And every time he says it's never coming to the 360 ever, probably because he hates us

41:21.820 --> 41:23.360
asking him that question.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.000
I don't think it's happening either.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.720
I think Blizzard, if they're going to do something on the consoles, they will make a game specifically

41:29.720 --> 41:30.720
for consoles.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.560
I don't think they're going to port their game.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.560
They don't really need to.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.400
I mean, everybody has a computer.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.040
People that don't even play PC games play World of Warcraft.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
Okay.

41:39.040 --> 41:43.080
You're only seeing games that are ported to that when they need more users.

41:43.080 --> 41:48.000
World of Warcraft is not really having any trouble with not a large enough user base.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.200
I mean, Blizzard probably figures if you have an Xbox 360, you also probably have a computer

41:53.200 --> 41:54.680
capable of playing World of Warcraft.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
Yeah.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.400
And also, I mean, World of Warcraft runs on almost anything.

41:58.400 --> 42:03.500
I mean, as far as like, you know, Linux, Mac OS, you know, Windows.

42:03.500 --> 42:08.880
So it's not like it's a graphically intensive game.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
Right.

42:09.880 --> 42:14.160
And, uh, the last email, oh my God, Rob, I'm so sorry.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.160
What?

42:15.160 --> 42:16.160
Oh, the chat?

42:16.160 --> 42:19.880
I just got unbanned from- I'm just ignoring the chat now.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.880
This is from SacraMax.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.080
I just got unbanned from Orange Lounge.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.740
Remember to plug that if you haven't, and I want to say, screw you, Rob Jamie is cooler

42:27.740 --> 42:28.740
than you.

42:28.740 --> 42:29.740
I hate you.

42:29.740 --> 42:34.420
I'm not even going to respond to it.

42:34.420 --> 42:37.600
But I think that the thing is, the signature is the funny part.

42:37.600 --> 42:41.480
Whoops, Rob gets eaten by a grew youngest OLR member, wishes World of Warcraft would

42:41.480 --> 42:45.680
work on his computer, Pocky lover and Vietnamese otaku, hell yeah.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.680
Whatever.

42:46.680 --> 42:47.680
Okay.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.680
Rob, heart.

42:48.680 --> 42:49.680
Yeah, whatever.

42:49.680 --> 42:50.680
All right.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.680
Is that all the emails?

42:51.680 --> 42:52.680
Yes.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
All right.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.480
If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.760
How about some Rob fan mail next week?

42:58.760 --> 42:59.760
After that email.

42:59.760 --> 43:03.120
I want some Rob fan mail that Jamie has to read word for word on the air.

43:03.120 --> 43:06.840
Rob fan mail in French.

43:06.840 --> 43:07.840
Or in Spanish or something.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.240
How about a language Jamie doesn't know that I know a little bit of?

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
How about Spanish?

43:11.240 --> 43:14.400
I want Spanish love for me.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.600
No love for Loki ever.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.800
What?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.720
Moving on to, yeah, that's right.

43:19.720 --> 43:23.200
Moving on to another story talking about Nintendo.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.760
Nintendo is following up a contest in some ways.

43:26.760 --> 43:31.480
Microsoft just recently said that they would like original TV pilots because something

43:31.480 --> 43:34.080
that they're going to distribute on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

43:34.080 --> 43:38.120
Well, now Nintendo has come out and said they're going to be holding this contest called the

43:38.120 --> 43:40.760
Shortcut Shortcase.

43:40.760 --> 43:44.640
The top three entries will be premiered at Rockefeller Center's annual summer film

43:44.640 --> 43:45.640
showcase.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
Shortcase?

43:46.640 --> 43:47.640
I'm thinking of shortcake.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.920
I must be hungry.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.440
The theme is Nintendo.

43:51.440 --> 43:57.560
The movies can be action, comedy, drama, whatever, as long as it has Nintendo hardware or Nintendo

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
characters.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.920
There you have it.

43:59.920 --> 44:03.520
The first place winner gets 10 grand and a trip to New York for the premiere and a lunch

44:03.520 --> 44:09.400
meeting with the Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatcoff.

44:09.400 --> 44:12.440
The top three entries all get Nintendo goodies.

44:12.440 --> 44:18.720
You have until June 6th to get it together, so there's already a lot of Nintendo fanboy

44:18.720 --> 44:22.540
stuff on YouTube, so this shouldn't be too hard for most people.

44:22.540 --> 44:31.280
Get crackin' if you want to be a famous filmmaker.

44:31.280 --> 44:37.840
One person that's not going to be featured in an upcoming live action Metal Gear Solid

44:37.840 --> 44:41.400
movie would unfortunately be the voice of Snake David Hayter.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.560
He will not have anything to do with the movie Fangirls Cry.

44:45.560 --> 44:50.640
That makes me sad.

44:50.640 --> 44:57.200
Basically they were asking him what his thoughts were on it and he's basically saying they're

44:57.200 --> 45:03.640
taking Metal Gear as an apocalypse now of the digital age or something like that.

45:03.640 --> 45:04.640
I don't know.

45:04.640 --> 45:09.400
Hopefully it's not going to suck, but after looking at his headshot here I can see why

45:09.400 --> 45:15.720
they don't want to go with him for Snake right now because man, the dude needs a haircut.

45:15.720 --> 45:16.720
He looks like Joey Fatone.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.560
That snake was running around with a mullet.

45:18.560 --> 45:29.320
He looks like he's about ready to join a ren fair.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.680
Snake was running around Metal Gear Solid 2 with a mullet.

45:31.680 --> 45:41.200
Yeah, but he has guns and he's not a real special op guy, so I don't know, whatever.

45:41.200 --> 45:52.660
Speaking of whatever, there's a next generation Wolfenstein in the works and they're stating

45:52.660 --> 45:57.400
that it should be actually out in 2008.

45:57.400 --> 46:02.420
It's being put out by Raven, so that's happy.

46:02.420 --> 46:06.280
Will it be like the old school Wolfenstein 3D or the more met Castle Wolfenstein game

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
that came out later?

46:07.280 --> 46:08.280
What was that called?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.280
Return to Wolfenstein or whatever that game was?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
Return to Castle Wolfenstein?

46:10.280 --> 46:11.760
Yeah, I didn't care for that one.

46:11.760 --> 46:14.720
Oh my gosh, Shane, this was the best taco.

46:14.720 --> 46:22.280
It was more like one of those war sim games.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.600
I just liked being able to shoot up Hitler and the war mech.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.680
That was awesome in the old school 3D game.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.680
Remember that?

46:28.680 --> 46:29.680
Forget it.

46:29.680 --> 46:40.260
Speaking of things of a questionable nature, there was a Flash game created about the Virginia

46:40.260 --> 46:41.260
Tech rampage.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.440
It was a Flash game.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.440
This game was created by this guy, Ryan Lamborn.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.440
This is interesting.

46:48.440 --> 46:55.120
Basically, he made a Flash game that kind of glamorized the whole Virginia Tech shooting.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.480
You could take part in it, whatever.

46:57.480 --> 47:02.480
Obviously, this is very controversial, but what's interesting is what this author chose

47:02.480 --> 47:07.840
to do in response to it, quote, Attention angry people, I will take this game down from

47:07.840 --> 47:11.880
Newgrounds if the donation amount reaches $1,000 US.

47:11.880 --> 47:16.760
I'll take it down from here if it reaches $2,000 US, and I will apologize if it reaches

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
$3,000 US.

47:17.760 --> 47:23.560
Of course, he never really says what the donations will go to besides his pocket.

47:23.560 --> 47:29.540
I believe Newgrounds ended up taking the damn thing down anyway, but kind of interesting

47:29.540 --> 47:32.040
that he kind of blackmailed the internet to take this game down.

47:32.040 --> 47:37.400
He also said that he was joking about the whole wanting to collect money.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.160
Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't really take it that way.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.160
He did.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.160
Later, there was an update.

47:42.160 --> 47:45.660
The donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game

47:45.660 --> 47:46.660
down.

47:46.660 --> 47:49.500
I didn't think anyone would donate money to it, and so far, my PayPal account has proven

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
me right.

47:50.500 --> 47:51.500
I don't know.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.840
That seems like an afterthought excuse, doesn't it?

47:53.840 --> 47:54.840
Yeah.

47:54.840 --> 47:58.960
He's just probably thinking, well, maybe some dumb sucker will... If it was a joke, he

47:58.960 --> 48:01.760
would have probably not put his PayPal account on there.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.480
What a weirdo.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.960
Who cares?

48:04.960 --> 48:06.960
It's just some dumb ass trying to get attention just like...

48:06.960 --> 48:11.320
I'm all for freedom of speech and all, but I don't know, and in a way, the media just

48:11.320 --> 48:14.040
shouldn't even cover it, and that's really what it should be.

48:14.040 --> 48:17.560
If you don't want this guy to make any money off it, don't fucking cover it so people don't

48:17.560 --> 48:18.560
know about it.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.360
I don't think anybody would have found it otherwise.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.640
Media should take some responsibility, even the gaming blogs and stuff.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.680
Don't fucking cover it if it's in poor taste.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
Don't write about it.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.080
I probably shouldn't even... God, I'm being a hypocrite right now.

48:30.080 --> 48:33.220
I probably shouldn't have said anything about it, but it sounds like the game's already

48:33.220 --> 48:34.220
down.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.000
That's what I'm going off of, so whatever.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.920
We come full circle to talking about GameTap again and what they're doing correct.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.800
This is actually very cool.

48:44.800 --> 48:50.840
GameTap has announced that they're doing an animated series called Revisioned, and what

48:50.840 --> 49:01.720
it basically is, each season is going to focus on basically a game series or a game character.

49:01.720 --> 49:06.600
For example, the first series that's up is Tomb Raider, and it's also going to be animated

49:06.600 --> 49:12.040
by Warren Ellis, Peter Chung, and Jim Lee, to give you an idea.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.040
That's cool.

49:13.040 --> 49:19.000
It's basically Animatrix, but for games, so it's yet another original thing that they're

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
actually doing.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
It's going to be pretty awesome.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.520
I'd like to see some DVDs for this because that might be something worth checking out.

49:25.520 --> 49:31.800
I want to see what they do beyond Tomb Raider, though, because that'd be pretty cool.

49:31.800 --> 49:34.440
Doesn't GameTap have some type of deal with Tomb Raider right now?

49:34.440 --> 49:36.960
There's going to be a Tomb Raider thing, a special edition thing?

49:36.960 --> 49:38.240
There's a ton of stuff coming out of there.

49:38.240 --> 49:41.040
I'm not feeling the Tomb Raider love, I'm sorry to say.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.040
Oh well.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.040
Whatever.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.840
If that's what they want to do, I guess.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.480
I never even saw the movies, ever.

49:46.480 --> 49:50.360
Although if you're interested in checking out to see what it's going to look like, they

49:50.360 --> 49:56.520
are going to have a little bit on the Tomb Raider GameTap collection website.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.960
It's TombRader.GameTap.com.

49:58.960 --> 50:04.120
You can check out a trailer for this new cartoon series.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
Let's see.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.240
Ross Steel in chat says, animated series on GameTap.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.160
Oh God, it's Captain N all over again.

50:10.160 --> 50:14.040
It Stun says, I think Tomb Raider Legend was going to be sold cheap on GameTap, if not

50:14.040 --> 50:15.040
free.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.040
All right.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.560
That's why we love having a chat nearby.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.240
They always like to correct us when we're wrong.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.640
Tap.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

50:21.640 --> 50:25.600
If you don't want to do it by chat, well, shit, you can always call us.

50:25.600 --> 50:31.160
You can call us 1-877-GAME-OLR and I'm pleased to say the Skype line is open.

50:31.160 --> 50:35.400
You need to pick up the phone and call us at that number 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give

50:35.400 --> 50:36.520
us a call on Skype.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.920
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

50:38.920 --> 50:44.320
All one word because the nice thing about that is that the 1-877 is a toll free number

50:44.320 --> 50:46.280
but only in the US and Canada.

50:46.280 --> 50:50.400
If you use the Skype line instead, you can be anywhere in the world and still call us

50:50.400 --> 50:51.400
for free.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.040
All right.

50:53.040 --> 50:57.040
Let's go to the phones and we'll take this call right here.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.920
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio.

50:58.920 --> 50:59.920
Who's this?

50:59.920 --> 51:00.920
Hi, DMN.

51:00.920 --> 51:01.920
What do you want?

51:01.920 --> 51:05.960
Oh, I'm so glad.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.440
It's really you this week.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.440
What's up?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.440
Yeah, I'm glad to.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.920
I'm out of impersonations right now.

51:12.920 --> 51:19.680
However, I'm calling on behalf of DJ Tyrant to say one thing and if you'll excuse me,

51:19.680 --> 51:23.680
I'll put the phone away from my mouse because I don't want everyone's speakers to explode.

51:23.680 --> 51:24.680
One second.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.680
Okay.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.680
StarCraft 2!

51:26.680 --> 51:27.680
Oh my God!

51:27.680 --> 51:28.680
Okay.

51:28.680 --> 51:31.720
Now we've gotten that out of the way.

51:31.720 --> 51:35.000
Why is DJ Tyrant so excited about StarCraft 2?

51:35.000 --> 51:38.720
DJ Tyrant is OLR's resident Blizzard fanboy.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
Yeah.

51:39.720 --> 51:40.720
Just real quick.

51:40.720 --> 51:41.720
Sorry.

51:41.720 --> 51:42.720
I'm sorry to interrupt real quick.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.800
I'm just going to come back to that Tomb Raider animated series thing.

51:45.800 --> 51:51.240
It's being animated and written by the guy that did Aeon Flux.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
So that's pretty awesome.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.160
Suddenly this has scored a lot of cool points in my book.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.160
Yes.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.160
Interesting.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.160
Maybe I'll like Tomb Raider.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.160
Now I may actually watch the first ten seconds.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
Oh wait.

51:59.160 --> 52:00.160
This is the first five.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
It's coming July 10th.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.160
That's when the series is starting.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.160
Thank you.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.160
So OMG!

52:04.160 --> 52:05.160
StarCraft 2!

52:05.160 --> 52:06.160
Well, what about you?

52:06.160 --> 52:09.640
What are you feeling about StarCraft 2?

52:09.640 --> 52:17.240
I've played StarCraft a little bit in my youth almost ten years ago.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.760
Not a huge fan of the real-time strategy genre.

52:19.760 --> 52:20.760
Yeah.

52:20.760 --> 52:21.760
You know, that's my problem.

52:21.760 --> 52:25.160
I never really played StarCraft because I wasn't a fan of the real-time strategy series.

52:25.160 --> 52:29.200
I'll tell you, if this announcement had been Diablo 3, I would have had a total fan-gasm.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.200
Yeah.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.720
I think you and I both would have.

52:32.720 --> 52:37.200
I love Diablo, but seeing as the announcement was happening in Korea, I think everyone did

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
their math.

52:38.200 --> 52:42.200
2 plus 2 equals 5 and all that stuff.

52:42.200 --> 52:46.880
But I'm also calling to announce the Phoenix Down usage on SDFU.

52:46.880 --> 52:50.640
Okay, what's this all about?

52:50.640 --> 52:54.440
We put our show on hiatus, one, because I've been going through a lot of personal turmoil

52:54.440 --> 53:00.240
and now that's kind of subsiding and I feel my crazy, normal self.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.640
We're revamping the format of SDFU.

53:02.640 --> 53:08.840
For any people who were introduced to my antics in the chat room earlier last year, you know

53:08.840 --> 53:11.840
I used to do a little around the horn thing and I scored people's arguments.

53:11.840 --> 53:15.480
Well, now we're turning it into a show.

53:15.480 --> 53:22.560
DJ Tyrant and three chatters from OLR's chat room will face each other off each week and

53:22.560 --> 53:26.840
the winner gets to finish the show with me.

53:26.840 --> 53:31.080
So wait, now I know you have a lot of special guests that come on, like you've had some

53:31.080 --> 53:35.640
of the Destructoid bloggers on the program and you've had bigger names on your program

53:35.640 --> 53:36.960
than we've had on this program.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.520
So are you going to invite them to play along with you guys?

53:39.520 --> 53:41.160
Oh, absolutely.

53:41.160 --> 53:43.200
And I guess you guys can come play, too.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.960
Oh, we get to come play DMN's little game, too?

53:45.960 --> 53:46.960
Oh, nice.

53:46.960 --> 53:47.960
Aww.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
Aww.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Well, maybe I don't want to play your game.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.960
I'm just kidding.

53:50.960 --> 53:51.960
Well, I'll come on at some point, for sure.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.520
I can't speak for the others, but I will.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.520
Okay.

53:54.520 --> 53:55.520
All right.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.900
I can't think of anything else, though.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.960
I guess it's time to hang up on me.

53:59.960 --> 54:00.960
All right.

54:00.960 --> 54:01.960
Bye.

54:01.960 --> 54:02.960
All right.

54:02.960 --> 54:03.960
Let's go to another call.

54:03.960 --> 54:04.960
I really did hang up on him, by the way.

54:04.960 --> 54:05.960
Hi.

54:05.960 --> 54:06.960
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

54:06.960 --> 54:07.960
Who's this?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.960
Legend of Zaku.

54:08.960 --> 54:09.960
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

54:09.960 --> 54:10.960
What's up?

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
Fine.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Uh, yeah.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
Just nothing much.

54:13.960 --> 54:21.520
I just went in on the break yesterday, played some Distorted, Poppin' 14, Pump It Up Pro.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.520
What's wrong with...

54:22.520 --> 54:23.520
What's...

54:23.520 --> 54:24.520
Wait, wait.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.040
What are you booing Pump It Up Pro for over here, Shane?

54:26.040 --> 54:27.040
No, I'm not.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.040
What?

54:28.040 --> 54:29.040
I'm sorry.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.040
Sorry.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.040
There's a confusion in the studio.

54:32.040 --> 54:33.040
Give Shane a mic.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.040
Damn it.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.360
I said boo Pump It Up Pro.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.080
Why boo Pump It Up Pro?

54:38.080 --> 54:43.120
Because it's by the guys that do In The Groove, and the step charts suck from what I've seen.

54:43.120 --> 54:44.120
Oh, I see.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.120
That one.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
Yeah.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
And it's got crap music.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
It's all right, though.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.120
Okay.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
Think about it.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
It's like In The Groove.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.120
It's already bad.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.120
It's already Pump It Up having a love child.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.120
Shane, put it down for a minute.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.120
You're obviously biased.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
I want to hear Zaku's opinion.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.120
What?

54:57.120 --> 54:58.120
No, I mean, I played it.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.320
It pretty much is step mania.

55:00.320 --> 55:05.360
It's like End of Mural found step mania and found a good use for it, and just mashed Cold

55:05.360 --> 55:08.680
War songs in addition to their banya and K-pop.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.560
So Pump It Up and In The Groove had sex, and this is their baby.

55:11.560 --> 55:12.560
Yeah.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.280
You pretty much have modifiers that you would normally find in step mania.

55:15.280 --> 55:21.520
Mines, C400, Speed.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.440
It plays pretty much better.

55:23.440 --> 55:28.960
Since 8 on the Breakout, the high end cabinet for beta testing, so that's a nice high def

55:28.960 --> 55:30.500
TV to go with it.

55:30.500 --> 55:34.000
You know, I was talking with Kyle on email last month trying to get him on the show,

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
and we just lost...

55:35.000 --> 55:36.680
I need to email him again and try to get him on the show.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.680
I'd love to have him and Shane on the same show.

55:38.680 --> 55:39.680
That would be a good time.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.360
I doubt he'll be able to spill the beans.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.360
I know.

55:42.360 --> 55:43.360
He's pretty tight-lipped.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.360
Yeah, it'll still be fun.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.480
Anyway, so what else have you been up to in your gaming world lately?

55:47.480 --> 55:53.400
Yeah, as I said, not only does 8 on the Breakout Pump It Up for beta testing, but New Jersey,

55:53.400 --> 55:59.680
he also has 2DX distorted and Pop'n Music 14.

55:59.680 --> 56:00.680
How is that?

56:00.680 --> 56:03.640
Pop'n Music 14, Jesus Christ, they keep cranking those things out.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.520
I mean, we're catching up to...

56:05.520 --> 56:10.240
You know, 8 on the Break's catching up to TGA at this point.

56:10.240 --> 56:13.520
So what are you doing, opening a candy bar?

56:13.520 --> 56:16.400
No, it's just an oatmeal bar.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.140
How is Pop'n Music 14?

56:19.140 --> 56:21.220
It's a lot better, though.

56:21.220 --> 56:25.280
It's a lot better than the one that I'm used to over in Queens, the one that we, the Pop'n

56:25.280 --> 56:26.280
8 that I go to.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.280
Do you have a case of the Munchies right now?

56:28.280 --> 56:29.280
Almost.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.280
I'm not high, though.

56:30.280 --> 56:32.840
I'm just a little hungry tonight.

56:32.840 --> 56:38.380
Yeah, besides that, just, you know, I just heard, you know, just, you know, pretty up

56:38.380 --> 56:40.880
over the whole StarCraft II thing.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.440
I've heard about that.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.720
Are you excited about StarCraft II?

56:43.720 --> 56:44.720
Are you a big RTS fan?

56:44.720 --> 56:49.360
Well, it's been, yeah, it's been almost a decade since they actually, you know, it was

56:49.360 --> 56:52.760
actually released the first one, so I've been itching to play it.

56:52.760 --> 56:57.320
The only thing that'll bother me is if Koreans, you know, the South Koreans start cheating

56:57.320 --> 57:00.560
on it and start, you know, bringing it down and battling it.

57:00.560 --> 57:03.000
All right, Korea, no cheating.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.160
Yeah, that's the only thing I worry about, but if anything, we'll just keep it to a land,

57:07.160 --> 57:10.120
you know, we'll just keep it to strictly land games.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.120
All right.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.960
Like something you can do after work.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.240
I still wish it had been Diablo III, though, but hey, I'll give it a try.

57:17.240 --> 57:18.760
Blizzard puts out some quality shit.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.920
I mean, they, I mean, seriously, what has Blizzard done wrong?

57:21.920 --> 57:23.800
They're really, I can't think of a lot, a lot.

57:23.800 --> 57:26.800
The only thing they need is World of StarCraft, and that's it, and they're set.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.360
I don't know about that.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.360
All right.

57:29.360 --> 57:34.240
All right, Zaku, we gotta let you go, but have another oatmeal bar for me, buddy.

57:34.240 --> 57:35.240
All right.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.240
All right.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.240
Later.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.840
Did he just say whatever to me?

57:38.840 --> 57:41.840
I think he did.

57:41.840 --> 57:44.320
Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
Who's this?

57:46.920 --> 57:47.920
Raven Stalton.

57:47.920 --> 57:48.920
Hello, Raven Stalton.

57:48.920 --> 57:51.840
What's on your mind, my friend?

57:51.840 --> 57:54.800
Let me turn down the thing, and I'll tell you.

57:54.800 --> 57:58.960
Yes, rule number one of radio, turn down the speakers when you're gonna be on the program.

57:58.960 --> 58:01.240
Oh, we don't get that annoying ass echo.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.760
Live radio, boys and girls.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.200
I'm sorry about that.

58:05.200 --> 58:10.640
I'm glad that you played that old To Go song from OLR, from OLR To Go, and the music break

58:10.640 --> 58:11.640
that no one knows about.

58:11.640 --> 58:15.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, the podcast listeners have no idea what you're talking about, but

58:15.000 --> 58:19.120
we played, during the break, because we do a break between A and B, we play some music.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.560
I can play a clip.

58:20.560 --> 58:22.440
Playing clips of music is okay on podcasts.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.360
Here's a little clip of Gradius, Full Speed.

58:24.360 --> 58:26.360
This is our old theme song.

58:26.360 --> 58:36.120
That was our old theme music back in the day when we were doing a live show and a separate

58:36.120 --> 58:37.120
podcast.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
That was a good time.

58:38.120 --> 58:40.280
Wasn't that good times when we'd be in the studio for like five hours?

58:40.280 --> 58:41.280
No.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.280
Anyway, sorry.

58:42.280 --> 58:46.000
What did you want to say about the song?

58:46.000 --> 58:51.720
It just brings back good memories of listening to you go like, OLR To Go, We Cup, whatever,

58:51.720 --> 58:53.720
and I'm like, ooh, OLR To Go.

58:53.720 --> 58:54.720
Oh, the old song.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.160
It's one of those really good memories.

58:56.160 --> 58:58.920
Aw, so it's like a retro thing for you.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.440
Yeah, and I didn't just call about that.

59:01.440 --> 59:04.600
I did call about Fear and Halo 3 beta.

59:04.600 --> 59:05.600
What about that?

59:05.600 --> 59:12.400
Well, I've been playing a lot of FPSs and Xbox, and I played Fear for the Xbox.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.400
I got it from Gamefly.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.400
How was that?

59:14.400 --> 59:15.400
I thought the game was good.

59:15.400 --> 59:21.600
The thing I hate is about the corridors, and everything looks the same when you walk.

59:21.600 --> 59:22.600
That's the thing I hate.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.640
You always have an hour of looking at it, and then you finally figure it out.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.640
That's what I hate about it.

59:27.640 --> 59:34.560
My favorite gun is the particle gun, and you get to shoot things, and it turns into skeletons.

59:34.560 --> 59:35.600
It's awesome.

59:35.600 --> 59:39.880
Do you think that Halo 3 will outsell Halo 2?

59:39.880 --> 59:40.880
I do.

59:40.880 --> 59:41.880
I do.

59:41.880 --> 59:45.280
Because it has my favorite gun, the assault rifle.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.680
Just because of the assault rifle?

59:46.680 --> 59:49.280
Yeah, just because of the assault rifle.

59:49.280 --> 59:53.200
Everyone's been bitching about it on the forum, going, we need the assault rifle!

59:53.200 --> 59:54.640
We need the assault rifle!

59:54.640 --> 59:56.440
The battle rifle sucks!

59:56.440 --> 59:57.440
Alright.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.520
Any other quick words here before we get to another call?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.800
A Tekken game podcast, that's it.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Alright.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.400
If you want more of the Raven's Dolphin, he has his own podcast, Tekken Games, check it

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.400
out.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.000
I know he has an OLR community page, too.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.020
By the way, I dug up something out of the archive, here's what Raven was referring to.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.680
Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, week of July 11th, 2005.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:26.160
You're to be into the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.520
Oh, good times, old school memories, there you go.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.480
You don't miss the five hour studio marathons?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
No, Rob.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.120
Well, I would go home literally sick with exhaustion.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
No.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.240
Aren't you glad we're much shorter now?

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240
Seriously.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240
Hold on, we picked up another call.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.800
Hey, it's Dr. Burst.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.480
Hey, Dr. Burst!

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.520
I do not recognize your name as a caller.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520
You a new caller?

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
Yes.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
Awesome.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.520
New caller?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.520
Yeah, I want to comment on the World of Warcraft on 360.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.760
World of Warcraft on 360, a very popular topic.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.440
What do you want to say about it?

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.440
Well, I just think, why not?

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.080
People want the game and Blizzard makes more money.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.720
Why not?

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.640
But do they make more money?

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.480
Because again, what about the argument earlier about most people that have an Xbox 360 probably

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.080
have a computer via PC or Mac that's capable of playing World of Warcraft?

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.640
Well, I have the computer and I tried the demo for World of Warcraft and it doesn't

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.640
work that well.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640
Okay.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.360
So, I don't know, maybe there's something to be said for the achievement point whores

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.920
of the world, Loki, that might have fun just playing the game to get achievements from

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920
it.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920
Who knows?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920
I don't know.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920
Why not?

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920
Anybody else in the room care to comment?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Why not while on the 360?

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.520
I'd actually be for it because it's the same thing they did with Final Fantasy XI.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.560
I got on the 360 because my computer, it could run it well enough, but the 360, it's got

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:04.320
a set spec for it, so they're putting it on a system knowing that everybody's going to

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320
have the same amount of...

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
It's like optimized for 360.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320
Yeah, it's optimized for that.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.520
And so, if they did that with World of Warcraft, give me a keyboard and mouse.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.100
I like my TV better than I like my computer monitor, so I would do it.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:20.660
And voice chat built in right there too, because you could just do your own little private

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.080
room with your friends.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:28.200
Rumor is that PC versions getting a voice chat patch, but that's a rumor.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.840
Well, the thing is too, you probably couldn't do mods on World of Warcraft for a 360.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
That's true.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.840
Okay, that's true.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, good point is that one thing that PC gamers on their World of Warcraft love are

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.780
all the mods.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.040
You can have the mods for what, Spam Century is a popular mod, or Titan Bar if you want

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.680
to get really popular, all that stuff.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.600
You can't have that on the 360, or could you in downloadable content through Marketplace?

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.720
I'm not paying for Spam Century.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.240
Well, what if Blizzard put out some of the popular ones for free?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.640
Do you play WoW right now?

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.560
You would pay for Spam Century.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560
It's pretty bad.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.800
I tried it on a demo.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.800
I'm a Guild Wars player.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.120
The demo that you downloaded is leading other websites that sell gold to download those

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.080
demos and spam us.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.400
You said you're a Guild War player.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.160
Why not Guild Wars on the 360?

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.440
That too.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.840
Because it's instance based and there's so many load screens, it probably wouldn't work

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.160
that well.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.440
Well, WoW has a lot of instances too, especially when you get into Endgame.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440
I think about Final Fantasy XI.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.840
Final Fantasy XI had frickin' loading screens every time you went to a new area.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.760
That's one of the reasons I like WoW is that it's very seamless.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:42.200
You only really do loading screens when you go into instances or when you go to the other

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.200
continent.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.080
But yeah, I don't know.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080
Tell us a little more.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.360
We don't often get new colors, so Dr. Burst, what types of games have you been playing

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
this week?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.480
Pretty much Guild Wars.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480
Guild Wars?

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480
Yeah.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.480
I'm getting back on Guild Wars.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480
Oh.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.480
You guys should...

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480
You looking for a guild?

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480
I've got one.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480
Oh.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.800
I've had one like five seconds after I made my account.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
You guys should go...

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800
Well, because you're a really good buddy.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800
I was playing with one of them.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.800
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.840
Well, you guys can do battle, right?

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.840
That's what Guild Wars is all about, right?

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840
Yeah.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840
Yeah.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840
That's cool.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.520
What is the best class in Guild Wars to play?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.840
There's not really a best class.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.840
Mesmer.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.200
I made the doctor as a Mesmer.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.200
Yeah, I saw.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.200
Mesmers are so fun.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.200
Oh, yeah.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.200
I kind of like the Mesmers too.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200
I like my ranger.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.000
I guess you have to say Mesmers are pretty awesome looking at least.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yeah.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They are.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
There you go.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Yeah.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That's one thing...

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
You know, that is one thing I really did like about Guild Wars when I was playing it is

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
that the game is extremely balanced.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.400
I hate to keep dogging on Final Fantasy XI, we're going to have some angry Final Fantasy

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.880
XI fans, but the problem with Final Fantasy XI is that some job-sub-jobs combinations

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.560
just didn't work.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.720
If you wanted to be a ranger black mage, good luck fighting a party, right?

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.720
Right, Miklotov?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720
Right?

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720
That was my dream.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.600
But the thing about Guild Wars is that every job-sub-job combination kind of makes sense.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.920
They kind of built it a little smarter in that regard.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.000
So props to Guild Wars for that.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.800
I think the most hated class, Warrior Monk, still works.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800
Yeah.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800
Even though...

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
Actually, I think I played a Warrior Monk.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.200
I mean, it was like Ghetto Paladin.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.080
All right, well, Dr. Burst, thanks so much for the call and have fun in Guild Wars.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.360
And if you see Jamie, you know, nuke her for me.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360
Okay.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360
See you.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360
Wait till like M at least a comparable level.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
All right.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
Bye.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360
I'm five right now.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Bye.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.360
Well, keep working.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.360
Bye, Dr. Burst.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360
Take care.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
All right.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360
I love new collars.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Don't you love new collars?

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360
For dinner.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.880
I'm going to find the old collars because I like the old collars too, but it's nice

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.260
to get some new blood in once in a while.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.260
For dinner.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.260
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.260
Who's this?

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.260
All right.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.260
I love new collars.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.260
Hi.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.260
It's Kane.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.260
Hi, Kane.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.260
What's on your mind?

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.660
I can hear myself a little bit, so just make sure you turn down your speakers.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.960
We hear Rob all the time.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960
I know.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960
It's too much of me on this phone.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960
We should turn down our speakers.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
I know.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960
Maybe I'll just...

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960
I'm putting down my ears.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960
Okay.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960
That's fine.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960
Screw you all.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960
I will be quiet for this entire phone call.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960
I got to pee anyway.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960
You guys talk to the caller.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.960
You talk to the caller, it's fine.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960
I know.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
It's too much of me.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Rob, come here and fix it.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960
That's better.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Anyways.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
Okay.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960
Now we can hear you.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.360
I just wanted to talk about the whole console thing with the WoW.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:23.280
Yeah, it would probably be better for most users, but honestly, who wants to pay that

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.120
extra money just because you have to pay for the subscription and the Xbox Live?

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.240
People do it for PSU.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.040
And they're idiots because PSU sucks.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.040
Yes, it does.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040
Oh my God.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040
I played that game for two days and canceled it.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040
Hey, hey.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.360
I'm a fantasy star fanboy.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360
Leave it alone.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.880
You know, PSO was great.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880
PSU is terrible.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880
PSO was awesome.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880
Yeah.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.080
I played Blue Burst, though.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.120
If you're worried about paying an extra fee to play on Xbox Live, do it the smart way

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.440
and pay for a year.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.160
Then you're not going to really worry about it anymore.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.440
You're not going to be thinking, oh, I'm paying this on top of my Xbox Live fee.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.440
It really works out nice.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440
Well, yeah.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.760
You've got the Xbox Live anyway, right?

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760
Who me?

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.760
No.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.760
Well, I mean, if you're...

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.760
Well, you don't...

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.560
Well, if you've got the silver...

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.160
You got silver, and they made Final Fantasy XI, if I remember right.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.220
If you have silver, you could play it online.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.080
Why couldn't they do that with WoW also?

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.080
Owned.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.680
That's what it is.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.680
I don't know if they will.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:28.560
Well, at any rate, I don't think that it's that good of an idea because, I mean, World

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:34.200
of Warcraft already is, they don't even have any type of controller support on it for PC,

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.680
so I think that it would be very interesting to see how they'd map something like that

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680
over.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:43.720
Yeah, they're probably going to really, really screw up on it when they do.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.920
I'm not going to hold my breath on it.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.160
You'll never know until it happens.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160
That is true.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.160
Mm-hmm.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.680
And Rob spent the entire time not in this room.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.420
Oh, that's cool.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.040
I was playing that stick figure game.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040
I'm here now!

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.040
And I'm going to break Rob's head.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.760
Rob and Loki yell.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760
Okay.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.440
Did this guy just threaten to break my head?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
That's okay.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440
I will break you.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.800
Don't break my head.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800
That's not nice.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800
All right.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800
What?

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800
For that, you get hung up on.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
Aww.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800
Thanks for calling.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800
All right.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.960
Hi, this is Chainsaw Juggling.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960
Chainsaw!

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.440
Wait, what is his name?

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440
Chainsaw Juggling.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:38.480
Yeah, I just wanted to say I have the new issue of games for Windows, and they have

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.600
it confirmed that voice chat is coming.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.600
Voice chat is coming.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.000
So if you don't want that.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.880
Thank God we don't have to buy Event now, because our guild was seriously thinking about

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.880
getting Event.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.040
And dear God, I can hear myself echoing.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.000
Am I really that loud?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yes, Rob, you are.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.120
Actually, because you have the speakers up right now.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120
Oh, maybe that's why.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120
Okay, I'll back up a little bit.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.480
So, oh, that's cool.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.760
So they confirmed that for the next patch.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.760
That's good.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760
So did they say about how long?

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.760
Yeah.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.760
Well, it's saying it's coming after the next patch, and then also that what they're

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.080
going to try and do is make it so that the person's talking their name, like, so that

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.440
you can click on it and then heal that person or trade with them.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440
Huh, that's kind of cool.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:24.880
Wait, so wait, it's gonna be voice chat, even not in parties, like in the barons, everybody

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
could have voice chat.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
That could be horrible.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.440
I think it's supposed to be more than a party.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.040
Because I don't want to be walking through the barons and then suddenly some asshole

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.200
comes on with a Chuck Norris joke on the speakers.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
That would kind of ruin the game.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.600
That would probably be one of the worst things ever.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.400
Or make it better.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.040
Loki says we'll make it better.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040
All right.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.880
Chainsaw, Juggling, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.760
They're adding guild bank.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.400
They're adding what?

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.800
A guild bank.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800
A guild bank?

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800
Oh, that's kind of cool.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.840
So like the entire guild can share one bank?

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.360
Yeah, and it's supposed to be set up so certain members can only access certain items within

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.160
the bank.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.080
That's kind of cool, because some people are doing that already, right?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.560
Like they'll set up a dummy character that the guild members can log into.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.760
I'm going to let nobody have access to our stuff but me.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.320
You're a jerk.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
All right.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.720
Hey, come join our guild if you're a wild player.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720
We need more people.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720
Yeah, I got to start over again.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.480
I'm having a lot of time, but I'll do it.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480
What?

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480
It takes like an hour to get to 10.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480
Come on.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480
Yeah.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480
We're a casual guild.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480
We don't want a lot of time from you.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480
That's right.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480
We just tell dick and fart jokes.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480
No, we don't.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.680
It took me about a year and a half to get 40.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680
Oh, snap.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680
That's...

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.680
Oh, he's a player like me.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680
Yeah.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680
He's a player like me.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680
That's still cool.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680
All right.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680
You can still come join us.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.640
We'll call and chase out Juglin and we'll hopefully have you in the wild guild at some

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640
point.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640
All right.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640
See you guys.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640
Have a good night.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.640
All right.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.640
See you.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640
Thanks.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.640
You too.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640
Lots of noobs tonight.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640
This is an interesting change here.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640
Let's do one more call.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640
Hi.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640
Who's this?

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640
Hey, it's Ron.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640
What's up, everyone?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640
Hi, Rama.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
How you doing?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
Good.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640
Are you all ready?

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640
For Fauna Mae?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640
Hell, yeah.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640
I'm actually very excited.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.640
Are you excited, Darksucker?

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:16.880
I'm going to find a sewing machine to put my... I actually got the skirt for my Jessica

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:23.000
costume, but it might not happen, so I'm going to focus on the ninja costume and do that

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
one.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.480
That's cool, because if I knew enough people on the West Coast, I bet you a dollar one

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.160
of them would be bringing their sewing machine to the con.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160
Probably.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.720
I mean, you'll probably have that anyway.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.720
Well, the only problem being is that I actually need the red ponytail wig and I cannot find

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
one.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.360
I have, though, a long red wig that I'm thinking about just sort of pulling back into a ponytail

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360
and faking it.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.360
Well, if you want, I can do some last minute wig shopping for you, if you like.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.200
If it's not too expensive.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.760
I've been hunting one down like crazy.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.160
I can't find anything.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.520
Well, I know a couple of nice spots.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.440
I'll check them out on my way to work this week, because I just have to pick up a couple

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440
of stuff.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.440
You are so my hero.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440
I try.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.640
Anything you want to share with the listeners, besides Rama and Jamie talked to each other

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.240
about private things hour.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.240
Cosplay!

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240
Well, I...

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.360
I missed the first half hour, so I don't know if you guys pimped out that you guys are going

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.760
to be at Fond of May this year.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.560
Yes, we mentioned, because we're not going to have a live show on Sunday because of it,

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.800
so yeah, we definitely pimped the fact that we're going to be at Fond of May 2 p.m. Saturday.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.200
Just a reminder for those who may not have heard Part A yet, we're not going to be live

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.240
next week, because we are going to be live at Fond of May on Saturday, taping.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.200
Now, are we still down for Part A?

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.560
I believe so.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.520
I don't think Loki's going to be there, but the rest of us can have some fun.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.960
I don't know if it's going to be an official podcast.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.880
We're thinking of having it be a special show for live journal MySpace, like our fan communities.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.520
So basically, anybody that wants it can get it, but it won't be a part of the official

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520
podcast.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520
Okay, because I like rum and Cokes.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.160
We'll see what we can come up with.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.520
Why don't I bring my Patrón from my last year's birthday?

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.800
Ooh, that's expensive stuff, girl, don't bring that.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.800
I've been drinking some of it, but I can't drink all that tequila by myself.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.040
You know me in tequila.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.040
You know me in tequila.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040
We don't get along.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040
So you'll be drinking it by yourself.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.040
Even good tequila makes me go crazy.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040
Give me a bottle of Malibu.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.040
We're good.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.600
Rob, let's put in some money for some Grey Goose.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.600
All right.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600
Oh, I got five on that.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.600
All right.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.560
Rama, anything else besides liquor chat?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.760
Just about it.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760
All right.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.080
See you next week, Rama.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.480
Next week, give me See You Friday.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480
Fuck, that's right.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480
See You Friday.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.480
Hell yeah.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480
Later.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480
Later.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480
All right.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.800
Ooh, do we even have a meetup planned for him at the con?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.400
Oh, no, I've got to figure out where I'm going to park my car overnight and all that crazy

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.400
stuff.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.400
I decided I'm not going to go.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.400
You're not going to Fonomay?

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.400
No, it's my birthday weekend.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.200
Why would I spend it with people I'm just going to make fun of?

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.200
I'd do that anyway.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
I'm not going to pay to get into that.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.440
What are you going to do for your birthday?

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.440
Your birthday's Wednesday, right?

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.440
Yeah.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.440
Happy birthday.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.440
I'm going to-

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440
How old are you going to be, 30?

01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440
12.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.440
I'm going to be 12.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.840
You're going to be 30, 12?

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.400
I'm not going to be 30, 12.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.920
I'm going to be 24, and it's terrible.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920
So I'm actually going to go 22.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.280
I'm going to go down a year, at least this year.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Maybe next year, I'll go back up to 23, but no, I don't have any plans yet, but in the

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.600
hopes that I come up with something better than going to the anime, I'm going to ditch

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.160
it because I didn't have fun last year, really, so it's not my thing, but I want to buy stuff

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.040
like Power Ranger things because I know they have them there.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.720
Mr. Wendell is in chat right now saying, Rob, at least you're not Jahi.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.760
Oh God, I would kill to have Jahi on the Friday thing.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.280
Oh my God, no.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.480
You don't- do you know the story about Jahi and Tequila?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.480
Probably really funny.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.720
He threw up so bad at Iguana Girl's apartment.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.920
I love Jahi.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.520
He's one of my favorite people ever.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520
He's just-

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520
And Wendell didn't.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520
He completely swore off-

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.520
Oh God, and I love Wendell, too.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.520
I'm so excited to see everybody.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.580
Wendell, didn't he completely swear off Tequila because of this?

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.200
I'm not going to embarrass him over the air, especially since I don't know if he's listening

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.560
or not, but oh my God, I heard the story.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.040
It was monumental.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.840
I'm so excited to drink with all my friends.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840
I miss Jahi.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.340
You know, I randomly ran into Jahi one time when Kristen and I were in San Francisco.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.880
If he's not on the show somehow, I'm going to cry.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.080
Jahi has to be on our party podcast.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.200
Okay, remember back in the day when we would do our live events?

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.660
We broadcasted all day from one of the tournaments.

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.880
We did the Sacramento DDR tournament at Scandi.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.760
I remember we broadcasted all day on the live stream, like eight hours of tournament coverage,

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760
right?

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.760
Okay, seriously, during one part of the program, we just gave Jahi the mic, and for like an

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.680
hour, he just spun off these random, insane badlings.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.840
It was incredible, riveting radio, and yeah, we really probably should wrap up the show

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:55.840
now, huh?

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840
Because now we're starting to talk about stuff that-

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.840
Yeah.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.840
Like all these personal-

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840
Afterbirth FTW.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
All right.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.160
So anyway, we're going to wrap it up.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.440
So any last minute stories in studio, folks?

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.740
I like beer.

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:13.200
I'm a level 11 wizard on Puzzle Quest, because it's really awesome.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200
But you're not a nerd at all.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.160
Dude, I just like playing the-

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.120
Lucky, what the fuck is that you're playing?

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.080
I'm playing Stick Remover.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080
Sounds exciting.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.760
It's on the Zoffy blog, the same one that had the cat golf thing.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760
Oh, okay.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760
That's a good story.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760
Any last minute stories, Loki?

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.440
Well, here's a few things.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.880
You can get free game.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.640
They just posted something on Kotaku about it called Echoes.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.480
It looks kind of like Geometry Wars and Asteroids, so that's pretty cool.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.160
So check that out.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.680
King of Fighters is being made into a live action movie.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.880
Dear God, no.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.360
It's being directed by Gordon Chan, a guy from Hong Kong who-

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.000
Okay, then maybe it'll be cool.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.320
It's spawned other Asian martial arts flicks, like The Medallion, starring Jackie Chan,

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.720
Fist of Fury, starring Jet Li, and let's see-

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.520
Okay, then I have a little bit of hope.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:18.520
Also it looks like AXIS Entertainment's Joseph Cho, Appleseed, ex Machina, and let's see,

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:26.980
Convergence Entertainment's Tim Kwok of Wicked City, I guess, will handle the production.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:32.160
Sounds like it'll be out in Asia early 2008.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.440
And then also one game that's going to be coming out as well for 2008, Winning Eleven

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:45.800
2008, and Konami, apparently this is coming from Game Wave, a print magazine in Germany,

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.360
and it says it'll be released on multiple platforms, even on the PlayStation 3, improved

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.880
animations, more realistic and change-dribbling animations, one-on-one tackles and offside

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.920
traps will have better results, better online service, no lag, and full HD support with

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.920
18GB storage.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.400
So I guess you could dump the game onto the hard drive.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.360
Nice.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.640
Looks like that's pretty much it.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:23.480
Oh, and Microsoft is asking gamers for Xbox Live Arcade game ideas.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.240
Laser Cats the Game, dude I'm so going to suggest that.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.320
I demand the OL Army to mobilize to this thread and request Laser Cats the Games, where is

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320
this at?

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320
Is that on the Gamerscore blog, wasn't it?

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
I don't remember where it was.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
Major Nelson's site-

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.080
Also, Activision wants your input for the next Spider-Man game.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.680
How about Don't Suck?

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.240
How about Don't Make Another One?

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.240
That's it.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.680
How about be able to set Kirsten Dunst on fire?

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.440
That would be great!

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.640
I want Kill Gwen Stacy the game.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.800
Would Special Supplement kill MJ?

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the evening.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.940
Loki, since you have the mic right now, your final thought.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:13.280
My final thought is I want to play more Earth Defense Force.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.160
Miek Latov, thanks for piping in for the last part of the show here, even though you've

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.240
been playing Puzzle Quest the whole time.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240
We will still give you an opportunity-

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.920
Hey, I talked while you were in the bathroom.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.920
All right, fine.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.480
Give your final thought.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.240
I really like that YouTube video of the little kid getting kicked in the face by the Breakdancer,

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.880
because I've been watching it a whole lot.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.880
Good times, good times.

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.120
I think I have no heart.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.040
On some really wrong LiveJournal community, I won't mention that I watch once in a while,

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.560
there was a picture of that and it just said, Bay-bality.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.640
That's stupid, because it didn't turn somebody into a baby.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
Keep the baby in the head.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640
It was funny.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.960
Then there was a Street Fighter one too, where they made it look like he did a little flash

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.840
kick and it said, Guile, and then the baby... I'm going to show it to you, maybe during

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.840
the afterbirth.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:03.680
Real quick, I was going to say, there is a funny thing that... This is on HMV, I guess.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.920
They're advertising their Manhunt 2, since it's coming out later this summer.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.120
They're adding in that little sticker on it, it says, Jack Thompson becomes angry, but

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.400
then again, he's always, and then it has the date.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.400
It just occurred something to me, that I think part of the reason why, even though it's just

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.260
to get his face all over everything, I think that lawyers are required to do a certain

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:32.640
number of hours of things that are for the public good.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.640
You know what I mean?

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.120
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it, but they're supposed... I think that that might be his

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120
consideration.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.680
Well, he's still a twat.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.680
He is.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.680
All right, anyway.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.000
He's got a yeast infection or something.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.680
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.960
Pay me.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.200
My final thought is, reject false icons, since Dark Soccer never says it anymore, and why

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.640
don't you ever say that anymore?

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.160
It makes me a little sad.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.160
Reject false icons, Rob.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.520
All right, thank you.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:15.900
My other final thought would be, both here.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.900
Have a great week.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.600
