Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
So let's get right back into some video game news.
Loki, take it away.
That, you know, that's not surprising.
Especially since, you know, Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think, and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.
Here's the problem I would have with the Zune marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present, I don't know a single person with a Zune.
I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.
Well, here's the thing, though.
Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to, like, the Zune.
They just limit it to, you know, just not just the Zune, but, like,
Microsoft products.
Microsoft, either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your... I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.
I want to say I read something about this.
I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee...
I think something like, in the story it says something like if you pay a type of subscription fee and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have, but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.
Like Napster, it's like Napster.
I love this, they're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months.
Because, you know, there's a price break after three months.
Wait, no, there isn't.
There's not a price break at all.
Yeah.
But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.
It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever per thing, or do, like, a subscription.
The Napster model.
Yeah.
They should do a virtual console.
Interesting.
I don't know.
I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.
But they're trying.
They've made a lot of improvements.
Can you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?
I don't know.
Would that work?
Well, it might be a good competition for Netflix.
Well, actually, that's funny that you mention Netflix.
I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft Marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.
Interesting.
That you're going to be able to download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.
Well, I heard a rumor that my cousin's sister's friend's uncle's person who works for Microsoft said that he sucked.
All right, anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live Marketplace as well.
I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.
Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?
Oh, yes, I have.
It is fucking disturbing.
I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted.
Happy Tree Friends False Alarm
with Death Lovely
Vintage Collection for the Xbox 360 that
among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.
So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Ages for the PlayStation 2?
And not to mention also that they later found out that it, or it's confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.
Goddamn internet liars!
What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Ages compilation, like the Sega Ages 2900.
Because, you know, I've got a few of those games.
How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?
I wouldn't mind something like that, if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.
Then, yeah, something like what you said there, where you could just have all of them on one disc.
Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.
Well, a lot.
And I want Planet Harrier.
A good chunk of them.
Planet Harrier.
And they could just release the game, and they could call it this.
Remember when Sega was good?
And that's what they could call the game.
And it would sell millions of copies.
Because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.
Sega ages.
There you go.
That's the selling point right there.
Remember when Sega was good?
Yes.
But I do remember when Crackdown was good.
And it was good today.
And that's because I had the new download pack.
And it's awesome.
But there were some complications as there normally is with a lot of these download packs.
Where it was resetting some of the game's progress.
And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.
You might find out that your save game's gone.
Whoopsie.
But they're working on a fix for it right now.
However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.
It's real quick.
All you have to do is get the brand new update.
Which will be coming out.
And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crash.
It's the update to the game.
Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.
And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.
And just reboot it, and you're good to go.
So, I recommend doing that.
Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.
But the download content is fucking awesome.
Free or paid.
Either way, you've got to get it.
I don't think I have ever played Crackdown Co-op, so I should be okay, right?
You should be fine.
But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.
And then go back into it and you can play it again.
And I played a co-op on the Keys to the City mode, actually the land, so that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.
So that you're probably safe on.
But just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.
But what they really, really, really need to release now is like an instant replay saver or something like that where you can create your own movies because with all this extra crap that they threw in there, there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.
All right.
Ross Steele, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemonster.com says, Crackdown Co-op is overrated.
You don't even have to really play together.
What do you think?
What do you say to that?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
BOMBERMAN ACT 0
DeathJunior, BrookTown, and...
Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo
I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.
Was that after Bomberman 94?
On a turbo?
I do believe so.
Bomberman 94 was really good, but it was still, I think, the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.
With the multi-tap.
So just take that and make it online playable.
The end.
No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?
Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.
However, and you know, it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.
God, I hate ads!
Stop putting Flash ads on your site, you stupid buttheads.
Well, they gotta make money somehow.
Delete.
Crapheads.
Anyway.
In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.
And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.
At least that's what I've heard.
But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.
You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.
Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?
Yes.
Well, there you go.
No point in me downloading this because I don't have that.
I don't know, I'll give it a try, because I've been interested in it.
I played the Xbox 360 demo.
But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.
So, let's hope.
Yes.
And unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June, Spore.
Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.
apparently the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA and of course their fiscal year ends March 31st 2008 so gotta wait more for this game but you know what though I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up
Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.
It didn't look like that much more to go.
It looked pretty cool to me.
The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.
And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.
DarkSakura, start us off.
A few of the wheat goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which, for anyone who's on into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.
It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it pops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.
Loki.
Uh, I'm pissed off at... I don't know, at the fact that Grantha thought a four's not out yet.
That makes me sad, but...
My FU of the week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft I hope you all die in a fire Like I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it and it hasn't been doing a damn thing Spammers are still getting through with all their tells I hope they all die a lot I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs Miklatov, anything you have for FU of the week?
I was going to FU to drama but I'm actually just going to say no I have nothing
So you're saying FU without saying FU?
Kind of, but not so much.
I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.
All right.
Very cryptic there.
That was a short FU of the week segment.
I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight.
Everybody seems to be pretty happy.
Alright, well, this is some interesting news here.
And I should clarify this, is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story, so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.
There was a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.
So in other words, you know, and then
Then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, you know, well, the Elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
But to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data, and not even the newest data.
So, there you have it.
But of course, this is just going to say, you know, about, this is a whole price war that's going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
So, there you go.
That's it.
That's all I got.
Question things that you read on the internet.
I question everything that I read on the internet.
And I question what the intelligence of this is.
They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360.
Which, first of all, it looks stupid.
I hate the color yellow so damn much.
And by the way, if I wanted Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.
Why?
Why?
I don't know, I thought it looked kind of neat.
I mean, nobody else has one.
Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah, to tie in with the Simpsons movie released on July 27th.
Yeah, whatever.
But you're a collector.
Don't you want one of these anyway?
I collect things that don't suck ass.
Fine.
See if I care.
If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.
Well, this, of course, is all tied into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.
And the game looks fucking awesome.
It's on pretty much every platform.
Of course, all the next-gen platforms or current-gen, however you want to call them.
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2, and PSP.
And it's just pretty awesome.
It's basically the storyline revolves around them
Thanks for watching!
Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?
It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.
They're like episodes, basically, so there's 16 levels in the game.
There were some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.
For example, there were posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island, stuff like that.
That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.
It'll be neat.
I think it's going to be pretty awesome.
Also, two-player co-op.
That's going to go over live?
I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system, but I think you might be able to do it over live as well.
GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead, but that's made by Activision.
Medal of Homer.
Might get me to play one of those war games finally, though.
Medal of Homer.
Medal of Homer.
of course the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial you might remember back in the day when it was first out like those shirts that said eat my shorts that were banned from school and stuff well of course always a source of controversy is the game ratings system and the ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings and 85% use them regularly when buying games
That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.
So kind of interesting there.
There you go.
I mean, but of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game's safe for me.
And the parent just kind of listens to that.
So I don't know.
Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.
90% of parents know about the system.
The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.
I don't know.
Well, there's one thing, though, between, you know, knowing about it and understanding how it's used.
True.
But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.
And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.
And that means that, you know,
Somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.
Was that you, Miklatov?
Did you do that?
Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?
Yes, because I live in Europe.
I just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.
It's healthy.
Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say, and that time was one of them.
Go back to playing with Hellmonkey.
Hellmonkey.
Alright.
I was going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
They have a list of features that it's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.
Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.
You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.
Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.
And it looks pretty awesome.
So.
Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.
And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already friggin' even talked about already.
30 days after the date, when it comes out, and I don't know.
Interesting.
Well, hooray!
You can rate me with microtransactions and Bomberman.
I'm so excited.
Awesome!
Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.
There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that
You know, Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.
And, uh, I don't know.
This is coming from a, uh, forum post to, uh, this website, Eacoustics.
And, um, it's, I guess, uh, 2chan in, uh, Japan.
I don't know.
Um...
Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?
Yes, but here's the thing, though.
They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.
They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.
They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.
Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so...
Not gonna happen yet.
And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.
Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war, because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player.
That's gonna make me sad.
It's just like Betamax before, people bought Betamax.
It must run in my family, my parents had a Betamax.
Laser discs?
That I didn't have, but she had it.
I still have them, I still watch them.
You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.
That's right.
That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.
You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point.
I believe it's been confirmed since then.
But when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it.
I've got to buy an HD DVD player.
I want one for the exact same reason.
I don't care about anything else.
I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.
and AnswerRawSteelUT in chat who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.
There you go.
Heroes.
HD DVD won the war.
I had to have Heroes in HD.
Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.
What am I going to do all summer?
It's awesome.
Watch Battlestar?
Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.
It did for me.
But that's one person.
It might come out on Blu-ray later.
Well, Laserdisc didn't win the war either, so... Well, fuck you, Advent... Fuck you!
Advent Children's coming out.
The Director's Cut's coming out on Blu-ray only.
So... Advent Children?
Okay, I care because... It's fucking awesome.
Little Spirits Within Me coming out too.
Whoopee!
No, I don't care about that.
Laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market.
So it didn't necessarily die.
Of nerds.
No, and they're actually still releasing Laserdiscs.
Really?
Yeah.
Two companies are.
You know how they had, like, that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this, Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars?
Can you imagine what would happen, the kind of damage you could do with a laser disc if you threw it at somebody?
Yeah.
But dead platforms still get support all the time.
Like, one of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.
5200, I think.
Or is it 5200?
Yeah.
Whatever.
Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.
Well, I have some happy news.
All right.
For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.
And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days, was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.
And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.
And so it
I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.
Fangirlgasm.
Not necessarily, I just think it's good quality work.
A little bit.
The only disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.
True.
That was disappointing.
Hell, they should just do some original animation, you know, just release some actual stuff.
Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies and the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.
Video game purists will probably hate it.
The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel.
Hell no!
Funny enough, Kira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role, and both of them passed.
But Jessica Biel, because, you know, she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.
At least they got the sex right.
Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.
What's her face from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?
Oh, um, um, Zhang Ji?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why don't they just have her play, like, fucking Cammy or something?
At least that would make sense.
Well, keep in mind, this is just a rumor.
Kylie Minogue, he's a player again!
Again?
She did, in the old... I know, I know.
No, she played, um, Cammy?
Yeah.
Okay.
But you know who should play Chun-Li?
Who?
Ching Chong.
What?
He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays, like, the... No, I'm just making a rake.
No, that's Chao Chang, stupid!
Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie City Hunter was more accurate than Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.
Granted, I'm not going to say that, you know, Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, you know, scantily clad, you know, would not be a draw for me to see his movie, but... What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene, like in the Japanese one?
That would never happen, but that'd be hot.
I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.
TigerClaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.
I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
You know that chick?
That was her name.
Yeah, exactly.
Actdeft says Kylie Minogue rocks.
That's true.
SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?
And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alba, Keira Knightley.
They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.
I can never pronounce that guy's name.
Jeter.
You know what would be really awful is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for the movie.
It would just be awful.
We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la Around the world, street fighting, la la la la Maybe I should play Chun-Li RuPaul as Chun-Li I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere Wison Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass
JV Mon says Rob could be E-Honda Are you saying I'm fat?
What are you trying to say?
DJ DarkNate says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3 Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li It could be Sanjaya from American Idol And GS68, as long as Loki is Tingle As long as Loki plays Tingle Anyways
Back to Guitar Hero.
Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the 80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer, July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister, I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist, not covers, Round and Round, as made famous by R.A.T.,
I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow Mental Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio And the Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia
How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're Not Gonna Take It?
How do you do that?
It could be an Unlocked song.
Or even the song, remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly, yeah, Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're gonna burn in hell!
That was awesome.
Anyway, sorry.
But yeah, why that random-ass Twisted Sister song?
These are only, you know...
7 songs that have been announced yet.
I mean, come on, it's going to be, you know, there's going to be more songs in there.
In case you're wondering, it is only going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, at least as a disc.
360, get ready for another download!
Woohoo!
Do you have the facts to back that up?
That's a rumor.
It's only coming out on PlayStation 2, as a disc.
Okay, alright.
So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.
Or just unannounced.
Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.
No, but it's going to be a download pack.
or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap as much as I hate ACDC I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell I can't stand that fucking guy's voice never did like it alright but a game I could stand was Saints Row that was actually kind of fun and if you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row sucks to be you it just got canned but there is a silver lining to the story Saints Row 2 is in development right now and it's coming out on the Playstation 3
and the Xbox 360.
And they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.
I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.
Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.
The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment into a larger installed base next year.
That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.
So in other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1
And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.
I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it.
Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or Crackdown.
Exactly.
Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.
Unless it sucks, in which case it'll come out right afterwards.
It's actually not a bad decision, though.
All right.
Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.
You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com and DarkSakura likes to dive into the mail bag head first and land on pavement apparently and pull out some of her favorite emails.
So, DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?
Fuck everybody.
I haven't got a single damn email.
So, fuck it.
I should say, just, there was some spam, and there was a couple... The spam is squishy, and we had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.
And there were, like, a couple random emails that were, like, other types of inquiries that aren't really suitable for on-air.
But other than that, nothing!
Like, Rob, what color are your underwear?
No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on-air, probably.
Yeah, Dark Tansy has said it.
Pool's closed.
And, uh, green.
What the... Okay, whatever.
What?
I'm married, butthead.
What, are they just starting to ask questions in chat?
All right.
I'm doing some chat booting.
But ever since January of 2005, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting a readable email.
It's very strange, isn't it?
Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one in French.
Well, you know the good news is now, I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.
Someone email me in French.
All right.
All right, here we go.
That was my best French impersonation, by the way.
All right, well.
That was horrible.
Thank you, as most of my accents are.
All right.
Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.
Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.
What?
Okay, this is kind of stupid.
My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.
So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our birthday party next month, right?
Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?
No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.
I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock.
and I'm going to dress as a police constable and go around arresting my co-workers.
Lovely.
Did you have fun with that?
Or has it happened yet?
No, it's next month.
Pics, please.
All right.
Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.
We had a phone call on our Skype line.
Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live.
And we'll take your calls in a minute here.
But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.
Chris Amegzi went to ASIN.
and Megzi actually had an artist table because some folks actually asked saying like, hey, I never found Chris and Megzi.
Where were they at the con?
Megzi is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.
Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
And she had an artist table.
Megzi had an artist table.
Yeah, she did.
So that's where she spent most of the con.
So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the art room, that's how you missed it.
And Chris was doing it too.
Yeah, so Chris apparently went around and whored out the show, but she says that in her voice message, which we're going to listen to right now.
Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.
Hello Rob, Jamie, and Matt, this is Chris over at ASIN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well.
Due to time constraints, a lot, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.
The pimping out has not been going according to plan.
Um, so I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.
Um, I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did, my phone kept dying.
Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including a game room.
Um, both of which, my cell phone reception did not work.
So, obviously, this entire trip has been one big mess of blah for me.
Plus, I'm now losing my voice.
So, but I think I should give you guys the scope anyway.
Those of you who are interested in going to ASUN in 2000... Oops, messed up.
Those of you who are interested at all going to ASUN and are looking for games, there's lots of things to do here.
The dealer room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.
There's a lot of... What are those things called?
You know, the dating sims.
There's a lot of those.
And a lot of yaoi weapons for those fine girls.
A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which again, I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.
I just haven't had the time.
There's also card games for people.
There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters and all that fun stuff.
And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.
This entire trip actually was paid for me.
Thanks for watching!
My Live Journal at Disney Punk 10.
Or you can try to get a hold from DarkSakura.
But other than that, I have tried.
I've been pimping out your show, I swear.
I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says Orange Lounge Radio for Gamers or something like that.
I forgot what I put on it.
I printed those out at work.
I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.
It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.
Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.
I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.
And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year, you guys got to give me some good promos.
So, you know, it looks impressive than the shit that I have.
So, but anyway, this has been Chris at ASUN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
This has been your Roaming Lesbian.
Back to you, Rob.
Back to you, Jamie.
Back to you, Matt.
Matt's role, asshole.
There you go, Chris, semi-live at ASEN there.
You gotta love Chris, she's so fine.
I love that she's adopted, she's kind of adopted the title of the roving lesbian of OLR, it's great.
And Max Rule, asshole, did you catch that?
They rule the land of sucking.
Great.
I hate their commercials too, because now he's like, see, the commercials said they're better, so they are.
Like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Pompous little fucking cars is what they are
That's kind of cool.
I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN and who knows, maybe next year if it's in the OLR budget, we'll go.
But for now, we have Fonamay to look forward to.
Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area, you've got to go to Fonamay.
It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend and OLR is going to be there Saturday.
And since we're only doing one panel this year, it's in the works.
This won't be live, boys and girls, but we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
Friday night,
at the secret, super secret suite that OLR will be at Friday night.
The super secret suite?
Yes, it's our super secret suite 16.
That's not the actually suite number, whatever suite it is.
The biggest, the most number of drunk, because it's going to be at a con, so everybody's going to be there.
The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just don't have the equipment to make that happen.
I could take my Mac out there, but Loki would find a way to fuck it all up, so there you go.
I could take my
Non-MAC.
by the way unfortunately that won't be live either we won't be live that weekend but you can come see us tape live in person that's pretty awesome and we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again we had some really good questions last year someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac hating thing that's always a good sign I don't care okay I don't care
I don't even really hate them anymore.
I don't like them.
I wouldn't buy them.
I don't care if you like them.
Great.
Good for you.
I really don't care.
Stop asking me why I don't like them because I don't have legitimate reasons.
I don't like them.
I'm racist against Max.
She doesn't like the color yellow.
You don't like Max.
Exactly.
I'm racist against Max.
I have no reason for it.
There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.
I think they're crappy computers.
But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.
That's your opinion, awesome.
I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them, either way.
Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?
Thank you.
Anyways, so...
Uh, yeah.
This is not very surprising at all.
But, um, apparently Playboy's coming to Second Life.
I would say, well, what took them so long?
Since, um, you know, I want to say that most of Second Life anyways is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.
Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.
But, um, yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life and, uh, no real word of what's going to happen.
But apparently you're going to be able to participate either as a centerfold or
Somebody's staring at centerfolds.
Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?
Possibly, I don't know.
Microsoft also entered Second Life.
I want to say Final Fantasy VII's been recreated in Second Life.
You know, I hate to sound morbid, but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.
I mean, he's not getting any younger.
I'm so interested to see how CNN's going to handle it when he passes.
You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?
He was an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.
I don't know.
Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.
Seven chicks at one time.
Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.
That's the fountain of youth.
Suddenly all the young kids still want to do you.
You know, if there's one person that in this world needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.
No, no, I take that back.
Bob Barker.
But if you can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.
We have the Hugh bot and the Bob bot.
Bob Barker, he cannot die.
The Barker Bot.
He's retiring this year.
It's happening.
I know.
I'm sad too.
No.
Robot.
Someone kill him before he decides to retire and we'll resurrect him as a robot and he'll never know the difference.
He will think it's his first year doing the show.
He will not be tired of it.
You know.
He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.
Rumor is because Rosie's leaving The View.
Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.
Yeah, uh, no.
It's like, come on down!
No, you're gonna eat me!
Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?
Didn't Wing Martindale die?
No, is he still alive?
Oh.
Some famous game show always dies.
It was the one from Pressure Lock.
Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.
Yeah, uh, whatever his name, Peter DeMarkin.
He was in a plane wreck or something.
Boy, this show's getting morbid.
Let's open up the phones, shall we?
If you want to give us a call and comment on anything from the show tonight.
Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.
1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR Or, remember that number is only toll free in the US.
What about Lamar Burton?
Lamar Burton?
Lamar Burton, yeah.
Lamar Burton?
I don't know his name.
Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.
Why him?
I've never seen him hosting a show.
He didn't have a say in this.
What?
Alright, let's go to the phones.
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Saku Hi, Legend of Saku Chewbacca, he could totally host the show It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000 I've never played that yodeling game Yes, I love the yodeling game, the game's fucking right You know, I went to see The Price is Right live a couple years ago We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork I know you have something you want to say, Zaku, but I'm going to talk for a minute Yeah, go ahead About nothing game-related
I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy and gets away with it, like, in public, nonetheless.
Like, she wore that fucking swan dress, but here's the thing.
When I saw her at Coachella, like, this was, what, like, 2002 or 2003, I want to say, is when we went.
She wore a Venus flytrap outfit, and it was awesome, because, like, it was closed for most of it, but then during one of her songs, it opened up, and she was like a Venus flytrap.
She's so fucking hardcore.
I mean, that was, like, the best weekend ever.
It was Bjork in a Venus flytrap outfit, and Price is Right.
It was a great weekend.
I had a good time.
Sorry, Zaku, you had something gaming-related you wanted to mention?
Uh, just pulling through Dick right now.
Um, I see that, uh, that Sony's about to announce a new PS3 firmware update.
A new PS3 firmware update.
Wait, this is on Dig right now?
Yeah.
Right this second?
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't be fooled.
It's an announcement of announcements, so... That's what... Yeah, Loki's right.
I'm looking... Oh, this is from PSU.com.
Isn't that their official underground site?
Or is this a... Oh, I don't know.
There's too... You know what?
There's too damn many game blogs out there on the internet right now.
We need to somehow put a cap.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are basically, they're biased towards either console.
You see Kotaku's more anti-Sony, you know, at certain times, and then, I don't know, Joystick is almost the same thing.
I mean, actually, no.
Joystick is more pro-Nintendo, if I recall correctly.
Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though, because they tried to screw them over because Kotaku was saying something, you know, legitimate.
And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff we don't want you to.
You're banned from everything now.
I don't know.
Yeah, like a certain other business I'm thinking of, a Namco, but we won't go there.
Anyhow.
Yeah.
Whoops.
They've just added stuff that, I don't know, should have been there, but I can see why they left it out initially.
Probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboys saying, oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.
You could access the XMB in-game.
Like how you can access the dashboard on 360 in-game as well.
Okay.
Let me see.
They said stuff about in-game music as well.
Sleep mode.
I mean, I can link you right now, but it's a whole bunch of settings.
I tried pulling it up on Dig, but obviously everybody's hammering the site, so it's broken.
But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.
What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.
There's an equalizer in the music.
There's photo settings, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 settings, RSS channel settings is now an option.
So now I'll be hopping to OLR on your PS3.
More slideshow stuff for the photos, more visualization for music.
Looks like you can do some other things with video.
You can do some zoom-ins and stuff.
The cross-media bar is now accessible during gameplay, like you said.
RSS Channel is added as a feature.
That's pretty cool.
That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3 pretty soon.
You can now have multiple chat sessions and you can select an image to use as your avatar from the photo.
So it sounds like a pretty big update.
That's pretty cool.
I don't know.
It's catching up to 360.
I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.
It's funny you phrase it that way.
It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?
I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.
Does that even exist?
Like the custom soundtracks like on Xbox 360?
I don't know.
I don't own a PS3.
Can you do custom soundtracks?
You can't, right?
Maybe.
I don't think so.
I think it depends on the game.
Interesting.
Folks in chat are saying no.
Yeah, I mean, once Sony, you know, Sony has a lot of work to do in order to win, in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.
I mean, they have to add Rumble, lower the price, get some really good games out because right now they're in a drought.
Not to say that they're the only ones, but, you know, the Wii is also in a drought right now.
They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.
Right, that's true.
That's exactly what I said.
A price cut would do just that.
All right.
Anything else, Zaku?
We've got to get going to another call, but any other last stuff you want to get in here?
That's about it.
My throat's kind of sore.
I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.
All right.
See you soon, buddy.
Less than a month before I come to New York.
All right.
Later, dude.
Bye-bye.
I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.
Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.
Maybe the
Dave and Buster's thing, although I don't think everybody can get in there, so I don't know.
Maybe pizza?
I don't know.
I'm up for ideas.
Let's start a forum thread or something.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
It's the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?
Not too much.
I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.
Ah, of course.
How was ASEN?
Oh, lots of fun.
I had a blast.
I watched a lot of anime.
I played a lot of games.
Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.
One guy was dressed up as Frank West.
He was carrying a surfboard head.
That's awesome.
He had his girlfriend who was also wearing a surfboard head.
He held her hand the whole time and she didn't move unless he dragged her.
That's great.
And two zombies with surfboard heads were chasing them the whole way through.
That's pretty awesome.
I like when people go all out with the game because I'm not really all about the anime.
Obviously we have a lot of folks here in studio that are really into anime.
and I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.
So I really like when people bring more of the gaming into the anime cons through the cosplay and stuff.
That's always cool.
Some interesting things happened too.
I went to a couple of the programming panels like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness and at one point a thousand people were singing the Segata Sanchiro theme song.
Wow.
You can get that many nerds in one place.
Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell, which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials, bad anime, that sort of thing.
That's right.
Or just, like, bad commercials.
So they played, like, the full four minutes, Sega Tatsushiro, or theme song, with subtitles.
So it's kind of an easy core thing, so everyone started joining in the second, third, and fourth times they played it.
Wow, nerds, all of you.
Hey, what types of, like, game room setups did they have?
Because I noticed no anime con is complete without a game room.
Right.
King of Fighters 11.
You're not really going to find Nadno8 at an anime con.
Exactly.
And for the Parapara machine, it was great.
There were probably about 15 people behind doing the motions themselves as people were playing the machine.
It was great.
How many of them were dudes?
Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.
You know, it's funny because there used to be hella guys in Northern California who
And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really do Parapara dancing, and then all those teams just fell apart, like instantly vaporized.
It was something else.
I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff, and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.
But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.
Exactly, rock on, Sky.
There were a lot of tournaments...
Turnips for just about every fighting game, every anime fighting game.
There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.
I got killed in that one.
Wow.
So I entered five of them, somewhere around there.
A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players, but people were still having fun.
There weren't too many people that were completely arrogant or cocky, which unfortunately can't happen.
I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chatroom.
Awesome.
Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.
It was a lot of fun.
It's funny.
Never mind.
I won't tell that story.
I'll just say that some of my friends actually found a stranger in their hotel room when they woke up the next day.
Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.
Interesting.
All right.
Well, we'll leave it at that.
Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Fanameh.
If you're an anime fan, I've got to say it's a great place to go to.
If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan, you should probably go to that because there are a lot of people that know how to play the games.
You'll get a lot of good matches there.
All right.
If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.
I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.
Awesome.
Well, thanks for the wrap-up, and I'm glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.
You guys should call in next time with your report because obviously Chris had a hard time finding you guys or her cell phone wasn't working or something.
All right.
All right, take care, buddy.
Thanks for the call.
Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?
Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?
I always do.
Really?
The first place I go to is the message boards because I do cosplay.
Really?
Yes.
All right.
It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements on there and stuff.
Dude, I'm going to do that at Fanime.
Well, no, the big thing is, at least this has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer, especially doing something from something you know other people are going to be doing, you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.
Oh, like the pictures that they all do.
Exactly.
Okay.
And there's also other groups meeting, like YaliCon had a bunch of Dolphy collectors getting together.
and that type of thing.
The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards or the site forums.
So once we find out Ranma's room number, we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that says Naked Twister at 9pm in this room.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven's Dolphin!
Hello, Raven's Dolphin!
What's on your mind?
Raven's Dolphin!
The We in the Lake story.
The We in the Lake story, yes.
Well, I know many guys have taken a We in the Lake
Wee in the Lake once or twice in their lives.
Oh yes, the Nintendo Wee in the Lake.
What's up with that?
What do you have to say about that?
You know, I agree with the guy.
Divorce is imminent.
I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water and get my wee.
Are you single, Raven Stolfen?
Yeah.
Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.
I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.
That's true.
I'm hearing an echo, Ravenstaff, and you need to fix that echo.
You've called into this show enough times.
Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.
Yeah, so is that this guy's problem is that maybe he should have just married somebody who understood the game thing a little more in the first place?
He should have married a gamer.
Yeah, I agree with that.
And so is that what you're doing, Ravenstaff, and you're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?
I am.
I just want her to understand about me and my gaming addiction, and she throws the Wii out.
It's over.
You know what, though?
People do stupid things when they fight.
I mean, people smash car windows.
They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.
I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.
And, you know, they'll do – I mean, it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not because if she knew, like, hey, this is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.
You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.
You know, that's what she's going to do.
That's true.
You just have to marry someone who can keep their temper in check.
That's true.
You're right.
Oh, one more thing?
Of course, what's up?
This is a little old, but I thought that the Situawada thing was hilarious.
Reggie, you're not selling enough.
Damn it, sell more.
I'm not following.
What was this news?
It's been a while.
Well, he said it was about the Brain Age, and he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.
In Europe, they sold 30,000.
Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 Brain Age or 30,000 in Europe?
Reggie's Invincible
Reggie is a god among men.
Reggie's invincible.
But Iwata does have the power if he wanted to bust some Reggie heads.
I mean, think about it.
The only person in the entire world who gets to yell at Reggie.
Actually, there's two people in the world that get to yell at Reggie.
His wife and Iwata.
That's true.
That's it.
Sorry for that thing.
That's all right.
I had the microphone too high.
Life goes on.
Well, Raven Stauffen, thanks for the call as always.
Of course, bye.
Have a good one, buddy.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Ranma.
What's up, everyone?
Hi, Jamie.
What's up?
Hey, naked twister, 9 o'clock, right?
Okay, before we start, there will be a $5 cover charge for the Drunk Show.
Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.
If you get in before the end of the Drunk Show, you can still qualify for Naked Twister.
There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.
That is not happening, Ranma.
That's a joke, okay?
I'm just going to say that right here.
There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room anyway.
I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.
You know what's actually really funny about Fanime?
Did I talk about this on the last week's show?
I'm not sure if it was on the show or if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.
But my boyfriend wants to go to Fanime.
Which is funny because... Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.
That's why it's funny.
That has nothing to do with it.
No, but the reason why is because he watches anime.
He's familiar with some of it.
He probably knows more about it than I do.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The mistake in the whole Sailor Moon part is actually not being moon-sized, you know.
Anyhow, so... I'm dressing up this year.
If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?
I have to have my skirt made.
What are you cosplaying as?
I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.
What?
That's cute.
I like that.
I have to get my wig finished, though.
Is there a rest of the posse?
Is there...
No, but Rob, you could cosplay.
You could be the hero.
I could.
Why not?
It would be fun.
And then I'll have to whip you.
And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.
I actually have a full bullwhip.
I'm not dressing up like a goblin.
Please do.
That would be funny.
So, does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume this year?
No, no black mage costume.
I had fun with that, though.
Hey, Ranma, can I borrow a mage costume?
Sure, I'll pack it.
Rad.
Okay.
Sorry.
Because I have the red hair and all.
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room suggests Loki should cosplay as Tingle.
I am not dressing up like Tingle.
Fuck no.
Alright, sorry Ranma.
What the hell did you call in for anyway?
Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.
Wait, like the movie?
The first one?
Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.
Really?
Okay, now spoiler free please, because Mikkelsof and I both want to see this.
Trust, um, do you have a strong stomach?
I want to see it because I love the undead.
I mean, load the undead.
Miklatov and I both scream like girls at bad violence, but that's part of the fun in going.
You're going to scream.
That's all I got to say.
Really?
Oh, Miklatov's already putting on a pouty face.
But it's really good, though.
I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw-up stuff going on in that movie.
Yeah.
And I hate that.
It's so gross.
Ranma, you know what you need to see if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?
What?
Hot fuzz.
That's on my list.
Well, maybe we can do it while we're out there.
Come on now.
Yeah, that's what I just said.
We can go see Hot Fuzz.
Sorry.
Definitely.
I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions where like, what more can I buy and how many more pictures can I be taken of?
Let's just go somewhere.
And we need to get chicken.
Let's go see that movie tomorrow when I get back from LA.
I'm gonna cry.
You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow, do you?
No.
Why would I want to do that?
Let's go see that movie and you can cry.
Suck it up.
Dude.
Okay.
I don't like zombies.
I don't like that these people, even though they're not really zombies because they're not dead, they're people with a virus, but they're like zombies and they throw up blood and they run really fast and it's going to scare the crap out of me.
Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Ranma, so you understand.
Yes.
Taking Shane to zombie movies.
Taking Extifer on Roller Coasters Oh my god, it's killing me!
That was so funny.
Anyhow, sorry.
These are the little pleasures in life.
This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we can go see the movie.
Sweet.
I'm just going to miss out on playing Bus to Move at work.
You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers, some of them listen to this program, right?
Why do I care?
Alright, just check it.
Just want to make sure.
They can all suck it.
All thousands of listeners.
I'm sorry.
I'm inflating that number a lot.
I meant dozens.
All 14 listeners.
All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.
Yeah.
Whatever.
I don't even care anymore.
Ranma, tell me something game related.
Let's see.
A couple of things.
In response of last week, I have been listening to this show for about five years.
It'll be six years in January.
How is that possible when we've only been doing this show five years next month?
I remember, maybe I'm off by you, I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.
Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.
Yes.
Okay.
See?
The station started in 2000, no, yeah, the station started in 2002.
Longest train wreck ever.
Forget it.
Anyway, sorry, what, Ranma?
No, DarkTetsu wanted to throw down, so I accepted his challenge.
Look, thank you, Drew Nami.
6-23 of 02 was the first live show.
Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence Drew Nami has.
23 is the number of coincidence.
Wait, what were you going to say, Ranma, about you've been listening to the show for five years, and last week... No, I think it was last week when Dr. Zacon said about your biggest fans, you said it was me and Misty.
I was trying to figure out how many years we've been listening.
You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show last week.
Yeah, because I EM'd her about it.
She said you guys missed her, and I told her, no, they all love you and miss you a lot.
I know.
She kind of just disappeared, but I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life and stuff.
She's doing her thing.
And that happens.
Folks, sometimes they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore, but we hope you'll always remember us and blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.
Definitely.
Rob D in chat says, Ranma is such a fan that he's been listening to you since before you've been on the air.
That means he was listening to Under Sedation.
I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it by saying you were listening to Under Sedation live, and I think that's how Dark Tetsuya gets away with it, because I think he was listening to Under Sedation live.
Dark Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest appearances.
Crazy.
And I filled in for people.
I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.
Crazy times.
Old school.
Anyway.
Sorry Ranma, anything else you want to share with us?
I want to finish it off by saying, in case you guys haven't heard yet, we have a new video gamer in the world.
Oh.
You IM'd me the other day.
Yep.
A new video, who's this?
My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy last Wednesday.
Aww, what's the boy's name?
Is it bouncing unhealthy for babies?
Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?
Stop.
Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller and started playing Street Fighter.
That's awesome.
On the first or second bounce.
First.
That's really awesome.
You need to talk more on this program.
All right.
Sorry, Ranma.
What's the kid's name?
Gabriel Henley.
Gabriel.
Why are you laughing?
Like Gabriel Knight, right?
I believe so.
Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?
Is that?
No.
Okay.
All right.
I like that.
Thank you for spoiling, Rob.
That's not a spoiler.
I didn't spoil a goddamn thing.
It's not a spoiler.
That's just his real name.
Somebody's going to be named Siler.
Maybe if you could watch the show.
I work with somebody named Melina.
Is that Siler?
No, but she's named after a video game character from Mortal Kombat.
Really?
I work with someone named Katana.
That's great.
No, I lied.
Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go now because your phone calls derail our show too much.
It gets the attention.
It gets people happy in the chat.
I did my job.
Bye.
One more call.
Oop, did I miss this one?
Hey, DJ Tyrant, what's on your mind, buddy?
Hey, not much.
Just wanted to say off your rant there about the gold spam in WoW.
Yeah.
I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened, not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.
What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?
They're not going to do anything about it.
They're supposed to change some of the reporting of users and stuff like that.
Yeah, I don't know.
Or just have it, like, okay, how hard would this be?
You can message...
How about this?
You can message a person, but then you have to wait a minute before you can message a different person.
Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.
Yeah, like limit that, like throttle it somehow that way so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.
I don't know.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Hopefully they'll do that.
And have you seen Blizzard's web page?
They're announcing their new product on Friday or Saturday, I believe.
It was the 19th, right?
Yeah.
Speaking of WoW, is it okay if I promote some of my other little projects I have on the side?
Okay.
Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website, wow.stratix.com, and we are having a developer chat on Tuesday.
So submit your questions through the IRC channel there, wow.stratix.com.
And it's been announced on the WOW webpage, so check it out if you're interested in asking the developers about the game or whatever.
Awesome.
And trying to make BlizzCon happen.
I've got to watch the monies, but I want to go to BlizzCon really bad.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
We'll probably see whatever they're going to announce this week there.
All right, we'll see.
All right, buddy.
We've got to let you go, but have a great one, okay?
Thanks a lot.
No problem.
Bye-bye.
Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyron.
Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU, which airs Thursday nights on this very network, but not for the next couple weeks.
They're taking a little bit of a break because we all need a break once in a while, but they'll be back.
This is your mother, Rob!
You didn't call me for Mother's Day!
You're a terrible son!
I wish I never had you!
That was yesterday.
It's Mother's Day today.
God, I should tell you this right now in front of all your listeners.
You were adopted.
What?
I was adopted?
You were adopted.
You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?
Yes.
Who's my real mother?
Well, I don't know.
Because I traded you with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes and a bottle of vodka.
Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.
What's wrong with you?
I used to.
Did you smoke while you were pregnant?
I hope not.
Oh, wait, no.
Never mind.
I was adopted.
Did they smoke while I was pregnant?
I don't really know what else to say, Mom.
You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners and I'm crying.
By the way, did you have anything... What video games have you been playing this week, Mom?
Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me, but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.
The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360?
What is that?
One of those things that chink like a disc?
Because it's 360 degrees?
Something like that.
I'll have to explain it to you later.
Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.
I begrudgingly love you, Rob.
I love you, too.
You should respond by hanging up quicker I guess so
All right, anyway, that's definitely going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Congratulations, everybody.
That call ruined it for the rest of you.
We're going to go around and wrap up the show now by first off asking if there's any last-minute stories here in the room.
Any last-minute stories?
I have a last-minute story.
Rob, your mom's cool.
What's that?
I have two last-minute stories.
First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally after five months of being broken.
That's a story.
What took so long?
Laziness.
and I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.
I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes out I can play it.
And then my other last minute story is my Magikarp evolved into a Gyarados.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
You know, this is completely inappropriate, but I feel like after that phone call I have no choice but to do this.
So we'll just give it a moment here.
Oh god.
Hello Hey dad, it's Rob Yeah Hey, how you doing?
Good, how are you doing?
Where are you at?
Good, I'm doing a radio program on the internet right now You know the one that embarrasses you that I do?
Yeah, I know, yeah Alright, is mom around?
Yeah Can you put her on real quick?
Just a second Alright Live radio boys and girls, have I mentioned that before?
Happy Mother's Day officially.
Thank you.
Why were they impersonating me?
They don't know me.
It's a joke.
What'd they say?
What were they saying?
They were saying that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.
Is that true?
No.
And I wasn't adopted?
No.
Okay, just making sure.
My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.
Well, hey, mom, I wanted to ask you, you know, when I was growing up, what did you think?
I played a lot of video games when I was growing up, huh?
Tons.
Tons.
Tons.
Why did you let me play so many video games?
Because I was an idiot.
Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this where I would have a radio program on the internet with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years talking about games?
Not in my weirdest dreams.
How come you never played video games with me?
I don't like games.
Why not?
What did the games do to you?
I just, I don't know.
They're boring.
So they're boring.
They play card games with you.
Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.
Well, video games are too fast-paced or something.
There's something, I just, I don't have the coordination.
Well, you know, but if you played them more often, you could build up the coordination.
Maybe, but why would I want to do that?
Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangeonsradio.com They're really liking you, Mom.
JV Mon says she is awesome.
DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.
The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
So you're popular.
You should come on the show sometime.
I have been on it before, remember?
When I told the whole world about you wearing the pink bunny suit?
Actually, that was a different show.
That I did before Orange Lounge Radio, but thanks so much for resharing that story.
I appreciate it.
All right, so, well, that's it.
I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not really my mother.
You really had a mother and you didn't hatch out of an egg.
Exactly, exactly.
We have other theories about how Rob came to be.
Well, he was, when he was four years old, was like a little old man, you know.
And then when he got to high school, he reverted back to childhood.
What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when I was four years old?
You were.
You were like a little old man.
You used to order everybody around.
You were like the boss.
I still do that.
You were the boss of me when you were four.
Did video games make me that way?
You were just really...
Well, you know, you were in an adult world.
You didn't have a lot of other children around.
Well, let's not get into the family drama here on the Internet where lots of people are listening.
So you kind of were old for your age.
How do I say it?
And then when you got into high school, it was like, what did I miss?
And then so you started being a child, you know, dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I heard lip-syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you, so I have to open in on this.
Jesus, when I was in high school, we participated in this lip-sync contest, and it was me and my two friends, and we did Hole by Violet.
You know, go on, take everything.
And I dressed up like Courtney Love, and my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.
Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen
Alright, bye.
Anyway, sorry mom.
Thanks mom for bringing that up.
I appreciate that.
Oh, okay.
What about all the good things I did?
Which would be what, one thing?
Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.
Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local news?
Uh-huh.
Very.
She sounds so convinced.
All right.
Mom, I appreciate you calling.
I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like, so there you go.
Well, she's like a female Rob.
So a Rob.
Shut up, Shane.
All right.
Mom, thanks so much for playing along.
I appreciate it.
You always know on Mother's Day or something to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.
Uh-huh.
I love you.
I was just waiting.
I was waiting for you to call, actually.
I love you.
And so do all the chatters.
I love you, too.
All right.
Alright, take care.
Happy Mother's Day.
Bye.
Bye, friend.
Bye.
Did she say, bye, friend?
I think she did.
I think she's like, bye, friend.
She said, friends.
Oh, bye, friends.
Yeah.
That had nothing to do with me.
I like your mom.
I know, she's funny.
I've met your mom in person.
I like your mom, too, because the whole... Why don't we call my mom next week?
We just might have to.
Or maybe, you know... Who knows?
It might be her birthday or something.
My mom's birthday's in November.
Oh, it's a ways off.
We'll see.
My mom's going to be 49.
No, 48.
My mom's going to be 49.
I keep forgetting, this is actually part of the podcast, so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?
However, I would like to see, I do have a request.
Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviewed, rejected last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss or whatever it was, like iTunes was rejecting the word piss.
Maybe you guys want to say, this show is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.
I don't know.
That would be great.
My mom would like that.
I could show it to her and she'd be like, what?
I don't get it.
So there you go.
All right.
Anyhow, we've got to wrap it up.
Any last-minute stories for real?
No.
All right.
Nothing from you, Loki?
I'm surprised.
He's distracted by the interwebs.
I know.
What are you doing on the Internet?
Stuff.
All right.
Crisis Core coming out in Japan September 13th.
There you go.
There you go.
All right, well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Shane, thank you for being on the show, even though you never say anything.
But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.
It's always funny.
All right, so your final thoughts, Shane?
I don't know.
All right, thanks.
Thanks for sharing.
All right, Loki, your final thought?
Stupid postage is going up to 41 cents tomorrow.
My final thought is zombie movie Shane.
We're going to be fun.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I have ice cream at home that's low sugar and I can eat it.
I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday because I was having a bad day and I didn't eat that.
But it was really good.
So don't point at my fat.
All right.
I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run when it's in the theater.
All right.
