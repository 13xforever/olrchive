Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, May 13th, 2007

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Could the Xbox Live Marketplace be set to compete with iTunes?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
The easy release of Spore faces yet another delay

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And a PlayStation series is revived on cell phones?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
But you might know her as Jamie Summers

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I love salad

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I heard your TV shows getting picked up by NBC after all

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
The Bionic Woman, the remake

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
What?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, they're making a remake of Bionic Woman

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
That's so fucking cool

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Because I think of your name and everything

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You know, your name, quote unquote

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
To recap for new people

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
My mom was going to name me Erica

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And the little girl next door said, no, you should name her after the Bionic Woman

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Name her Jamie

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
So my mom named me Jamie, only she spelled it right

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And so that's why I took Summers as my last name for my stage name

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
There you go

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Because I am named after, my mom showed her very small nerd roots

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
But you've been using that name on air for the past, you know, five years or so

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I've been using it since under sedation

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, so a long time, so it's just kind of funny that now the Bionic Woman is coming back, so

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Do we get neat sound effects?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know, well maybe

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Dude, it will not be the same if we do not get neat sound effects when she runs

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I do know that the people behind Battlestar Galactica have a hand in this

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
A new remake, so it should be pretty awesome

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Because if there's one show I've been watching a shitload of lately, it's Battlestar Galactica

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Finally, I'm like three years late, but I'm finally catching up

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
The last Battlestar Galactica thing I saw was on Robot Chicken

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
With the giant mecha things falling over

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Alright

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
The Cylons

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And there's Techmaster Loki

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
That was a funny episode, that was like one of the first ones actually

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I was watching the Optimus Prime with prostate cancer thing

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Well, Bionic Woman, that sounds kind of retarded actually

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It could be cool though, I mean

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
What, is she going to run super fast with a cell phone in her hand, trip into laypeople and cause a super crash or something?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's not the Bionic Soccer Mom

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
We can rebuild her, she will be even more, you know, destruction prone

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It sounds like a horrible show

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Bionic Man sounds even retarded

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
That sounds kind of dumb too

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And Bionic Woman is like, I'm going to rage at you

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
That was the Six Million Dollar Man

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I was going to say, they have the Six Million Dollar Man, so

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh, well then that's lame, I don't even give a shit about the Bionic Woman

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, I believe

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Unless she has a claw that comes out of her hand and she can swing on things and fights Hitler

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I believe

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Bionic Commando

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
I believe I was reading in one of those websites that in this new Bionic Woman, she's a 50 million dollar woman

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
They have 50 million dollars worth of parts in her

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Well yeah, inflation, you know, is a bitch

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
That'll buy a nice pair of tits though

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Alright

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It better for 50 million dollars

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I want Rebecca Romain to play her

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
No, it's some British unknown

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Somebody that isn't known here, but has been in some British shows

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
British, I know

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Softy

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I want someone who looks like Jane Fonda in the 60's

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
There's pictures, go to dig and look at the entertainment section and you can see pictures of the new Bionic Woman

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Rob, I'm doing a show right now

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Like that ever stopped you before

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Alright

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Anyway, also say hello, we'll get to video games soon, I promise

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
We have nerd stuff to get to first

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Also say hello to a frequent guest of ours, but he hasn't been here in a while

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Say hello to Miklotov

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Hello

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And where have you been young man?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I don't know

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Where have I been?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
The island of Pokemon

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, you've been catching Pokemons

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm tired

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I just woke up

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Alright

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
What's going on?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
But I noticed that you're playing DS, you're playing Pokemon now

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yes

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Still

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Now, you started Pokemon and then you restarted your game

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Why did you quit and restart your game completely?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Because I felt like I was doing too much trading and not enough playing

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I was just not happy with my Pokemon, so I restarted

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
And I started with Chimchar, who I've named Homonkey

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Like homo-monkey?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Like homo-monkey, yes

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Like a Pokemon name, it's awesome

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Shane, Miklotov, and I like to have naming contests for our Pokemon, like who can have the better names

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Mine wins hands down, nothing's gonna top that, like nothing ever

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
No porch monkey would not fit, because he's not black

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I liked, you named one of them Fancy Pants

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Fancy Pants

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Because it looked like it was wearing a big fur coat

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
And then it evolved into like this cyber grasshopper looking thing

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It was ridiculous

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
It was ugly pants

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't use it anymore

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I like Muffins

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Muffins is actually called Daddy Ore

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
What was the other one I just called it?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
See the problem is, I don't know the real Pokemon names now

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Because of my stupid names, because I named everything

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Like I named one Sparkles, because it had a little thing on its tail

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
It had a little sparkle on its tail

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
My electric squirrel thing is named Ellinuts, because it's an electric squirrel

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
And I really got creative when I got that Ponyta

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
It's a fire horse, so I named it Hoarfires

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
So I just put fire in the middle of horse

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
That's it

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
That's very creative

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It is creative

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Good job

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I enjoy it

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Actually, I caught a Magikarp and named it Useless

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I named it Fish Sticks

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Alright, anyhow

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Wow, we're nerds

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Anyhow, also we have some nerds here in chat

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we record

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Kind of a busy Sunday, we don't have as many people as we usually do

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I mean, we're up against Mother's Day today

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You know, there's a lot of people out doing stuff with their moms

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Happy Mother's Day if we have any moms that listen to our program

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Also, we are up against the finale of Survivor

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
You know, somebody actually had the balls to come into chat

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And say, oh, sorry, I can't listen to you guys tonight, Survivor's on

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Goodbye

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Shut up

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay, A, this season of Survivor was spoiled a long time ago if you read the forums

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I can tell you who wins, but I'm going to be nice

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He's already told me

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
For listeners to TiVo'd it

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
But, yeah, it's just, I don't know

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I used to be the biggest Survivor fan

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Like, I had a party when the first Survivor was ending

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay, I was that hardcore nerd

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
But now, like, the game's really gotten just old

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I haven't really gotten into any seasons since, like, maybe

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Palau was, like, the last one I watched, which was a while ago

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
So, anyway

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Don't you love reality television, DarkSakura?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
No

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Then we ought to get into our gaming weeks

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
It was kind of neat

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I actually just played a whole lot of pinball

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You know

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I looked at Cooking Mama once

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Just to show somebody

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But, really, I've just been playing a bunch of pinball

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And, you know, I got Guild Wars

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Which, um, right now

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm having to be really slow with moving on to my new computer

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Because I actually have to replace all of my programs

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So, I haven't really been playing a whole lot

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, we are, though, we've decided we're getting Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Because we have more controllers

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
That's the only reason

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Party

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Party game

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
How many, can four folks play simultaneously on that one?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That's pretty cool

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I've still yet to play it

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
But I've already laid claim

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Alright

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, what pinball tables have been dominating your time lately?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Twilight Zone, that game's a bitch

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
But you haven't really been playing the pinball game on 360

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
The new downloadable one

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
No, Dan can play it, I don't care

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It kind of looks sucky to me

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
The whole point of pinball to me

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
The last good virtual pinball besides for Alien Crush and Devil's Crush

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Was, like, Revenge of the Gator on Game Boy

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Back in the day

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
That game was awesome

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, Sonic Spinball, of course

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
But that's not quite the same

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
But, you know, Devil's Crush and Alien Crush are the pinnacle of video pinball

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Anything else is just a pale imitation

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I have to say that, for me, it's having the flippers and the noises and the ball

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And having my machine go Powerball and getting that ceramic ball

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That the magnets can't do crap to

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I love Twilight Zone

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But I've also been playing Rocky and Bullwinkle

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
I like the pinball FX, but, you know, I think I was getting into this last week

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Nothing is a replacement for the real thing, sadly

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Nothing at all

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You feel the machine move

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And that's, I think, the

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Not even Revenge of the Gator, sadly

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Not even Revenge of the Gator

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
It was good

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Finally got the damn systems to land with each other

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Apparently the problem was Crackdown

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Because Crackdown is a little bitch and doesn't want to land with other systems

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Unless you do it its way

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So anyways

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
So I've been playing a little bit of Call of Duty 3

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
And that was fun

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
We landed together and had a little multiplayer game

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
And then once the Crackdown update came out

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
With the new download content

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
That pretty much screwed any chances I had with playing anything else

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
So I've been playing that

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And the download content is pretty awesome

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Especially the free-for-all pack

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Which is the free stuff that basically unlocks the keys to the city

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Which is basically a debug mode for the game

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You can adjust the agility of your character

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
You can give yourself super agility to jump even higher

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Or run super fast and then super strength

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Plus you can spawn vehicles, spawn explosive barrels

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Have all weapons, unlimited ammo, god mode, that kind of stuff

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Of course none of that stuff counts if you're playing the actual game

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
But it's just a little fun little mode to play with

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
And you can do that in co-op

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Then of course there's also new weapons and new vehicles with the paid one

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Including a spear gun

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You can spear people in the head and stick them to the walls and stuff like that

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Which is kind of fun

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
And then they have like a dune buggy vehicle that you can spin around the air like crazy

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Just a bunch of little fun stuff

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Plus now they have street racing in the game

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Which adds a little bit of, you know, kind of a little extra minigame in there

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But overall I think it's pretty awesome

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And then of course, you know, fuck

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Tomorrow we've got, you know, or I should say Monday

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
For those people listening on the podcast

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
The Halo 3, er, no I'm sorry, not Monday, Wednesday

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
The Halo 3 beta is going to be coming out, so

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
A bunch of people on my friends list are already playing it

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
We're just not special, nobody cares

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Because, you know, they had those preview events in Frisco and New York

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
And they were giving out those codes to basically everybody that went to the event

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
So there's a bunch of people on live already playing it

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But, you know, I don't care

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I know, I'm like, eh, it's a beta

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
It's not the real game

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And like, you know, the beta's going to have issues

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Especially with everybody hitting it at once

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
I think people are getting a little too excited about the Halo 3 beta

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
If that makes sense

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Like it's not the real game

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't know, I think Microsoft's pretty ballsy to be doing this to be honest

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Uh, they played Super Paper Mario some more

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
About halfway through the game now

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And it's still very easy, I don't know

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I've had like no trouble getting through the game at all

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
And I don't know if it's just

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Like even all the secret stuff and the puzzles are just so fucking easy to figure out

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't know

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But it's fun, you know, don't get me wrong

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
It's a fun game

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I just, I would really like them to do a new Mario RPG

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Because, you know, even if you kept the same graphic style as this game

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It could be so awesome

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
It's just very disappointing that they're not gonna

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Alright

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
DarkSakura, some comments from chatroom

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Toshin asked about Pokemon Pinball

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Did you ever play that one?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Did you like that one?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Barely

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I was a good one, I liked it

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
There was two of them if I remember right

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
There was one for the old games and the one for the advanced games

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
They did like two

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Dude, Epic Pinball

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
On the PC, yeah, Epic Pinball was pretty awesome

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I had another pinball simulator

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I can't remember the name of it

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Somebody had, I brought it up on a previous episode

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Somebody named it

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
But there were some good PC pinball games too

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Epic Pinball, of course, being one

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Also looking at chatroom

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
RawstealUT says Halo 3 Beta

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
The only reason people bought Crackdown

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That might be true, but they got a pretty decent game with it

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It's a fucking awesome game

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Even I like Crackdown

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
It's not usually my type of game, but I like it quite a bit

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I would have bought it even if it didn't have Halo 3 Beta in there

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
There you go

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
To be honest, I don't even know

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean, I may download it and might play it once

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't think I'm going to play it much more than that

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Because I'm not really a huge Halo fan

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And as far as first-person shooters go

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It doesn't really make, it doesn't seem like

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That big of a difference in Halo 2

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It's just like, eh, whatever

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm going to get fucking murdered by everybody on there anyway

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Because I suck at Halo like really bad

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I want to know if there's any really really bad Halo players

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That are excited about the Halo 3 Beta

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
Because we need to form a clan and just play with each other and suck together at Halo 3

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm pretty awful, I've only played Halo 2 like four times

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'll play if you load me up on meclizine

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Do you have the Beta? Do you have Crackdown or anything?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Can you get the Beta?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I got Crackdown

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay, then you can get into the Beta

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
So we'll play an OLR We Suck night or something

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
But we only have a few weeks to do it, I think, so

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
We'll see

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You can still, by the way, I was at Best Buy the other day

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Randomly, and they still had Crackdown with the Halo 3 Beta in it

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
So, you can still find copies of it

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
So, get them soon if you want to get in

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Well, this has nothing to do with Halo, but I did have an announcement

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Okay

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Um, probably in the next four months I'm going to be a published illustrator

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh, how so?

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Um, I'm going to be doing flashcards of bones and muscles if everything works out

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Huh

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
For my flash therapists

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That'll be fun

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
So, are you going to autograph them at different places for our listeners?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
No, but I'm going to take deep tissue massage

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
That's cool

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Well, good luck with that

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Um, my gaming week

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Let's see, I haven't really played video games this week

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
They're bad for you

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I've been trying to avoid video games

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Also, I don't eat at Wendy's anymore

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Because they support the evil company that is Nintendo

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
And, you know, this lawyer guy told me that was bad

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
No, kidding of course

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I had, all things considered, I actually had a pretty bad week personally this week

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
But, Miklotov cheered me up, which was really cool, because he bought me this

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
This Final Fantasy XII play arts

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And this is great radio, by the way, when I go like this in motion

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
It's something that listeners can't see

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
But I'm telling you, it's a Balthier figurine from Final Fantasy XII

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And Balthier is the sexy, sexy, sexy pirate from Final Fantasy XII

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
And, like, the best reason to play that game is him and Fran

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Because they have the best interactions and steal every scene

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
So, I love them

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And so I was very happy to get this figurine

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And it kind of made me go, damn, Final Fantasy XII was one of those games I started

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And just didn't finish because all the console launches were going on at that time

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I really need to go back now that

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I never even started it

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I need to play it, it's such an incredible game

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I need to finish it

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And the characters are so awesome, so there you go

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Um, let's see

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And, um, also I played World of Warcraft

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I got to level 51 because I don't have a life

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And, uh, then I played some Xbox Live

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I finally tried out Catan this week

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
And, uh, because somebody had told me it was like Civilization

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Lies, lies, lies, lies

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Catan, I don't know, Catan didn't really do it for me

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
I know there's a lot of people that are really into the strategy games

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And, you know, really got into Catan

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
But it just, it just wasn't the kind of game I was looking for on Xbox Live

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Um, and I hear it has some real crappy multiplayer

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That people are getting disconnected and all that stuff

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
So, I don't know, I don't know

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Try out the demo, see if it's your type of thing

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
It's way more complicated than Uno, certainly

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But, what I do like about the game, what it does have going for it

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Is because the game is a little more complicated

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You have to really kind of learn it and think

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It's a much more, like, thinking type game

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Uh, the people that are playing it are pretty intelligent

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So if you do play it online, you don't get a lot of the

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
type people, you know, the people, that's what they say

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You know, in their headsets on Xbox Live, so that's kind of

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Kind of, I guess, something the game has going for it

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Otherwise I've been playing a little more Pinball FX

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And, uh, Centipede and Millipede

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
For no good reason, other than I just really like retro games

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So I was playing, uh, Centipede and Millipede

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh, and Double Dragon, I bought Double Dragon

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
But, I was a little, well, it's not that bad

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
But the problem is that I really remember the Nintendo one

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Much more, and there's big differences between the Nintendo one

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And the arcade one

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And namely that the arcade one was a lot harder

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And some of the, like, the moves aren't quite the same

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
That they were in the Nintendo one

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Like, with the Nintendo one, you, um

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Gain these stars as your points went up

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And that allowed you to do more moves

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Like jump kick and punch people when they're on the ground

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And stuff, and it doesn't really work the same in the arcade

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Uh, version

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
But I thought

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It's the first port I've seen of an old arcade classic

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That wasn't done by that, what is it?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Digital Eclipse, is that what they are?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It was done by somebody else

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And so it was kind of refreshing to see that there's other companies

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Capable of porting over the old games

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
They did a pretty decent job, the high def graphics are really cleaned up

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I mean, it looks nice for, you know, an arcade game that's 20 years old

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
So, it was alright, 5 bucks

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Not bad

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
That's it, that's my gaming week

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Miklotov, how about your gaming week?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Um, I played WoW a couple times

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm level 56, so I have less of a life

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Um, I also had the sudden interest

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
To start playing Bust A Move 2 again

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Because I love that game

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So I've been playing it like non-stop

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And there's not like anything new I can do in it

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Because I've already unlocked everybody, beaten it with every character

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Always get the upper path

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
So, I don't know, it's just a little fun game to play I guess

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Been slacking on Pokemon

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Um, other than that

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I don't think there are any video games I play

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Hey, keep your cell phone off

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Sorry, my cell phone went off

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
People forget I do this thing on Sunday night

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
And try to call me

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Yes, and

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't know, I guess

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Kind of gaming related

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I think I'm leaving Konami by the 4th of June

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Okay

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So hooray for me

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Well, I mean, you'll finally be able to talk openly

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
About what you do during the day, that'll be nice

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Oh, I can talk about it right now

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I play Bust A Move 2 all day

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That's pretty much what I do

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I don't care

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Alright, well there you go

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
There's no other games you've been working on by chance?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Sometimes I play Dance Summit

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I kind of switch it out between the two

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Bring that over, because I miss that game

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Okay, I'll bring it next time, it's at work right now

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I haven't played that in forever

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
And I've been trying to find a copy of it to buy

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Good luck with that

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I fell on eBay for 40 bucks

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh, that's really cheap, that's definitely worth it

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm looking actually right now to find a copy of Bust A Groove 1 US

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Do you want to borrow mine?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
No, I want one to own

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I could probably sell you mine, because I have the Japanese ones

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh really?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
While you guys barter and trade over there

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Jvmon says in chat

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
If Bust A Move 2 is on the Playstation 3 network

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That would sell me a PS3

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It would sell me one too

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Or, you know what, if Squeenix decided to

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Ever revisit that series

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't care if they put a Final Fantasy

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Character in it to ruin the game

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I would still buy another one

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I keep forgetting it was an Enix game

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
You don't think of that

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You think of Squeenix, you think, oh, roleplaying games, roleplaying games

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
They don't do really anything else

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I knew of Dragon Warrior, Quest, whatever

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And I used to frequent the Enix boards

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And I only hung out at the Bust A Groove section

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
That's all I knew Enix for

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
For the longest time

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Well, I remember some of their old

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Super Nintendo roleplaying games

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Like Illusion of Gaia, Soul Blazer

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Those were good games

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
An Act Racer was an Enix game, right?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I believe so

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And then Square ruined them

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
SJ100Matt asks, what?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
No Sweet Coden for you, Miklotov?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
To play?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
No, because

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I guess, you know

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I still care about the series

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
But after working on it

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I kind of know everything that happens

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
In the last game

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And I never even finished playing it

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
So it's like, there's nothing to surprise me

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Is it kind of one of those things

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Where like, you know

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Maybe you're really excited

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
For many years to work at

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't know, like let's say a

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Taco Bell

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Nobody's excited to work at Taco Bell

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
What the hell's wrong with you?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
People are excited to work

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
At Great America, a theme park

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
People are really excited, they want to work at a theme park

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And then when they get there and realize how everything

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Really works, how the rides all function

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And how the magic happens

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Everything kind of loses its magic

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Is it kind of like that, where now that you've been on the inside

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
There's no more?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
No, it wasn't even that

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It's just office politics go down

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And then things completely change

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And that's when it gets bad

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Drama?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Drama, yes

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Alright

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Well speaking of drama

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I want to get into some housekeeping this week

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
And this is a little atypical housekeeping for us

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
But we were asked by our buddies

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Over at AllGames.com to relay the following announcement

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Which is cool because

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
They have a live show on Monday nights

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
As well as Tuesday mornings over on AllGames.com

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
If you miss the live show on Sunday

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You can always hear part A and B together on AllGames

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And one of their other shows

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
The video game show, they had a little bit of drama

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
A couple weeks ago

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And to make a long story short

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
A lot of folks think

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That the show is gone

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Because of something that someone on the show did

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
To the website and everything

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And he's since apologized for it

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I saw the apology and was basically like

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I suck and I'm sorry

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But a lot of people still think the show is gone

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
So AllGames is asking us

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
To put forward the video game show

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
They are not gone

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
They are still around

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
And they are now at www.videogameshow.net

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So we know those of you who listen to Orange on the Radio

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Probably listen to other independent video game podcasts

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And we encourage you to do so

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
So if you're a fan of Chris Haas and Rich Bergen

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
They are now over at videogameshow.net

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Check it out

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Their show is moved over there

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Also in housekeeping tonight

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I wanted to mention real quick

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Of course our FONOMAY appearance

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Is going to be happening over Memorial Day weekend in San Jose

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Saturday at 2pm

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
We hope to see you guys there

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Speaking of FONOMAY conventions

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
We're going to talk about ACEN a little later tonight

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Can I just say ACEN and the same thing?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
What if I don't want to say ACEN?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Then no one will know what you're talking about

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Jerks

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Regardless, Chris called us

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And we're going to hear her message a little bit later

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Thank you to folks who've reviewed us recently

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
In iTunes

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
With 5 star reviews

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I was looking at some of the more recent reviewers

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And there's some awesome reviews

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Some folks actually using some of the gags from our previous weeks

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Somebody left a review that says

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
OLR the L stands for suck

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
That was pretty awesome

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
We just really want to thank you guys

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Because we know probably every podcast you listen to

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Says go vote for us here

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Go leave us a review on iTunes

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
But it really really really does help

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
When you get more reviews

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It gets you that exposure

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
When we first started the video game podcasting thing

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
A couple years ago

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
There was like maybe 10 shows at the most

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
So there wasn't much to pick from

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
That's how a lot of folks found us

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But now there's like 10,000 video game podcasts

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Out there

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Because every freaking magazine has their own podcast

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And every blog has a podcast

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's really tough to stand out sometimes

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
So we just kind of keep doing our thing

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And hope people enjoy what we're doing

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
But we appreciate it when you guys help get the word out

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
So tell a friend

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Leave us a review on iTunes

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
We do appreciate all of that

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Alright enough blabber

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Let's get into the gaming news

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Who's going to start us off tonight?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Yes there's been a lot of news this week

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Because everyone seems to think it's like E3 all over again

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Because I mean hey about a year from now

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Or a year ago we were pretty much at E3

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I was just thinking of that

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Bobby Blackwolf speaking of all games

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Bobby Blackwolf had his birthday

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I think it was yesterday

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Happy birthday Bobby by the way

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And that reminded me that

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
He had his birthday at E3 last year

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So that was making me go

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Shit it's been one year since E3

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
And it was kind of sad because E3

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Sucks now

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The E3 rave as we've been calling it

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Because they're going to take you to an abandoned airport hangar

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And unmarked vehicles will come pick you up

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And escort you there

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Don't worry though G4 will be there as their commercials say

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Whoopee

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
One more reason I don't want to go to E3

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
But I do because

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
All the cool kids go

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Except for G4

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Well Jamie

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Our very own

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Jamie has an invite

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And is basically saying

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
You know what I'm not going I'm too cool for this

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I didn't say I wasn't going I just said I can't afford to go

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Unless

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Like the heavens open up and

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
God gives me money

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
We'll see

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I have to get time off work too

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I think you're just too cool for E3

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I know

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
So because of that

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
There's been a whole bunch of announcements this week

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Including some from Square Enix's

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Own little party that they had

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Celebrating the Final Fantasy

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
20th anniversary

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And with that

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
A bunch of announcements for Final Fantasy games

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And what not

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Including a remake of Final Fantasy 4

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Yes much like there was for the

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Final Fantasy 3

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Looks pretty sexy from what I've seen so far

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Completely redone all 3D

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Hooray

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't know how I feel about this

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Final Fantasy 4 is my favorite

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Final Fantasy game

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Mostly because it was the first one I ever really got into

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And beat

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So you know it's kind of weird to watch

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That get changed into this whole new

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
3D thing

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I think it looks good

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I probably love it but you know

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It's like somebody is messing with your baby

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I hope it just doesn't turn out as bad

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
As Final Fantasy 3 did for the DS

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Because that was no fun

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
You didn't like it? No

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But did you like the original Nintendo one? Did you ever play it?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Like translation or anything?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Maybe I think so a little bit

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
The third one was great

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's kind of slow

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I had fun with it

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It's not slow in the story sense even though it is

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Everything just seems really slow

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
In that game

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I don't know it's not that fun

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Well that's your opinion

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I think it looks good

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I think they needed to be doing

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
More of this on the PSP

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That's for sure because

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's kind of lacking

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
But yeah keep it up

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I want to see Final Fantasy 6 redone

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
As well

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I'm looking at chat for comments here

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
JVMON agrees with you Miklotov

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Final Fantasy 3 for the DS was boring as hell

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I think Final Fantasy 3 DS was good

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
RasteelUT says Final Fantasy 4 DS was uber milkage

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Let's see

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
SSJ100Matt says

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I really want them to remake 5

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Sephiroth1215 says 4

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
What was so great about 4? 5 and 6 are so much better

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I can't explain the allure of 4

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Sephiroth1215

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Other than really the fact that it's the first one

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I really played

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I played the original one on NES

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
This is the first one I played all the way through

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And it really just had a moving story

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I think Final Fantasy 4 was really the first one

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
For me

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Since we kind of missed most of the NES ones over here

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I think it was really the first one for me

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
That had such a moving story

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And the orchestral

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
The spoonie bard

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah and it had the spoonie bard

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
And dear god

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Mark my words

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
If Final Fantasy 4 DS did not keep the spoonie bard lingo intact

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Instant fail

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
On Square Enix's part

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I will pick it

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Screw that up

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Give me my spoonie bard

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It looks nice

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
At least it's not just a straight port

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
At least they're doing something with it

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
That's good

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I'll give them that

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I'm actually thinking I'm going to get that one

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Because it was one of my favorites too

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
But I would prefer 5

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
The reason I liked 3 was because of the job change system

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Gamezoo time

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I was going to say if this sells well

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
What happens next right?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Let's hope so

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Well at any rate there's some good news for our UK listeners

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
For anyone who is interested in SNK vs Capcom

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Card fighters

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
For the DS

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
The little problem that was going on in the 9th level of the game

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
We were having this issue

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Where if you

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Fought the opponent

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
John you didn't get the card so you couldn't finish the game

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
That is being

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Corrected for the UK release

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
And also

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
For our American listeners

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
SNK has offered

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
To replace all of your copies

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It does though take up to 6 weeks

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
For your replacements to arrive

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Aw we gotta actually do something

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Instead of just re-releasing

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Stuff what the hell

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Making us work now? Seriously

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm actually a victim

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Of that

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Not that I like card games or anything

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I only bought it because it has Phoenix Wright stuff in it

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
So I'm not actually going to get rid of my copy

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Because it's only on the new game plus

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So take that

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
SNK

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
You're not getting my cartridge back

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
To be fair though they do have a new

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Arcade game that's going to be

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Coming out

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Not that we really care

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
What Capcom vs SNK?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
No SNK has actually got a new

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
King of Fighters

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Sorry I lost interest in that series a while ago

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
But I liked Capcom vs SNK

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That was kinda cool

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
A lot of fighting games but I liked Capcom vs SNK

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
My vs Chun-Li awesome

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Epic

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Well anyway speaking of epic

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Loki and I were addicted

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
For many many many many

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Many years to Final Fantasy 11

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Actually not that many years

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh yeah Miklata was addicted too

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And it's your fucking fault

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I went back like 2

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
How long ago was it? About 6 months ago?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
That we went back when the 360 version came out?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah and we played for like maybe a month

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You bastard

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Well Final Fantasy 11 fans

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Those of you that have stuck with the game

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You troopers you

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Good news for you guys there's a brand new add on coming out

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
It's Wings of the Goddess

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
This was announced at

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Square Enix Party 07

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And there was a little trailer that went with it

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I watched the trailer

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I was not impressed because half of it was recycled footage

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
From all the expansions that are already out

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Like the original opening movie

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
That's like 5 years old right?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
And then the rest of it

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I get was pretty much like

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Miklata picked this out I didn't even pick this out

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
This looks the exact same as the areas that are already in there

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Miklata was like oh yeah it's the areas

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Like before

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The game takes place because I guess this

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Wings of the Goddess is some type of like

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Prequel-ish thing or a time travel thing

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Where you go back to the past

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It's basically going back to the actual

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Was it the war or whatever that they had?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
The Crystal War

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You know this is just an

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Excuse to introduce a time mage class

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
That's what I think

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Interesting theory. Are you going to go back to the game?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
When this comes out?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Probably for a week

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Well I went back every other time a new expansion came out

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm not going to stop

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's just I won't play it much and then I'll be like

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I'm too low of a level to do anything in the new area

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
And I just want to go get the new job classes

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Just hold off

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
They're making a new fucking role playing game anyways

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Seriously

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Just as a friendly reminder

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I'd like to go around and remind everybody

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Why we quit Final Fantasy 11

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Because there's probably some fans of the game who listen to the program going

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
You guys are so mean to Final Fantasy 11

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I play this game

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Okay we played this game between us all

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We probably played this game for many many many years

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Jamie why'd you quit?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I played for six months

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
And it was because the white mage is the party bitch

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And I like playing white mages

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So fuck everybody in that game

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Loki why'd you quit?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I quit because I had a girlfriend and a wife

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
That became a wife

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
At the same time?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
That's amazing

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
No that would not be fun

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
So I couldn't play it as often as I'd like to

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
And there was a big six month span

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Where I didn't actually play at all

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And it's just paying that kind of money each month

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Even though it's 13 or 12 bucks

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It's still money that's being wasted

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I mean hell

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
If I was still single

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Not seeing anybody

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I'd probably still be playing it

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Because it was fun

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I had fun with it

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
But it's just you get to a point though

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You work so hard in the game

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And then it's just

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
You know you get in stupid parties

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And the whole fact that you have to party with people

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Really kind of sucks

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I know it's an MMO

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And you're supposed to party with people

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
But the fact that they force you to party

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
When you can't find a party

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I mean that kind of fucking sucks

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
You go on the play

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And you can't do anything

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So that was lame

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Well the main reason probably

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Is that whole XP loss

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
When you die

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
But most recently it was because

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Getting blue mage spells sucked sometimes

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And me and

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
One of my friends in the game

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
We spent all night

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Hours and hours trying to get this one spell

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Never got it

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
So I was like screw this game I'm done

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And the reason I did it was because

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Squeenix did nothing about the gold farmers

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
For far too long and the economy in that game

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Was fucked

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And people were telling me to actually buy

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Gill and I was like that's where I draw the line

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Is spending that type of real world money

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
To buy fake money online

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Just because you know

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
These people who are being paid

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
To sit here and camp these monsters

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Are getting stuff before me

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
People were so elitist that if you didn't have these items

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
It's like you suck in parties

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Even I had my elitist

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Plus one everything

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Fucking bard character

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And I got nothing

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
No parties out of that

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Alright so there you go

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Plus everything charisma and all that stuff

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
What?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I was just going to say it's like

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
They want you to party in that game

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
But people have in their minds

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
The ideal party setup and if you don't fit that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Your job or anything then what's the point

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Because you're not going to get a party

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
At least back when I played

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And you know your job is worthless then

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Heaven help you if you're a paladin who doesn't sub warrior

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah you have to have the right sub jobs too

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
So boo on you

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Final Fantasy 11 boo

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Let's see looking at the

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Comments in the chat room here

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
RawsteelUT says healers are the party bitch

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
In every MMO

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Let's see

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Sephiroth1215 says I never liked Final Fantasy 11

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
But it does get addicting

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Somehow when I stopped myself before I was an addict

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
ShadowFitSlayer says

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Tetra Master is greater than Final Fantasy 11

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Boo

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Tetra Master was kind of fun

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
No it wasn't

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I played my free month of Tetra Master

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I had fun

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It was fun for about 5 minutes

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
That's a very good idea actually Loki

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Loki says put that on Xbox Live Arcade

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Yes and no one will play it

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Shut up I play it once

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
New story please

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Anyways

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't have time for me to read but

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Parasite Eve 3 is apparently going to be

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
a cell phone title

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
You know obviously in Japan

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
where cell phone titles are more popular

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You know it's not a big surprise

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
But over here though

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I would hope that maybe a next gen version

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
of Parasite Eve because I like that series

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I thought it was pretty good

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Although then again I never did play the second one

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
But this was announced over at the Square Enix party

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I don't know

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Kind of disappointing

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Hopefully you know

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
You know what they kind of tend to do with these kind of things

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
They'll port it over to the PSP or something

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Later on

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Here's hoping for a PSP version

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
PSP version would be hot though

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
RosteelUT who I'm quoting a lot tonight

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
But he's saying a lot of stuff here

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm not going to tell him to shut up

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
He's saying a lot of good stuff here

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Heartbreaks as he hears

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
PE3 is a cell phone title

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm sure that's how most people feel

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
About that news

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Because everybody was kind of waiting for

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Parasite Eve 3 on Playstation 2

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And then it just never happened

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Well at least you know

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Maybe they translate the book for us

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Some of us who wants to read it can

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I saw the Japanese movie and that was awesome

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I've got it somewhere but my friends read the book

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Like five times and keep telling me how awesome the book is

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Ew, reading

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Shut up

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I like the book so I get the good story

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Anyway

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Well there is actually a bit of happiness

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
That came out of the Tokyo Game Show

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And that was an announcement for

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Kingdom Hearts

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Well it's going to happen at the Tokyo Game Show

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Still a few months off

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Well that's what I said isn't it

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
No you said some announcement

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It's coming out of the

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Ok whatever

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Pardon my context

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Anyway it's going to be announced

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
At the Tokyo Game Show

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
So

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I'm just sick of announcements of announcements

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
We have an announcement to make

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
We're going to make an announcement later

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I completely refrain from here on out

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
To make announcements of announcements

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
You know what

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It is an amazing trend within this industry

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Is that hey stay tuned

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
For a really big announcement about

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Something we're going to be announcing very soon

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
It's like

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Shut up and make a game

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Shut up and go make the game

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Anyhow

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Any hopes for what they're going to be announcing

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Dark Sakura

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 maybe

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Or do you think it's going to be like

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Kingdom Hearts MMO

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
There's not going to be any way they can do a

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Kingdom Hearts MMO

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Kingdom Hearts minus Disney

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Then it won't be good

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Let's see

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Hostile1 in chat says

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Please please please

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Kingdom Hearts for 360

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Save me the $600 for the Playstation 3

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Except it's minus Disney and with

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Hanna-Barbera instead

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Yabba Dabba Doo

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
That'd be so horrible

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Oh hooray I have Quick Draw McGraw in my party

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
And Droopy Dog

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh but

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Wow

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Hey but Jetsons world would be pretty awesome

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
What do you think of that Jamie

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Kingdom Hearts with minus the Disney plus

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
The Hanna-Barbera

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
They should do

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Plus Warner Brothers

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
So we get the Animaniacs

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Was that Johnny Quest 2?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah that was Hanna-Barbera

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Was it?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
But then again that would also give us C-Lab

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
It could be worse they could do Kingdom Hearts 3 with

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Adult Swim

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I guess that's true

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Kingdom Hearts with Robot Chicken

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Let's talk about some games we know are coming out

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
We're going to do some release dates real quick here

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I'm going to start off with Japanese

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
release dates and again it's been kind of

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
a slow month over there in Japan

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
There's not a whole lot of stuff coming out

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
But on the Nintendo Wii they are getting Marvel

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Ultimate Alliance in Japan

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
So the Japanese version coming out from

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Inter Channel

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Also they're getting a game on the 17th of May called

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Detective Conan

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Suyoku no Gensu

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
You're yaying that I don't even know what the hell that is

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Give me the top microphone

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
There is this show

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
on Adult Swim a long time ago

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Case closed

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It's just like this little kid who solves

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Detective Conan

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Here it was case closed

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
He just solves

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
crimes and stuff and if you like detective

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
things it's really cool

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I like detective things so it's pretty awesome

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I want that to come out here even though I'm not a fan

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
of anime whatsoever

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
On the Playstation 2

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
you get Shining Wind from Sega

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
on the 17th as well as Odin Sphere

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
coming out over there

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I think that's about it

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Let me see if there's anything on the DS real quick

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
You do get

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Custom Beat Battle

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Draglade is coming out

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Oh and then of course Oh and Dan 2

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I suppose that's important is also coming out this week

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
in Japan

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Elite Beat Agents some of you know that here

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
You pre-ordered that didn't you Shane?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
You pre-ordered it and you got

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
next day shipping or something right?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
My shipping costs about the same as the game

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
because I care that much

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
to have it that early

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I've watched that stupid demo that they put up on

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
YouTube from the download kiosks

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
in Japan a million times

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and I watched the TouchDS

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
.JP videos a million times

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm so excited

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I don't know any of the songs except for one

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
So you spent like $80 on this game?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I would say closer to $90

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Wow

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I do want to say actually

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
one other game because I actually went and looked at the

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
PC and Macintosh releases

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
coming out and Korea

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
you know we don't talk a whole lot about what goes on

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
in Korea but they are getting a game

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
that's worth mentioning here this is my favorite title

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
of the week an adventure game for the PC called

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Princess Maker 5

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Princess Maker 5 coming out

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
in Korea looks like fun

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
in this game you get to it looks like make

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
princesses go figure

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
see there's all their little stats

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
in Korean which I don't understand

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
any of yeah it looks cute

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
looks all like chibi

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
looks like fun I want to play Princess Maker

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
they do make good MMOs

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I can't knock the Korean developers

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
there you go

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
okay dancing games

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
well didn't Korea

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
wasn't the easy to

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
DJ series out of

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Korea? yeah it was all Korea

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
okay well then they fucking rock music games too

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
anyways the US

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
it's not entirely exciting but there are

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
some things coming out

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
of the non-exciting

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
like the third is finally making its way out

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
same day as the movie

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
hurrah

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
but if you're not into really crappy games

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
then you might be interested in Dawn of Mana

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
which is going to be coming out this week on Playstation 2

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
that one looks pretty good

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
that's happy

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
also if you're interested in SNK

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
re-releases Art of Fighting

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Anthology will be making its way out

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
on the PS2 luckily though

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
it's only $14.99

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
so it's a chibi

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
it's a mana game on Playstation 1

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Secret of Mana?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Legend of Mana is one of the most disappointing

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
games I've ever played in my entire fucking life

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
try playing it in Japanese

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
oh that's just salt in the wound

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
right there cause that game

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm sorry it sucked

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
it wasn't, if they would go back

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
okay what you should do

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
get an emulator and play the translation

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
of Seiken Densetsu 3

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
it's fucking beautiful

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
we need to have a game be like that

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
virtual console, hello maybe someday

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
but yeah I'm just saying that cause

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Dawn of Mana, I don't know

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
approach with caution

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
if you haven't bought Marvel Ultimate Alliance yet

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
on the 360

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
and you're thinking about doing it

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
you definitely want to pick up Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
which is coming out this week as well

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
it's basically the same game

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
with the download codes for the extra characters

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
so that's pretty awesome

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Innocent Life

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
a futuristic harvest moon

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
PSP this week

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
don't let that fool you it's exactly the same damn game

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
all over again

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
and let's see here

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Etrion Odyssey

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
some RPG game coming out on

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
the DS and then

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
of course if you're a baseball fan

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
MLB 07 the show on Playstation 3

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and then finally the rounded up

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
really strange game Touch the Dead

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and that's coming out on the DS

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
think House of the Dead on the DS

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I want to touch the dead

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
that sounds kind of kinky

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
and of course

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
last few things here

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I was going to say on PC

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
is there anything interesting coming out

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Resident Evil 4 is coming out on PC I guess

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
or doing a re-release of that

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Nanny Mania

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Nanny Mania?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Nanny Mania

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
is that like Diner Dash but with babies?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't know but

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Nanny Mania

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
you know what that has me thinking of

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
mama mama mama mama mama

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I love that stage

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
it makes me think of Super Nanny

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
on TV or Nanny

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
911 whatever those shows are

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
and then I was going to say

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Naruto Ninja Council 3

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
is also coming out on the DS

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I don't know how many Naruto fans are out there

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
too damn many

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
the Rob D in chat is picking a fight

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
with Loki here why does Loki hate

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
sequels?

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and why is he not hating on MLB

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Super 7 which is a giant rehash itself

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I didn't say I didn't hate it

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I said if you like

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
baseball what was I

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
hating on sequels for I said Shrek the 3rd

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
sucks I mean

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Shrek the 3rd I mean obviously the games gonna suck

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
if it's Shrek the 1st it's still gonna suck

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
no we want more Shrek

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
go karts

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
I wasn't hating on anything

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
when did I hate on a sequel when I was talking there

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
there wasn't any sequels I hated on

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
except for oh Art of Fighting Anthology

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
because that's not a sequel it's just a re-release

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
the Rob D admits I'm mostly stirring up trouble

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
drama

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
well done drama

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
so well we have UK

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
releases like

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
on the 15th we have Freestyle

Street Basketball

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
and then everything else is Sony

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
we have Innocent Life

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
US Navy Seals

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
US Navy Seals Combined Assault

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
and that's it

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
awesome

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
alright well let's get back into

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
some news talking about upcoming

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
releases Rock Band

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
is rumored to be coming out on the Wii

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
lots and lots of rumors going

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
around about this this week

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
apparently it's because

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
there's focus group testing going

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
on they've been testing with focus group

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
MTV's been asking about

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
packaging and pricing like how much would you pay

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
and then the Wii was also

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
one of the systems that they

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
said the game would be coming on of course Rock Band

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
coming from Harmonics who made

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Guitar Hero but this is a joint

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
venture between Harmonics, EA and

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
MTV well of course MTV

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
owns Harmonics so you gotta state that

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
but that's of course going to be the game that has not

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
just the guitar but the drums and the singing

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
all in one so that should be very interesting

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
by the way during this

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
focus group the group was asked

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
what they would think about a bundle including

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
the game, a wireless guitar, a drum kit

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
and a microphone for

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
$200 didn't

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
go over well with the group

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
$175 went over a little

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
better $150 was when everybody

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
in the group got on board but that would be

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
pushing it for all it's stuff

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
it's supposed to be an actual drum set

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
can you imagine how big this box

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
is gonna be?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
where the fuck am I gonna put that in my shit hole apartment?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I mean I'm just

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
what college dorm is

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
gonna fit that?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
it's a cool concept for a game but you know

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
this is why they didn't have any arcade style

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
you know drum mania controllers

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
or anything you know they left it at

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Guitar Freaks

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
said okay those controllers are big enough

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
we don't need to bring the huge fucking drum set

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
do you remember when we were younger

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
like in junior high or whatever

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
they had those drum sticks

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
that you could just hit anywhere in the air

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
they had a little speaker I think they were called

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
like hit sticks or something and you could play the drums

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
and the little crappy speaker that was attached

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
to them would go

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
like you could just wave the drums in the air

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
there was like $10 that could be the controller

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
you remember back in the day when I had the actual

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
cabinet and everything and I was talking

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
about how I was gonna make actual drums

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
you know a drum set for guitar

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
or Guitar Freaks drum mania

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
yeah I'm glad I didn't do that

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
for real Blaze says

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
those still exist I'll be damned

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
DJ Dark Knight says I had one

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I think a lot of us had one

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
those things are pretty rad

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
did you have one of those Mikl Tov I see you nodding your head over there

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
my cousins didn't

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I wasn't allowed to play with them because I was really little

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
but yeah

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
they were really awesome looking at the time

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
and kind of stupid though now that I think about it

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
they were pretty stupid in retrospect

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
but I'm thinking those were cheap

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
and they didn't take up any space at all

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
it's pretty awesome

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I don't know I think this is getting a little crazy

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
with your obsession with music games

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I mean the thing with Guitar

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Hero I mean

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
$80 I almost said Guitar Freaks

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
$80 is a really

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
big investment I think for a game

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
and a $200

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
investment in a game you better hope this game

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
is fucking awesome because otherwise

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
you're gonna be fucking pissed

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
so I mean besides

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
if you wanna buy you know Rock Band

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
boy do we have a game for you the Eye of Judgment

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
it too will have a lot of

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
extra crap and it'll probably be expensive

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
great

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
anyways another game though

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
that's scheduled to be coming or rumored to be coming

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
out on another system would be

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Table Tennis for the Wii Rockstar's Table Tennis

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
that is of course it's gonna be

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
scaled down graphically but hey

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
it's Table Tennis on the Wii

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
because everybody likes Wii Tennis so

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
of course this is gonna do well

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
right

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
how would that work because I seem to remember

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I mean the gameplay mechanics would have to be

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
completely different if I'm not

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
mistaking well maybe not

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
because I seem to remember I haven't played Table Tennis

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
in a while but I seem to remember like you had to

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
look very carefully at the ball

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
to see what color it was glowing

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
cause that was showing you the type of spin that was on

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
the ball and that was very important for

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
how you could respond to that

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
better you know defeat your opponent

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
was to you know counter with the appropriate

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
type of spin how would you do that with the

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Wiimote would you just have to use the 1 and 2 buttons or

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
the D-pad or something I don't know

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
here's what I've been thinking

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
people think because

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
people liked Wii Sports cause it was a

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
packing title and everybody loves the games that came

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
with it and stuff that

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
people would want to buy a game that does

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
exactly the same thing for more money

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
that's why I didn't understand I mean

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Tennis itself yeah it was fun

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
you know bringing it out and people

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
come over and stuff like that I wouldn't buy a

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Tennis game though just because I like playing

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Wii Tennis but like fuck that shit I've got

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
a free game right here why would I buy another game

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm reading chat room and there's some

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
comments on the previous story about Rock Band

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
GS68 wrote in all

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
caps Drummania is a blatant

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
rip off of Rock Band with crappy

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Jap Techno and timing judgments and

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
cheats aka speed mods

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
you know and that's exactly how

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
X-Play will probably review it if the

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
game comes out next year from Konami for whatever

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
crazy reason

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
although they'll say that it came out they'll acknowledge

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
the fact that it came out but they'll say that

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
it's improved on it because this actually

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
teaches you how to play drums

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
to be honest though out of all the Bomani

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
series I think that's the only one that taught you how to do

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
something you know

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
it was pretty much closest to

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Keyboardmania you could actually take

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
the real version in Keyboardmania

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
play them on a real keyboard and it would sound very similar

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
very similar

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
unless you played them easy like I did

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
well then you'd get something that sounded

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
kind of close

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
well I mean still though those games

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
it was pretty good it's like I saw you know for example

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Lankystyle you know I saw him

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
start off on you know that I don't know if he was a drummer

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
beforehand but you know he got

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
pretty good by the end I mean and I've seen people

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
that just start playing Drummania and then you know you see

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
them about a year later they're just

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
busting out like a real drummer so I don't know

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
it does well and I've learned this

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
as a musician that half of playing

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
is you know the more you do it

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
it comes to a point where

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
you're you build the instinct

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
for it your hands will know what to do

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
you know that's what got me through

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
through band is that after a while

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
you train yourself to know how to do these

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
things so you know it's the same thing

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
JVMON has another interesting point in chat

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
ParaparaParadise taught Parapara

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
dancing sorta

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
but I remember when that game first

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
came out and people over here didn't know that it was

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
based off like the Japanese thing like people

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
used to rave on that like remember that one guy who used to do

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
all his like crazy rave dancing

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
that was funny

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm gonna hang my head down now

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
did you do that too?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
yes with your glow sticks

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
no

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
but I remember we'd get everybody

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
shadowing and that was great

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
especially when we ate the sign that said no shadowing

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I wondered if it did that

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
that's right Golfland dared

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
to put a sign on the machine that said no

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
shadowing and we got a picture

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
of somebody eating it Rick ate it

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
we got a guy we said

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
this rule sucks and we

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
dared Rick to eat the sign so he did

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
he tore the sign off the machine and I'm not

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
kidding he fucking ate it

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
good times

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
and then we all shadowed

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
in defiance of Golfland's

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
neo-nazi policies

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
in Rick's defense I mean this is

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
the guy that didn't have like the challenges that they would

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
do where they would like either

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I don't remember if they sniffed a whole bunch of

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
cinnamon or ate a whole bunch of cinnamon

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
some weird shit like that drinking a gallon

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
of milk you know that kind of weird crazy

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
shit so

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
GS68

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
has a great idea for a macro

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
if I could find that picture I know there's a

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
picture that exists with Rick with half

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
a sign in his mouth

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I made you a sign but I eat it

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
cat macro that's beautiful

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
winner GS68

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
chatter of the evening congratulations

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
yeah you win a no prize

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
so I've got some fun news

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
you know one of my favorite games ever

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
is Soul Calibur right and I've told you

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
about Rod Calibur haven't I

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
using the fishing thing when you play it on Dreamcast

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
use the fishing rod to play Soul Calibur it's

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
hilarious I've also tried doing it with the

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Dreamcast dance pads and the only

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
analog on there is the Konami symbol

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
but Rod Calibur

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
is the most fun I always thought Rod Calibur

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
was a different game I played with my Rod

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
you know what Rod let me finish the story

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
okay well now

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
and I think

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
that this is beautiful because

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
in my brain it's an homage to Rod

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Calibur is Soul Calibur

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Legends is coming out on the Wii

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
and

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
it's going to be using the

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Nunchuck and the

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Wiimote so I'm just seeing

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Rod Calibur all over again

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
but you know what's fucking awesome about the game though

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
it's kind of like a beat

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
em up game except hopefully it's not

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
going to be like was that that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Tekken game with

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
what's-her-name Death by the Greaves

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
yeah hope it's not like that

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
maybe it's like the Tekken force mode from

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Tekken 3 so Jamie to sum up

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I will soon be able to play Rod

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Calibur with my Wii yes

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Rod Calibur with your Wii

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
fabulous right and

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
if anybody still has a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
just you should try Rod Calibur if you never

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
have

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
alright well you know

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I just want to mention real quick sure

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
there will be some fishing games coming out in

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
the fall for the Wii that actually have

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
a fishing rod controller therefore

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Rod Calibur

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
for a whole other generation

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
well one person that won't be

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
playing Soul Calibur on the Wii

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
anytime soon or any derivative of the

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
game is this guy who emailed

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Kotaku earlier this week and

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
this was a story here I'm just going to quote this story

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
from a Kotaku article here

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
buying a Wii was a big deal for me

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
seeing those 250 hard-earned dollars

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
and some change go flying from her hand

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
and into the water was painful

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
we would probably be together right now

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
if she had not thrown out my beloved Wii

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
but alas you can't talk a crazy woman

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
out of an idea of such magnitude

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
yes this guy's wife took

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
the Wii and threw it into a lake

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
during a heated argument

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
anyway and he goes on to say anyways

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
divorce is imminent I'm talking

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
to a lawyer tomorrow to get the process

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
started I'm not divorcing her just

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
because of the Wii throwing but that's the rather

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
large straw that broke

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
the Drome Dairy's back

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I would have thrown

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
her right after that

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
throw her in the river

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
go get my Wii

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
what would you do if Nelly threw your Wii into the lake

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I'd be pissed

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
would you file papers

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I'd buy another one

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
buy another one? buy two? just piss her off

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
maybe

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
spend savings

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
there you go

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
GS68 says too bad the woman's going to win 100%

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Craven's Dolphin says I'm with Loki

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
alright well there you have it

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
anyways

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I don't know this

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
sounds pretty cool

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
last game that came out I know like this

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
the Rygar game

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
on Playstation 2 was pretty awesome

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
now they're doing Project Rygar for the Wii

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
and of course it's going to be

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
a brand new game exclusively

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
for the Wii and

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
no real details about that

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
except it's supposed to have

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
new characters, new enemies, new weapons, yada yada yada

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
but

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
one of the announcements from

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Tecmo's party

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
that they did because everyone was having their

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
gamer's day or Tecmo's

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
night out 07

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I don't know they have a pretty cool piece of

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
artwork that's the only bit of info

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
from the game so far

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
looks pretty guilty gear-ish actually

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
interesting

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
you know I never played the

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Rygar game on Playstation 2 I somehow missed it

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
but I did enjoy the old NES one

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
that's like one of my favorite 8-bit games ever

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
even if it was really different from the arcade

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
well know what?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
then probably when this game gets closer to coming out

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Virtual Console

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
yeah that's pretty exciting

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
if I remember right the 8-bit one had no save feature

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
or password or anything

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
so you had to play it all in one sitting which sucked

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
but now with the Virtual Console

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
not a problem anymore

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
very exciting I hope that does come out

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
pretty cool

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
well speaking of Virtual Console

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I do have the list for our UK listeners

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
that is released so far

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Ninja Spirit

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
which was a TurboGrafx game

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and also

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
NES Open Tournament Golf

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I think that's it

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
wow sucks to be in the UK

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
because neither of those games really are that good to me

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Ninja Spirit was a good game

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I vaguely remember it

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I think I played it once

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Golf was more like crap

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
didn't it come out kind of in response to

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Ninja Gaiden

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
which did really well on the NES

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
that's how a lot of TurboGrafx games were

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
where's Shadow Dancer?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
it could have been Shadow Dancer because Shadow Dancer had the dog

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I know but where's Shadow Dancer?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I know!

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
or Moonwalker I mean come on

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
it's so bad I mean it's such a bad movie

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
well it was a bad movie and a bad game

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
but the bar scene

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
the bar level in Moonwalker was pretty fun

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
because you do the leaning thing in advance

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and all that was cool

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
D.Vay has a Mother's Day message in chat here

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
my mom rocked at Ninja Spirit

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
for some reason

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
don't know why I bought it

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
my mom never really played video games at all

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I couldn't get her to play anything

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
so I don't know that whole experience

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
of walking in and your mom or your dad

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
is playing a video game of yours

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Mom what are you doing?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
oh I'm just beating the level 3 boss

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
anyhow

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
now one game that came out on the Virtual Console

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
not that long ago that was pretty exciting

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
was Tecmo Bowl

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
even if they did make some changes to it

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
to remove players names and stuff

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
but people were excited to see Tecmo Bowl make a return

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
and hey

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
that return might be forthcoming

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
like even bigger

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
because Tecmo has announced

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
that they have plans to revive

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
the Tecmo Bowl franchise

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
in 2008

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Tecmo will be joining up with Visual Concepts

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
to make a new version of Tecmo Bowl

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
now note there is no NFL licenses

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
going on here but who cares

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Tecmo Bowl was just fun

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
and actually I don't talk a lot about

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
sports games on the program because I don't get into

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
a whole lot of them but

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Tecmo Bowl was one of the few sports games

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I really really got into on the NES

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
because back then sports games were so simple

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
that you didn't really have to be

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
a professor of the sport to do well

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
at them

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
so I'm pretty excited that Tecmo Bowl

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
is re-coming out

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
except the weird thing about it is that they're not saying

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
what system it's coming out on

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
they're just saying

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I can't tell you what platform we're making it for

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but I can tell you

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that it's probably not going to be on the platform

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
that you're expecting if that makes any sense

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and I actually have no idea

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
what that means

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
does that mean Xbox Live Arcade?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I actually have a cell phone, Tecmo Bowl

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I actually downloaded Tecmo Bowl to my cell phone

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
about a year ago and was very disappointed

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
actually they're not working with Visual Concepts

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
it's a little play on there

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
they're saying they

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
join Visual Concepts because Visual Concepts

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
is doing that All Pro 2K8 or whatever

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
basically they're comparing them because they don't

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
have the NFL license as well

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
so it looks like Tecmo is

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
going to be developing it by themselves

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
or at least with an unnamed developer

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I'm going to guess that it's the N-Gage

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
that they're working on

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
because they are doing that whole

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
N-Gage 3 relaunch thing

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
or whatever so

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
that's the system I least expect it on

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
How about the

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Atari 2600? That's the system

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I would least expect it on

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
What about Virtual Console?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Nope, we already have Tecmo Bowl

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
on Virtual Console, kinda

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yeah, a new one though, you wouldn't expect that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Oh that'd be cool, but you know the weird thing is

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
it had this Tecmo Collection

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
or something like that, it was called

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I don't remember, like a Tecmo Collection

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
that came out on Xbox and it had the old

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
arcade version of Tecmo Bowl on it

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
not nearly as fun as the NES one

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and I realize a lot of people kinda only

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
know that as the Tecmo Bowl, but it was kinda

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
clunky to me

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
it didn't have that fast pacedness that the

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
NES one had, so there you go

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Anyways

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
some interesting

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
stuff, another thing that was announced over

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
in

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
during the Square Enix

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
little Final Fantasy party there was that

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
they're gonna be bringing Chocobo Dungeon

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
to

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
actually to the Wii

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
exclusively, which is kinda neat

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
so that'll be kinda cool I guess

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
with, aren't they having the new

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I wanna say they had Dragon Quest

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Swords as well coming out

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
lots of stuff

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
for the Wii, lots of Wii love

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
good

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I don't remember if any news about this

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
made our show roll, but isn't there information

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
as well about Crystal Chronicles that came out

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
of the event?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I know that they're in the DS

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
version, I think they may have

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
announced a date for that

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Wasn't the Wii one supposed to be a launch title?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Maybe, maybe in Japan

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
but I know that

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I distinctly remember seeing some type of

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Crystal Chronicles stuff in

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
like, some of the early press things

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
for the Wii, like it was an early launch title

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
They announced, what was it, the DS version is gonna

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
be coming to Japan on August 23rd

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
that was the announcement that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I believe was there, I don't know about the Wii

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
version at all, I don't think there was anything

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
announced there

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Alright

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
well, I don't know, are you excited about

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Nope, don't care, I couldn't give a crap when the DS

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
version came out, especially

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
didn't give a crap for the Japanese one

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
but uh

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I don't know

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Miklotov, have you ever played the Chocobo Dungeon games?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Are you excited about this new

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Wii one at all?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
No, but I'm excited about Crystal Chronicles

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I'm very excited, because me and my friends

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
played the GameCube one a whole bunch

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
we never beat it, but we had a really good time

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
with it, because we had all the Game Boy

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
advances linked up, and it was just a really good

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
time, and I expect that the DS one will be

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
probably a little more fun

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
RossdielUT

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
says in chat, will Crystal Chronicles

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
require 4 DS's for multiplayer?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Of course

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I hope not

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
You're going to have people share the DS

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
when they're playing, if it's just

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
the DS version, everybody's going to

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
need a copy and a DS to play

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Is that maybe one reason that they've kind of

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
held off on putting this out on the Wii?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Is because there

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
hasn't really been a game that has the DS connectivity

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
yet, so they're waiting?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Probably, but I would really like them

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
to do a Wii one already, and the

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
DS one. Bring it square

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Enix. So even though the

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
story was about Chocobo Dungeon, we couldn't help

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
throwing a little bit of Crystal Chronicles in there

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Because we talked about a good game instead

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Well there you have it

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
We have potential for something to be relatively

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
good

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
They are doing, actually

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
a Final Fantasy sort of

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
fighting game

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Ergize 2?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Final Fantasy

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Cecidia

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And it's looking like it's going to be

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
more like a

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
a big

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
it sort of looks like it's more of a big

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I'm sorry, the only thing I can really

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
think of looking at this is like

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
a sort of like

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
level of Power Stone, I think

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
you know, with the big levels and all that

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
just with versus

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
you know, versus each other's characters, but it looks like we've got

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
some Final Fantasy

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
9, some

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
7, 8

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and I think 12

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
thrown in, yeah

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Is this just

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
an excuse to give the fangirls

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
their Cloud X, Tidus

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
stories?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
No, because Steffi is my bishie

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Yeah

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Wow, you're lame

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Just kidding, hearts

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I was a squall fangirl

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Well now, if this ends up

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
being what the game is all about, you could have all

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
of those guys battling it out

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I know, it's great

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Alright, anyhow

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Shadows Fits Lair in chat says

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Super Smash Brothers Final Fantasy edition

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Maybe, maybe

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Alright, well one thing I should mention

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
is that Star Ocean 1

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
and 2 are being made

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
for the PSP

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Of course, you know, it seems like Square's kind of getting

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
big on the remakes for PSP lately because

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
you know, of course Final Fantasy

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
that's there and then of course they did the

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
redone version of Tactics or whatever

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So Square's been showing the PSP

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
a lot of love lately and they are continuing

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Star Ocean 1 and 2

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You may remember these games were originally on the Super Nintendo

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
and the Playstation 1, but now they are going to be coming

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
to the PSP. By the way

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
if you would like a new Star Ocean game

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Star Ocean 4 is

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
confirmed to be under development and

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
will be coming out soon

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
but they haven't exactly said which

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
platform it's going to be coming out

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
to yet, I believe

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well, people

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
are assuming it's PS3 and Xbox 360

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and most people are assuming it has to be

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Playstation 3 because all the other games were

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
on the Sony platforms, but

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
you know, anything's possible, especially with

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Square. They've jumped ship before

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
to other systems. I mean, hello, Dragon Quest

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
going to DS. Who would have thought

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
that was going to happen? Well, there you go

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Well, I was thinking

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It says

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
it was officially announced for next gen

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
consoles, so

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Well, technically, I don't know

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Again,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
though, you can assume

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
it's the Playstation, but then they'll make a surprise

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
jump to Wii, you never know

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
There you go

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Anyways

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So, of more

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I hate to sound like a broken record, but

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
more rumors

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
regarding the PSP getting a redesign

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
One, I had to laugh

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
at when I saw this story. There's a rumor

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that the PSPs are going to be

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
now being shipped

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
with

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
with firmwares

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
with downloadable

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
prevention

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Right

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Like all the other ones

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
had it so you can download

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm sorry, I don't think they're going to have it

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
where you can enable it not

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
to be able to be downgraded

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But they're going to try, apparently

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
That's the rumor

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
So wait, what exactly are they blocking? You can't

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
download anything? What? No, they're downgradable

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
They're going to make it so you can't downgrade the

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
firmware. I don't see how that's going to happen

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Well, don't they say that every other time

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
they release a patch? Yes

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So, anyways

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
They're basically, that's the rumor

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's supposed to be happening

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They said all new PSPs

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
shipping out as of next Friday

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
which is May 18th

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
will be a higher firmware

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
4 point something

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It says they promised

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
to include, and this is coming from

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
a

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
EB Games regional manager

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
in Canada

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So I don't know how much you can believe that

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But anyways

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
What are you trying to say about Canada?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I'm trying to say something about EB

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
But basically, here's what they're saying

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Sony was sending out emails to its commercial

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
retailers that all new PSPs

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
will be

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
sent out with

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
downgradable

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
prevention built right into them

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
All new PSPs will be shipped out

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
as of next week, Friday, May 18th

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
will be a higher firmware

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
4.XX

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Specifics not released, it says

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
But they were promised to include new security features

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
to prevent hacks and downgrades

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Apparently this will be

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
one of the first steps to start focusing

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
on the PSP again instead of diverting

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
all the attention to the PS3

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I'll believe it when I see it

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Isn't this just a challenge to hackers?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yes, it is

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's not going to happen

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
At this point, no

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It's not when they said

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Blu-ray and HD DVD is uncrackable

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and then the code is all over the front page of DIG

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Let's just say

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
for example, if they do release this

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
firmware, whatever, that's for new

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
PSPs. There's a lot of them out there

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
right now that do not have that

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So, big deal

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
That's about the equivalent of them

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
changing the $5 bill to a new

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
version that can't be counterfeited

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but the old ones are still in circulation

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and still being used, so

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
It's kind of dumb

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Anywho, the other

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
of course, rumor that we've talked about before

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
is saying that a new PSP

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
redesign is going to become

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and it'll be smaller

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and a lighter weight version of

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
the handheld device

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
No release date

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
No price point

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
and no other info on that

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It's a big, fat rumor

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
but I think people are thinking that it's going to happen

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
since, I don't know

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
that they haven't muggied with it yet

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and that they can't do that with all their console systems

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Alright

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Well, we're going to get to a segment here

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
we like to do every week on the program

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That is DarkSakura's website of the week

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
because DarkSakura likes to surf the internet

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
all back and forth

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
and around and through and find a website

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
that she wants to share with you

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
DarkSakura, where should the kids

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
be pointing their web browsers this week?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
The website of the week is

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
MyCatHatesYou.com

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and this is

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
a

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
big, massive collection

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
of pissed off cats

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
It's beautiful

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's just lovely

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That's all it is, is pictures of angry cats

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Pretty much

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Our cat is doing naughty bad things

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
There's this one cat

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The first thing is this cat

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
with a leather jacket on it

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and a big cat looking all bad ass

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It's also one of those bald cats

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Interesting

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
There's also one of the black and white cats

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
by a thing that's already used

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
MyCatHatesYou.com

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Your cat doesn't really hate me

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
though, right DarkSakura?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
My cat doesn't hate anybody, she just looks offended

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Alright, here you go

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Alright, well one more

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
story for you for this segment

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
this part of Orange Lounge Radio

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
and that's about some homebrew

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
that's being made for the DS

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
This is

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I don't know exactly how to

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
describe this game

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I kind of look at it like a

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
puzzle type game, but the game is called

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Virus DX

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It's a puzzle game

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
but this puzzle game has hot anime

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
nurses with it

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and I'm assuming they must get

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
naked if you do good

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
because this is being called

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Triple X homebrew

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
available on the Nintendo DS

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
That's not all, they have strip rock

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
paper scissors, tickle girl and

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
teenage queen NDS

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yes, lots of fun stuff there

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I like tickle girl, what's tickle girl about?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I'm thinking about buying stuff too

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Wow, you actually see a picture

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
of a girl on the bottom screen there

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and if you tickle her

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
with your stylus you can see her reaction

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
on the top screen and it will

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
utilize full motion video sampled

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
audio and looping background music

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
and

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
they're saying if you liked Feel

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
the Magic, you'll love this

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Wow

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I want to see strip rock

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
paper scissors

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
like when you're trying to convince

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
someone to play strip poker with you

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
and they're like, but I don't know how to

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
play poker, so you say, okay

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
let's play strip high card

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
All it is is it's basically a rock

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
paper scissor and then they have

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
porn pictures that they've taken off

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
a website that's in a series or something

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Why bother with the game, seriously?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Why not just have

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
DS porno?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Why bother?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I guess that's true too

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But this is homebrew

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
this you can get for free, right?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Whereas the browser costs like 50 bucks

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Actually, Teenage Queen

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
NDS is actually

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
pretty, it's all hand drawn

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
animation, that's kind of neat

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It's a poker game, it looks like

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah, but that's

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
probably about as good as strip poker was

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
on the Commodore 64

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's all about Custer's Revenge

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Dude, it's all

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
about, you know, fucking

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
putting some more adult

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
games, what the fuck is that one game

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that needs to play all the time?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Gals panic! They need to put gals panic on there

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, I thought the guy game

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Where they would have the contest

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
between the women, like the video sequences

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
that you'd unlock

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
They have that now in Girls Gone Wild

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It's kind of retarded

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Alright, well anyway

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
that's going to do it here for part A

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
