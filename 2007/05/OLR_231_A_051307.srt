00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 13th, 2007, could the Xbox Live Marketplace be set to compete with iTunes?

2
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:26,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy release of Spore faces yet another delay, and a PlayStation series is revived on cell phones?

3
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:48,994
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, but you might know her as Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I love salad.

7
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard your TV show is getting picked up by NBC after all, The Bionic Woman, the remake.

8
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

9
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:57,139
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

10
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're making a remake of Bionic Woman.

11
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:00,802
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so fucking cool!

12
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think of your name and everything.

13
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, your name, quote unquote.

14
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:13,065
[SPEAKER_02]: To recap for new people, my mom was going to name me Erica.

15
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little girl next door said, No, you should name her after the Bionic Woman.

16
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:18,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Name her Jamie.

17
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So my mom named me Jamie, only she spelled it right.

18
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:25,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I took Summer as my last name for my stage name.

19
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:26,148
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

20
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I am named after my mom showed her very small nerd roots.

21
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Optimus Prime with Prostate Cancer Thing

22
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:19,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

23
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Bionic Man 6 Million Dollar Man

24
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, then that's lame.

25
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even give a shit about the Bionic Woman.

26
00:02:56,268 --> 00:03:00,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless she has a claw that comes out of her hand and she can swing on things and fight Hitler.

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Bionic Commando.

28
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:10,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I was reading in one of those websites that in this new Bionic Woman, she's a $50 million woman.

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,913
[SPEAKER_04]: They have $50 million worth of parts in her.

30
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:12,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

31
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:14,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Inflation, you know, is a bitch.

32
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,615
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll buy a nice pair of tits, though.

33
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It better for $50 million.

34
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Rebecca Romaine Blair.

35
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,953
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's some British unknown.

36
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:28,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that isn't known here, but has been in some British shows.

37
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:29,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Softie.

38
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone who looks like Jane Fonda in the 60s.

39
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:32,801
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pictures.

40
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Dig and look at the entertainment section.

41
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:36,124
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see pictures of the new Bionicle.

42
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm doing a show right now.

43
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that ever stopped you before.

44
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,870
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

45
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also say hello.

46
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to video games soon, I promise.

47
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: We have nerd stuff to get to first.

48
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to a frequent guest of ours, but he hasn't been here in a while.

49
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:51,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Miklatov.

50
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:51,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

51
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And where have you been, young man?

52
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:55,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

53
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have I been?

54
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,511
[SPEAKER_05]: The island of Pokemon.

55
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've been catching Pokemons.

56
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:00,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tired.

57
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:01,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I just woke up.

58
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:02,252
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

59
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,233
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

60
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,373
[SPEAKER_04]: But I noticed you're playing DS.

61
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,373
[SPEAKER_04]: You're playing Pokemon now.

62
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:05,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

63
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Still.

64
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:06,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Still.

65
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you started Pokemon and then you restarted your game.

66
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you quit and restart your game completely?

67
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I felt like I was doing too much trading and not enough playing.

68
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:21,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just not happy with my Pokemon, so I restarted.

69
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started with Chimchar, who I've named Ho-Monkey.

70
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Homo-Monkey?

71
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Homo-Monkey, yes.

72
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a Pokemon name.

73
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

74
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:37,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane Miklatov and I like to have naming contests for our Pokemon, like who can have the better names.

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine wins hands down.

76
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's going to top that.

77
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, nothing ever.

78
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Porchmonkey would not fit because he's not black.

79
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked, you named one of them Fancy Pants.

80
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Fancy Pants.

81
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it looked like it was wearing a big fur coat.

82
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it evolved into like this cyber grasshopper looking thing.

83
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ridiculous.

84
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:58,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't use it anymore.

85
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like muffins.

86
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, creative when I got that ponytail.

87
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fire horse, so I named it Hor-fires.

88
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just put fire in the middle of horse.

89
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:32,996
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

90
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,416
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very creative.

91
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It is creative.

92
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:35,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

93
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:36,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy it.

94
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:36,617
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

95
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I caught a magic carp and named it useless.

96
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I named it fish sticks.

97
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,720
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

99
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, we're nerds.

100
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we have some nerds here in chat.

101
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we record.

102
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,380
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

103
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:02,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Mother's Day if we have any moms that listen to our program.

104
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we are up against the finale of Survivor.

105
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:11,416
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, somebody actually had the balls to come into chat and say, Oh, sorry, I can't listen to you guys tonight.

106
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Survivor's on.

107
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:12,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye.

108
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:14,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

109
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:19,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, A, this season of Survivor was spoiled a long time ago if you read the forums.

110
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:22,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you who wins, but I'm going to be nice to the listeners who T-vote it.

111
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,445
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360 Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360

113
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,022
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have more controllers.

114
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason.

115
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:27,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Party.

116
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Party game.

117
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Can four folks play simultaneously on that one?

118
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:31,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

119
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

120
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still yet to play it.

121
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've already laid claim.

122
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:38,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

123
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:42,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what pinball tables have been dominating your time lately?

124
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:43,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Twilight Zone.

125
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's a bitch.

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,882
[SPEAKER_04]: But you haven't really been playing the pinball game on 360?

127
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,104
[SPEAKER_04]: The new downloadable one?

128
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

129
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan can play it.

130
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:50,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

131
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks sucky to me.

132
00:07:52,716 --> 00:08:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point of pinball to me, the last good virtual pinball besides for Alien Crush and Devil's Crush was like Revenge of the Gator on Game Boy back in the day.

133
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:03,826
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

134
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sonic Spinball, of course, but that's not quite the same.

135
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But Devil's Crush and Alien Crush are the pinnacle of video pinball.

136
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else is just a pale imitation.

137
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:25,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that for me it's having the flippers and the noises and the ball and having my machine go powerball and getting that ceramic ball that the magnets can't do crap to.

138
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:26,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Twilight Zone.

139
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:28,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've also been playing Rocky and Bullwinkle.

140
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the pinball effects, but I think I was getting into this last week.

141
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is a replacement for the real thing, sadly.

142
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:37,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing at all.

143
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel the machine move.

144
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even Revenge of the Gator, sadly.

145
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:43,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even Revenge of the Gator.

146
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:44,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

147
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.

148
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally got the damn systems to land with each other.

149
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:56,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the problem was Crackdown because Crackdown's a little bitch and doesn't want to land with other systems unless you do it its way.

150
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:01,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, so I've been playing a little bit of Call of Duty 3 and that was fun.

151
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We landed together and had a little multiplayer game.

152
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:10,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once the Crackdown update came out with the new download content,

153
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:12,618
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,195
[SPEAKER_03]: A debug mode for the game.

155
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You can adjust the agility of your character.

156
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:37,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give yourself super agility to jump even higher or run super fast and then super strength.

157
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus you can spawn vehicles, spawn explosive barrels, have all weapons, unlimited ammo, god mode, that kind of stuff.

158
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:47,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, none of that stuff counts if you're playing the actual game.

159
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:51,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just a little fun little mode to play with and you can do that in co-op.

160
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:55,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, there's also new weapons and new vehicles with the paid one.

161
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, you know, fuck.

162
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:27,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow we've got, or I should say Monday for those people listening on the podcast, the Halo 3, no I'm sorry, not Monday, Wednesday, the Halo 3 beta is going to be coming out.

163
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of people on my friends list are already playing it.

164
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just not special, nobody cares.

165
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:41,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they had those preview events in Frisco, New York, and they were giving out those codes to basically everybody that went to the event.

166
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:43,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a bunch of people on live already playing it.

167
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:43,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

168
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,720
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't care.

169
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm like, eh, it's a beta.

170
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the real game.

171
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:52,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, you know, the beta's going to have issues, especially with everybody hitting it at once.

172
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:57,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are getting a little too excited about the Halo 3 beta, if that makes sense.

173
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not the real game.

174
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:02,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think Microsoft's pretty ballsy to be doing this, to be honest.

175
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Super Paper Mario some more, about halfway through the game now, and it's still very easy.

176
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:09,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

177
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had, like, no trouble getting through the game at all.

178
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if it's just...

179
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, some comments from chatroom.

180
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:16,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Toshin asked about Pokemon Pinball.

181
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play that one?

182
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:18,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely.

183
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one.

184
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

185
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,956
[SPEAKER_04]: There was two of them if I remember right.

186
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,377
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one for the old games and one for the advanced games.

187
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,077
[SPEAKER_04]: They did like two.

188
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:51,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic Pinball.

189
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,319
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PC, yeah, Epic Pinball was pretty awesome.

190
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another pinball simulator.

191
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name of it.

192
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it up on a previous episode.

193
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:01,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody named it.

194
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,881
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were some good PC pinball games too.

195
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:05,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic Pinball, of course, being one.

196
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:14,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Also looking at chat room, RawSteelUT says Halo 3 Beta, the only reason people bought Crackdown.

197
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be true, but they got a pretty decent game with it.

198
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking awesome game.

199
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:19,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Crackdown.

200
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not usually my type of game, but I like it quite a bit.

201
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have bought it even if it didn't have Halo 3 Beta in there.

202
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,691
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I don't even know.

203
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I may download it and might play it once.

204
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:32,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm going to play it much more than that because I'm not really a huge Halo fan.

205
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:40,329
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as first person shooters go, it doesn't seem like that big of a difference in Halo 2.

206
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, eh, whatever.

207
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get fucking murdered by everybody on there anyway because I suck at Halo really bad.

208
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know if there's any really, really bad Halo players that are excited about the Halo 3 beta.

209
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, me.

210
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:56,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we need to form a clan and just play with each other and suck together at Halo 3.

211
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:57,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty awful.

212
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:59,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only played Halo 2 like four times.

213
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play if you load me up on Mechlozine.

214
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the beta?

215
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:05,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have Crackdown or anything?

216
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:05,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you get the beta?

217
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:06,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Crackdown.

218
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then you can get into the beta.

219
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll play an OLR We Suck night or something.

220
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But we only have a few weeks to do it, I think.

221
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

222
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:20,760
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I was at Best Buy the other day, randomly, and they still had Crackdown with the Halo 3 beta in it.

223
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can still find copies of it.

224
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So get them soon if you want to get in.

225
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this has nothing to do with Halo, but I did have an announcement.

226
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

227
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably in the next four months, I'm going to be a published illustrator.

228
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:35,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how so?

229
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing flashcards of bones and muscles of what everything works out.

230
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:41,803
Huh.

231
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: For massage therapists.

232
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:44,263
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

233
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you going to autograph them at different places for our listeners?

234
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,985
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I'm going to take deep tissue massage.

235
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

236
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:52,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck with that.

237
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:54,737
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week.

238
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

239
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:58,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really played video games this week.

240
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,100
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bad for you.

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to avoid video games.

242
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:05,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I don't eat at Wendy's anymore because they support the evil company that is Nintendo.

243
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:08,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, this lawyer guy told me that was bad.

244
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: No, kidding, of course.

245
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,030
[SPEAKER_04]: All things considered, I actually had a pretty bad week, personally, this week.

246
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But Miklatov cheered me up, which was really cool, because he bought me this.

247
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII Play Arts Final Fantasy XII Play Arts Final Fantasy XII Play Arts

248
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:49,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, Final Fantasy XII was one of those games I started and just didn't finish because all the console launches were going on at that time.

249
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I really need to go back now that... I never even started it.

250
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play it.

251
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such an incredible game.

252
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:55,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to finish it.

253
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And the characters are so awesome, so there you go.

254
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:00,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

255
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I played World of Warcraft.

256
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to level 51 because I don't have a life.

257
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played some Xbox Live.

258
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan, Catan, Catan

259
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:47,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I do like about the game, what it does have going for it, is because the game is a little more complicated, you have to really kind of learn it and think.

260
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:49,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a much more thinking type game.

261
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,132
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that are playing it are pretty intelligent.

262
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:57,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do play it online, you don't get a lot of the... type people.

263
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:01,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they say... in their headsets on Xbox Live.

264
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:04,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of, I guess, something the game has going for it.

265
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I've been playing a little more Pinball FX and...

266
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Centipede and Millipede for no good reason other than I just really like retro games.

267
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing Centipede and Millipede.

268
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Double Dragon.

269
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Double Dragon.

270
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:25,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not that bad, but the problem is that I really remember the Nintendo one much more, and there's big differences between the Nintendo one

271
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:55,801
[SPEAKER_04]: and the arcade one and namely that the arcade one was a lot harder and some of them like the moves aren't quite the same that they were in the Nintendo one like with the Nintendo one you gain these stars as your points went up and that allowed you to do more moves like jump kick and punch people when they're on the ground and stuff and it doesn't really work the same in the arcade version but I thought it's the first port I've seen of an old arcade classic that wasn't done by that what is it Digital Eclipse is that who they are it was done by somebody else

272
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of refreshing to see that there's other companies capable of porting over the old games.

273
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they did a pretty decent job.

274
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,104
[SPEAKER_04]: The high def graphics are really cleaned up.

275
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks nice for an arcade game that's 20 years old.

276
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:09,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, $5.

277
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:11,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

278
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

279
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my gaming week.

280
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, how about your gaming week?

281
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:20,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I played WoW a couple times.

282
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm level 56, so I have less of a life.

283
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:31,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I also had this sudden interest to start playing Bust a Move 2 again, because I love that game.

284
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:41,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been playing it non-stop, and there's not anything new I can do in it, because I've already unlocked everybody, beaten it with every character, always get the upper path.

285
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, it's just a little fun game to play, I guess.

286
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been slacking on Pokemon.

287
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:48,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

288
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:53,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, I don't think there are any video games I play.

289
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:56,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, keep your cell phone off.

290
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:57,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my cell phone went off.

291
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: People forget I do this thing on Sunday night and try to call me.

292
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:10,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I don't know, I guess, kind of gaming related, I think I'm leaving Konami by the 4th of June.

293
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

294
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:13,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So hooray for me.

295
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you'll finally be able to talk openly about what you do during the day.

296
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be nice.

297
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can talk about it right now.

298
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Bust a Move 2 all day.

299
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,932
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much what I do.

300
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:26,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

301
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:28,173
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, there you go.

302
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,354
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no other games you've been working on by chance?

303
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I play Dance Summit.

304
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:35,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of switch it out between the two.

305
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring that over because I miss that game.

306
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll bring it next time.

307
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:39,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at work right now.

308
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:41,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played that in forever.

309
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to find a copy of it to buy.

310
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck with that.

311
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I found one on eBay for $40.

312
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:48,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's really cheap.

313
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely worth it.

314
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking actually right now to find a copy of Bust a Groove 1 US.

315
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:55,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to borrow mine?

316
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:56,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one to own.

317
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:57,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really need it.

318
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:59,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably sell you mine because I have the Japanese ones.

319
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

320
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sell it to my hubby.

321
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:09,275
[SPEAKER_04]: While you guys barter and trade over there, JVmon says in chat, if Bus to Move 2 was on the PlayStation 3 network, that would sell me a PS3.

322
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It would sell me one, too.

323
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:11,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know what?

324
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: If Squeenix decided to ever revisit that series, I don't care if they put a Final Fantasy character in it to ruin the game.

325
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I would still buy another one.

326
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep forgetting it was an Enix game.

327
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:21,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

328
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Square ruined them.

329
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt asks, what, no sweet codon for you, Miklatov?

330
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:57,734
[SPEAKER_05]: To play?

331
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:58,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

332
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no, because I guess, you know, I still care about the series, but after working on it, it's like, I kind of know everything that happens in the last game, and I never even finished playing it, so it's like, there's nothing to surprise me.

333
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it kind of one of those things where, like, you know,

334
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:25,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you're really excited for many years to work at, I don't know, let's say a... Taco Bell.

335
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,924
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nobody's excited to work at Taco Bell.

336
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:29,704
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's wrong with you?

337
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:35,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say people are excited to work at Great America, a theme park, let's say.

338
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,105
[SPEAKER_04]: People are really excited, they want to work at a theme park.

339
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:43,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they get there and realize how everything really works, now the rides all function and how the magic happens, everything kind of loses its magic.

340
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it kind of like that, where now that you've been on the inside, it's just not as fun anymore?

341
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All Games.com to relay the following announcement.

342
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:18,985
[SPEAKER_04]: which is cool because All Games is very supportive of us and replaying our show on Monday nights as well as Tuesday mornings over on AllGames.com.

343
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:22,309
[SPEAKER_04]: If you missed the live show on Sunday, you can always hear part A and B together on All Games.

344
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:28,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of their other shows, the video game show, they had a little bit of drama a couple weeks ago.

345
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:38,903
[SPEAKER_04]: To make a long story short, a lot of folks think that the show is gone because of something that someone on the show did to the website and everything.

346
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,924
[SPEAKER_04]: He's since apologized for it.

347
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:44,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the apology and I was basically like, I suck and I'm sorry.

348
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people still think the show is gone.

349
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:50,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So all games is asking us to kind of put forward and, you know, the video game show.

350
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:51,852
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not gone.

351
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They are still around, and they are now at www.videogameshow.net.

352
00:21:56,796 --> 00:22:02,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know those of you guys that listen to Orange Launch Radio probably listen to other independent video game podcasts, and we encourage you to do so.

353
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a fan of Chris Haas and Rich Bergen, they are now over at videogameshow.net.

354
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:08,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

355
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Their show has moved over there.

356
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in housekeeping tonight, I wanted to mention real quick, of course, our Fonamay appearance.

357
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,730
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be happening over Memorial Day weekend in San Jose, Saturday at 2 p.m.

358
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to see you guys there.

359
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really excited.

360
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:25,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of anime conventions, we're going to talk about ACEN a little later tonight.

361
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:26,755
[SPEAKER_04]: ACEN.

362
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:29,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just say ACEN and the same thing?

363
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:30,598
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I don't want to say ACEN?

364
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Then no one will know what you're talking about.

365
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:32,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerks.

366
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:37,492
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, regardless, Chris called us, and we're going to hear her message a little bit later.

367
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:43,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we want to give a big thank you to folks who've reviewed us recently in iTunes with five-star reviews.

368
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:47,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at some of the more recent reviewers, and there are some awesome reviews.

369
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:54,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks actually using some of the gags from our previous weeks, like somebody left a review that says, OLR, the L stands for suck.

370
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:55,743
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty awesome.

371
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:59,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just really want to thank you guys, because we know probably every podcast you listen to

372
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Go vote for us here.

373
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave us a review on iTunes.

374
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:10,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, really, really does help because when you get more reviews, it gets you that exposure.

375
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: When we first started the video game podcasting thing a couple years ago, there was maybe 10 shows at the most.

376
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:20,725
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't much to pick from, so that's how a lot of folks found us.

377
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But now there's 10,000 video game podcasts out there because every freaking...

378
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

379
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:56,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's been a lot of news this week, because everyone seems to think it's like E3 all over again, because I mean, hey, about a year from now, or a year ago, we were pretty much at E3.

380
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking of that.

381
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:06,328
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Bobby Blackwolf, speaking of all games, Bobby Blackwolf had his birthday, I think it was yesterday, and that reminds me, happy birthday Bobby, by the way.

382
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:10,925
[SPEAKER_04]: and that reminded me that he had his birthday at E3 last year.

383
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was making me go, shit, it's been one year since E3.

384
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:17,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was kind of sad because E3 sucks now.

385
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:25,892
[SPEAKER_04]: The E3 rave, as we've been calling it, because they're going to take you to an abandoned airport hangar and unmarked vehicles will come pick you up and escort you there.

386
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry though, G4 will be there as their commercials say.

387
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopee.

388
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:31,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

389
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: One more reason I don't want to go to E3.

390
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do because, you know, all the cool kids go.

391
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:47,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, except for G4 because, you know, they just... Well, Jamie, as I understand, our very own Jamie has an invite and is basically saying, you know what, I'm not going.

392
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too cool for this.

393
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say I wasn't going.

394
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said I can't afford to go.

395
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

396
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, like, the heavens open up and, you know, God gives me money.

397
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

398
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

399
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:02,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get time off work, too.

400
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:03,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're just too cool for E3.

401
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:04,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

402
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:06,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, sorry, news.

403
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty sexy from what I've seen so far.

404
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely redone, all 3D.

405
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:36,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

406
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:38,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I feel about this.

407
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy IV is my favorite Final Fantasy game.

408
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:45,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly because it was the first one I ever really got into and beat.

409
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:52,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's kind of weird to watch that get changed into this whole new, like, 3D thing.

410
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks good.

411
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

412
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a try and I'll probably love it.

413
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:58,922
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's still, it's like somebody's messing with your baby.

414
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:04,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it just doesn't turn out as bad as Final Fantasy 3 did for the DS because that was no fun.

415
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:04,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't like it?

416
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:05,151
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

417
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:07,153
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you like the original Nintendo one?

418
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:07,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever play it?

419
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Like translation or anything?

420
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:10,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

421
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:11,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so a little bit.

422
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:12,417
[SPEAKER_05]: The third one was great.

423
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the original.

424
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of slow.

425
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun with it.

426
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:23,765
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not slow in the story sense, even though it is, but everything just seems really slow in that game.

427
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:25,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

428
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that fun to me.

429
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's your opinion.

430
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it looks good.

431
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:34,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think they need to be doing more of this on the PSP.

432
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:37,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure, because it's kind of lacking.

433
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, keep it up.

434
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:43,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see Final Fantasy VI redone as well.

435
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at chat for comments here.

436
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:46,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Jvmon agrees with you, Mikotov.

437
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy III for the DS was boring as hell.

438
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Drudami says, though, Final Fantasy III DS was good...

439
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:55,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel, UT, says Final Fantasy IV DS was uber milkage.

440
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

441
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, I really want them to remake V. Sephiroth1215 says, IV?

442
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,414
[SPEAKER_04]: What was so great about IV?

443
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: V and VI are so much better.

444
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't explain the allure of IV.

445
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Sephiroth1215...

446
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:09,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoonie Bard

447
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:34,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they had the Spoonie Bard.

448
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they needed.

449
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:43,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And, dear God, mark my words, if Final Fantasy IV DS did not keep the Spoonie Bard lingo intact, instant fail on Square Enix's part.

450
00:27:44,655 --> 00:27:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I will pick it out front of Square Enix.

451
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:47,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not screw that up.

452
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me my Spoonie Bard.

453
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I do think, I mean, it looks nice.

454
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:54,340
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's not just a straight port.

455
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,922
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, you know, at least they're doing something with it.

456
00:27:58,263 --> 00:27:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's good.

457
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:00,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give them that.

458
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

459
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually thinking I'm going to get that one because it was one of my favorites too, but I would prefer 5.

460
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:10,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I liked 3 was because of the job change system.

461
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:15,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was going to say, but if this sells well, I guess logically that's going to be what happens next, right?

462
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope so.

463
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, there's some good news for our UK listeners.

464
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:32,288
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone who is interested in SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters for the DS, the little problem that was going on in the 9th level of the game, we were having this issue where if you...

465
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:33,942
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually a victim of that.

467
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I like card games or anything.

468
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I only bought it because it has Phoenix Wright stuff in it.

469
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:13,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not actually going to get rid of my copy because I'm never going to get that far because it's only on the New Game Plus or whatever.

470
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:16,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So take that, SNK.

471
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:18,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not getting my cartridge back.

472
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:23,527
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, though, they do have a new arcade game that's going to be coming out.

473
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that we really care.

474
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:28,068
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Capcom versus SNK?

475
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No, SNK has actually got, I think, a new King of Fighters

476
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, I lost interest in that series a while ago.

477
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,671
[SPEAKER_04]: But I liked Capcom vs. SNK.

478
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of cool.

479
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:41,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get into a lot of fighting games, but I liked Capcom vs. SNK.

480
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Mai vs. Chun-Li, awesome.

481
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:43,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic.

482
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:45,134
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

483
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:53,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, speaking of epic, Loki and I were addicted for many, many, many, many, many years to Final Fantasy XI.

484
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:54,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, not that many years.

485
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:55,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably about like four.

486
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:56,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Miklatov was addicted, too.

487
00:29:57,318 --> 00:30:00,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's your fucking fault I went back, like, to...

488
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

489
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:50,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not impressed because half of it was recycled footage from all the expansions that are already out like the original opening movie that's like five years old right and then um the rest of it I get was pretty much like Miklatov picked this out I didn't even pick this out I'm like this looks the exact same as the areas that are already in there Miklatov was like oh yeah it's the areas like before the game takes place because I guess this Wings of the Goddess is some type of like

490
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Time Mage Class Time Mage Class

491
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting theory.

492
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:10,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to go back to the game when this comes out?

493
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:11,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably for a week.

494
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:11,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

495
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:15,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I went back every other time a new expansion came out.

496
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:16,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to stop.

497
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:23,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I won't play it much, and then I'll be like, I'm too low of a level to do anything in the new area, and I just want to go get the new job classes.

498
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:24,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hold off.

499
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:27,434
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making a new fucking role-playing game anyways.

500
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

501
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:36,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as a friendly reminder, I'd like to go around and remind everybody why we quit Final Fantasy XI, because there's probably some fans of the game who listen to the program going,

502
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,209
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are so mean to Final Fantasy XI.

503
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:39,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I play this game.

504
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we play this game like between us all.

505
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,432
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably played this game for like many, many, many years.

506
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:45,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, why'd you quit?

507
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I played for six months.

508
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because the White Mage is the party bitch.

509
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:51,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like playing White Mages.

510
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:54,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fuck everybody in that game.

511
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why'd you quit?

512
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit because I had a girlfriend and a wife.

513
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:01,562
[SPEAKER_03]: That became a wife.

514
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:02,603
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time?

515
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

516
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,344
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that would not be fun.

517
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:05,945
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but...

518
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:14,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I couldn't play it as often as I'd like to and there was like a big six month, you know, span where I didn't actually play at all.

519
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,524
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, you know, paying that kind of money each month, even though it's, you know, like 13, 12 bucks, whatever.

520
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:24,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still, you know, money that's kind of being wasted.

521
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:29,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hell, if I was still single and not seeing anybody, I'd probably still be playing the game.

522
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:30,767
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was fun.

523
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:44,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I had fun with it, but it's just you get to a point, though, you work so hard in the game, and then it's just, you know, you get in stupid parties, and the whole fact that you have to party with people really kind of sucks.

524
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's an MMO, and you're supposed to party with people, but the fact that they force you to party when you can't find a party, I mean, that kind of fucking sucks.

525
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:58,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You go on the play, and you can't do anything, so that was lame.

526
00:32:58,564 --> 00:32:59,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Mikotov, why'd you quit?

527
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the main reason probably is that whole XP loss when you die.

528
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:11,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But most recently, it was because getting blue mage spells sucked sometimes.

529
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And me and one of my friends in the game, we spent all night, hours and hours, trying to get this one spell.

530
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Never got it.

531
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:22,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, screw this game, I'm done.

532
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:28,447
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I quit was because Squeenix did nothing about the gold farmers for far too long, and the economy in that game was fucked.

533
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:57,744
[SPEAKER_04]: and people were telling me to actually buy Gil and I was like that's where I draw the line is spending that type of real world money to buy fake money online just because you know these people who are being paid to sit here and camp these monsters are getting stuff before me and people were so elitist that if you didn't have these items it's like you suck in parties and so I finally had my fill of it I was done even I had my elitist you know plus one everything you know fucking bard character and I got nothing

534
00:33:58,641 --> 00:33:59,661
[SPEAKER_03]: No parties out of that.

535
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:02,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there you go.

536
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:04,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus everything charisma and all that stuff.

537
00:34:05,063 --> 00:34:05,203
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

538
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:15,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, it's like, they want you to party in that game, but people have in their minds the ideal party setup, and if you don't fit that, your job or anything, then what's the point?

539
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:16,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're not going to get a party.

540
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,787
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be a samurai looking for a party for forever, at least back when I played, and

541
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:22,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Your job is worthless then.

542
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:25,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Heaven help you if you're a paladin who doesn't sub warrior.

543
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you have to have the right sub jobs too.

544
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:30,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So boo on you, Final Fantasy XI.

545
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:30,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

546
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:31,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

547
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:34,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the comments in the chat room here.

548
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteelUT says, healers are the party bitch in every MMO.

549
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:40,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

550
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:47,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Sephiroth1215 says, I never liked Final Fantasy XI, but it does get addicting somehow and I stopped myself before I was an addict.

551
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:51,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow Fitzslayer says Tetra Master is greater than Final Fantasy XI.

552
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:55,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetra Master was kind of fun.

553
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,990
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

554
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I played my free month of Tetra Master.

555
00:34:58,152 --> 00:34:58,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun.

556
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like fun for about five minutes.

557
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good idea, actually, Loki.

558
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki says put that on Xbox Live Arcade.

559
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so no one will play it.

560
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

561
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play it once.

562
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:09,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was free.

563
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,104
[SPEAKER_04]: News story, please.

564
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:12,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

565
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,505
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very disappointing for me to read, but Parasite Eve 3 is apparently going to be a cell phone title.

566
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:26,090
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously in Japan, where cell phone titles are more popular, you know, it's not a big surprise.

567
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:31,714
[SPEAKER_03]: But over here, though, I would hope that maybe a next-gen version of Parasite Eve, because I like that series.

568
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:32,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty good.

569
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:34,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, then again, I never did play the second one.

570
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:37,738
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was announced over at the Square Enix party.

571
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

572
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of disappointing.

573
00:35:44,056 --> 00:36:11,623
[SPEAKER_04]: but hopefully you know what they kind of tend to do with these kind of things though port it over to like the PSP or something later on so here's hoping for a PSP version PSP version would be hot though Ross Steel UT who I'm quoting a lot tonight but he's saying a lot of stuff here and I'm not going to tell him to shut up he's saying a lot of good stuff here heartbreaks as he hears PE3 is a cell phone title I'm sure that's how most people feel about that news

574
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:13,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complete sadness.

575
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:17,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody was kind of waiting for Parasite Eve 3 on PlayStation 2, and then it just never happened.

576
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:23,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least, you know, maybe they translate the book for us so that some of us who wants to read it can.

577
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the Japanese movie, and that was awesome.

578
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:30,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it somewhere, but my friends read the book like five times and keep telling me how awesome the book is.

579
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:31,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew, reading.

580
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

581
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:33,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, watch the movie.

582
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:36,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the book so I get the good story.

583
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:37,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

584
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is actually a bit of happiness that came out of the Tokyo Game Show.

585
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was an announcement for Kingdom Hearts.

586
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to happen at the Tokyo Game Show.

587
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a few months off.

588
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I said, isn't it?

589
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:58,255
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you said some announcement that... It's coming out of the... Okay, whatever.

590
00:36:58,695 --> 00:36:59,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon my context.

591
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... At any rate, it's going to be announced at the Tokyo Game Show.

592
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Who's sick of announcements of announcements?

593
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:11,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an announcement to make.

594
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make an announcement later.

595
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:16,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely refrain from here on out to make announcements of announcements.

596
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

597
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:27,066
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an amazing trend within this industry is that, hey, stay tuned for a really big announcement about something we're going to be announcing very soon.

598
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, shut up and make a game.

599
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:33,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up and go make the game.

600
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:35,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

601
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Any hopes for what they're going to be announcing, DarkSakura?

602
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:39,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Kingdom Hearts 3?

603
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe.

604
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's going to be like Kingdom Hearts MMO?

605
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:44,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Memories 2.

606
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other lame- There's not going to be any way they can do a Kingdom Hearts MMO.

607
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts minus Disney.

608
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:51,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're all fearing that.

609
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:51,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it won't be good.

610
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:54,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

611
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:58,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Hostile1 in chat says, Please, please, please, Kingdom Hearts for $360.

612
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:01,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Save me the $600 for the PlayStation 3.

613
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:06,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 3, except it's minus Disney and with Hanna-Barbera instead.

614
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:08,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yabba-dabba-doo!

615
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be so horrible.

616
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:15,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray, I have Quick Draw McGraw in my party and Droopy Dog.

617
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but... Wow.

618
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:21,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

619
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:24,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, but Jetson's world would be pretty awesome.

620
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:26,306
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that, Jamie?

621
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:29,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts with minus the Disney plus the Hanna-Barbera.

622
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the Hanna-Barbera so much.

623
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,152
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do plus Warner Brothers.

624
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:37,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get the Animaniacs.

625
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that Johnny Quest 2?

626
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:40,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Johnny Quest.

627
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was Hanna-Barbera.

628
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:41,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it?

629
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:42,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be worse.

630
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,098
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, that would also give us C-Lab.

631
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be worse.

632
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:47,200
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do Kingdom Hearts 3 with Adult Swim.

633
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:49,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true.

634
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:54,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts of the Robot Chicken Suyoku no Gensu What is that?

635
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:54,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You're yaying that.

636
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:55,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what the hell that is.

637
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:21,962
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

638
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:53,583
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 2, you get Shining Wind from Sega on the 17th, as well as Odin Sphere coming out over there.

639
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's about it.

640
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if there's anything on the DS real quick.

641
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:02,427
[SPEAKER_04]: You do get Custom Beat Battle.

642
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Draglade is coming out.

643
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then, of course, Oendan 2.

644
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:07,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose that's important.

645
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also coming out this week in Japan.

646
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Elite Beat Agents, some of you know that here.

647
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You pre-ordered that, didn't you, Shane?

648
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You pre-ordered it, and you got next day shipping or something, right?

649
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,243
[SPEAKER_05]: My shipping costs about the same as the game, because I care that much.

650
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have it that early, right?

651
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:36,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've watched that stupid demo that they put up on YouTube from the download kiosks in Japan a million times, and I watched the TouchDS.jp videos a million times, and I'm so excited.

652
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know any of the songs except for one.

653
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So you spent like $80 on this game?

654
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:42,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say closer to $90.

655
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

656
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:45,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

657
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to say actually one other game because I actually went and looked at the PC and Macintosh releases coming out.

658
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And Korea, you know, we don't talk a whole lot about what goes on in Korea.

659
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are getting a game that's worth mentioning here.

660
00:40:58,029 --> 00:40:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my favorite title of the week.

661
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,150
[SPEAKER_04]: An adventure game for the PC called Princess Maker 5.

662
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Princess Maker 5 coming out in Korea.

663
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:06,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like fun.

664
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,534
[SPEAKER_04]: In this game you get to, it looks like, make princesses.

665
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

666
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:12,715
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's all their little stats.

667
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

668
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

669
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:53,120
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that Mana game on PlayStation 1?

670
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:18,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret of Mana?

671
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:19,007
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Legend of Mana.

672
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Mana is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played in my entire fucking life.

673
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:24,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Try playing it in Japanese.

674
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's just salt in the wound right there, because that game's... I'm sorry, it sucked.

675
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:37,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any nice... It wasn't... If they would go back, because... Okay, what you should do, get an emulator and play the translation of Seiken Densetsu 3.

676
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:38,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have.

677
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking beautiful.

678
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:40,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

679
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a game be like that.

680
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:43,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Virtual Console?

681
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:44,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

682
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:44,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

683
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:45,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday.

684
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:45,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

685
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I was just saying that because Dawn of Mana, I don't know, I approach with caution.

686
00:42:51,142 --> 00:43:01,466
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't bought Marvel Ultimate Alliance yet on the 360 and you're thinking about doing it, you definitely want to pick up Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold, which is coming out this week as well.

687
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the same game with the download codes for the extra characters, so that's pretty awesome.

688
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, is coming out on PSP this week.

689
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let that fool you, it's exactly the same damn game all over again.

690
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see here.

691
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:24,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Etrian Odyssey, some RPG game coming out on the DS.

692
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, if you're a baseball fan, MLB07, The Show on PlayStation 3.

693
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:33,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, the rounded up, really strange game, Touch the Dead.

694
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:35,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming out on the DS.

695
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Think House of the Dead on the DS.

696
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to touch the dead.

697
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:40,352
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds kind of kinky.

698
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:41,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course...

699
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:43,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Nanny Mania

700
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:11,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that stage.

701
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:13,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me think of Super Nanny on TV.

702
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Nanny 911, whatever those shows are.

703
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:22,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was going to say, oh yeah, that's right, Naruto Ninja Council 3 is also coming out in the DS.

704
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:24,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many Naruto fans are out there.

705
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:26,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Too damn many.

706
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

707
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: TheRobD in chat is picking a fight with Loki here.

708
00:44:29,854 --> 00:44:31,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does Loki hate sequels?

709
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:36,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And why is he not hating on MLB 07, which is a giant rehash itself?

710
00:44:37,648 --> 00:44:38,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say I didn't hate it.

711
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I said if you like baseball.

712
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:44,012
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I hating on sequels for?

713
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:45,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Shrek the Third sucks.

714
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Shrek the Third, I mean, obviously the games are going to suck.

715
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was Shrek the First, it'd still suck.

716
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:53,557
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we want more Shrek go-karts.

717
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:56,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't hating on anything.

718
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: When did I hate on a sequel when I was talking there?

719
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:00,361
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't any sequels I hated on.

720
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for, oh, Art of Fighting Anthology, because that's not a sequel.

721
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a re-release.

722
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,265
[SPEAKER_04]: TheRobD admits I'm mostly stirring up trouble.

723
00:45:08,178 --> 00:45:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama.

724
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:09,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done.

725
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:09,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Drama.

726
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, we have UK releases, like 5.

727
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:21,522
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 15th, we have Freestyle Street Basketball for PC.

728
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:24,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything else is Sony.

729
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Innocent Life, Legend of the Dragon, and SOCOM US Navy Seals.

730
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:36,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire Bravo 2 on PSP, and on PlayStation 2, we have SOCOM US Navy Seals Combined Assault.

731
00:45:38,123 --> 00:45:38,803
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it.

732
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:40,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

733
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's get back into some news talking about upcoming releases.

734
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:49,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band is rumored to be coming out on the Wii.

735
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:52,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of rumors going around about this this week.

736
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:57,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's because there's focus group testing going on.

737
00:45:58,013 --> 00:45:59,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been testing with focus group.

738
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: MTV's been asking about packaging and pricing like how much would you pay and then the Wii was also one of the systems that

739
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:07,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

740
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:34,953
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, during this focus group, the group was asked what they would think about a bundle including the game, a wireless guitar, a drum kit, and a microphone for $200.

741
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:39,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't go over well with the group.

742
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: $175 went over a little better.

743
00:46:42,377 --> 00:46:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: $150 was when everybody in the group got on board.

744
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:49,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be an actual drum set.

745
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:51,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine how big this box is?

746
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the fuck am I going to put that in my shithole apartment?

747
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:54,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

748
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:59,858
[SPEAKER_04]: What college dorm is going to fit that?

749
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:07,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool concept for a game, but this is why they didn't have any arcade style drum mania controllers or anything.

750
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:15,028
[SPEAKER_03]: They left it at Guitar Freaks and said, okay, those controllers are big enough, we don't need to bring the huge fucking drum set.

751
00:47:15,356 --> 00:47:23,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember when we were younger, like in junior high or whatever, they had those drumsticks that you could just hit anywhere in the air and they had a little speaker.

752
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were called like hit sticks or something.

753
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could play the drums and the little crappy speaker that was attached to them would go, like you could just wave the drums in the air.

754
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:34,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 10 bucks.

755
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:35,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be the controller.

756
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:44,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember back in the day when I had the actual cabinet and everything and I was talking about how I was going to make actual drums, you know, a drum set for Guitar Freaks Drum Mania?

757
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm glad I didn't do that.

758
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:47,594
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

759
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Blaze says those still exist.

760
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:50,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be damned.

761
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,996
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight says I had one.

762
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of us had one.

763
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:55,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are pretty rad.

764
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have one of those, Mikhail Tov?

765
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you nodding your head over there.

766
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,201
[SPEAKER_05]: My cousins did, and I wasn't allowed to play with them because I was really little.

767
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:06,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they were really awesome looking at the time.

768
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:09,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of stupid, though, now that I think about it.

769
00:48:09,183 --> 00:48:11,264
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pretty stupid in retrospect.

770
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm thinking those were cheap, and they didn't take up any space at all.

771
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.

772
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:17,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

773
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is getting a little crazy with your obsession with music games.

774
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:30,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the thing with Guitar Hero, I mean, $80, I almost said Guitar Freaks, $80 is a really big investment, I think, for a game.

775
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:36,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And a $200 investment in a game, you better hope this game is fucking awesome.

776
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Because otherwise, you're going to be fucking pissed.

777
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:44,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, besides, if you want to buy, you know, Rock Band, boy, do we have a game for you!

778
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The Eye of Judgment!

779
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:51,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It too will have a lot of extra crap and will probably be expensive.

780
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:57,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game that's rumored to be coming out on another system would be Table Tennis for the Wii.

781
00:48:58,088 --> 00:48:59,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockstar's Table Tennis, that is.

782
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:04,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's going to be scaled down graphically, but hey, it's Table Tennis on the Wii.

783
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:08,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody likes Wii Tennis, so of course this is going to do well.

784
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that work?

785
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:12,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I seem to remember...

786
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:15,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the gameplay mechanics would have to be completely different

787
00:49:16,772 --> 00:49:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

788
00:49:16,852 --> 00:49:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not mistaking.

789
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe not.

790
00:49:19,093 --> 00:49:29,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I seem to remember, I haven't played table tennis in a while, but I seem to remember, like, you had to look very carefully at the ball to see what color it was glowing because that was showing you the type of spin that was on the ball.

791
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:37,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was very important for how you could respond to that to better, you know, defeat your opponent was to, you know, counter with the appropriate type of spin.

792
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you do that with the Wiimote?

793
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:42,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you just have to use the one and two buttons or the D-pad or something?

794
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

795
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's what I've been thinking.

796
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:43,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

797
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: People think because people liked Wii Sports, because it was a packing title and everybody loves the games that came with it and stuff, that people would want to buy a game that does exactly the same thing for more money.

798
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,540
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I didn't understand.

799
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:05,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, tennis itself, yeah, it was fun bringing it out and people would come over and stuff like that.

800
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:09,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy a tennis game, though, just because I like playing Wii Tennis.

801
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:10,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, fuck that shit.

802
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:11,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a free game right here.

803
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I buy another game?

804
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:19,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading chatroom and there's some comments on the previous story about Rock Band.

805
00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:28,747
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 wrote, in all caps, Drum Mania is a blatant rip-off of Rock Band with crappy Jap techno and timing judgments and cheats, aka speed mods.

806
00:50:29,607 --> 00:50:35,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's exactly how X-Play will probably review it if the game comes out next year from Konami for whatever crazy reason.

807
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:44,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Although they'll say that it came out, they'll acknowledge the fact that it came out, but they'll say that it's improved on it because this actually teaches you how to play drums.

808
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of all the Bomani series, I think that's the only one I thought you had to do something.

809
00:50:53,244 --> 00:50:53,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Keyboard Mania.

810
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:59,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You could actually take the real version of Keyboard Mania and play it on a real keyboard and it would sound very similar.

811
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:02,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you played on easy like I did.

812
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:05,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you'd get something that sounded kind of close.

813
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:09,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, still, though, those games, it was pretty good.

814
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I saw, you know, for example, Lankstyle.

815
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I saw him start off on, you know, that.

816
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:17,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he was a drummer beforehand, but, you know, he got pretty good by the end.

817
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:23,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I've seen people that just start playing Drum Mania, and then, you know, you see them about a year later, they're just busting out like a real drummer.

818
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:24,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

819
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:35,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, well, and I've learned this as a musician, that half of playing is, you know, the more you do it, it comes to a point where you're, you build the instinct for it.

820
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands will know what to do.

821
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what got me through band is that after a while you train yourself to know how to do these things.

822
00:51:44,379 --> 00:51:45,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing.

823
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:47,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Jvmon has another interesting point in chat.

824
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Parapara Paradise taught Parapara dancing.

825
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:57,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of, but I remember when that game first came out and people over here didn't know that it was based off the Japanese thing, people used to rave on that.

826
00:51:58,004 --> 00:52:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one guy who used to do all his crazy rave dancing.

827
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:01,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

828
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:05,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna hang my head down now.

829
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:07,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do that too?

830
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:07,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

831
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: With your glow sticks?

832
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:10,112
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

833
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember we'd get everybody shadowing and that was great.

834
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:17,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when we ate the sign that said no shadowing.

835
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:18,930
Who did that?

836
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:19,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

837
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:24,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Golfland dared to put a sign on the machine that said no shadowing.

838
00:52:24,533 --> 00:52:25,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a picture of somebody eating it.

839
00:52:26,073 --> 00:52:26,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick ate it.

840
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:27,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick.

841
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:27,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Rick.

842
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:28,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a guy.

843
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:30,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, this rule sucks.

844
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:32,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And we dared Rick to eat the sign.

845
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:32,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So he did.

846
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:34,316
[SPEAKER_04]: He tore the sign off the machine.

847
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:35,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not kidding.

848
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:36,097
[SPEAKER_04]: He fucking ate it.

849
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:39,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

850
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we all shadowed in defiance of Golfland's neo-Nazi policies.

851
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:54,942
[SPEAKER_03]: In Rick's defense, I mean, this is the guy that didn't they have like the challenges that they would do where they would like either, I don't remember if they sniffed a whole bunch of cinnamon or ate a whole bunch of cinnamon.

852
00:52:55,282 --> 00:52:59,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Some weird shit like that, drinking a gallon of milk, you know, that kind of weird crazy shit.

853
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 has a great idea for a macro if I could find that picture.

854
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:08,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a picture that exists with Rick

855
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:09,987
[SPEAKER_04]: with half a sign in his mouth.

856
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I made you a sign, but I eated it.

857
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,112
[SPEAKER_02]: A cat macro.

858
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:16,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.

859
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:17,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

860
00:53:17,953 --> 00:53:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Winner, GS68, Shatter of the Evening.

861
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

862
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:22,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you win a no prize.

863
00:53:23,377 --> 00:53:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got, though, some fun news.

864
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:28,221
[SPEAKER_02]: You know one of my favorite games ever is Soul Calibur, right?

865
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've told you about Rod Calibur, haven't I?

866
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:32,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Using the fishing thing?

867
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:34,765
[SPEAKER_02]: When you played on Dreamcast, use the fishing rod to play Soul Calibur.

868
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:35,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

869
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:38,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also tried doing it with the Dreamcast dance pads.

870
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:40,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only analog on there is the Konami symbol.

871
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,733
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rod Calibur is the most fun.

872
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:46,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought Rod Calibur was a different game I played with my rod.

873
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rod, let me finish the story, okay?

874
00:53:50,597 --> 00:53:58,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Well now, um, and I think that this is beautiful because in my brain it's an homage to Rod Calibur.

875
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:01,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur Legends is coming out on the Wii.

876
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be using the nunchuck and the, uh,

877
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:07,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The Weemote.

878
00:54:08,134 --> 00:54:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just seeing Rod Calibur all over again.

879
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,876
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what's fucking awesome about the game, though?

880
00:54:13,936 --> 00:54:15,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a beat-em-up game.

881
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:21,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Except hopefully it's not going to be like that Tekken game with... What's her name?

882
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:23,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Death by Degrees.

883
00:54:23,438 --> 00:54:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

884
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:24,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope it's not like that.

885
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's like the Tekken Force mode from Tekken 3.

886
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jamie, to sum up, I will soon be able to play Rod Calibur with my Wii.

887
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:32,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

888
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Rod Calibur with your Wii.

889
00:54:34,822 --> 00:54:35,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Fabulous.

890
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:36,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Rod...

891
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:41,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And for anyone who still has a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur, you should try Rod Calibur if you never have.

892
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well... You know, I just want to mention real quick.

893
00:54:46,294 --> 00:54:46,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

894
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:52,339
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some fishing games coming out in the fall for the Wii that actually have a fishing rod controller.

895
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, Rod Calibur for a whole other generation.

896
00:54:58,844 --> 00:54:58,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah...

897
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:08,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one person that won't be playing Soul Calibur on the Wii anytime soon or any derivative of the game is this guy who emailed Kotaku earlier this week.

898
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was a story here.

899
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to quote this story from a Kotaku article here.

900
00:55:12,738 --> 00:55:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, Buying a Wii was a big deal for me.

901
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:20,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing those 250 hard-earned dollars and some change go flying from her hand and into the water was painful.

902
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:24,986
[SPEAKER_04]: We would probably be together right now if she had not thrown out my beloved Wii.

903
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:28,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But alas, you can't talk a crazy woman out of an idea of such magnitude.

904
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:34,794
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's wife took the Wii and threw it into a lake during a heated argument.

905
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:38,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, and he goes on to say, Anyways, divorce is imminent.

906
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking to a lawyer tomorrow to get the process started.

907
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not divorcing her just because of the Wii throwing, but that's the rather large straw that broke the Dromedary's back.

908
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have thrown her right after that.

909
00:55:54,443 --> 00:55:55,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw her in the river, go get my Wii?

910
00:55:56,924 --> 00:55:58,885
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do if Nellie threw your Wii into the lake?

911
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be pissed I'd buy another one Maybe Anyways

912
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:26,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, this sounds pretty cool.

913
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:32,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Last game that came out, I know like this, the Rygar game on PlayStation 2 was pretty awesome.

914
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're doing Project Rygar for the Wii.

915
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:39,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it's going to be a brand new game exclusively for the Wii.

916
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:47,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And no real details about that, except it's supposed to have new characters, new enemies, new weapons, yada yada yada.

917
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:53,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the announcements from Tecmo's party that they did.

918
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:57,876
[SPEAKER_03]: because everyone is having their gamers day or Tecmo's, I guess, night out of seven.

919
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

920
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a pretty cool piece of artwork.

921
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:04,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only bit of info from the game so far.

922
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:07,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty Guilty Gear-ish, actually.

923
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:07,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

924
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,780
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I never played the Rygar game on PlayStation 2.

925
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow missed it, but I did enjoy the old NES one.

926
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like one of my favorite 8-bit games ever, even if it was really different from the arcade.

927
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:18,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

928
00:57:19,442 --> 00:57:22,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Then probably when this game gets closer to coming out, Virtual Console.

929
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Spirit, TurboGrafx Game

930
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:56,841
[SPEAKER_02]: and also NES Open Tournament Golf.

931
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:00,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.

932
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:01,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

933
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be in the UK because neither of those games really are that good to me.

934
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:09,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely remember it.

935
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:09,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I played it once.

936
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Golf is more like crap.

937
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:15,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't it come out kind of in response to Ninja Gaiden?

938
00:58:16,823 --> 00:58:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

939
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: because you do the leaning thing in the dance.

940
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

941
00:58:42,342 --> 00:58:44,943
[SPEAKER_04]: D-Vay has a Mother's Day message in chat here.

942
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:47,844
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom rocked at Ninja Spirit for some reason.

943
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know why I bought it.

944
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom never really played video games at all.

945
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get her to play anything.

946
00:58:54,728 --> 00:59:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know that whole experience of walking in and your mom or your dad is playing a video game of yours.

947
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, what are you doing?

948
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:05,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm just beating the level 3 boss.

949
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:07,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

950
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:09,915
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

951
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:32,737
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

952
00:59:50,635 --> 01:00:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Techmo Bowl was one of the few sports games I really, really got into on the NES because back then, sports games were so simple that you didn't really have to be a professor of the sport to do well at them.

953
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty excited that Techmo Bowl is re-coming out.

954
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:10,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Except the weird thing about it is that they're not saying what system it's coming out on.

955
01:00:11,043 --> 01:00:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just saying, quote, I can't tell you what platform we're making it for, but I can tell you that it's probably not going to be on the platform that you're expecting.

956
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,371
[SPEAKER_04]: If that makes any sense.

957
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:23,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually have no idea what that means.

958
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:25,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean Xbox Live Arcade?

959
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:26,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Cell phone?

960
01:00:26,553 --> 01:00:27,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they already have a cell phone.

961
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Tecmo Bowl.

962
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:31,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually downloaded Tecmo Bowl to my cell phone about a year ago.

963
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:32,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very disappointed.

964
01:00:32,856 --> 01:00:34,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they're not working with Visual Concepts.

965
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:37,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little play on there.

966
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:43,140
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying they joined Visual Concepts because Visual Concepts is doing that All Pro 2K8 or whatever.

967
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:49,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they're comparing them because they don't have the NFL license as well.

968
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:55,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Tecmo is going to be developing it by themselves, or at least with an unnamed developer.

969
01:00:55,725 --> 01:00:58,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to guess that it's the N-Gage that they're working on.

970
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they are doing that whole N-Gage 3 relaunch thing or whatever, so that's the system I least expect it on.

971
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:09,673
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the Atari 2600?

972
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:12,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the system I would least expect it on.

973
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Virtual Console?

974
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, we already have Tecmo Bowl on Virtual Console.

975
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:18,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinda.

976
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:19,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but a new one though.

977
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that'd be cool.

978
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:25,994
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, the weird thing is I had like this Tecmo Collection or something like that.

979
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:29,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called, I don't remember, like a Tecmo Collection that came out on Xbox.

980
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:32,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had the old arcade version of Tecmo Bowl on it.

981
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:35,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Not nearly as fun as the NES one.

982
01:01:35,456 --> 01:01:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize a lot of people kind of only know that as the Tecmo Bowl, but it was kind of clunky to me.

983
01:01:40,737 --> 01:01:43,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have that fast pacedness that the NES one had.

984
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:44,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

985
01:01:47,473 --> 01:01:51,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, some interesting stuff.

986
01:01:51,356 --> 01:02:06,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that was announced over in during the Square Enix little Final Fantasy party there was that they're going to be bringing Chocobo Dungeon to actually to the Wii exclusively, which is kind of neat.

987
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:14,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be kind of cool, I guess, with aren't they having the new, I want to say they had Dragon Quest Swords as well coming out

988
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff for the Wii.

989
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Wii love, which is good.

990
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:28,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't remember if any news about this made our show roll, but isn't there information as well about Crystal Chronicles that came out of the event?

991
01:02:29,614 --> 01:02:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they're doing a DS version.

992
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:34,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they may have announced a date for that.

993
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:37,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't the Wii one supposed to be a launch title?

994
01:02:39,316 --> 01:02:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

995
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:41,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in Japan, but I don't...

996
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:43,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that didn't happen.

997
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:50,876
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I distinctly remember seeing some type of Crystal Chronicles stuff in some of the early press things for the Wii, like it was an early launch title.

998
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:54,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced, what was it, the DS version is going to be coming to Japan on August 23rd.

999
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:58,102
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the announcement that I believe was there.

1000
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about the Wii version at all.

1001
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:03,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there was anything announced there.

1002
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:08,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I don't know, are you excited about Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii?

1003
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, don't care.

1004
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't give a crap when the DS version came out.

1005
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:15,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially didn't give a crap for the Japanese one.

1006
01:03:18,053 --> 01:03:20,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Mikotov, have you ever played the Chocobo Dungeon games?

1007
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about this new Wii One at all?

1008
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:26,855
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I'm excited about Crystal Chronicles.

1009
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:27,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

1010
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:30,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and my friends played the GameCube one a whole bunch.

1011
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We never beat it, but we had a really good time with it because we had all the Game Boy Advances linked up and it was just a really good time and

1012
01:03:37,728 --> 01:03:41,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect the DS one will be probably a little more fun.

1013
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:47,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel UT says in chat, will Crystal Chronicles require four DSs for multiplayer?

1014
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1015
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:49,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not.

1016
01:03:49,313 --> 01:03:50,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it will.

1017
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1018
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:54,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to have people share the DS when they're playing?

1019
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:59,118
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's just the DS version, everybody's going to need a copy and a DS to play.

1020
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:02,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that maybe one reason that they've kind of held off on putting this out on the Wii?

1021
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Is because there hasn't really been a game that has the DS connectivity yet?

1022
01:04:07,932 --> 01:04:08,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're waiting?

1023
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:13,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, but I would really like them to do a Wii one already, and the DS one.

1024
01:04:14,276 --> 01:04:15,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it, Square, Enix.

1025
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:21,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though the story was about Chocobo Dungeon, we couldn't help but throw in a little bit of Crystal Chronicles in there, so go figure.

1026
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:23,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we talked about a good game instead.

1027
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you have it.

1028
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have potential for something to be relatively good.

1029
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:34,327
[SPEAKER_02]: They are doing, actually, a Final Fantasy sort of fighting game.

1030
01:04:36,108 --> 01:04:36,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Her Guys 2?

1031
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Dissidia.

1032
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:53,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's looking like it's going to be more like a big... It sort of looks like it's more of a big... I'm sorry, the only thing I can really think of looking at this is like a sort of like...

1033
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just an excuse to give the fangirls their Cloud X Tidus stories?

1034
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,216
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because Steffi is my bishy.

1035
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:24,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1036
01:05:24,923 --> 01:05:25,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you're lame.

1037
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1038
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:27,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding, hearts.

1039
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:28,725
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

1040
01:05:28,785 --> 01:05:29,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a Squall fan girl.

1041
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now all of the, you could, if this is, if this ends up, you know, being what the game's all about, you could have all, all of those guys battling it out.

1042
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:37,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1043
01:05:38,008 --> 01:05:38,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1044
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:39,729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

1045
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadows Fitzlair in chat says, Super Smash Brothers Final Fantasy Edition.

1046
01:05:45,832 --> 01:05:46,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe.

1047
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:48,469
[SPEAKER_04]: StarOcean1 and StarOcean2

1048
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember these games were originally on the Super Nintendo and the PlayStation 1, but now they are going to be coming to the PSP.

1049
01:06:15,857 --> 01:06:30,481
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you would like a new Star Ocean game, Star Ocean 4 is confirmed to be under development and will be coming out soon, but they haven't exactly said which platform it's going to be coming out to yet, I believe.

1050
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people are assuming it's PS3 and Xbox 360, and most people are assuming it has to be PlayStation 3, because all the other games were...

1051
01:06:39,306 --> 01:06:40,347
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Sony platforms.

1052
01:06:40,447 --> 01:06:43,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, anything's possible, especially with Square.

1053
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,651
[SPEAKER_04]: They've jumped ship before to other systems.

1054
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:48,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hello, Dragon Quest going to DS.

1055
01:06:48,554 --> 01:06:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought that was going to happen?

1056
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

1057
01:06:51,696 --> 01:06:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was thinking, it says it was officially announced for next-gen consoles.

1058
01:06:58,021 --> 01:06:59,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind the DS thing.

1059
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:03,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, technically, I don't know.

1060
01:07:03,365 --> 01:07:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, though, you can assume it's the PlayStation, but then they'll make a surprise jump to Wii.

1061
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:07,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1062
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:10,357
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1063
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:21,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so of more, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but more rumors regarding the PSP getting a redesign.

1064
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:24,330
[SPEAKER_03]: One I had to laugh at when I saw this story.

1065
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:36,340
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a rumor that the PSPs are going to be now being shipped with downloadable, with firmwares with downloadable prevention software.

1066
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:42,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, like all the other ones had it so you can download.

1067
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:48,402
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry, I don't think they're going to have it where you can enable it not to be able to be downgraded.

1068
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:51,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to try, apparently, that's the rumor.

1069
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait, what exactly are they blocking?

1070
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:55,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't download anything?

1071
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:57,266
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're downgradable.

1072
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,527
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to make it so you can't downgrade the firmware.

1073
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:00,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how that's going to happen.

1074
01:08:00,988 --> 01:08:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't they say that every other time they release a patch?

1075
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:04,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1076
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:05,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1077
01:08:06,505 --> 01:08:09,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, they're basically, that's the rumor, it's supposed to be happening.

1078
01:08:11,266 --> 01:08:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: They said all new PSPs shipping out as of next Friday, which is May 18th, will be at a higher firmware, 4 point something.

1079
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says they promised to include, and this is coming from an EB Games regional manager in Canada.

1080
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how much you can believe that.

1081
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,591
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you trying to say about Canada?

1082
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:37,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to say something about EB.

1083
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:40,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, here's what they're saying.

1084
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:52,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony was sending out emails to its commercial retailers that all new PSPs will be sent out with downgradable prevention built right into them.

1085
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:59,533
[SPEAKER_03]: All new PSPs will be shipped out as of next week, Friday, May 18th, will be a higher firmware for .xx.

1086
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:01,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this just a challenge to hackers?

1087
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:02,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

1088
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

1089
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:23,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, no.

1090
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:31,748
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, is there really... It's not when they said Blu-ray and HD DVD is uncrackable and then, you know, the code's all over the front page of Dig a few months later.

1091
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's just say, for example, if they do release this firmware or whatever, that's for new PSPs.

1092
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of them out there right now that do not have that.

1093
01:09:40,794 --> 01:09:41,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1094
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:42,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

1095
01:09:42,403 --> 01:09:53,010
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about the equivalent of them changing the $5 bill to a new version that can't be counterfeited, but the old ones are still in circulation and still being used, so it's kind of dumb.

1096
01:09:54,391 --> 01:10:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, the other, of course, rumor that we've talked about before is saying that a new PSP redesign is going to become, and it'll be smaller and a lighter weight version of the handheld device.

1097
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,382
[SPEAKER_03]: No release date, no price point,

1098
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:13,769
[SPEAKER_03]: and no other info on that.

1099
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:24,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that's a big fat rumor, but I think people are thinking that's going to happen since, I don't know, that they haven't monkeyed with it yet and that they can't do that with all their console systems.

1100
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1101
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The website of the week is MyCatHatesYou.com and this is a

1102
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:58,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, massive collection of pissed off cats.

1103
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:00,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

1104
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just lovely.

1105
01:11:03,711 --> 01:11:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is, is pictures of angry cats.

1106
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:06,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

1107
01:11:06,893 --> 01:11:09,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Our cats are doing naughty, bad things.

1108
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this one cat, and one of the first things is this cat with a leather jacket on it and a big hat, looking all badass.

1109
01:11:16,798 --> 01:11:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also one of those bald cats.

1110
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1111
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:22,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1112
01:11:28,806 --> 01:11:34,011
[SPEAKER_04]: MyCatHatesYou.com Your cat doesn't really hate me though, right, DarkSakura?

1113
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:36,333
[SPEAKER_02]: My cat doesn't hate anybody, she just looks offended.

1114
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:38,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here you go.

1115
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:48,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, one more story for you for this segment, this part of Orange Lounge Radio, and that's about some homebrew that's being made for the DS.

1116
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:50,265
[SPEAKER_04]: This is...

1117
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly how to describe this game.

1118
01:11:54,543 --> 01:12:00,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of look at it like a sort of like puzzle type game, but the game is called Virus DX.

1119
01:12:01,387 --> 01:12:05,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a puzzle game, but this puzzle game has hot anime nurses with it.

1120
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, and I'm assuming they must get, you know, naked if you do good, because this is being called XXX Homebrew, available on the Nintendo DS.

1121
01:12:16,494 --> 01:12:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not all.

1122
01:12:17,295 --> 01:12:21,577
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like, what is it, strip rock, paper, scissors, tickle girl, and teenage queen...

1123
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:22,673
[SPEAKER_03]: NDS.

1124
01:12:22,753 --> 01:12:24,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, lots of fun stuff there.

1125
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:25,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Tickle Girl.

1126
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Tickle Girl about?

1127
01:12:26,434 --> 01:12:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I'm thinking about buying stuff too.

1128
01:12:29,855 --> 01:12:33,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you actually see a picture of a girl on the bottom screen there.

1129
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you tickle her with your stylus, you can see her reaction on the top screen.

1130
01:12:38,657 --> 01:12:43,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will utilize full motion video, sampled audio, and looping background music.

1131
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:48,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying if you liked Feel the Magic, you'll love this.

1132
01:12:51,755 --> 01:12:54,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see strip rock, paper, scissors.

1133
01:12:56,999 --> 01:13:03,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like when you're trying to convince someone to play strip poker with you and they're like, but I don't know how to play poker.

1134
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:06,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So you say, okay, let's play strip high card.

1135
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:14,652
[SPEAKER_03]: All it is is it's basically a rock, paper, scissor and then they have like porn pictures that they've taken off of a website that's in a series or something.

1136
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:16,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Why bother with the game, seriously?

1137
01:13:16,753 --> 01:13:20,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not just have, you know, DS porno?

1138
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Why bother?

1139
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get the web browser.

1140
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:24,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true, too.

1141
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is homebrew.

1142
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: This you can get for free, right?

1143
01:13:28,461 --> 01:13:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the browser costs like 50 bucks.

1144
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:32,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1145
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:37,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Teenage Queen NDS is actually pretty... It's all hand-drawn animation.

1146
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:38,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

1147
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a poker game, it looks like.

1148
01:13:42,604 --> 01:13:45,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's probably about as good as strip poker was on the Commodore 64.

1149
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:46,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1150
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about Custer's Revenge.

1151
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's all about, you know, fucking, you know, putting some more adult, like, games.

1152
01:13:57,819 --> 01:13:59,861
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that one game I used to play all the time?

1153
01:14:00,062 --> 01:14:01,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the guy... Gals Panic!

1154
01:14:01,243 --> 01:14:02,864
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to put Gals Panic on there.

1155
01:14:03,084 --> 01:14:04,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought the guy game.

1156
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, you know... Where they would have the contest between the women, like the video sequences that you'd unlock.

1157
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,032
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that now in Girls Gone Wild.

1158
01:14:11,052 --> 01:14:11,812
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of retarded.

1159
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:12,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they?

1160
01:14:12,353 --> 01:14:13,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's lame.

1161
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:13,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times, though.

1162
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:14,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1163
01:14:16,303 --> 01:14:20,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, that's going to do it here for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1164
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:35,631
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening to us on your iPod or your Zune or whatever device you have to go on the go, or you're just listening on your computer in our audio archive or podcast, you've got to wait a little while, just a couple days, because we like to spread the OLR throughout the week, so you'll see Part B of our podcast about Wednesday-ish.

1165
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:42,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those of you guys listening live, be it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com or AllGames.com, we will be right back with Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

1166
01:14:43,778 --> 01:14:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1167
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:53,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
