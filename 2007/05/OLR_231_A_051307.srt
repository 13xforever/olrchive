Tonight, May 13th, 2007

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Could the Xbox Live Marketplace be set to compete with iTunes?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The easy release of Spore faces yet another delay

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And a PlayStation series is revived on cell phones?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But you might know her as Jamie Summers

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I love salad

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I heard your TV shows getting picked up by NBC after all

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The Bionic Woman, the remake

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, they're making a remake of Bionic Woman

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's so fucking cool

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Because I think of your name and everything

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You know, your name, quote unquote

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To recap for new people

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My mom was going to name me Erica

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the little girl next door said, no, you should name her after the Bionic Woman

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Name her Jamie

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So my mom named me Jamie, only she spelled it right

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so that's why I took Summers as my last name for my stage name

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There you go

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Because I am named after, my mom showed her very small nerd roots

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But you've been using that name on air for the past, you know, five years or so

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been using it since under sedation

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, so a long time, so it's just kind of funny that now the Bionic Woman is coming back, so

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do we get neat sound effects?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't know, well maybe

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Dude, it will not be the same if we do not get neat sound effects when she runs

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I do know that the people behind Battlestar Galactica have a hand in this

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A new remake, so it should be pretty awesome

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because if there's one show I've been watching a shitload of lately, it's Battlestar Galactica

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Finally, I'm like three years late, but I'm finally catching up

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The last Battlestar Galactica thing I saw was on Robot Chicken

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
With the giant mecha things falling over

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The Cylons

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there's Techmaster Loki

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That was a funny episode, that was like one of the first ones actually

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was watching the Optimus Prime with prostate cancer thing

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, Bionic Woman, that sounds kind of retarded actually

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It could be cool though, I mean

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What, is she going to run super fast with a cell phone in her hand, trip into laypeople and cause a super crash or something?

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not the Bionic Soccer Mom

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We can rebuild her, she will be even more, you know, destruction prone

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It sounds like a horrible show

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bionic Man sounds even retarded

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That sounds kind of dumb too

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And Bionic Woman is like, I'm going to rage at you

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That was the Six Million Dollar Man

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was going to say, they have the Six Million Dollar Man, so

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, well then that's lame, I don't even give a shit about the Bionic Woman

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, I believe

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unless she has a claw that comes out of her hand and she can swing on things and fights Hitler

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I believe

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bionic Commando

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I believe I was reading in one of those websites that in this new Bionic Woman, she's a 50 million dollar woman

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They have 50 million dollars worth of parts in her

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well yeah, inflation, you know, is a bitch

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That'll buy a nice pair of tits though

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It better for 50 million dollars

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want Rebecca Romain to play her

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, it's some British unknown

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Somebody that isn't known here, but has been in some British shows

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
British, I know

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Softy

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want someone who looks like Jane Fonda in the 60's

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's pictures, go to dig and look at the entertainment section and you can see pictures of the new Bionic Woman

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Rob, I'm doing a show right now

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like that ever stopped you before

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alright

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Anyway, also say hello, we'll get to video games soon, I promise

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We have nerd stuff to get to first

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Also say hello to a frequent guest of ours, but he hasn't been here in a while

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Say hello to Miklotov

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hello

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And where have you been young man?

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where have I been?

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The island of Pokemon

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, you've been catching Pokemons

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm tired

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I just woke up

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's going on?

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I noticed that you're playing DS, you're playing Pokemon now

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Still

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now, you started Pokemon and then you restarted your game

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why did you quit and restart your game completely?

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because I felt like I was doing too much trading and not enough playing

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was just not happy with my Pokemon, so I restarted

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I started with Chimchar, who I've named Homonkey

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Like homo-monkey?

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like homo-monkey, yes

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like a Pokemon name, it's awesome

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Shane, Miklotov, and I like to have naming contests for our Pokemon, like who can have the better names

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mine wins hands down, nothing's gonna top that, like nothing ever

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No porch monkey would not fit, because he's not black

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I liked, you named one of them Fancy Pants

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Fancy Pants

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because it looked like it was wearing a big fur coat

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then it evolved into like this cyber grasshopper looking thing

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was ridiculous

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It was ugly pants

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't use it anymore

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I like Muffins

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Muffins is actually called Daddy Ore

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What was the other one I just called it?

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
See the problem is, I don't know the real Pokemon names now

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Because of my stupid names, because I named everything

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Like I named one Sparkles, because it had a little thing on its tail

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It had a little sparkle on its tail

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
My electric squirrel thing is named Ellinuts, because it's an electric squirrel

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I really got creative when I got that Ponyta

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a fire horse, so I named it Hoarfires

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So I just put fire in the middle of horse

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's it

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's very creative

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It is creative

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Good job

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I enjoy it

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually, I caught a Magikarp and named it Useless

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I named it Fish Sticks

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright, anyhow

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wow, we're nerds

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Anyhow, also we have some nerds here in chat

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening as we record

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Kind of a busy Sunday, we don't have as many people as we usually do

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I mean, we're up against Mother's Day today

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, there's a lot of people out doing stuff with their moms

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Happy Mother's Day if we have any moms that listen to our program

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Also, we are up against the finale of Survivor

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You know, somebody actually had the balls to come into chat

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And say, oh, sorry, I can't listen to you guys tonight, Survivor's on

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Goodbye

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Shut up

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, A, this season of Survivor was spoiled a long time ago if you read the forums

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can tell you who wins, but I'm going to be nice

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's already told me

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For listeners to TiVo'd it

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But, yeah, it's just, I don't know

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I used to be the biggest Survivor fan

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Like, I had a party when the first Survivor was ending

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, I was that hardcore nerd

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But now, like, the game's really gotten just old

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I haven't really gotten into any seasons since, like, maybe

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Palau was, like, the last one I watched, which was a while ago

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, anyway

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't you love reality television, DarkSakura?

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then we ought to get into our gaming weeks

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was kind of neat

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I actually just played a whole lot of pinball

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I looked at Cooking Mama once

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just to show somebody

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But, really, I've just been playing a bunch of pinball

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And, you know, I got Guild Wars

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which, um, right now

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm having to be really slow with moving on to my new computer

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because I actually have to replace all of my programs

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, I haven't really been playing a whole lot

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, we are, though, we've decided we're getting Marvel Ultimate Alliance on the Xbox 360

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because we have more controllers

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's the only reason

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Party

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Party game

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How many, can four folks play simultaneously on that one?

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's pretty cool

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've still yet to play it

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I've already laid claim

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Alright

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, what pinball tables have been dominating your time lately?

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Twilight Zone, that game's a bitch

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you haven't really been playing the pinball game on 360

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The new downloadable one

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, Dan can play it, I don't care

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It kind of looks sucky to me

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The whole point of pinball to me

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The last good virtual pinball besides for Alien Crush and Devil's Crush

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Was, like, Revenge of the Gator on Game Boy

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Back in the day

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That game was awesome

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, Sonic Spinball, of course

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But that's not quite the same

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But, you know, Devil's Crush and Alien Crush are the pinnacle of video pinball

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Anything else is just a pale imitation

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to say that, for me, it's having the flippers and the noises and the ball

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And having my machine go Powerball and getting that ceramic ball

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That the magnets can't do crap to

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I love Twilight Zone

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I've also been playing Rocky and Bullwinkle

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I like the pinball FX, but, you know, I think I was getting into this last week

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Nothing is a replacement for the real thing, sadly

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Nothing at all

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You feel the machine move

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And that's, I think, the

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Not even Revenge of the Gator, sadly

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Not even Revenge of the Gator

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was good

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Finally got the damn systems to land with each other

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Apparently the problem was Crackdown

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because Crackdown is a little bitch and doesn't want to land with other systems

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Unless you do it its way

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So anyways

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I've been playing a little bit of Call of Duty 3

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And that was fun

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We landed together and had a little multiplayer game

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then once the Crackdown update came out

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
With the new download content

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That pretty much screwed any chances I had with playing anything else

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So I've been playing that

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And the download content is pretty awesome

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Especially the free-for-all pack

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Which is the free stuff that basically unlocks the keys to the city

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Which is basically a debug mode for the game

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can adjust the agility of your character

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can give yourself super agility to jump even higher

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Or run super fast and then super strength

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Plus you can spawn vehicles, spawn explosive barrels

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Have all weapons, unlimited ammo, god mode, that kind of stuff

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course none of that stuff counts if you're playing the actual game

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But it's just a little fun little mode to play with

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And you can do that in co-op

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then of course there's also new weapons and new vehicles with the paid one

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Including a spear gun

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can spear people in the head and stick them to the walls and stuff like that

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Which is kind of fun

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then they have like a dune buggy vehicle that you can spin around the air like crazy

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just a bunch of little fun stuff

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Plus now they have street racing in the game

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Which adds a little bit of, you know, kind of a little extra minigame in there

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But overall I think it's pretty awesome

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And then of course, you know, fuck

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Tomorrow we've got, you know, or I should say Monday

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
For those people listening on the podcast

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The Halo 3, er, no I'm sorry, not Monday, Wednesday

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The Halo 3 beta is going to be coming out, so

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A bunch of people on my friends list are already playing it

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We're just not special, nobody cares

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Because, you know, they had those preview events in Frisco and New York

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And they were giving out those codes to basically everybody that went to the event

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So there's a bunch of people on live already playing it

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But, you know, I don't care

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I know, I'm like, eh, it's a beta

258
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's not the real game

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And like, you know, the beta's going to have issues

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Especially with everybody hitting it at once

261
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think people are getting a little too excited about the Halo 3 beta

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If that makes sense

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like it's not the real game

264
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't know, I think Microsoft's pretty ballsy to be doing this to be honest

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Uh, they played Super Paper Mario some more

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
About halfway through the game now

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's still very easy, I don't know

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've had like no trouble getting through the game at all

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I don't know if it's just

270
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like even all the secret stuff and the puzzles are just so fucking easy to figure out

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But it's fun, you know, don't get me wrong

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a fun game

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I just, I would really like them to do a new Mario RPG

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because, you know, even if you kept the same graphic style as this game

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It could be so awesome

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's just very disappointing that they're not gonna

278
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Alright

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
DarkSakura, some comments from chatroom

280
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Toshin asked about Pokemon Pinball

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you ever play that one?

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Did you like that one?

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Barely

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was a good one, I liked it

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There was two of them if I remember right

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There was one for the old games and the one for the advanced games

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They did like two

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Dude, Epic Pinball

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
On the PC, yeah, Epic Pinball was pretty awesome

290
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I had another pinball simulator

291
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't remember the name of it

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Somebody had, I brought it up on a previous episode

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Somebody named it

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But there were some good PC pinball games too

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Epic Pinball, of course, being one

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Also looking at chatroom

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
RawstealUT says Halo 3 Beta

298
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The only reason people bought Crackdown

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That might be true, but they got a pretty decent game with it

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a fucking awesome game

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Even I like Crackdown

302
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's not usually my type of game, but I like it quite a bit

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I would have bought it even if it didn't have Halo 3 Beta in there

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There you go

305
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To be honest, I don't even know

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean, I may download it and might play it once

307
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't think I'm going to play it much more than that

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because I'm not really a huge Halo fan

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And as far as first-person shooters go

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It doesn't really make, it doesn't seem like

311
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That big of a difference in Halo 2

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's just like, eh, whatever

313
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to get fucking murdered by everybody on there anyway

314
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Because I suck at Halo like really bad

315
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want to know if there's any really really bad Halo players

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That are excited about the Halo 3 Beta

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Because we need to form a clan and just play with each other and suck together at Halo 3

318
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm pretty awful, I've only played Halo 2 like four times

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll play if you load me up on meclizine

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you have the Beta? Do you have Crackdown or anything?

321
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can you get the Beta?

322
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I got Crackdown

323
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, then you can get into the Beta

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So we'll play an OLR We Suck night or something

325
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But we only have a few weeks to do it, I think, so

326
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We'll see

327
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can still, by the way, I was at Best Buy the other day

328
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Randomly, and they still had Crackdown with the Halo 3 Beta in it

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So, you can still find copies of it

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So, get them soon if you want to get in

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, this has nothing to do with Halo, but I did have an announcement

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Um, probably in the next four months I'm going to be a published illustrator

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, how so?

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Um, I'm going to be doing flashcards of bones and muscles if everything works out

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
For my flash therapists

338
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That'll be fun

339
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So, are you going to autograph them at different places for our listeners?

340
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, but I'm going to take deep tissue massage

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's cool

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, good luck with that

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Um, my gaming week

344
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's see, I haven't really played video games this week

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
They're bad for you

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I've been trying to avoid video games

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Also, I don't eat at Wendy's anymore

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because they support the evil company that is Nintendo

349
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And, you know, this lawyer guy told me that was bad

350
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, kidding of course

351
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I had, all things considered, I actually had a pretty bad week personally this week

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But, Miklotov cheered me up, which was really cool, because he bought me this

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This Final Fantasy XII play arts

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And this is great radio, by the way, when I go like this in motion

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's something that listeners can't see

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I'm telling you, it's a Balthier figurine from Final Fantasy XII

357
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And Balthier is the sexy, sexy, sexy pirate from Final Fantasy XII

358
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And, like, the best reason to play that game is him and Fran

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because they have the best interactions and steal every scene

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, I love them

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And so I was very happy to get this figurine

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And it kind of made me go, damn, Final Fantasy XII was one of those games I started

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And just didn't finish because all the console launches were going on at that time

364
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I really need to go back now that

365
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I never even started it

366
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I need to play it, it's such an incredible game

367
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I need to finish it

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And the characters are so awesome, so there you go

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Um, let's see

370
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And, um, also I played World of Warcraft

371
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I got to level 51 because I don't have a life

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And, uh, then I played some Xbox Live

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I finally tried out Catan this week

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And, uh, because somebody had told me it was like Civilization

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Lies, lies, lies, lies

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Catan, I don't know, Catan didn't really do it for me

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I know there's a lot of people that are really into the strategy games

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And, you know, really got into Catan

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it just, it just wasn't the kind of game I was looking for on Xbox Live

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Um, and I hear it has some real crappy multiplayer

381
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That people are getting disconnected and all that stuff

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So, I don't know, I don't know

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Try out the demo, see if it's your type of thing

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's way more complicated than Uno, certainly

385
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But, what I do like about the game, what it does have going for it

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is because the game is a little more complicated

387
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You have to really kind of learn it and think

388
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's a much more, like, thinking type game

389
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Uh, the people that are playing it are pretty intelligent

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So if you do play it online, you don't get a lot of the

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
type people, you know, the people, that's what they say

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know, in their headsets on Xbox Live, so that's kind of

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Kind of, I guess, something the game has going for it

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Otherwise I've been playing a little more Pinball FX

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And, uh, Centipede and Millipede

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
For no good reason, other than I just really like retro games

399
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So I was playing, uh, Centipede and Millipede

400
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, and Double Dragon, I bought Double Dragon

401
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But, I was a little, well, it's not that bad

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But the problem is that I really remember the Nintendo one

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Much more, and there's big differences between the Nintendo one

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And the arcade one

405
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And namely that the arcade one was a lot harder

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And some of the, like, the moves aren't quite the same

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That they were in the Nintendo one

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, with the Nintendo one, you, um

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Gain these stars as your points went up

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And that allowed you to do more moves

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Like jump kick and punch people when they're on the ground

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And stuff, and it doesn't really work the same in the arcade

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Uh, version

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But I thought

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's the first port I've seen of an old arcade classic

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That wasn't done by that, what is it?

417
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Digital Eclipse, is that what they are?

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It was done by somebody else

419
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And so it was kind of refreshing to see that there's other companies

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Capable of porting over the old games

421
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They did a pretty decent job, the high def graphics are really cleaned up

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I mean, it looks nice for, you know, an arcade game that's 20 years old

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, it was alright, 5 bucks

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Not bad

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's it, that's my gaming week

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Miklotov, how about your gaming week?

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Um, I played WoW a couple times

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm level 56, so I have less of a life

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Um, I also had the sudden interest

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
To start playing Bust A Move 2 again

431
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Because I love that game

432
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I've been playing it like non-stop

433
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And there's not like anything new I can do in it

434
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Because I've already unlocked everybody, beaten it with every character

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Always get the upper path

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So, I don't know, it's just a little fun game to play I guess

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Been slacking on Pokemon

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Um, other than that

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't think there are any video games I play

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hey, keep your cell phone off

441
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Sorry, my cell phone went off

442
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
People forget I do this thing on Sunday night

443
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And try to call me

444
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes, and

445
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know, I guess

446
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Kind of gaming related

447
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think I'm leaving Konami by the 4th of June

448
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So hooray for me

450
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, I mean, you'll finally be able to talk openly

451
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
About what you do during the day, that'll be nice

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, I can talk about it right now

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I play Bust A Move 2 all day

454
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's pretty much what I do

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't care

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Alright, well there you go

457
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There's no other games you've been working on by chance?

458
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sometimes I play Dance Summit

459
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I kind of switch it out between the two

460
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Bring that over, because I miss that game

461
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay, I'll bring it next time, it's at work right now

462
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I haven't played that in forever

463
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And I've been trying to find a copy of it to buy

464
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Good luck with that

465
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I fell on eBay for 40 bucks

466
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, that's really cheap, that's definitely worth it

467
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm looking actually right now to find a copy of Bust A Groove 1 US

468
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you want to borrow mine?

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, I want one to own

470
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I could probably sell you mine, because I have the Japanese ones

471
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh really?

472
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
While you guys barter and trade over there

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Jvmon says in chat

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If Bust A Move 2 is on the Playstation 3 network

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That would sell me a PS3

476
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It would sell me one too

477
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Or, you know what, if Squeenix decided to

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Ever revisit that series

479
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't care if they put a Final Fantasy

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Character in it to ruin the game

481
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I would still buy another one

482
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I keep forgetting it was an Enix game

483
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You don't think of that

484
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You think of Squeenix, you think, oh, roleplaying games, roleplaying games

485
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They don't do really anything else

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I knew of Dragon Warrior, Quest, whatever

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I used to frequent the Enix boards

488
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And I only hung out at the Bust A Groove section

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's all I knew Enix for

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
For the longest time

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Well, I remember some of their old

492
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Super Nintendo roleplaying games

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Like Illusion of Gaia, Soul Blazer

494
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Those were good games

495
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
An Act Racer was an Enix game, right?

496
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I believe so

497
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then Square ruined them

498
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
SJ100Matt asks, what?

499
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No Sweet Coden for you, Miklotov?

500
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
To play?

501
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, because

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I guess, you know

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I still care about the series

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But after working on it

505
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I kind of know everything that happens

506
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In the last game

507
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I never even finished playing it

508
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So it's like, there's nothing to surprise me

509
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is it kind of one of those things

510
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where like, you know

511
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Maybe you're really excited

512
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
For many years to work at

513
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know, like let's say a

514
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Taco Bell

515
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Nobody's excited to work at Taco Bell

516
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What the hell's wrong with you?

517
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
People are excited to work

518
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
At Great America, a theme park

519
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
People are really excited, they want to work at a theme park

520
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then when they get there and realize how everything

521
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Really works, how the rides all function

522
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And how the magic happens

523
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Everything kind of loses its magic

524
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Is it kind of like that, where now that you've been on the inside

525
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There's no more?

526
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No, it wasn't even that

527
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's just office politics go down

528
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And then things completely change

529
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And that's when it gets bad

530
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Drama?

531
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Drama, yes

532
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Alright

533
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well speaking of drama

534
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I want to get into some housekeeping this week

535
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And this is a little atypical housekeeping for us

536
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But we were asked by our buddies

537
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Over at AllGames.com to relay the following announcement

538
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Which is cool because

539
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They have a live show on Monday nights

540
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
As well as Tuesday mornings over on AllGames.com

541
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If you miss the live show on Sunday

542
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can always hear part A and B together on AllGames

543
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And one of their other shows

544
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The video game show, they had a little bit of drama

545
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
A couple weeks ago

546
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And to make a long story short

547
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
A lot of folks think

548
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That the show is gone

549
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because of something that someone on the show did

550
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
To the website and everything

551
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And he's since apologized for it

552
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I saw the apology and was basically like

553
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I suck and I'm sorry

554
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But a lot of people still think the show is gone

555
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So AllGames is asking us

556
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
To put forward the video game show

557
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
They are not gone

558
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They are still around

559
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And they are now at www.videogameshow.net

560
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So we know those of you who listen to Orange on the Radio

561
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Probably listen to other independent video game podcasts

562
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And we encourage you to do so

563
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So if you're a fan of Chris Haas and Rich Bergen

564
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They are now over at videogameshow.net

565
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Check it out

566
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Their show is moved over there

567
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Also in housekeeping tonight

568
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I wanted to mention real quick

569
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Of course our FONOMAY appearance

570
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Is going to be happening over Memorial Day weekend in San Jose

571
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Saturday at 2pm

572
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We hope to see you guys there

573
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Speaking of FONOMAY conventions

574
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We're going to talk about ACEN a little later tonight

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Can I just say ACEN and the same thing?

576
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What if I don't want to say ACEN?

577
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then no one will know what you're talking about

578
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Jerks

579
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Regardless, Chris called us

580
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And we're going to hear her message a little bit later

581
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you to folks who've reviewed us recently

582
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
In iTunes

583
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
With 5 star reviews

584
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I was looking at some of the more recent reviewers

585
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And there's some awesome reviews

586
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Some folks actually using some of the gags from our previous weeks

587
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Somebody left a review that says

588
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
OLR the L stands for suck

589
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That was pretty awesome

590
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We just really want to thank you guys

591
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because we know probably every podcast you listen to

592
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Says go vote for us here

593
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Go leave us a review on iTunes

594
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But it really really really does help

595
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
When you get more reviews

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It gets you that exposure

597
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When we first started the video game podcasting thing

598
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
A couple years ago

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There was like maybe 10 shows at the most

600
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So there wasn't much to pick from

601
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's how a lot of folks found us

602
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But now there's like 10,000 video game podcasts

603
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Out there

604
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Because every freaking magazine has their own podcast

605
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And every blog has a podcast

606
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's really tough to stand out sometimes

607
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So we just kind of keep doing our thing

608
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And hope people enjoy what we're doing

609
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But we appreciate it when you guys help get the word out

610
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So tell a friend

611
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Leave us a review on iTunes

612
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We do appreciate all of that

613
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Alright enough blabber

614
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's get into the gaming news

615
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Who's going to start us off tonight?

616
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes there's been a lot of news this week

617
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because everyone seems to think it's like E3 all over again

618
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Because I mean hey about a year from now

619
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Or a year ago we were pretty much at E3

620
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I was just thinking of that

621
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Bobby Blackwolf speaking of all games

622
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Bobby Blackwolf had his birthday

623
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think it was yesterday

624
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Happy birthday Bobby by the way

625
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And that reminded me that

626
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He had his birthday at E3 last year

627
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So that was making me go

628
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Shit it's been one year since E3

629
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And it was kind of sad because E3

630
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sucks now

631
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The E3 rave as we've been calling it

632
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Because they're going to take you to an abandoned airport hangar

633
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And unmarked vehicles will come pick you up

634
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And escort you there

635
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't worry though G4 will be there as their commercials say

636
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Whoopee

637
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
One more reason I don't want to go to E3

638
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But I do because

639
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
All the cool kids go

640
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Except for G4

641
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well Jamie

642
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Our very own

643
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Jamie has an invite

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And is basically saying

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You know what I'm not going I'm too cool for this

646
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't say I wasn't going I just said I can't afford to go

647
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Unless

648
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Like the heavens open up and

649
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
God gives me money

650
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We'll see

651
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I have to get time off work too

652
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I think you're just too cool for E3

653
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I know

654
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So because of that

655
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
There's been a whole bunch of announcements this week

656
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Including some from Square Enix's

657
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Own little party that they had

658
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Celebrating the Final Fantasy

659
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
20th anniversary

660
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And with that

661
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
A bunch of announcements for Final Fantasy games

662
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And what not

663
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Including a remake of Final Fantasy 4

664
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes much like there was for the

665
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Final Fantasy 3

666
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Looks pretty sexy from what I've seen so far

667
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Completely redone all 3D

668
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Hooray

669
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't know how I feel about this

670
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Final Fantasy 4 is my favorite

671
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Final Fantasy game

672
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Mostly because it was the first one I ever really got into

673
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And beat

674
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So you know it's kind of weird to watch

675
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That get changed into this whole new

676
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
3D thing

677
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think it looks good

678
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I probably love it but you know

679
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's like somebody is messing with your baby

680
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I hope it just doesn't turn out as bad

681
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
As Final Fantasy 3 did for the DS

682
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because that was no fun

683
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You didn't like it? No

684
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But did you like the original Nintendo one? Did you ever play it?

685
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Like translation or anything?

686
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Maybe I think so a little bit

687
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The third one was great

688
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's kind of slow

689
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I had fun with it

690
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's not slow in the story sense even though it is

691
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Everything just seems really slow

692
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In that game

693
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't know it's not that fun

694
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well that's your opinion

695
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I think it looks good

696
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think they needed to be doing

697
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
More of this on the PSP

698
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's for sure because

699
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's kind of lacking

700
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But yeah keep it up

701
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I want to see Final Fantasy 6 redone

702
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
As well

703
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm looking at chat for comments here

704
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
JVMON agrees with you Miklotov

705
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Final Fantasy 3 for the DS was boring as hell

706
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I think Final Fantasy 3 DS was good

707
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
RasteelUT says Final Fantasy 4 DS was uber milkage

708
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's see

709
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SSJ100Matt says

710
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I really want them to remake 5

711
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sephiroth1215 says 4

712
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What was so great about 4? 5 and 6 are so much better

713
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I can't explain the allure of 4

714
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Sephiroth1215

715
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Other than really the fact that it's the first one

716
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I really played

717
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I played the original one on NES

718
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
This is the first one I played all the way through

719
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And it really just had a moving story

720
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think Final Fantasy 4 was really the first one

721
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For me

722
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Since we kind of missed most of the NES ones over here

723
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I think it was really the first one for me

724
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That had such a moving story

725
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And the orchestral

726
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The spoonie bard

727
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah and it had the spoonie bard

728
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And dear god

729
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mark my words

730
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If Final Fantasy 4 DS did not keep the spoonie bard lingo intact

731
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Instant fail

732
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
On Square Enix's part

733
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I will pick it

734
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Screw that up

735
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Give me my spoonie bard

736
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It looks nice

737
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
At least it's not just a straight port

738
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
At least they're doing something with it

739
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So

740
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That's good

741
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll give them that

742
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm actually thinking I'm going to get that one

743
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because it was one of my favorites too

744
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But I would prefer 5

745
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The reason I liked 3 was because of the job change system

746
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Gamezoo time

747
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I was going to say if this sells well

748
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What happens next right?

749
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's hope so

750
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well at any rate there's some good news for our UK listeners

751
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
For anyone who is interested in SNK vs Capcom

752
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Card fighters

753
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
For the DS

754
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The little problem that was going on in the 9th level of the game

755
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We were having this issue

756
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Where if you

757
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Fought the opponent

758
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
John you didn't get the card so you couldn't finish the game

759
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That is being

760
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Corrected for the UK release

761
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And also

762
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
For our American listeners

763
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
SNK has offered

764
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
To replace all of your copies

765
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It does though take up to 6 weeks

766
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
For your replacements to arrive

767
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Aw we gotta actually do something

768
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Instead of just re-releasing

769
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Stuff what the hell

770
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Making us work now? Seriously

771
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm actually a victim

772
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Of that

773
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Not that I like card games or anything

774
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I only bought it because it has Phoenix Wright stuff in it

775
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So I'm not actually going to get rid of my copy

776
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Because it's only on the new game plus

777
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So take that

778
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SNK

779
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You're not getting my cartridge back

780
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
To be fair though they do have a new

781
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Arcade game that's going to be

782
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Coming out

783
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Not that we really care

784
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
What Capcom vs SNK?

785
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No SNK has actually got a new

786
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
King of Fighters

787
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Sorry I lost interest in that series a while ago

788
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I liked Capcom vs SNK

789
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That was kinda cool

790
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
A lot of fighting games but I liked Capcom vs SNK

791
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
My vs Chun-Li awesome

792
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Epic

793
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well anyway speaking of epic

794
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Loki and I were addicted

795
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
For many many many many

796
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Many years to Final Fantasy 11

797
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Actually not that many years

798
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh yeah Miklata was addicted too

799
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And it's your fucking fault

800
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I went back like 2

801
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
How long ago was it? About 6 months ago?

802
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That we went back when the 360 version came out?

803
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah and we played for like maybe a month

804
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You bastard

805
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Well Final Fantasy 11 fans

806
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Those of you that have stuck with the game

807
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You troopers you

808
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Good news for you guys there's a brand new add on coming out

809
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's Wings of the Goddess

810
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This was announced at

811
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Square Enix Party 07

812
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And there was a little trailer that went with it

813
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I watched the trailer

814
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I was not impressed because half of it was recycled footage

815
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
From all the expansions that are already out

816
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Like the original opening movie

817
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's like 5 years old right?

818
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And then the rest of it

819
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I get was pretty much like

820
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Miklata picked this out I didn't even pick this out

821
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This looks the exact same as the areas that are already in there

822
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Miklata was like oh yeah it's the areas

823
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Like before

824
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The game takes place because I guess this

825
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Wings of the Goddess is some type of like

826
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Prequel-ish thing or a time travel thing

827
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Where you go back to the past

828
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's basically going back to the actual

829
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Was it the war or whatever that they had?

830
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The Crystal War

831
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You know this is just an

832
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Excuse to introduce a time mage class

833
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's what I think

834
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Interesting theory. Are you going to go back to the game?

835
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
When this comes out?

836
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Probably for a week

837
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Well I went back every other time a new expansion came out

838
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm not going to stop

839
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's just I won't play it much and then I'll be like

840
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm too low of a level to do anything in the new area

841
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I just want to go get the new job classes

842
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Just hold off

843
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They're making a new fucking role playing game anyways

844
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Seriously

845
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Just as a friendly reminder

846
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'd like to go around and remind everybody

847
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why we quit Final Fantasy 11

848
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Because there's probably some fans of the game who listen to the program going

849
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You guys are so mean to Final Fantasy 11

850
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I play this game

851
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay we played this game between us all

852
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We probably played this game for many many many years

853
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Jamie why'd you quit?

854
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I played for six months

855
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And it was because the white mage is the party bitch

856
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I like playing white mages

857
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So fuck everybody in that game

858
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Loki why'd you quit?

859
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I quit because I had a girlfriend and a wife

860
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That became a wife

861
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
At the same time?

862
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's amazing

863
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No that would not be fun

864
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So I couldn't play it as often as I'd like to

865
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And there was a big six month span

866
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Where I didn't actually play at all

867
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And it's just paying that kind of money each month

868
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Even though it's 13 or 12 bucks

869
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's still money that's being wasted

870
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I mean hell

871
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If I was still single

872
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Not seeing anybody

873
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'd probably still be playing it

874
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because it was fun

875
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I had fun with it

876
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But it's just you get to a point though

877
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You work so hard in the game

878
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then it's just

879
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You know you get in stupid parties

880
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And the whole fact that you have to party with people

881
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Really kind of sucks

882
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I know it's an MMO

883
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And you're supposed to party with people

884
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But the fact that they force you to party

885
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
When you can't find a party

886
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I mean that kind of fucking sucks

887
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You go on the play

888
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And you can't do anything

889
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So that was lame

890
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well the main reason probably

891
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Is that whole XP loss

892
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
When you die

893
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But most recently it was because

894
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Getting blue mage spells sucked sometimes

895
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And me and

896
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
One of my friends in the game

897
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We spent all night

898
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hours and hours trying to get this one spell

899
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Never got it

900
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So I was like screw this game I'm done

901
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And the reason I did it was because

902
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Squeenix did nothing about the gold farmers

903
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
For far too long and the economy in that game

904
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Was fucked

905
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And people were telling me to actually buy

906
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Gill and I was like that's where I draw the line

907
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is spending that type of real world money

908
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
To buy fake money online

909
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Just because you know

910
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
These people who are being paid

911
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
To sit here and camp these monsters

912
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Are getting stuff before me

913
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
People were so elitist that if you didn't have these items

914
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's like you suck in parties

915
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Even I had my elitist

916
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Plus one everything

917
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fucking bard character

918
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And I got nothing

919
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No parties out of that

920
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Alright so there you go

921
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Plus everything charisma and all that stuff

922
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
What?

923
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I was just going to say it's like

924
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They want you to party in that game

925
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But people have in their minds

926
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The ideal party setup and if you don't fit that

927
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Your job or anything then what's the point

928
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Because you're not going to get a party

929
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
At least back when I played

930
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And you know your job is worthless then

931
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Heaven help you if you're a paladin who doesn't sub warrior

932
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah you have to have the right sub jobs too

933
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So boo on you

934
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Final Fantasy 11 boo

935
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Let's see looking at the

936
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Comments in the chat room here

937
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
RawsteelUT says healers are the party bitch

938
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In every MMO

939
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Let's see

940
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Sephiroth1215 says I never liked Final Fantasy 11

941
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But it does get addicting

942
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Somehow when I stopped myself before I was an addict

943
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ShadowFitSlayer says

944
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Tetra Master is greater than Final Fantasy 11

945
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Boo

946
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Tetra Master was kind of fun

947
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
No it wasn't

948
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I played my free month of Tetra Master

949
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I had fun

950
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It was fun for about 5 minutes

951
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's a very good idea actually Loki

952
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Loki says put that on Xbox Live Arcade

953
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes and no one will play it

954
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Shut up I play it once

955
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
New story please

956
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Anyways

957
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't have time for me to read but

958
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Parasite Eve 3 is apparently going to be

959
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
a cell phone title

960
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You know obviously in Japan

961
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
where cell phone titles are more popular

962
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You know it's not a big surprise

963
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But over here though

964
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I would hope that maybe a next gen version

965
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
of Parasite Eve because I like that series

966
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I thought it was pretty good

967
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Although then again I never did play the second one

968
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But this was announced over at the Square Enix party

969
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't know

970
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Kind of disappointing

971
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Hopefully you know

972
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You know what they kind of tend to do with these kind of things

973
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
They'll port it over to the PSP or something

974
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Later on

975
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Here's hoping for a PSP version

976
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
PSP version would be hot though

977
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
RosteelUT who I'm quoting a lot tonight

978
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But he's saying a lot of stuff here

979
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm not going to tell him to shut up

980
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He's saying a lot of good stuff here

981
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Heartbreaks as he hears

982
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
PE3 is a cell phone title

983
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm sure that's how most people feel

984
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
About that news

985
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Because everybody was kind of waiting for

986
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Parasite Eve 3 on Playstation 2

987
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And then it just never happened

988
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Well at least you know

989
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Maybe they translate the book for us

990
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Some of us who wants to read it can

991
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I saw the Japanese movie and that was awesome

992
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I've got it somewhere but my friends read the book

993
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like five times and keep telling me how awesome the book is

994
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Ew, reading

995
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Shut up

996
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I like the book so I get the good story

997
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Anyway

998
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Well there is actually a bit of happiness

999
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That came out of the Tokyo Game Show

1000
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And that was an announcement for

1001
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Kingdom Hearts

1002
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Well it's going to happen at the Tokyo Game Show

1003
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Still a few months off

1004
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Well that's what I said isn't it

1005
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No you said some announcement

1006
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's coming out of the

1007
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Ok whatever

1008
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Pardon my context

1009
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Anyway it's going to be announced

1010
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
At the Tokyo Game Show

1011
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So

1012
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm just sick of announcements of announcements

1013
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We have an announcement to make

1014
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We're going to make an announcement later

1015
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I completely refrain from here on out

1016
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
To make announcements of announcements

1017
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You know what

1018
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It is an amazing trend within this industry

1019
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Is that hey stay tuned

1020
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
For a really big announcement about

1021
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Something we're going to be announcing very soon

1022
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's like

1023
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Shut up and make a game

1024
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Shut up and go make the game

1025
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Anyhow

1026
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Any hopes for what they're going to be announcing

1027
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Dark Sakura

1028
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 maybe

1029
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Or do you think it's going to be like

1030
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Kingdom Hearts MMO

1031
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
There's not going to be any way they can do a

1032
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Kingdom Hearts MMO

1033
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Kingdom Hearts minus Disney

1034
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then it won't be good

1035
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Let's see

1036
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hostile1 in chat says

1037
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Please please please

1038
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Kingdom Hearts for 360

1039
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Save me the $600 for the Playstation 3

1040
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Except it's minus Disney and with

1041
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Hanna-Barbera instead

1042
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yabba Dabba Doo

1043
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That'd be so horrible

1044
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh hooray I have Quick Draw McGraw in my party

1045
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And Droopy Dog

1046
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh but

1047
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Wow

1048
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Hey but Jetsons world would be pretty awesome

1049
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What do you think of that Jamie

1050
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Kingdom Hearts with minus the Disney plus

1051
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The Hanna-Barbera

1052
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They should do

1053
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Plus Warner Brothers

1054
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So we get the Animaniacs

1055
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Was that Johnny Quest 2?

1056
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah that was Hanna-Barbera

1057
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Was it?

1058
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But then again that would also give us C-Lab

1059
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It could be worse they could do Kingdom Hearts 3 with

1060
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Adult Swim

1061
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I guess that's true

1062
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Kingdom Hearts with Robot Chicken

1063
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Let's talk about some games we know are coming out

1064
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We're going to do some release dates real quick here

1065
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm going to start off with Japanese

1066
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
release dates and again it's been kind of

1067
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
a slow month over there in Japan

1068
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
There's not a whole lot of stuff coming out

1069
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But on the Nintendo Wii they are getting Marvel

1070
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ultimate Alliance in Japan

1071
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So the Japanese version coming out from

1072
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Inter Channel

1073
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Also they're getting a game on the 17th of May called

1074
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Detective Conan

1075
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Suyoku no Gensu

1076
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You're yaying that I don't even know what the hell that is

1077
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Give me the top microphone

1078
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
There is this show

1079
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
on Adult Swim a long time ago

1080
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Case closed

1081
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's just like this little kid who solves

1082
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Detective Conan

1083
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Here it was case closed

1084
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He just solves

1085
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
crimes and stuff and if you like detective

1086
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
things it's really cool

1087
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I like detective things so it's pretty awesome

1088
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I want that to come out here even though I'm not a fan

1089
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
of anime whatsoever

1090
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
On the Playstation 2

1091
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you get Shining Wind from Sega

1092
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
on the 17th as well as Odin Sphere

1093
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
coming out over there

1094
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I think that's about it

1095
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Let me see if there's anything on the DS real quick

1096
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You do get

1097
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Custom Beat Battle

1098
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Draglade is coming out

1099
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh and then of course Oh and Dan 2

1100
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I suppose that's important is also coming out this week

1101
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
in Japan

1102
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Elite Beat Agents some of you know that here

1103
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You pre-ordered that didn't you Shane?

1104
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You pre-ordered it and you got

1105
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
next day shipping or something right?

1106
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
My shipping costs about the same as the game

1107
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
because I care that much

1108
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
to have it that early

1109
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I've watched that stupid demo that they put up on

1110
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
YouTube from the download kiosks

1111
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
in Japan a million times

1112
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and I watched the TouchDS

1113
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
.JP videos a million times

1114
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm so excited

1115
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I don't know any of the songs except for one

1116
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So you spent like $80 on this game?

1117
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I would say closer to $90

1118
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Wow

1119
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I do want to say actually

1120
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
one other game because I actually went and looked at the

1121
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000

1123
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
in Korea but they are getting a game

1125
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that's worth mentioning here this is my favorite title

1126
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
of the week an adventure game for the PC called

1127
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000

1135
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000

1136
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
looks like fun I want to play Princess Maker

1137
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
they do make good MMOs

1138
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I can't knock the Korean developers

1139
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
there you go

1140
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
okay dancing games

1141
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
well didn't Korea

1142
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
wasn't the easy to

1143
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
DJ series out of

1144
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Korea? yeah it was all Korea

1145
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
okay well then they fucking rock music games too

1146
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
anyways the US

1147
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
it's not entirely exciting but there are

1148
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
some things coming out

1149
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
of the non-exciting

1150
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
like the third is finally making its way out

1151
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
same day as the movie

1152
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
hurrah

1153
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but if you're not into really crappy games

1154
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
then you might be interested in Dawn of Mana

1155
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
which is going to be coming out this week on Playstation 2

1156
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that one looks pretty good

1157
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
that's happy

1158
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
also if you're interested in SNK

1159
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
re-releases Art of Fighting

1160
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Anthology will be making its way out

1161
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
on the PS2 luckily though

1162
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it's only $14.99

1163
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
so it's a chibi

1164
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
it's a mana game on Playstation 1

1165
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Secret of Mana?

1166
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Legend of Mana is one of the most disappointing

1167
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
games I've ever played in my entire fucking life

1168
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
try playing it in Japanese

1169
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
oh that's just salt in the wound

1170
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
right there cause that game

1171
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm sorry it sucked

1172
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it wasn't, if they would go back

1173
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
okay what you should do

1174
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
get an emulator and play the translation

1175
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
of Seiken Densetsu 3

1176
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
it's fucking beautiful

1177
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
we need to have a game be like that

1178
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
virtual console, hello maybe someday

1179
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
but yeah I'm just saying that cause

1180
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Dawn of Mana, I don't know

1181
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
approach with caution

1182
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
if you haven't bought Marvel Ultimate Alliance yet

1183
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
on the 360

1184
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and you're thinking about doing it

1185
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
you definitely want to pick up Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold

1186
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
which is coming out this week as well

1187
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
it's basically the same game

1188
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
with the download codes for the extra characters

1189
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
so that's pretty awesome

1190
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Innocent Life

1191
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
a futuristic harvest moon

1192
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
PSP this week

1193
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
don't let that fool you it's exactly the same damn game

1194
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
all over again

1195
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and let's see here

1196
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Etrion Odyssey

1197
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
some RPG game coming out on

1198
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the DS and then

1199
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
of course if you're a baseball fan

1200
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
MLB 07 the show on Playstation 3

1201
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and then finally the rounded up

1202
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
really strange game Touch the Dead

1203
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and that's coming out on the DS

1204
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
think House of the Dead on the DS

1205
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I want to touch the dead

1206
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
that sounds kind of kinky

1207
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and of course

1208
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
last few things here

1209
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I was going to say on PC

1210
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
is there anything interesting coming out

1211
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Resident Evil 4 is coming out on PC I guess

1212
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
or doing a re-release of that

1213
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Nanny Mania

1214
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Nanny Mania?

1215
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Nanny Mania

1216
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
is that like Diner Dash but with babies?

1217
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't know but

1218
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Nanny Mania

1219
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
you know what that has me thinking of

1220
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
mama mama mama mama mama

1221
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I love that stage

1222
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
it makes me think of Super Nanny

1223
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
on TV or Nanny

1224
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
911 whatever those shows are

1225
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and then I was going to say

1226
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Naruto Ninja Council 3

1227
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
is also coming out on the DS

1228
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't know how many Naruto fans are out there

1229
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
too damn many

1230
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the Rob D in chat is picking a fight

1231
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
with Loki here why does Loki hate

1232
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
sequels?

1233
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and why is he not hating on MLB

1234
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Super 7 which is a giant rehash itself

1235
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I didn't say I didn't hate it

1236
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I said if you like

1237
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
baseball what was I

1238
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
hating on sequels for I said Shrek the 3rd

1239
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
sucks I mean

1240
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Shrek the 3rd I mean obviously the games gonna suck

1241
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
if it's Shrek the 1st it's still gonna suck

1242
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
no we want more Shrek

1243
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
go karts

1244
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I wasn't hating on anything

1245
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
when did I hate on a sequel when I was talking there

1246
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
there wasn't any sequels I hated on

1247
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
except for oh Art of Fighting Anthology

1248
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
because that's not a sequel it's just a re-release

1249
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
the Rob D admits I'm mostly stirring up trouble

1250
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
drama

1251
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
well done drama

1252
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000

1263
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and on Playstation 2 we have SoCom

1264
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
US Navy Seals Combined Assault

1265
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and that's it

1266
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
awesome

1267
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
alright well let's get back into

1268
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
some news talking about upcoming

1269
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
releases Rock Band

1270
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
is rumored to be coming out on the Wii

1271
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
lots and lots of rumors going

1272
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
around about this this week

1273
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
apparently it's because

1274
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
there's focus group testing going

1275
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
on they've been testing with focus group

1276
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
MTV's been asking about

1277
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
packaging and pricing like how much would you pay

1278
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and then the Wii was also

1279
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
one of the systems that they

1280
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
said the game would be coming on of course Rock Band

1281
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
coming from Harmonics who made

1282
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Guitar Hero but this is a joint

1283
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
venture between Harmonics, EA and

1284
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
MTV well of course MTV

1285
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
owns Harmonics so you gotta state that

1286
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
but that's of course going to be the game that has not

1287
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
just the guitar but the drums and the singing

1288
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
all in one so that should be very interesting

1289
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
by the way during this

1290
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
focus group the group was asked

1291
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
what they would think about a bundle including

1292
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the game, a wireless guitar, a drum kit

1293
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and a microphone for

1294
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
$200 didn't

1295
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
go over well with the group

1296
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
$175 went over a little

1297
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
better $150 was when everybody

1298
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
in the group got on board but that would be

1299
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
pushing it for all it's stuff

1300
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
it's supposed to be an actual drum set

1301
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
can you imagine how big this box

1302
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
is gonna be?

1303
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
where the fuck am I gonna put that in my shit hole apartment?

1304
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I mean I'm just

1305
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
what college dorm is

1306
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
gonna fit that?

1307
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
it's a cool concept for a game but you know

1308
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
this is why they didn't have any arcade style

1309
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
you know drum mania controllers

1310
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
or anything you know they left it at

1311
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Guitar Freaks

1312
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
said okay those controllers are big enough

1313
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
we don't need to bring the huge fucking drum set

1314
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
do you remember when we were younger

1315
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
like in junior high or whatever

1316
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
they had those drum sticks

1317
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that you could just hit anywhere in the air

1318
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
they had a little speaker I think they were called

1319
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
like hit sticks or something and you could play the drums

1320
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and the little crappy speaker that was attached

1321
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to them would go

1322
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
like you could just wave the drums in the air

1323
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
there was like $10 that could be the controller

1324
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
you remember back in the day when I had the actual

1325
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
cabinet and everything and I was talking

1326
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
about how I was gonna make actual drums

1327
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
you know a drum set for guitar

1328
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
or Guitar Freaks drum mania

1329
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
yeah I'm glad I didn't do that

1330
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
for real Blaze says

1331
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
those still exist I'll be damned

1332
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
DJ Dark Knight says I had one

1333
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I think a lot of us had one

1334
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
those things are pretty rad

1335
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
did you have one of those Mikl Tov I see you nodding your head over there

1336
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
my cousins didn't

1337
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I wasn't allowed to play with them because I was really little

1338
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
but yeah

1339
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
they were really awesome looking at the time

1340
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and kind of stupid though now that I think about it

1341
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
they were pretty stupid in retrospect

1342
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
but I'm thinking those were cheap

1343
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
and they didn't take up any space at all

1344
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it's pretty awesome

1345
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I don't know I think this is getting a little crazy

1346
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
with your obsession with music games

1347
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I mean the thing with Guitar

1348
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Hero I mean

1349
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
$80 I almost said Guitar Freaks

1350
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
$80 is a really

1351
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
big investment I think for a game

1352
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and a $200

1353
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
investment in a game you better hope this game

1354
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
is fucking awesome because otherwise

1355
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
you're gonna be fucking pissed

1356
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
so I mean besides

1357
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
if you wanna buy you know Rock Band

1358
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
boy do we have a game for you the Eye of Judgment

1359
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
it too will have a lot of

1360
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
extra crap and it'll probably be expensive

1361
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
great

1362
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
anyways another game though

1363
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that's scheduled to be coming or rumored to be coming

1364
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
out on another system would be

1365
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Table Tennis for the Wii Rockstar's Table Tennis

1366
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
that is of course it's gonna be

1367
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
scaled down graphically but hey

1368
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
it's Table Tennis on the Wii

1369
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
because everybody likes Wii Tennis so

1370
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
of course this is gonna do well

1371
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
right

1372
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
how would that work because I seem to remember

1373
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I mean the gameplay mechanics would have to be

1374
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
completely different if I'm not

1375
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
mistaking well maybe not

1376
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
because I seem to remember I haven't played Table Tennis

1377
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
in a while but I seem to remember like you had to

1378
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
look very carefully at the ball

1379
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to see what color it was glowing

1380
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
cause that was showing you the type of spin that was on

1381
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the ball and that was very important for

1382
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
how you could respond to that

1383
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
better you know defeat your opponent

1384
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
was to you know counter with the appropriate

1385
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
type of spin how would you do that with the

1386
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Wiimote would you just have to use the 1 and 2 buttons or

1387
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
the D-pad or something I don't know

1388
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
here's what I've been thinking

1389
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
people think because

1390
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
people liked Wii Sports cause it was a

1391
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
packing title and everybody loves the games that came

1392
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
with it and stuff that

1393
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
people would want to buy a game that does

1394
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
exactly the same thing for more money

1395
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that's why I didn't understand I mean

1396
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Tennis itself yeah it was fun

1397
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
you know bringing it out and people

1398
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
come over and stuff like that I wouldn't buy a

1399
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Tennis game though just because I like playing

1400
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Wii Tennis but like fuck that shit I've got

1401
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
a free game right here why would I buy another game

1402
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm reading chat room and there's some

1403
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
comments on the previous story about Rock Band

1404
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
GS68 wrote in all

1405
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
caps Drummania is a blatant

1406
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
rip off of Rock Band with crappy

1407
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Jap Techno and timing judgments and

1408
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
cheats aka speed mods

1409
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
you know and that's exactly how

1410
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
X-Play will probably review it if the

1411
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
game comes out next year from Konami for whatever

1412
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
crazy reason

1413
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
although they'll say that it came out they'll acknowledge

1414
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the fact that it came out but they'll say that

1415
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
it's improved on it because this actually

1416
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
teaches you how to play drums

1417
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
to be honest though out of all the Bomani

1418
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
series I think that's the only one that taught you how to do

1419
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
something you know

1420
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it was pretty much closest to

1421
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Keyboardmania you could actually take

1422
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
the real version in Keyboardmania

1423
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
play them on a real keyboard and it would sound very similar

1424
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
very similar

1425
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
unless you played them easy like I did

1426
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
well then you'd get something that sounded

1427
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
kind of close

1428
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
well I mean still though those games

1429
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
it was pretty good it's like I saw you know for example

1430
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Lankystyle you know I saw him

1431
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
start off on you know that I don't know if he was a drummer

1432
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
beforehand but you know he got

1433
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
pretty good by the end I mean and I've seen people

1434
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
that just start playing Drummania and then you know you see

1435
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
them about a year later they're just

1436
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
busting out like a real drummer so I don't know

1437
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
it does well and I've learned this

1438
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
as a musician that half of playing

1439
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
is you know the more you do it

1440
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
it comes to a point where

1441
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
you're you build the instinct

1442
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
for it your hands will know what to do

1443
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
you know that's what got me through

1444
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
through band is that after a while

1445
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
you train yourself to know how to do these

1446
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
things so you know it's the same thing

1447
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
JVMON has another interesting point in chat

1448
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
ParaparaParadise taught Parapara

1449
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
dancing sorta

1450
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
but I remember when that game first

1451
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
came out and people over here didn't know that it was

1452
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
based off like the Japanese thing like people

1453
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
used to rave on that like remember that one guy who used to do

1454
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
all his like crazy rave dancing

1455
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that was funny

1456
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I'm gonna hang my head down now

1457
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
did you do that too?

1458
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
yes with your glow sticks

1459
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
no

1460
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
but I remember we'd get everybody

1461
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
shadowing and that was great

1462
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
especially when we ate the sign that said no shadowing

1463
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I wondered if it did that

1464
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
that's right Golfland dared

1465
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
to put a sign on the machine that said no

1466
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
shadowing and we got a picture

1467
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
of somebody eating it Rick ate it

1468
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
we got a guy we said

1469
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
this rule sucks and we

1470
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
dared Rick to eat the sign so he did

1471
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
he tore the sign off the machine and I'm not

1472
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
kidding he fucking ate it

1473
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
good times

1474
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and then we all shadowed

1475
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
in defiance of Golfland's

1476
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
neo-nazi policies

1477
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
in Rick's defense I mean this is

1478
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the guy that didn't have like the challenges that they would

1479
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
do where they would like either

1480
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't remember if they sniffed a whole bunch of

1481
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
cinnamon or ate a whole bunch of cinnamon

1482
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
some weird shit like that drinking a gallon

1483
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
of milk you know that kind of weird crazy

1484
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
shit so

1485
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
GS68

1486
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
has a great idea for a macro

1487
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
if I could find that picture I know there's a

1488
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
picture that exists with Rick with half

1489
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
a sign in his mouth

1490
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I made you a sign but I eat it

1491
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
cat macro that's beautiful

1492
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
winner GS68

1493
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
chatter of the evening congratulations

1494
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
yeah you win a no prize

1495
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
so I've got some fun news

1496
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
you know one of my favorite games ever

1497
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
is Soul Calibur right and I've told you

1498
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
about Rod Calibur haven't I

1499
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
using the fishing thing when you play it on Dreamcast

1500
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
use the fishing rod to play Soul Calibur it's

1501
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
hilarious I've also tried doing it with the

1502
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Dreamcast dance pads and the only

1503
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
analog on there is the Konami symbol

1504
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
but Rod Calibur

1505
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
is the most fun I always thought Rod Calibur

1506
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
was a different game I played with my Rod

1507
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
you know what Rod let me finish the story

1508
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
okay well now

1509
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and I think

1510
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
that this is beautiful because

1511
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
in my brain it's an homage to Rod

1512
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Calibur is Soul Calibur

1513
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Legends is coming out on the Wii

1514
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
and

1515
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
it's going to be using the

1516
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Nunchuck and the

1517
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Wiimote so I'm just seeing

1518
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Rod Calibur all over again

1519
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
but you know what's fucking awesome about the game though

1520
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
it's kind of like a beat

1521
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
em up game except hopefully it's not

1522
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
going to be like was that that

1523
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Tekken game with

1524
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
what's-her-name Death by the Greaves

1525
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
yeah hope it's not like that

1526
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
maybe it's like the Tekken force mode from

1527
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Tekken 3 so Jamie to sum up

1528
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I will soon be able to play Rod

1529
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Calibur with my Wii yes

1530
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Rod Calibur with your Wii

1531
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
fabulous right and

1532
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
if anybody still has a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur

1533
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
just you should try Rod Calibur if you never

1534
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
have

1535
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
alright well you know

1536
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I just want to mention real quick sure

1537
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
there will be some fishing games coming out in

1538
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
the fall for the Wii that actually have

1539
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
a fishing rod controller therefore

1540
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Rod Calibur

1541
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
for a whole other generation

1542
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
well one person that won't be

1543
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
playing Soul Calibur on the Wii

1544
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
anytime soon or any derivative of the

1545
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
game is this guy who emailed

1546
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Kotaku earlier this week and

1547
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
this was a story here I'm just going to quote this story

1548
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
from a Kotaku article here

1549
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
buying a Wii was a big deal for me

1550
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
seeing those 250 hard-earned dollars

1551
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and some change go flying from her hand

1552
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and into the water was painful

1553
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
we would probably be together right now

1554
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
if she had not thrown out my beloved Wii

1555
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
but alas you can't talk a crazy woman

1556
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
out of an idea of such magnitude

1557
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
yes this guy's wife took

1558
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
the Wii and threw it into a lake

1559
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
during a heated argument

1560
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
anyway and he goes on to say anyways

1561
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
divorce is imminent I'm talking

1562
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
to a lawyer tomorrow to get the process

1563
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
started I'm not divorcing her just

1564
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
because of the Wii throwing but that's the rather

1565
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
large straw that broke

1566
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
the Drome Dairy's back

1567
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I would have thrown

1568
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
her right after that

1569
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
throw her in the river

1570
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
go get my Wii

1571
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
what would you do if Nelly threw your Wii into the lake

1572
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'd be pissed

1573
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
would you file papers

1574
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'd buy another one

1575
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
buy another one? buy two? just piss her off

1576
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
maybe

1577
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
spend savings

1578
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
there you go

1579
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
GS68 says too bad the woman's going to win 100%

1580
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Craven's Dolphin says I'm with Loki

1581
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
alright well there you have it

1582
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
anyways

1583
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I don't know this

1584
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
sounds pretty cool

1585
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
last game that came out I know like this

1586
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
the Rygar game

1587
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
on Playstation 2 was pretty awesome

1588
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
now they're doing Project Rygar for the Wii

1589
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and of course it's going to be

1590
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
a brand new game exclusively

1591
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
for the Wii and

1592
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
no real details about that

1593
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
except it's supposed to have

1594
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
new characters, new enemies, new weapons, yada yada yada

1595
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but

1596
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
one of the announcements from

1597
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Tecmo's party

1598
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that they did because everyone was having their

1599
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
gamer's day or Tecmo's

1600
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
night out 07

1601
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I don't know they have a pretty cool piece of

1602
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
artwork that's the only bit of info

1603
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
from the game so far

1604
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
looks pretty guilty gear-ish actually

1605
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
interesting

1606
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
you know I never played the

1607
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Rygar game on Playstation 2 I somehow missed it

1608
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
but I did enjoy the old NES one

1609
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
that's like one of my favorite 8-bit games ever

1610
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
even if it was really different from the arcade

1611
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
well know what?

1612
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
then probably when this game gets closer to coming out

1613
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Virtual Console

1614
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
yeah that's pretty exciting

1615
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
if I remember right the 8-bit one had no save feature

1616
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
or password or anything

1617
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
so you had to play it all in one sitting which sucked

1618
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
but now with the Virtual Console

1619
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
not a problem anymore

1620
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
very exciting I hope that does come out

1621
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
pretty cool

1622
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
well speaking of Virtual Console

1623
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I do have the list for our UK listeners

1624
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and

1625
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
that is released so far

1626
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Ninja Spirit

1627
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
which was a TurboGrafx game

1628
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and also

1629
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
NES Open Tournament Golf

1630
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I think that's it

1631
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
wow sucks to be in the UK

1632
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
because neither of those games really are that good to me

1633
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Ninja Spirit was a good game

1634
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I vaguely remember it

1635
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think I played it once

1636
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Golf was more like crap

1637
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
didn't it come out kind of in response to

1638
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Ninja Gaiden

1639
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
which did really well on the NES

1640
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that's how a lot of TurboGrafx games were

1641
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
where's Shadow Dancer?

1642
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
it could have been Shadow Dancer because Shadow Dancer had the dog

1643
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I know but where's Shadow Dancer?

1644
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I know!

1645
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
or Moonwalker I mean come on

1646
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
it's so bad I mean it's such a bad movie

1647
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
well it was a bad movie and a bad game

1648
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
but the bar scene

1649
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
the bar level in Moonwalker was pretty fun

1650
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
because you do the leaning thing in advance

1651
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and all that was cool

1652
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
D.Vay has a Mother's Day message in chat here

1653
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
my mom rocked at Ninja Spirit

1654
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
for some reason

1655
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
don't know why I bought it

1656
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
my mom never really played video games at all

1657
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I couldn't get her to play anything

1658
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
so I don't know that whole experience

1659
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
of walking in and your mom or your dad

1660
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
is playing a video game of yours

1661
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Mom what are you doing?

1662
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
oh I'm just beating the level 3 boss

1663
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
anyhow

1664
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
now one game that came out on the Virtual Console

1665
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
not that long ago that was pretty exciting

1666
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
was Tecmo Bowl

1667
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
even if they did make some changes to it

1668
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
to remove players names and stuff

1669
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but people were excited to see Tecmo Bowl make a return

1670
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
and hey

1671
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
that return might be forthcoming

1672
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
like even bigger

1673
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
because Tecmo has announced

1674
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
that they have plans to revive

1675
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
the Tecmo Bowl franchise

1676
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
in 2008

1677
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Tecmo will be joining up with Visual Concepts

1678
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
to make a new version of Tecmo Bowl

1679
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
now note there is no NFL licenses

1680
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
going on here but who cares

1681
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Tecmo Bowl was just fun

1682
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
and actually I don't talk a lot about

1683
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
sports games on the program because I don't get into

1684
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
a whole lot of them but

1685
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Tecmo Bowl was one of the few sports games

1686
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I really really got into on the NES

1687
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
because back then sports games were so simple

1688
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
that you didn't really have to be

1689
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a professor of the sport to do well

1690
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
at them

1691
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
so I'm pretty excited that Tecmo Bowl

1692
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is re-coming out

1693
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
except the weird thing about it is that they're not saying

1694
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
what system it's coming out on

1695
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
they're just saying

1696
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I can't tell you what platform we're making it for

1697
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but I can tell you

1698
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that it's probably not going to be on the platform

1699
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
that you're expecting if that makes any sense

1700
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and I actually have no idea

1701
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
what that means

1702
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
does that mean Xbox Live Arcade?

1703
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I actually have a cell phone, Tecmo Bowl

1704
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I actually downloaded Tecmo Bowl to my cell phone

1705
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
about a year ago and was very disappointed

1706
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
actually they're not working with Visual Concepts

1707
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
it's a little play on there

1708
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
they're saying they

1709
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
join Visual Concepts because Visual Concepts

1710
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
is doing that All Pro 2K8 or whatever

1711
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and

1712
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
basically they're comparing them because they don't

1713
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
have the NFL license as well

1714
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
so it looks like Tecmo is

1715
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
going to be developing it by themselves

1716
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
or at least with an unnamed developer

1717
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm going to guess that it's the N-Gage

1718
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that they're working on

1719
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
because they are doing that whole

1720
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
N-Gage 3 relaunch thing

1721
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
or whatever so

1722
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
that's the system I least expect it on

1723
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
How about the

1724
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Atari 2600? That's the system

1725
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I would least expect it on

1726
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
What about Virtual Console?

1727
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Nope, we already have Tecmo Bowl

1728
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
on Virtual Console, kinda

1729
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah, a new one though, you wouldn't expect that

1730
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh that'd be cool, but you know the weird thing is

1731
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
it had this Tecmo Collection

1732
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
or something like that, it was called

1733
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I don't remember, like a Tecmo Collection

1734
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
that came out on Xbox and it had the old

1735
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
arcade version of Tecmo Bowl on it

1736
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
not nearly as fun as the NES one

1737
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and I realize a lot of people kinda only

1738
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
know that as the Tecmo Bowl, but it was kinda

1739
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
clunky to me

1740
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
it didn't have that fast pacedness that the

1741
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
NES one had, so there you go

1742
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Anyways

1743
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
some interesting

1744
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
stuff, another thing that was announced over

1745
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
in

1746
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
during the Square Enix

1747
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
little Final Fantasy party there was that

1748
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
they're gonna be bringing Chocobo Dungeon

1749
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
to

1750
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
actually to the Wii

1751
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
exclusively, which is kinda neat

1752
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
so that'll be kinda cool I guess

1753
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
with, aren't they having the new

1754
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I wanna say they had Dragon Quest

1755
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Swords as well coming out

1756
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
lots of stuff

1757
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
for the Wii, lots of Wii love

1758
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
good

1759
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I don't remember if any news about this

1760
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
made our show roll, but isn't there information

1761
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
as well about Crystal Chronicles that came out

1762
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
of the event?

1763
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I know that they're in the DS

1764
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
version, I think they may have

1765
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
announced a date for that

1766
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Wasn't the Wii one supposed to be a launch title?

1767
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Maybe, maybe in Japan

1768
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
but I know that

1769
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I distinctly remember seeing some type of

1770
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Crystal Chronicles stuff in

1771
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
like, some of the early press things

1772
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
for the Wii, like it was an early launch title

1773
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
They announced, what was it, the DS version is gonna

1774
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
be coming to Japan on August 23rd

1775
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
that was the announcement that

1776
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I believe was there, I don't know about the Wii

1777
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
version at all, I don't think there was anything

1778
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
announced there

1779
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Alright

1780
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
well, I don't know, are you excited about

1781
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii?

1782
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Nope, don't care, I couldn't give a crap when the DS

1783
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
version came out, especially

1784
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
didn't give a crap for the Japanese one

1785
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
but uh

1786
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't know

1787
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Miklotov, have you ever played the Chocobo Dungeon games?

1788
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Are you excited about this new

1789
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Wii one at all?

1790
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
No, but I'm excited about Crystal Chronicles

1791
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm very excited, because me and my friends

1792
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
played the GameCube one a whole bunch

1793
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
we never beat it, but we had a really good time

1794
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
with it, because we had all the Game Boy

1795
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
advances linked up, and it was just a really good

1796
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
time, and I expect that the DS one will be

1797
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
probably a little more fun

1798
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
RossdielUT

1799
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
says in chat, will Crystal Chronicles

1800
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
require 4 DS's for multiplayer?

1801
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Of course

1802
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I hope not

1803
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You're going to have people share the DS

1804
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
when they're playing, if it's just

1805
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
the DS version, everybody's going to

1806
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
need a copy and a DS to play

1807
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Is that maybe one reason that they've kind of

1808
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
held off on putting this out on the Wii?

1809
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Is because there

1810
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
hasn't really been a game that has the DS connectivity

1811
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
yet, so they're waiting?

1812
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Probably, but I would really like them

1813
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
to do a Wii one already, and the

1814
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
DS one. Bring it square

1815
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Enix. So even though the

1816
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
story was about Chocobo Dungeon, we couldn't help

1817
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
throwing a little bit of Crystal Chronicles in there

1818
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Because we talked about a good game instead

1819
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Well there you have it

1820
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
We have potential for something to be relatively

1821
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
good

1822
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
They are doing, actually

1823
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
a Final Fantasy sort of

1824
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
fighting game

1825
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Ergize 2?

1826
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Final Fantasy

1827
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Cecidia

1828
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And it's looking like it's going to be

1829
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
more like a

1830
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
a big

1831
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
it sort of looks like it's more of a big

1832
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm sorry, the only thing I can really

1833
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
think of looking at this is like

1834
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
a sort of like

1835
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
level of Power Stone, I think

1836
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
you know, with the big levels and all that

1837
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
just with versus

1838
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
you know, versus each other's characters, but it looks like we've got

1839
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
some Final Fantasy

1840
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
9, some

1841
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
7, 8

1842
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
and I think 12

1843
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
thrown in, yeah

1844
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Is this just

1845
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
an excuse to give the fangirls

1846
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
their Cloud X, Tidus

1847
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
stories?

1848
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No, because Steffi is my bishie

1849
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Yeah

1850
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Wow, you're lame

1851
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Just kidding, hearts

1852
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I was a squall fangirl

1853
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Well now, if this ends up

1854
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
being what the game is all about, you could have all

1855
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
of those guys battling it out

1856
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I know, it's great

1857
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Alright, anyhow

1858
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Shadows Fits Lair in chat says

1859
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Super Smash Brothers Final Fantasy edition

1860
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Maybe, maybe

1861
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Alright, well one thing I should mention

1862
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
is that Star Ocean 1

1863
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and 2 are being made

1864
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
for the PSP

1865
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Of course, you know, it seems like Square's kind of getting

1866
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
big on the remakes for PSP lately because

1867
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
you know, of course Final Fantasy

1868
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that's there and then of course they did the

1869
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
redone version of Tactics or whatever

1870
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
So Square's been showing the PSP

1871
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
a lot of love lately and they are continuing

1872
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Star Ocean 1 and 2

1873
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You may remember these games were originally on the Super Nintendo

1874
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
and the Playstation 1, but now they are going to be coming

1875
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to the PSP. By the way

1876
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
if you would like a new Star Ocean game

1877
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Star Ocean 4 is

1878
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
confirmed to be under development and

1879
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
will be coming out soon

1880
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
but they haven't exactly said which

1881
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
platform it's going to be coming out

1882
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
to yet, I believe

1883
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, people

1884
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
are assuming it's PS3 and Xbox 360

1885
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and most people are assuming it has to be

1886
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Playstation 3 because all the other games were

1887
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
on the Sony platforms, but

1888
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
you know, anything's possible, especially with

1889
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Square. They've jumped ship before

1890
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
to other systems. I mean, hello, Dragon Quest

1891
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
going to DS. Who would have thought

1892
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that was going to happen? Well, there you go

1893
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Well, I was thinking

1894
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It says

1895
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
it was officially announced for next gen

1896
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
consoles, so

1897
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well, technically, I don't know

1898
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Again,

1899
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
though, you can assume

1900
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
it's the Playstation, but then they'll make a surprise

1901
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
jump to Wii, you never know

1902
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
There you go

1903
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Anyways

1904
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So, of more

1905
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I hate to sound like a broken record, but

1906
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
more rumors

1907
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
regarding the PSP getting a redesign

1908
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
One, I had to laugh

1909
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
at when I saw this story. There's a rumor

1910
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that the PSPs are going to be

1911
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
now being shipped

1912
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
with

1913
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
with firmwares

1914
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
with downloadable

1915
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
prevention

1916
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Right

1917
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Like all the other ones

1918
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
had it so you can download

1919
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I'm sorry, I don't think they're going to have it

1920
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
where you can enable it not

1921
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
to be able to be downgraded

1922
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
But they're going to try, apparently

1923
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's the rumor

1924
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So wait, what exactly are they blocking? You can't

1925
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
download anything? What? No, they're downgradable

1926
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They're going to make it so you can't downgrade the

1927
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
firmware. I don't see how that's going to happen

1928
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Well, don't they say that every other time

1929
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
they release a patch? Yes

1930
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So, anyways

1931
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
They're basically, that's the rumor

1932
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
It's supposed to be happening

1933
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
They said all new PSPs

1934
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
shipping out as of next Friday

1935
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
which is May 18th

1936
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
will be a higher firmware

1937
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
4 point something

1938
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It says they promised

1939
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
to include, and this is coming from

1940
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
a

1941
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
EB Games regional manager

1942
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
in Canada

1943
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So I don't know how much you can believe that

1944
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
But anyways

1945
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
What are you trying to say about Canada?

1946
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'm trying to say something about EB

1947
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
But basically, here's what they're saying

1948
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Sony was sending out emails to its commercial

1949
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
retailers that all new PSPs

1950
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
will be

1951
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
sent out with

1952
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
downgradable

1953
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
prevention built right into them

1954
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
All new PSPs will be shipped out

1955
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
as of next week, Friday, May 18th

1956
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
will be a higher firmware

1957
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
4.XX

1958
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Specifics not released, it says

1959
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But they were promised to include new security features

1960
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to prevent hacks and downgrades

1961
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Apparently this will be

1962
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
one of the first steps to start focusing

1963
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
on the PSP again instead of diverting

1964
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
all the attention to the PS3

1965
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'll believe it when I see it

1966
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Isn't this just a challenge to hackers?

1967
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yes, it is

1968
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's not going to happen

1969
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
At this point, no

1970
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's not when they said

1971
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Blu-ray and HD DVD is uncrackable

1972
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and then the code is all over the front page of DIG

1973
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Let's just say

1974
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
for example, if they do release this

1975
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
firmware, whatever, that's for new

1976
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
PSPs. There's a lot of them out there

1977
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
right now that do not have that

1978
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So, big deal

1979
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
That's about the equivalent of them

1980
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
changing the $5 bill to a new

1981
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
version that can't be counterfeited

1982
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
but the old ones are still in circulation

1983
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and still being used, so

1984
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
It's kind of dumb

1985
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Anywho, the other

1986
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
of course, rumor that we've talked about before

1987
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
is saying that a new PSP

1988
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
redesign is going to become

1989
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
and it'll be smaller

1990
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and a lighter weight version of

1991
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
the handheld device

1992
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
No release date

1993
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
No price point

1994
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and no other info on that

1995
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's a big, fat rumor

1996
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
but I think people are thinking that it's going to happen

1997
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
since, I don't know

1998
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
that they haven't muggied with it yet

1999
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
and that they can't do that with all their console systems

2000
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Alright

2001
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, we're going to get to a segment here

2002
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
we like to do every week on the program

2003
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That is DarkSakura's website of the week

2004
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
because DarkSakura likes to surf the internet

2005
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
all back and forth

2006
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and around and through and find a website

2007
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that she wants to share with you

2008
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
DarkSakura, where should the kids

2009
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
be pointing their web browsers this week?

2010
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The website of the week is

2011
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
MyCatHatesYou.com

2012
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and this is

2013
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
a

2014
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
big, massive collection

2015
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
of pissed off cats

2016
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's beautiful

2017
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's just lovely

2018
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's all it is, is pictures of angry cats

2019
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Pretty much

2020
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Our cat is doing naughty bad things

2021
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
There's this one cat

2022
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
The first thing is this cat

2023
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
with a leather jacket on it

2024
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
and a big cat looking all bad ass

2025
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's also one of those bald cats

2026
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Interesting

2027
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
There's also one of the black and white cats

2028
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
by a thing that's already used

2029
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
MyCatHatesYou.com

2030
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Your cat doesn't really hate me

2031
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
though, right DarkSakura?

2032
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
My cat doesn't hate anybody, she just looks offended

2033
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Alright, here you go

2034
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright, well one more

2035
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
story for you for this segment

2036
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
this part of Orange Lounge Radio

2037
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and that's about some homebrew

2038
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
that's being made for the DS

2039
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
This is

2040
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't know exactly how to

2041
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
describe this game

2042
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I kind of look at it like a

2043
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
puzzle type game, but the game is called

2044
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Virus DX

2045
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It's a puzzle game

2046
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
but this puzzle game has hot anime

2047
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
nurses with it

2048
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and I'm assuming they must get

2049
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
naked if you do good

2050
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
because this is being called

2051
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Triple X homebrew

2052
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
available on the Nintendo DS

2053
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's not all, they have strip rock

2054
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
paper scissors, tickle girl and

2055
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
teenage queen NDS

2056
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yes, lots of fun stuff there

2057
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I like tickle girl, what's tickle girl about?

2058
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm thinking about buying stuff too

2059
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Wow, you actually see a picture

2060
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
of a girl on the bottom screen there

2061
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and if you tickle her

2062
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
with your stylus you can see her reaction

2063
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
on the top screen and it will

2064
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
utilize full motion video sampled

2065
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
audio and looping background music

2066
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
and

2067
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
they're saying if you liked Feel

2068
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
the Magic, you'll love this

2069
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Wow

2070
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I want to see strip rock

2071
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
paper scissors

2072
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's

2073
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
like when you're trying to convince

2074
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
someone to play strip poker with you

2075
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
and they're like, but I don't know how to

2076
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
play poker, so you say, okay

2077
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
let's play strip high card

2078
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
All it is is it's basically a rock

2079
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
paper scissor and then they have

2080
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
porn pictures that they've taken off

2081
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
a website that's in a series or something

2082
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Why bother with the game, seriously?

2083
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Why not just have

2084
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
DS porno?

2085
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Why bother?

2086
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I guess that's true too

2087
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But this is homebrew

2088
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
this you can get for free, right?

2089
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Whereas the browser costs like 50 bucks

2090
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Actually, Teenage Queen

2091
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
NDS is actually

2092
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
pretty, it's all hand drawn

2093
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
animation, that's kind of neat

2094
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's a poker game, it looks like

2095
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah, but that's

2096
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
probably about as good as strip poker was

2097
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
on the Commodore 64

2098
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah

2099
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's all about Custer's Revenge

2100
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Dude, it's all

2101
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
about, you know, fucking

2102
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
putting some more adult

2103
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
games, what the fuck is that one game

2104
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
that needs to play all the time?

2105
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Gals panic! They need to put gals panic on there

2106
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh, I thought the guy game

2107
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Where they would have the contest

2108
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
between the women, like the video sequences

2109
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
that you'd unlock

2110
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
They have that now in Girls Gone Wild

2111
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It's kind of retarded

2112
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Alright, well anyway

2113
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
that's going to do it here for part A

2114
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
