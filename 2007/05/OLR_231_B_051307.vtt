Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this May 13, 2007.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Remember, Orange Lounge Radio is distributed in two parts.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
So if you're thinking, it's not May 13, that's because we record live and we get a whole chat room filled with people over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
And then we break the show up into two parts and take it to our audio archive throughout the week.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
So let's get right back into some video game news.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Take it away.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
And this shouldn't come to a surprise to anybody, but there's a rumor that music downloads are coming to Xbox Live Marketplace.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah, I could totally see that happening since, well, they have the Zune Marketplace right now

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
that has songs that you can download to your Zune that use the Microsoft Point.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
How easy would it be to put these on Xbox Live Marketplace?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
It's going to happen sooner or later.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
So that's not surprising, especially since Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Here's the problem I would have with the Zune Marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I don't know a single person with a Zune.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, here's the thing, though.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to the Zune.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
They just limit it to not just the Zune, but like...

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Microsoft products.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
You know, Microsoft.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
Either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your...

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I want to say I read something about this.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I think something like, in the story, it says something like if you type a subscription fee,

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have,

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Like Napster.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I love this.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
They're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
because, you know, there's a price break after three months.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Wait, no, there isn't.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
There's not a price break at all.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever, per thing,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
or do, like, a subscription.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
The Napster model.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
It should be a virtual console.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Interesting.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't know.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
But they're trying.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
They've made a lot of improvements.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Do you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I don't know.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Would that work?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
It might be a good competition for Netflix.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Well, actually, that's funny that you mentioned Netflix.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Interesting.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
That you were going to be able to, you know, download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, I heard a rumor that, you know, my cousins, you know, who, sisters, you know, friends, uncles,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
person who works for, you know, Microsoft said that you suck.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Very uninterested.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
All right.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
Anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live marketplace as well.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, yes, I have.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
It is fucking disturbing.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted animation festival or whatever it's called.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I remember, look, you got me a Happy Tree Friend for Christmas a couple years ago.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Don't they have a show on G4 or something now?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's basically episodes from the cartoon series.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's got to be a watered down version, though, isn't it?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
No, it's not.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It's the exact same thing.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, wow, because that stuff was pretty gruesome.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, this is great because Happy Tree Friends is actually now going to be in a digitally distributed PC and Xbox Live arcade game.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm buying it.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
It's being developed by Stainless Games and will be published by Sega and should be coming out in fall of 2007.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
They're calling it an action puzzle game.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
With death.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
You can either be Flippy the Bear, Lumpy the Moose, or Handy the Amputee Beaver.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Lovely.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I like games with cute things dying.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I think that's fantastic.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I'll play it.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm sure Jamie is going to be all over this game.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
This is Cooking Mama 07 right here.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
This is it.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
That's so awesome.

04:44.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, something else that's fairly awesome, at least as far as rumor-y things, is there's a rumor posted at an Xbox 360 site in the Netherlands that Sega is working on a vintage collection for the Xbox 360 that among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Aegis for the PlayStation 2?

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
And not to mention also that they later found out that it was confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Goddamn internet liars.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Aegis compilation, like the Sega Aegis 2900, because I've got a few of those games. How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I wouldn't mind something like that if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Then, yeah, something like what you said there where you could just have all of them on one disk.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, a lot.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And I want Planet Harrier.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
A good chunk of them.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Planet Harrier.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
And they could just release the game and they could call it this. Remember when Sega was good?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And that's what they could call the game.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
And it would sell millions of copies because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Sega Aegis.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
There you go.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
That's the selling point right there. Remember when Sega was good?

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Yes, but I do remember when Crackdown was good, and it was good today.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And that's because I had the new download pack, and it's awesome.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
But there were some complications, as there normally is with a lot of these download packs,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
where it was resetting some of the game's progress.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
You might find out that your save game's gone.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Whoopsie.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But they're working on a fix for it right now.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Just real quick.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
All you have to do is get the brand new update, which will be coming out.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crashes, the update to the game.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And just reboot it, and you're good to go.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So I recommend doing that.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
But the download content is fucking awesome.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Free or paid.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Either way, you've got to get it.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
I don't think I have ever played Crackdown co-op, so I should be okay, right?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
You should be fine.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
And then go back into it and you can play it again.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And I played a co-op on the keys to the city mode, actually the land.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
So that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So that you're probably safe on.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
And just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
But what they really, really, really need to release now is an instant replay saver

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
or something like that where you can create your own movies

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
because with all this extra crap that they threw in there,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
All right.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Ross Deal, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com says,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Crackdown co-op is overrated.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You don't even have to really play together.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
What do you think? What do you say to that?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Exactly. You don't have to play together, but it's still fun.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
And it's not really fun to actually play together to try to beat missions and stuff.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's just fun to fuck around.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
That's the whole fun about it.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, some evidence has come to light this week

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
of a new Xbox Live game in development.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's Bomberman Live on the Xbox 360.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And the evidence to support this game's release is that

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
the Australian government's Office of Film and Literature

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
actually has already raided this game.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Not only that, but a screenshot showed up earlier this week as well.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So it does look like Bomberman will be making its way to the Xbox Live arcade.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
As to when, who knows.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But certainly this game is certain to get a lot better reception

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
than Bomberman Act Zero did on the Xbox 360,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
which you might recognize as the worst Xbox 360 title out there in existence.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Not only that, they have a trailer for it, too, out there.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Look at that now.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So it's official, and it is old-school Bomberman.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Thank God.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You know what my only problem with this game would be?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
What?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Because that's being developed by Backbone,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
according to everything that I've seen online.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
What else has Backbone done?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Death Junior.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And Brooktown.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And a lot of really crappy games.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
So I have no hope for this.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
All right.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
They're going to suck.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
How can you fuck up Bomberman, though?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh, wait.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Bomberman Act Zero.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Bomberman Act Zero.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Good point.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
It looked like classic Bomberman.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
There's no way.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Just seriously, don't change anything.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Just make it playable on the internet.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
The end.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That's it.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
The last really good Bomberman was Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Was that after Bomberman 94 on a Turbo?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I do believe so.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Bomberman 94 was really good,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
but it was still I think the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
With the multi-tap.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
So just take that and make it online playable.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The end.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
However, and it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
God, I hate ads.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Stop putting flash ads on your site, you stupid butt heads.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, they got to make money somehow.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Delete crap heads.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Anyway.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
At least so I'd have heard.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yes.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Well, there you go.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
No point me downloading this because I don't have that.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I don't know. I'll give it a try because I've been interested in it.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I play the Xbox 360 demo.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
So, let's hope.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yes.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And, unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Spore.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
Apparently, the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
And, of course, their fiscal year ends March 31st, 2008.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
So, got to wait more for this game.

11:54.000 --> 12:04.000
But you know what, though? I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
It didn't look like that much more to go. It looked pretty cool to me.

12:10.000 --> 12:21.000
The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.

12:21.000 --> 12:30.000
And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't know, though. News about games I'm really looking forward to getting delayed.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
It really makes me angsty.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
And when I get angsty, people die, and we have to do this little segment on the program called the FUs of the Week.

12:42.000 --> 12:55.000
Dark Sakura, start us off.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
A few of the week goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which for anyone who has gone into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.

13:04.000 --> 13:13.000
It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it hops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Loki.

13:15.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm pissed off at the fact that Grent thought of course not out yet. That makes me sad.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
My FU of the Week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft. I hope you all die in a fire.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it, and it hasn't been doing a damn thing.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
The Spammers are still getting through with all their tells. I hope they all die a lot.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Niklotov, anything you have for FUs of the Week?

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
I was going to say FU to Drama, but I'm actually just going to say no, I have nothing.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
So you're saying FU without saying FU?

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Kind of, but not so much. I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
All right. Very cryptic there.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
That was a short FU of the Week segment. I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight. Everybody seems to be pretty happy.

14:16.000 --> 14:26.000
All right. Well, this is some interesting news here, and I should clarify this is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story,

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.

14:30.000 --> 14:38.000
There's a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
So in other words, and then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, well, the elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is,

14:47.000 --> 14:56.000
and blah, blah, blah, blah, but to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data and not even the newest data.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
So there you have it.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
But of course, this is just going to say about this whole price war is going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
So there you go. That's it. That's all I got.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Question things that you read on the Internet.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
I question everything that I read on the Internet and I question what the intelligence of this is.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360, which, first of all, it looks stupid.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I hate the color yellow so damn much.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
And by the way, if I wanted like Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Why?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I don't know. I thought it looked kind of neat.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I mean, nobody else has one.

15:41.000 --> 15:49.000
Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah,

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
to tie in with the Simpsons movie release on July 27th.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, whatever.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
But you're a collector. Don't you want one of these?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I collect things that don't suck ass.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Fine. See if I care.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
Well, this is, of course, is all tying into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And the game looks fucking awesome.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
It's on pretty much every platform.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Of course, all the next gen platforms or current gen, however you want to call them,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2 and PSP.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And it's just pretty awesome.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
It's basically the storyline revolves around them being put into an actual game.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
And then they realize that they're stuck in a video game, kind of almost a little bit like Bart's nightmare, I guess.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
But it's just awesome.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And the whole game looks kind of cel-shaded.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Reminds me a little bit of the 3D that's actually in like Futurama or something like that.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Very cool looking, though.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Awesome.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
They're like episodes, basically.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So there's 16 levels in the game.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
And there was some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
For example, there was posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island types, stuff like that.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It'll be neat.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I think it's going to be pretty awesome.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Also, two-player co-op.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
That's going to go over live on Xbox, maybe?

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
But I think you might be able to do it over live as well.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
But that's made by Activision.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Medal of Homer.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Might get me to play one of those war games, finally, though.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Medal of Homer.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
Of course, the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial, you might remember, back in the day when it was first out.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Like those shirts that said, Eat My Shorts, that were banned from school and stuff.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Well, of course, always a source of controversy is the game ratings system.

18:08.000 --> 18:19.000
The ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
And 85% use them regularly when buying games.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
So, kind of interesting there.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
There you go.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
I mean, of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game is safe for me.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And the parent just kind of listens to that.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
So, I don't know.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
90% of parents know about the system.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I don't know.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, there's one thing, though, between knowing about it and understanding how it's used.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
True.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.

19:03.000 --> 19:17.000
And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
And that means that, you know, somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Was that you, Miklotov?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Did you do that?

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
Yes, because I live in Europe.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I'd just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
It's healthy.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
And that time was one of them.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Go back to playing with Hoe Monkey.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Hoe Monkey.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
All right.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
They have a list of features that's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And it looks pretty awesome.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already freaking even talked about already.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Thirty days after the date when it comes out.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know. Interesting.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh, hooray. You can rate me with microtransactions in Bomberman. I'm so excited.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Awesome.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.

20:43.000 --> 20:53.000
There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.

20:53.000 --> 21:02.000
And, I don't know, this is coming from a forum post to this website Ecoustics.

21:02.000 --> 21:10.000
And it's, I guess, 2chan in Japan. I don't know.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Yes, but here's the thing, though. They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so not going to happen yet.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player. That's going to make me sad.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Well, it's just like Betamax before people bought Betamax.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
It must run in my family. My parents had a Betamax.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Laser discs.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
That I didn't have, but she had it.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I still have them. I still watch them.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
That's right.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point. I believe it's been confirmed since then,

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
but when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it, I've got to buy an HD DVD player.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
I want one for the exact same reason. I don't care about anything else.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
And to answer Ross, SteelUT, and Chad who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
There you go, Heroes. HD DVD won the war. I had to have Heroes on HD.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
What am I going to do all summer?

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It did for me.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
But that's one person.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
They might come out on Blu-ray later.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
But laserdisc didn't win the war either, so nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Well, fuck you, Advent Children.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Fuck you.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Advent Children is coming out. The director's cut is coming out on Blu-ray only.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
Advent Children? Okay, I care because little spirits within me coming out too.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't care about that.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
But laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market, so it didn't necessarily die.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Of nerds.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
No, and they're actually still releasing laserdiscs.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Really?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Two companies are.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I remember how they had that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Can you imagine what would happen?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
The kind of damage you could do with laserdisc if you threw it at somebody?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
But dead platforms still get support all the time.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
One of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
5200, I think.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Or is it 5200?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Whatever.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, I have some happy news.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days,

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
And so I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Fangirlgasm.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Not necessarily. I just think it's good quality work.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
A little disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
True.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That was disappointing.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Hell, they should just do some original animation.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Just release some actual stuff.

24:46.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies in the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Video game purists will probably hate it.

24:59.000 --> 25:11.000
The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel will actually be playing the role.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
Funny enough, Keira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role and both of them passed.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
But Jessica Biel, because she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
At least they got the sex right.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
What's your face from Crouching Tiger or Hidden Dragon?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Zhang Ji?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Why don't they just have her play like fucking Cammy or something? At least that would make sense.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, keep in mind this is just a rumor.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I leave it out because he's a player again.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Again?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
She did, in the old movie.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
I know, I know.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
She played Cammy?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Okay.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
But you know who should play Chun-Li?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Who?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Ching Chong.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
What?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays like the...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
No, I'm just making a reaction.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
No, that's Chow Chang, stupid.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I know Chow Chang, I'm just saying that's what Nelly calls her.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
I think it was great though that she was Scottish.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Here's the thing.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
This Asian girl with this thick Scottish accent.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
It was great.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
He was a good Chun-Li too.

26:22.000 --> 26:30.000
In the movie, City Hunter was more accurate than fucking Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
Granted, I'm not going to say that Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, scantily clad, would not

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
be a draw for me to see his movie.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene like in the Japanese

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
one?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
That would never happen, but that'd be hot.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Tigerclaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Dragon.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You know that chick?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Zhang Ziyi, that was her name.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Yeah, exactly.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
ActDeaf says Kylie Minogue rocks.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
That's true.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alva, Kiera Knightley.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I can never pronounce that guy's name.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Jeter.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
You know what would be really awful?

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
Is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
the movie.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
That would be awful.

27:30.000 --> 27:39.000
We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la, around the world, street fighting,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.240
la la la la.

27:41.240 --> 27:45.000
Maybe I should play Chun-Li.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.920
RuPaul is Chun-Li.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.000
I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
JVMon says Rob could be E. Honda.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Are we saying I'm fat?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
What are we trying to say?

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
DJ Darknite says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It could be Sanjaya from American Idol.

28:21.000 --> 28:30.000
And GS68, as long as Loki plays Tingle.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Anyways, back to Guitar Hero.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer,

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister,

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist NotCovers, Rounded

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
Round, as made famous by RAT, I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow, and Mental

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot, Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio, that's pretty

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
cool, and The Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Not Gonna Take It?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
How do you do that?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
It could be an unlocked song.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Or even the song Remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
gonna burn in hell.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
That was awesome.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Anyway, sorry.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
But yeah, why that random ass Twisted Sister song?

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
These are only, you know, seven songs that have been announced yet.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
I mean, come on, it's gonna be, you know, there's gonna be more songs in there.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
In case you're wondering, it is only gonna be coming out on Playstation 2, at least as

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
a disc.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
360, get ready for another download!

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Woohoo!

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Do you have the facts to back that up?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
That's a rumor.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
It's only coming out on Playstation 2, as a disc.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, okay.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Alright.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Or just unannounced.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
No, but it's gonna be a download pack.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Alright.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
You're very insistent about that.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Let's see, RawsteelUT seems to think they're gonna stick We're Not Gonna Take It in one

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
of those shitty download packs.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
There you go.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Let's see, a couple people in chat, Drewnami and SSJ100matt both are asking, where's Come

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
On Feel the Noise?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
These are only the first seven songs announced yet, folks!

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I mean, come on!

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
There's gonna be another, like, 27 songs, at least.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Man, I still want Highway to Hell.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Our dirty deed's done dirt cheap.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
As much as I hate ACDC, I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
I can't stand that fucking guy's voice.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Never did like it.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Alright.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
But a game I could stand was Saints Row.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
That was actually kind of fun.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
If you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
sucks to be you.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It just got canned.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But there is a silver lining to the story.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
Saints Row 2 is in development right now, and it's coming out on the Playstation 3 and

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
the Xbox 360, and they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
into a larger installed base next year.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
In other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it through.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Crackdown.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Exactly.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Unless it sucks, in which case it will come out right afterwards.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It's actually not a bad decision though.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Alright.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
And Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag head first.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
And land on pavement apparently.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
And pull out some of her favorite emails.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
So Dark Soccer, what's in the email bag this week?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Fuck everybody.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I haven't got a single damn email.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So fuck it.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
I should say just there was some spam and there was a couple.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
The spam is squishy.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
We had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
And there were like a couple random emails that were like other types of inquiries that

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
aren't really suitable for on air.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
But other than that, nothing.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Like Rob, what color are your underwear?

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on air probably.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, Dark Tazzy has said it.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Pool's closed.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And Green.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
What the?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Okay, whatever.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
What?

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm married, butthead.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
What, are now they just starting to ask questions in chat?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Alright.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm doing some chat booting.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Alright.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Well, in lieu of a mail bag segment this week, by the way, if you want to send us an email,

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
mailbagatorangelaundry.com.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
That is very odd though.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
We've been doing this show for, you know, well, we've been doing a mail bag segment

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
in our show, I should say, since we were doing a podcast, which was what, January of 05?

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Because when we were doing the old show, the three hour program about like DDR, we didn't

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
really do an email bag segment.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
It was pretty much chat comments or nothing because you had to listen to the show live

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
or you didn't hear it at all, right?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So we didn't really have an email bag segment.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
But ever since January of 05, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
a readable email.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
That's very strange, isn't it?

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one, I want one in French.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Well, you know, the good news is now I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Someone email me in French.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Alright.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Alright, here we go.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
That was my best French impersonation, by the way.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Alright, well.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
That was horrible.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Thank you.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
As most of my accents are.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Right.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
What?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Okay, this is kind of stupid.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Uh-huh.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
birthday party next month, right?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.

34:20.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock and I'm going to dress as a police constable and

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
go around arresting my coworkers.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Lovely.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Did you have fun with that?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Or has that happened yet?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
No, it's next month.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Picks, please.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Alright.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
We had a phone call on our Skype line.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live and we'll take your

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
calls in a minute here.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Chris and Meg Z went to ASEN and Meg Z actually had an artist's table.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Because some folks are actually saying, like, hey, I never found Chris and Meg Z.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Where were they at the con?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Meg Z is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Yeah.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
And she had an artist's table.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Meg Z had an art table.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Yeah, she did.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
So that's where she spent most of the con.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
art room, that's it.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
And Chris was doing it too.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Chris apparently went around and hoarded out the show, but she says that in her voice message,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
which we're going to listen to right now.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Hello, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
This is Chris over at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well due to time

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
constraints, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done.

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
Probably done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
The pimping out has not been going according to plan.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
So I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
my phone kept dying.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
a game room, both of which my cell phone reception did not work.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
So obviously, this entire trip has been one big mass of blah for me.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Plus, I'm now losing my voice.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
But I think I should give you guys a scope anyway.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
Those of you who are interested in going to ASEN 2000, oops, messed up.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Those of you who are interested at all going to ASEN and are looking for games,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
there's lots of things to do here.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
The deal room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.

36:39.000 --> 36:46.000
There's a lot of, what are those things called, you know, the dating sims.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
There's a lot of those.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And a lot of Yowie ones for those fangirls.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which, again,

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I just haven't had the time.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
There's also card games for people.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and all that fun stuff.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
This entire trip actually was paid for me due to the fact that I had no money.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
It was part of my birthday present for my wonderful girlfriend, Maggie,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
who's been selling her art.

37:22.000 --> 37:29.000
And other than that, it's more focused on anime, obviously, than games.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
But I don't discount the fact that they do give a lot of props to the gamers,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and there have been a lot of them.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I just, unfortunately, due to many different circumstances,

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
I haven't been able to get any good interviews.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
But I do have pictures for anyone who's interested.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
They will be up on my website, my live channel at Disneypunk10.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Or you can try to get ahold from Dark Sakura.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
But other than that, I have tried.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
I've been pimping out your show, I swear.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says,

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
I've changed around radio for gamers or something like that.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
I forgot what I put on it.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I printed those out at work.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
you guys have got to give me some good promos.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
So it looks impressive than the shit that I have.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
But anyway, this has been Chris at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
This has been your Roaming Lesbian.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Back to you, Rob.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Back to you, Jamie.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Back to you, Matt.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Max Rule, asshole.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
There you go, Chris.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Semi-live at ASEN there.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You've got to love Chris.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
She's so fine.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
I love that she's kind of adopted the title of the Roaming Lesbian of OLR.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
It's great.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
And Max Rule, asshole.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Did you catch that in the end?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
I did.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I did.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I hate their commercials, too.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Because now he's like,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
See, the commercials said they're better, so they are.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I'm like, fucking A.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Great, here come 10 e-mails next week.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Why does Lucky hate Max?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Why does he hate Max?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Your show is on iPods.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
You should respect Max more.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Freedom of speech, what can we say?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
He's allowed to hate Max if he wants.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Dark Soccer and I, we love the Max.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
They're like the Volkswagen Beetle.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.400
This little fucking cars is what they are.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.520
All right, ASEN.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.480
ASEN, please.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.120
Can we talk a little bit about ASEN?

39:31.120 --> 39:33.400
I heard some of our listeners actually did some,

39:33.400 --> 39:35.400
like some folks randomly ran into each other.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.440
Like it seems like Rob D and Misty, two of our chatters,

39:38.440 --> 39:40.160
it sound like they were chatting earlier.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.220
So that's kind of cool.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.720
I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.220
And who knows, maybe next year, if it's in the OLR budget,

39:45.220 --> 39:45.920
we'll go.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.960
But for now, we have Fond of May to look forward to.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.960
Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area,

39:50.960 --> 39:52.040
you got to go to Fond of May.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.600
It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.080
OLR is going to be there Saturday.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.440
And since we're only doing one panel this year,

39:58.440 --> 40:00.200
it's in the works.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.840
This won't be live, boys and girls.

40:01.840 --> 40:07.640
But we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

40:07.640 --> 40:12.960
Friday night at the Super Secret Suite

40:12.960 --> 40:14.600
that OLR will be at Friday night.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.720
The Super Secret Suite?

40:15.720 --> 40:17.480
The Super Secret.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.760
Yes, it's our Super Secret Suite 16.

40:20.760 --> 40:23.280
That's not the actually sweet number, whatever sweet it is.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.480
The biggest, the most number of drunk,

40:25.480 --> 40:26.440
because it's going to be at a con.

40:26.440 --> 40:27.760
So everybody's going to be there.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.560
The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.560
I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just

40:31.560 --> 40:33.520
don't have the equipment to make that happen.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.240
I could take my Mac out there, but look,

40:35.240 --> 40:36.900
you would find a way to fuck it all up.

40:36.900 --> 40:37.600
So there you go.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.880
I can take my non-Mac.

40:39.880 --> 40:40.480
All right.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.000
So we'll see.

40:41.000 --> 40:41.280
We'll see.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.720
Well, we're going to tape it one way or another.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.280
And that's going to be half the show you get that week.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.160
So we're going to flag it somehow.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.520
It's not a usual show.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.760
It'll be like the OLR special edition.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.200
The OLR live from the minibar.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.840
Live at Fond of May and live at minibars.

40:56.840 --> 40:57.360
There you go.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.740
We will be at Fond of May, though.

40:58.740 --> 41:01.600
And the real show will be probably hung over

41:01.600 --> 41:03.240
on Saturday at 2 PM.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.720
So we're looking forward to that.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.960
By the way, unfortunately, that won't be live either.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.220
We won't be live that weekend.

41:08.220 --> 41:10.320
But you can come see us tape live in person.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.200
That's pretty awesome.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.280
And we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.120
We had some really good questions last year.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.040
Someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac-hating thing.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.120
That's always a good time.

41:19.120 --> 41:19.720
I don't care.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.000
OK, I don't care.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.080
I don't even really hate them anymore.

41:25.080 --> 41:25.960
I don't like them.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.800
I wouldn't buy them.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.600
I don't care if you like them.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.120
Great.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.020
Good for you.

41:30.020 --> 41:30.960
I really don't care.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.400
You've become a poster child.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.480
Stop asking me why I don't like them,

41:34.480 --> 41:36.760
because I don't have legitimate reasons.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.440
I don't like them.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.960
It's I'm racist against Mac.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.420
She doesn't like the color yellow.

41:42.420 --> 41:43.240
You don't like Macs.

41:43.240 --> 41:43.760
Exactly.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.200
I'm racist against Macs.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.480
I have no reason for it.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.240
There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.680
I think they're crappy computers.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.760
But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.560
That's your opinion, awesome.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.040
I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them.

41:58.040 --> 41:58.560
Either way.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.520
Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.880
Thank you.

42:01.880 --> 42:08.920
Anyways, so yeah, this is not very surprising at all.

42:08.920 --> 42:12.320
But apparently, Playboy's coming to Second Life.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.360
I would say, what took them so long?

42:14.360 --> 42:17.860
Since I want to say that most of Second Life anyways

42:17.860 --> 42:21.040
is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.280
Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.040
But yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.900
And no real word of what's going to happen.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.440
But apparently, you're going to be able to participate either

42:32.440 --> 42:36.720
as a centerfold or as somebody staring at centerfolds.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.240
Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?

42:39.240 --> 42:39.920
Possibly.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.840
I don't know.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.840
Microsoft also entered Second Life.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.880
I want to say Final Fantasy VII's

42:44.880 --> 42:47.720
been recreated in Second Life.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.240
You know, I hate to sound morbid,

42:49.240 --> 42:51.320
but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.820
I mean, he's not getting any younger.

42:52.820 --> 42:56.080
I'm so interested to see how CNN is going

42:56.080 --> 42:58.040
to handle it when he passes.

42:58.040 --> 43:02.480
You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?

43:02.480 --> 43:07.120
Hugh is an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.

43:07.120 --> 43:07.800
I don't know.

43:07.800 --> 43:11.520
Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.000
Seven chicks at one time.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.080
Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.000
That's the fountain of youth.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.160
Suddenly, all the young kids still want to do you.

43:20.160 --> 43:22.960
You know, if there's one person that in this world

43:22.960 --> 43:25.440
needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.

43:25.440 --> 43:25.960
No, no.

43:25.960 --> 43:26.680
I take that back.

43:26.680 --> 43:27.840
Bob Barker.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.600
But if they can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.720
We have the Hugh Bot and the Bob Bot.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.640
Bob Barker.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.560
He cannot die.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.720
The Barker Bot.

43:35.720 --> 43:36.960
He's retiring this year.

43:36.960 --> 43:37.560
It's happening.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.840
Ah!

43:38.840 --> 43:39.340
I know.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.120
I'm sad, too.

43:40.120 --> 43:40.680
No.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.040
Robot.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.160
Somebody kill him before he decides to retire,

43:44.160 --> 43:45.560
and we'll resurrect him as a robot,

43:45.560 --> 43:47.120
and he'll never know the difference.

43:47.120 --> 43:50.680
He will think it's his first year doing the show.

43:50.680 --> 43:51.840
He will not be tired of it.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.340
You know.

43:52.340 --> 43:55.080
He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.440
Rumor is, because Rosie's leaving The View,

43:57.440 --> 44:01.400
Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.160
Yeah.

44:03.160 --> 44:03.660
No.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.160
It's like, come on down.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.320
No, you're going to eat me.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.760
We need to wing Martindale.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.840
Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?

44:13.840 --> 44:15.120
Didn't Wing Martindale die?

44:15.120 --> 44:15.620
No.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.120
Is he still alive?

44:17.120 --> 44:18.560
Some famous game show host died.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.800
It was the one from Pressure Luck.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.200
Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.000
Whatever his name, Peter DeMarken.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.680
He was in a plane wreck or something.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.680
Boy, this show's getting morbid.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.720
Let's open up the phone, shall we?

44:30.720 --> 44:32.880
If you want to give us a call and comment on anything

44:32.880 --> 44:33.440
from the show tonight.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.120
Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.

44:35.120 --> 44:38.120
1-877-GAME-OLR.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.600
1-877-GAME-OLR.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.360
Or remember, that number is only toll free in the US.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.600
What about Lamar Burton?

44:43.600 --> 44:44.720
And Levar Burton.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.680
Levar Burton, yeah.

44:45.680 --> 44:46.520
Levar Burton?

44:46.520 --> 44:47.640
I don't know his name.

44:47.640 --> 44:52.120
Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.

44:52.120 --> 44:52.760
Why him?

44:52.760 --> 44:55.280
I've never seen him hosting a show.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.600
Reading Rainbow, come on.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.920
Not a live show.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.360
I mean, of course, Reading Rainbow,

44:59.360 --> 45:00.860
but not a live show with an audience.

45:00.860 --> 45:02.760
Who said he'd even want to do it?

45:02.760 --> 45:04.760
Force him.

45:04.760 --> 45:05.680
Why would I do that?

45:05.680 --> 45:07.040
He doesn't have a say in this.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.160
What?

45:08.160 --> 45:09.840
All right, let's go to the phones.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.520
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.640
Who's this?

45:12.640 --> 45:13.800
Legend of Saku.

45:13.800 --> 45:14.600
Hi, Legend of Saku.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.360
Chewbacca.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.720
He could totally host a show.

45:17.720 --> 45:22.360
It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.560
I want to play that yodeling game.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.880
Yes, I love the yodeling game.

45:25.880 --> 45:26.600
The game's fucking right.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.680
You know I want to see The Price is Right live a couple years

45:28.680 --> 45:29.240
ago.

45:29.240 --> 45:32.360
We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.480
And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.440
I know you have something you want to say, Saku,

45:36.440 --> 45:37.800
but I'm going to talk for a minute.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.440
Yeah, go ahead.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.960
About nothing game related.

45:39.960 --> 45:43.200
I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy

45:43.200 --> 45:46.360
and gets away with it in public, nonetheless.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.840
She wore that fucking swan dress.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.720
But here's the thing.

45:48.720 --> 45:52.680
When I saw her at Coachella, this is what, 2002 or 2003,

45:52.680 --> 45:54.720
I want to say, is when we went.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.520
She wore a Venus fly trap outfit.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.560
And it was awesome because it was closed for most of it.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.640
But then during one of her songs, it opened up,

46:02.640 --> 46:04.600
and she was like a Venus fly trap.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.000
She's so fucking hardcore.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.640
I mean, that was the best weekend ever.

46:07.640 --> 46:11.160
It was Bjork in a Venus fly trap outfit, and Price is Right.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.440
It was a great weekend.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.160
I had a good time.

46:13.160 --> 46:13.680
Sorry, Saku.

46:13.680 --> 46:16.360
You had something gaming related you want to mention?

46:16.360 --> 46:18.680
Just pulling through Digg right now.

46:18.680 --> 46:23.880
I see that Sony is about to announce a new PS3 firmware

46:23.880 --> 46:24.920
update.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.320
A new PS3 firmware update?

46:26.320 --> 46:28.200
Wait, this is on Digg right now?

46:28.200 --> 46:28.720
Yeah.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.680
Right this second?

46:29.680 --> 46:30.400
Wait, wait, wait.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.160
Don't be fooled.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.840
It's an announcement of announcements.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.160
So.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.040
That's what, yeah, Loki's right.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.720
I'm looking.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.400
This is from psu.com.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.880
Isn't that their official underground site?

46:41.880 --> 46:43.280
Oh, I don't know.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.640
There's too, you know what?

46:44.640 --> 46:46.520
There's too damn many game blogs out there

46:46.520 --> 46:47.400
on the internet right now.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.640
We need to somehow put a cap.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.040
I mean, don't get me wrong.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.000
I love the indies.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.880
I love the homebrew and stuff, but there's just so many.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.680
And like, we have room to talk.

46:55.680 --> 46:58.480
But you know, just damn, we need to streamline some of these,

46:58.480 --> 47:00.440
because I can't keep track of all of them.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.520
I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are

47:02.520 --> 47:06.440
basically, they're biased towards either console.

47:06.440 --> 47:10.920
You see one, you see Kotaku's more anti-Sony at certain

47:10.920 --> 47:13.160
times, and then, I don't know.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.000
Joystick is almost the same thing.

47:15.000 --> 47:15.920
I mean, actually, no.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.080
Joystick is more pro Nintendo, if I recall correctly.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.360
Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though,

47:21.360 --> 47:23.080
because they tried to screw them over,

47:23.080 --> 47:25.840
because Kotaku was saying something legitimate.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.320
And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff

47:28.320 --> 47:29.640
we don't want you to.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.440
You're banned from everything now.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.200
Mm-hmm.

47:33.200 --> 47:36.240
But that was all the principles.

47:36.240 --> 47:36.800
I don't know.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.560
Yeah, like a certain other business

47:38.560 --> 47:41.440
I'm thinking of in Namco, but we won't go there.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.840
Anyhow.

47:42.840 --> 47:43.340
Yeah.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.480
Whoops.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.480
Oh, well.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.160
Just adding up that, I don't know, should have been there,

47:48.160 --> 47:51.680
but I could see why they left it out initially,

47:51.680 --> 47:55.360
probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboy saying,

47:55.360 --> 47:58.760
oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.

47:58.760 --> 48:02.160
OK, well, fucking A, you started off with a firmware update.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.480
Now we're talking about warring cyber blogs.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.760
What's up with the new update?

48:05.760 --> 48:08.000
What is actually going to be on this?

48:08.000 --> 48:12.200
You could access the XMB from the in-game,

48:12.200 --> 48:15.000
like how you could access the dashboard on 360 in-game

48:15.000 --> 48:15.680
as well.

48:15.680 --> 48:18.040
OK.

48:18.040 --> 48:18.560
Let me see.

48:18.560 --> 48:23.080
They said stuff about in-game music as well,

48:23.080 --> 48:25.560
for sleep mode.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.120
I mean, I could link you right now,

48:27.120 --> 48:28.280
but it's a whole bunch of settings that are up.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.880
I tried pulling it up on Digg, but obviously everybody's

48:30.880 --> 48:32.160
hammering the sites was broken.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.480
But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.920
What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.000
There's an equalizer in the music.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.480
There's photo settings, PlayStation 2 settings,

48:44.480 --> 48:47.040
RSS channel settings is now an option.

48:47.040 --> 48:50.720
So now I'll be hopping to OR on your PS3.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.800
More slideshow stuff for the photos,

48:52.800 --> 48:55.600
more visualization for music.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.160
Looks like you can do some other things with video.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.880
You can do some zoom ins and stuff.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.040
Cross media bar is now accessible during gameplay,

49:04.040 --> 49:05.240
like you said.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.800
RSS channel is added as a feature.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.560
That's pretty cool.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.880
That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3

49:09.880 --> 49:10.560
pretty soon.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.240
You can now have multiple chat sessions,

49:12.240 --> 49:14.280
and you can select an image to use as your avatar

49:14.280 --> 49:17.120
from the photo.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.560
So it sounds like a pretty big update, that's pretty cool.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.120
I don't know.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.080
It's catching up to 360.

49:22.080 --> 49:25.400
I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.840
It's funny you phrase it that way.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.120
It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?

49:29.120 --> 49:30.200
It's not even there.

49:30.200 --> 49:36.720
It's not at the tip, the leading edge of where 360's at right

49:36.720 --> 49:39.000
now.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.880
I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.

49:41.880 --> 49:43.960
Does that even exist?

49:43.960 --> 49:46.580
Like the custom soundtracks, like an Xbox 360?

49:46.580 --> 49:47.160
I don't know.

49:47.160 --> 49:47.920
I don't own a PS3.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.440
Does it?

49:48.440 --> 49:49.240
Can you do custom sound?

49:49.240 --> 49:49.960
You can't, right?

49:49.960 --> 49:50.440
Maybe.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.560
I don't think so.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.880
Depends on the game.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.440
I think it depends on the game.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.920
Interesting.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.400
Folks in chat are saying no.

49:59.400 --> 50:02.840
Yeah, I mean once Sony has a lot of work

50:02.840 --> 50:09.040
to do in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.400
I mean, they have to add rumble, lower the price,

50:12.400 --> 50:16.040
get some really good games out because right now not

50:16.040 --> 50:17.640
to say that they're the only ones,

50:17.640 --> 50:19.920
but the Wii's also in a drought right now.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.560
They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.360
Right, that's true.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.440
That's exactly what I said.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.560
A price cut would do just that.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.200
All right.

50:29.200 --> 50:30.040
Anything else, Zaku?

50:30.040 --> 50:31.700
We've got to get going to another call.

50:31.700 --> 50:34.280
But any other last stuff you want to get in here?

50:34.280 --> 50:35.000
That's about it.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.540
I'm cutting my throat's kind of sore.

50:36.540 --> 50:39.160
I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.

50:39.160 --> 50:39.680
All right.

50:39.680 --> 50:40.440
See you soon, buddy.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.280
Less than a month before I come to New York.

50:42.280 --> 50:42.800
All right.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.720
All right, later, dude.

50:43.720 --> 50:44.680
Bye-bye.

50:44.680 --> 50:47.080
I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup

50:47.080 --> 50:50.880
because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo

50:50.880 --> 50:53.320
World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.800
Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.680
Maybe the Dave and Buster's thing,

50:57.680 --> 50:59.200
although I don't think everybody can get in there.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.000
So I don't know.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.320
Maybe pizza?

51:01.320 --> 51:02.480
I don't know.

51:02.480 --> 51:03.460
I'm up for ideas.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.160
Let's start a forum thread or something.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.580
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

51:06.580 --> 51:07.240
Who's this?

51:07.240 --> 51:08.160
Hey, what's up, guys?

51:08.160 --> 51:08.880
It's the Rob D.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.200
Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?

51:11.200 --> 51:11.720
Not too much.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.720
I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.

51:13.720 --> 51:14.560
Ah, of course.

51:14.560 --> 51:15.800
How was ASEN?

51:15.800 --> 51:16.600
Oh, lots of fun.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.680
I had a blast.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.080
I watched a lot of anime.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.120
I played a lot of games.

51:21.120 --> 51:25.640
Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.280
One guy who was dressed up was Frank West.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.000
He was carrying a servbot head.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.680
That's awesome.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.560
He had his girlfriend, who was also wearing a servbot head.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.340
He held her hand the whole time, and she didn't move unless he

51:37.340 --> 51:39.080
dragged her.

51:39.080 --> 51:40.480
That's great.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.920
And two zombies with servbot heads

51:41.920 --> 51:43.880
were chasing them the whole way through.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.720
That's pretty awesome.

51:44.720 --> 51:45.960
I like when people go all out with the game,

51:45.960 --> 51:48.400
because you know, I'm not really all about the anime.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.080
I mean, obviously, we have a lot of folks here in studio

51:51.080 --> 51:52.680
that are really into anime.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.680
And I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.440
So I really like when people bring

51:57.440 --> 51:59.160
more of the gaming into the anime cons

51:59.160 --> 52:00.400
through the cosplay and stuff.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.400
That's always cool.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.000
Some interesting things happened, too.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.880
I went to a couple of the programming panels,

52:06.880 --> 52:09.440
like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness.

52:09.440 --> 52:13.120
And at one point, 1,000 people were singing the Segata Sanchiro

52:13.120 --> 52:14.800
theme song.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.560
Wow.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.960
You can get that many nerds in one place?

52:18.960 --> 52:20.920
Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell,

52:20.920 --> 52:23.840
which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials,

52:23.840 --> 52:25.360
bad anime, that sort of thing.

52:25.360 --> 52:27.400
Or just like whacking commercials.

52:27.400 --> 52:31.120
So they played like a full four minutes Segata Sanchiro theme

52:31.120 --> 52:32.960
song with subtitles.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.000
So it's kind of an easy core to sing.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.520
So everyone started joining in the second, third,

52:37.520 --> 52:39.440
and fourth times they played it.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.880
Wow, nerds, all of you.

52:40.880 --> 52:43.760
Hey, what types of game room setups did they have?

52:43.760 --> 52:46.320
Because I notice no anime con is complete without a game room.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.720
They had a pretty big game room in the basement floor.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.760
They actually had Beat Mania 2DX down there.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.160
I didn't get a chance to play it,

52:52.160 --> 52:55.480
but it looked like some people were having some fun with that one.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.920
Like the real game, like the arcade game, or home port?

52:58.920 --> 53:00.440
I think it was a home port.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.480
Yeah, it was a home port.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.320
That's all right, it's still cool.

53:03.320 --> 53:06.120
They had a HDTV set up for just about, I think,

53:06.120 --> 53:08.000
every single set up they had around there.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.920
A lot of console games, mostly anime-based games or fighting

53:10.920 --> 53:12.120
games, that sort of thing.

53:12.120 --> 53:12.620
Right.

53:12.620 --> 53:13.920
King of Fighters 11.

53:13.920 --> 53:18.440
You're not really going to find Navno 8 at an anime con?

53:18.440 --> 53:18.940
Exactly.

53:18.940 --> 53:21.000
And for the Para Para machine, it was great.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.440
There were probably about 15 people

53:23.440 --> 53:27.520
behind doing the motions themselves as people

53:27.520 --> 53:28.600
were playing the machine.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.240
It was great.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.360
How many of them were dudes?

53:33.240 --> 53:36.200
Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.080
You know, it's funny because there

53:38.080 --> 53:40.880
used to be hella guys in Northern California

53:40.880 --> 53:43.160
that were into Para Para.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.840
There was teams and everything.

53:44.840 --> 53:48.120
And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really

53:48.120 --> 53:49.400
do Para Para dancing.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.360
And then all those teams just fell apart,

53:51.360 --> 53:53.000
like instantly vaporized.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.240
It was something else.

53:55.240 --> 53:59.600
I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff

53:59.600 --> 54:01.960
and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.

54:01.960 --> 54:04.520
But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.

54:04.520 --> 54:05.100
Exactly.

54:05.100 --> 54:05.800
Rock on, Sky.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.880
But anyway, there were a lot of tournaments.

54:08.880 --> 54:10.680
Tournaments for just about every fighting game,

54:10.680 --> 54:12.120
every anime fighting game.

54:12.120 --> 54:14.240
There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3,

54:14.240 --> 54:18.960
Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.000
I got killed in that one.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.360
Wow.

54:21.360 --> 54:24.040
So I entered like five of them, somewhere around there.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.080
A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.120
But people are still having fun.

54:27.120 --> 54:27.920
There weren't too many people that

54:27.920 --> 54:29.920
were completely arrogant or cocky, which

54:29.920 --> 54:33.440
unfortunately can't happen.

54:33.440 --> 54:36.960
I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chat room.

54:36.960 --> 54:37.860
Awesome.

54:37.860 --> 54:39.640
Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.280
It was a lot of fun.

54:42.280 --> 54:45.880
It's funny, never mind, I won't tell that story.

54:45.880 --> 54:47.880
I'll just say that some of my friends

54:47.880 --> 54:49.600
actually found a stranger in their hotel room

54:49.600 --> 54:50.960
when they woke up the next day.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.280
I'll leave it at that.

54:53.280 --> 54:59.520
Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.

54:59.520 --> 55:01.240
Interesting.

55:01.240 --> 55:02.880
All right, well, we'll leave it at that.

55:02.880 --> 55:07.080
Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Faname.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.680
If you're an anime fan, I got to say

55:08.680 --> 55:09.920
it's a great place to go to.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.640
If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan,

55:12.640 --> 55:14.720
you should probably go to that, because there are

55:14.720 --> 55:16.000
a lot of people that know how to play the games,

55:16.000 --> 55:17.760
and you'll get a lot of good matches there.

55:17.760 --> 55:18.880
All right.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.440
If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.

55:21.440 --> 55:24.280
I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.000
Awesome.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.200
Well, thanks for the wrap up, and I'm

55:26.200 --> 55:28.040
glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.120
You guys should call in next time with your report,

55:30.120 --> 55:32.000
because obviously, Chris had a hard time finding you guys,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
or her cell phone wasn't working, or something.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.040
All right, we'll do.

55:36.040 --> 55:36.640
See you guys later.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.840
All right, take care, buddy.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.840
Thanks for the call.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.840
Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons

55:40.840 --> 55:42.840
where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?

55:42.840 --> 55:44.400
Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?

55:44.400 --> 55:45.200
I always do.

55:45.200 --> 55:45.680
Really?

55:45.680 --> 55:47.360
The first place I go to is the NASA

55:47.360 --> 55:48.440
reports because I do cosplay.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.120
Really?

55:49.120 --> 55:49.640
Yes.

55:49.640 --> 55:49.960
All right.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.960
It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements

55:51.960 --> 55:54.720
on there and stuff.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.800
Dude, I'm going to do that at Fonami.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.920
Well, no, the big thing is, at least this

55:58.920 --> 56:01.400
has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer,

56:01.400 --> 56:02.640
especially doing something from something

56:02.640 --> 56:04.600
you know other people are going to be doing,

56:04.600 --> 56:07.080
you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.320
Oh, like the pictures that they all do.

56:09.320 --> 56:09.820
Exactly.

56:09.820 --> 56:10.320
Oh, OK.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.120
And there's also other groups meeting,

56:12.120 --> 56:15.080
like YaliCon had a bunch of doll fee collectors getting

56:15.080 --> 56:17.280
together, and that type of thing.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.920
The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards.

56:19.920 --> 56:21.000
Or the site forums.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.380
So once we find out Rama's room number,

56:23.380 --> 56:25.760
we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that

56:25.760 --> 56:28.720
says, naked twister at 9 PM in this room.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.800
No.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

56:33.200 --> 56:34.200
Raven's dolphin.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.880
Hello, Raven's dolphin.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.560
What's on your mind, Raven's dolphin?

56:39.560 --> 56:41.400
The we in the lake story.

56:41.400 --> 56:43.440
The we in the lake story, yes.

56:43.440 --> 56:46.640
Well, I know many guys have taken a we in the lake

56:46.640 --> 56:48.720
once or twice in their lives, but oh, yes,

56:48.720 --> 56:49.960
the Nintendo we in the lake.

56:49.960 --> 56:50.960
What's up with that?

56:50.960 --> 56:52.800
What do you have to say about that?

56:52.800 --> 56:54.160
You know, I agree with the guy.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.480
Divorce is imminent.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.960
I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water

56:57.960 --> 57:01.120
and get my we.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.840
Are you single, Raven's dolphin?

57:03.840 --> 57:04.320
Yeah.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.000
Call it a hunch.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.500
How are we going to remain that way?

57:06.500 --> 57:08.800
Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.

57:08.800 --> 57:13.640
God, I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.

57:13.640 --> 57:16.240
That's true.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.240
I'm hearing an echo, Raven's dolphin.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.160
You need to fix that echo.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.820
You've called in this show enough time.

57:20.820 --> 57:22.280
Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.280
Yeah, so is that this guy's problem?

57:24.280 --> 57:25.640
Is that maybe he should have just

57:25.640 --> 57:27.720
married somebody who understood the game thing a little more

57:27.720 --> 57:28.040
in the first place?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.320
He should have married a gamer.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.680
Yeah, I agree with him.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.720
And so is that what you're doing, Raven's dolphin?

57:32.720 --> 57:36.440
You're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?

57:36.440 --> 57:36.920
I am.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.080
I just want her to understand about me and my gaming

57:40.080 --> 57:40.600
edition.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.040
And she throws the we out.

57:42.040 --> 57:42.960
It's over.

57:42.960 --> 57:43.880
You know what, though?

57:43.880 --> 57:45.720
People do stupid things when they fight.

57:45.720 --> 57:48.200
I mean, people smash car windows.

57:48.200 --> 57:51.560
They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.880
I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.

57:53.880 --> 57:57.720
And it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.600
Because if she knew, like, hey, this

57:59.600 --> 58:01.680
is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.

58:01.680 --> 58:04.400
You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.

58:04.400 --> 58:06.400
You know, that's what she's going to do.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.480
So that's true.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.880
You just have to marry someone who

58:08.880 --> 58:11.000
can keep their temper in check.

58:11.000 --> 58:11.760
That's true.

58:11.760 --> 58:12.440
You're right.

58:12.440 --> 58:13.360
Oh, one more thing?

58:13.360 --> 58:13.880
Of course.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.760
What's up?

58:15.760 --> 58:17.400
This is a little old, but I thought

58:17.400 --> 58:20.320
that the Situa Wada thing was hilarious when you went,

58:20.320 --> 58:22.760
like, Reggie, you're not selling enough.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.360
Damn it, sell more.

58:24.360 --> 58:25.560
I'm not following.

58:25.560 --> 58:26.440
What was this news?

58:26.440 --> 58:28.240
It's been a while.

58:28.240 --> 58:31.200
Well, he said it was about the brain age.

58:31.200 --> 58:33.280
And he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.520
And you're up to sell 30,000.

58:35.520 --> 58:38.360
Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 brain

58:38.360 --> 58:40.840
age or 30,000 versus Europe?

58:40.840 --> 58:44.840
And I find it hilarious, like, wow, he's pissed.

58:44.840 --> 58:48.240
Well, you know, even though they are these public figure

58:48.240 --> 58:51.040
heads that we see, you know, they still have a job to do.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.160
And ultimately, you know, when the game

58:53.160 --> 58:55.280
doesn't sell the way they expected it,

58:55.280 --> 58:58.480
the big, big bosses want to know why and what happened

58:58.480 --> 59:00.040
and who's head's got to roll, who's

59:00.040 --> 59:03.000
got to get fired because of it.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.120
Reggie ain't going to get fired.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.440
I know Reggie ain't going to get fired.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.120
Reggie's invincible.

59:09.120 --> 59:11.360
Reggie is a god among men.

59:11.360 --> 59:14.320
Reggie's invincible, but Iwata does have the power

59:14.320 --> 59:17.200
if he wanted to, you know, bust some Reggie heads.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.320
I mean, if the only, think about it,

59:19.320 --> 59:21.680
the only person in the entire world who

59:21.680 --> 59:24.280
gets to yell at Reggie, actually there's

59:24.280 --> 59:27.740
two people in the world who get to yell at Reggie, his wife

59:27.740 --> 59:29.240
and Iwata.

59:29.240 --> 59:29.840
That's true.

59:29.840 --> 59:31.080
That's it.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.320
Sorry for that thing.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.040
That's all right.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.880
I had the microphone too high.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.080
Life goes on.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.440
Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks for the call, as always.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.080
Of course, bye.

59:39.080 --> 59:41.640
Have a good one, buddy.

59:41.640 --> 59:42.760
Let's go to another call.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:44.180 --> 59:45.640
Who's this?

59:45.640 --> 59:47.360
Hey, it's Aronimo.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.520
What's up, everyone?

59:48.520 --> 59:49.160
Hey, Jamie.

59:49.160 --> 59:49.680
What's up?

59:49.680 --> 59:50.320
Hi.

59:50.320 --> 59:53.040
Hey, Naked Twister, 9 o'clock, right?

59:53.040 --> 59:56.900
OK, before we start, there will be a $5 cover

59:56.900 --> 59:58.920
charge for the Drunk Show.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.000
Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.920
If you get in before the Editor Drunk Show,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.080
you can still qualify for Naked Twister.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.200
There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.480
That is not happening, Rama.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.320
That's a joke, OK?

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.000
I'm just going to say that right here.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.240
There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room, anyway.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.600
Oh, like I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.560
You know what's actually really funny about Fonomé?

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.200
Did I talk about this on last week's show?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.080
I'm not sure if it was on the show,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.720
if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.960
But my boyfriend wants to go to Fonomé,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.720
which is funny because, well, not just,

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.280
Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.320
That's why it's funny.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.680
That has nothing to do with it.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.960
No, but the reason why is because he's never really,

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.360
he watches Fonomé.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.480
He's familiar with Fonomé.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.440
He probably knows more about it than I do.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.320
In fact, he had a Doraemon book in his car, and I'm like,

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.160
oh, it's Doraemon.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.440
He's like, how in the hell did you know who that was?

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.360
He always jokes that I'm more Asian than he is.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.480
Doraemon.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.800
Whatever.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.840
See, I'm not that Asian, apparently.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.720
But anyway, where was I going with this?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.840
Oh, yeah, he doesn't really like, he doesn't go to the,

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.600
he wouldn't have no idea what to expect at the convention.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.680
He's like, you mean people dress up?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.240
I'm like, yeah, I'm like, you know,

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.960
big girls like to dress up like Sailor Moon.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.800
It's fun.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.520
And he says, so I can go as Tuxedo Mask?

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.160
They mistaken the whole Sailor Moon part

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.440
as actually not being moon sized, you know.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.280
Anyhow, so.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.720
I'm dressing up this year.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.840
If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.400
and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.200
going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.240
I have to, I have to have my skirt made.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.680
What do you, what do you cosplay as?

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.960
I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960
What?

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.560
That's cute.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.120
I like that.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.640
I have to get my wig finished, though.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.400
Is there a rest of the posse?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.160
Is there?

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.680
No, but Rob, you could cosplay.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.760
You could be the hero.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.920
I could.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.440
Why not?

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.040
It'll be fun.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.360
And then I'll have to whip you.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.400
And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.760
I actually have a full bullet.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.520
I'm not dressing up like a goblin.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.120
Please do.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.480
That would be funny.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.800
So does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.640
this year?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.240
No, no black mage costume.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.440
I had fun with that, though.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.000
Hey, Rama, can I borrow a mage costume?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.160
Sure, I'll pack it.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.040
Rad.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:17.880
OK.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.200
Sorry.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.160
Because I have the red hair and all.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.280
SSJ100Matt in our chat room suggests

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.040
that Loki should cosplay as Tingle.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.480
I am not dressing up like Tingle.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.360
Fuck no.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.240
All right, sorry Rama.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.920
What the hell would you call in for, anyway?

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.200
Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.840
Wait, like the movie, the first one?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.800
Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.520
Really?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.080
OK, now spoiler free, please, because Miklotov and I both

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.040
want to see this, but.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.120
Trust, do you have a strong stomach?

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.240
I want to see it, because I love the undead.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.640
I mean, load the undead.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.360
Miklotov and I both scream like girls at bad violence,

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.240
but that's part of the fun in going.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.160
You're going to scream.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.300
That's all I got to say.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:02:59.800
Really?

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.560
Oh, Miklotov's already putting on a pouty face.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.920
But it's really good, though.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.360
I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw up

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.080
stuff going on in that movie.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.360
And that's true.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.760
And I hate that.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.040
It's so gross.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.440
Rama, you know what you need to see

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.520
if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.000
What?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.680
Hot Fuzz.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.640
That's on my list.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.320
Well, maybe we could do it while we're out there.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.040
Come on, now.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.560
Yeah, that's what I just said.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.640
We can go see Hot Fuzz.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.600
Sorry, definitely.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.400
I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.480
where like, what more can I buy, and how many more pictures

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.560
can I be taken of?

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.920
Let's just go somewhere.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.640
Miklotov, let's go see that movie tomorrow

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.640
when I get back from LA.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.720
I'm going to cry.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.480
You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow,

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.200
do you?

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.440
No, I don't want to do that.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.160
Let's go see that movie and you can cry.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.680
Miklotov, Miklotov, suck it up.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.800
Dude.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.000
OK, I don't like zombies.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.400
I don't like that these people, even though they're not really

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.840
zombies because they're not dead,

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.480
they're people with a virus.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.160
But they're like zombies, and they throw up blood,

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.040
and they run really fast, and it's

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.440
going to scare the crap out of me.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.520
Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Rama,

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.720
so you understand.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.200
Yes, taking Shane to zombie movies,

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.360
taking X to fur on roller coasters.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.440
These are the, oh my god, it's killing me.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.760
That was so funny.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.080
Anyhow, sorry, these are the little pleasures in life.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.640
This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.720
can go see the movie.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.200
Sweet.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.920
I'm just going to miss out on playing bus to move at work.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.800
You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers,

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.600
some of them listen to this program, right?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.440
Why do I care?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.520
All right, just check it.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.240
Just want to make sure.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.400
They can all suck it.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.880
All thousands of listeners.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.960
I'm sorry, I'm inflating that number a lot.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.720
I meant dozens.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.160
All 14 listeners.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.520
All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.120
Yeah.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.840
Yeah.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.320
Whatever, I don't even care anymore.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.960
Rama, tell me something game related.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.520
Let's see, a couple of things.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.440
In response of last week, I have been listening

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.840
to this show for about five years.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.600
It'll be six years in January.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.120
How is that possible when we've only

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.920
been doing this show five years next month?

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.760
I remember, or maybe I'm off by you.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.680
I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.720
Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.200
Yes.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.700
OK.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.200
See?

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.160
Yes, the station started in 2000.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.880
No, yeah, the station started in 2002.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.380
Longest train wreck ever.

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:29.880
Forget it.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.460
Anyway, sorry.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.840
What, Rama?

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.640
No, Dr. Tetsuya wanted to throw it out,

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.640
so I accepted his challenge.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.720
Look, so, yeah, we start.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.480
Thank you, Junami.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.800
623 of 02 was the first live show.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.000
Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.680
Junami has.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.960
23 is the number of coincidence.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.520
Wait, what were you going to say, Rama,

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.680
about you've been listening to this show for five years,

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.760
and last week?

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.840
No, I think it was last week when Dr. Tetsuya called

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.280
and said about your biggest fans.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.720
You said it was me and Misty.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.240
I'm just trying to figure out how many years we've

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.640
been listening.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.640
You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.280
Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.600
last week.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.520
Yeah, because I am sure about it.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.440
She missed her, and I totally know.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.480
They all love you and miss you a lot, you know?

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.040
I know, she kind of just disappeared.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.920
But I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.960
and stuff, and she's doing her thing.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.320
But that happens, is folks sometimes,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.560
they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.720
But we hope you'll always remember us,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.080
and blah, blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.840
All right.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.840
The Rob D in chat says, Rama is such a fan

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.960
that he's been listening to you since before you've

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.160
been on the air.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.200
It means he was listening to Under Station.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.240
I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.840
by saying you were listening to Under Station Live.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.600
And I think that's how Dr. Tetsuya gets away with it,

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.040
because I think he was listening to Under Station Live.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.240
Dr. Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.200
appearances.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.240
Crazy.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.480
And I filled in for people.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.040
I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.440
Crazy times, old school.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.040
Anyway, sorry, Rama.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.640
Anything else you want to share with us?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:06:59.920
We're getting all this thought.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.360
I want to finish it off by saying,

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.920
in case you guys haven't heard yet,

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.320
we have a new video gamer in the world.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.480
Oh.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.280
You IMed me the other day.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.120
Yep.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.920
A new video, who's this?

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.480
My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.680
last Wednesday.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.360
Aw, what's the boy's name?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.040
Isn't bouncing unhealthy for babies?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.440
Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:22.960
Stop.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.040
Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.720
and started playing Street Fighter.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.360
That's awesome.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.560
On the first or second bounce.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.840
First.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.000
That's really awesome.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.520
You need to talk more on this program.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.880
All right, sorry, Rama, what's the kid's name?

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.800
Gabriel Henley.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.920
Gabriel.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.400
Why are you laughing?

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.600
Like Gabriel Knight, right?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.760
I believe so.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.880
Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.640
Is that?

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.160
No.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.920
OK, all right.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.640
I like that name.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.040
Thank you for spoiling, Rob.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.000
There's.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.080
That's not a spoiler.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.480
I didn't spoil a god damn thing.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.280
It's not a spoiler.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:56.800
All right.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.920
That's just his real name.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.840
Like Siler, somebody's going to be named Siler.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.680
Maybe if you could like watch the show.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.760
I work with somebody named Mileena.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.120
Is that Siler?

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120
No, but she's named after a video game

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.360
character from Mortal Kombat.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.840
Really, I work with someone named Katana.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.600
That's great.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.680
No, I lied.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.640
All right, Rama, we're going to let you go now,

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.480
because your phone calls derail our show too much.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.880
Hey, it gets the attention.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.400
It gets people happy in the chat.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.240
I did my job.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.240
Bye.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.280
One more call.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.520
Oop, did I miss this one?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.040
Damn it.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.240
All right, whoever was trying to call, call again.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.560
Somebody from an 805 area code is trying to call in.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.040
I don't recognize that number, so try calling back.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.160
I won't say the whole number on the air.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.480
Call back, because I just barely missed the call.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.280
And that phone number's been hammering us for a little bit,

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.680
so I wanted to get to it.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.640
There it is.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.760
Who's this?

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.320
Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.440
Hey, DJ Tyrant.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.240
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.120
Hey, not much.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.040
Just wanted to say off of your rant

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.960
there about the gold spam in WoW.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.560
I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened,

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.800
not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.120
What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.240
They're not going to do anything about it.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.600
2.1, they're supposed to change some of the reporting of users

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.160
and stuff like that.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.320
That's not going to do anything, because these are just

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.600
those people taking advantage of the 10-day free trials.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.200
And you can make as many of those as you want.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.480
That's all it is.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.520
So I don't know what they can do except take away

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.440
the 10-day free trials.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.960
Yeah.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.880
Or just have it like, OK, how hard would this be?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.760
You can message.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.360
How about this?

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.160
You can message a person, but then you

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.520
have to wait a minute before you can

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.680
message a different person.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.040
Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.680
Yeah, throttle it somehow that way

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.120
so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.960
I don't know.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.000
Hopefully they'll do that.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.120
And have you seen Blizzard's updates?

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.400
They're announcing their new progress

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.320
on Friday or Saturday, I believe.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.000
It was the 19th, right?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.720
Yeah, I remember the news story about the fact

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.080
that there's going to be an announcement on the 19th.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.520
But now, yeah, Blizzard, I did remember catching that.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.960
Blizzard has updated their website

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.240
with their little timeline.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.080
Like, first we brought you Warcraft I,

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.520
then Warcraft II and Diablo, and now who knows what's next?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.040
So it's kind of interesting.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.880
Speaking of WoW, is it OK if I promote

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.720
some of my other little projects I have on the side?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.600
I suppose.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.800
OK.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.520
Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website,

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.080
WoW.stratics.com, and we are having a developer chat

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.360
on Tuesday.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.920
So submit your questions through the IRC channel there.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.920
It's WoW.stratics.com.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.840
And it's been announced on the WoW web page,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.360
so check it out if you're interested in asking

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.280
the developers about the game or whatever.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.120
Awesome.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.200
And trying to make BlizzCon happen.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.740
I got to watch the moneys, but I want

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.440
to go to BlizzCon really bad.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.280
Yeah, it'll be fun.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.280
WoW was a blast, and we'll probably

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.040
see whatever they're going to announce this week there.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:18.880
We'll see.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.640
All right, buddy.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.080
We've got to let you go, but have a great one, OK?

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:22.720
Thanks a lot.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.840
No problem.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.600
Bye-bye.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.480
Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyran.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.320
Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.360
which airs Thursday nights on this very network,

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.240
but not for the next couple of weeks.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.440
They're taking a little bit of a break

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.640
because we all need a break once in a while,

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.120
but they'll be back pretty soon with more episodes.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.580
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.920
Who's this?

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.160
This is your mother, Rob.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.840
Hi, Mom.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.680
I didn't know you were listening to the program.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.640
What's on your mind?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.520
You didn't call me for Mother's Day.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.040
You're a terrible son.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.600
I wish I never had you.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.600
Well, I don't know if Alzheimer's

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.040
said in early or something, but you

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.160
might recall I actually took you out to lunch yesterday.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.560
That was yesterday.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.600
It's Mother's Day today.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.800
God, I'll tell you this right now

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.640
in front of all your listeners.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.640
You were adopted.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.880
What?

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880
I was adopted?

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.600
You were adopted.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.720
You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.640
Yes.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.240
Who's my real mother?

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.760
Well, I don't know because I traded you

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.400
with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.400
and a bottle of vodka.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.720
Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.760
What's wrong with you?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.680
I used to.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.800
Did you smoke while you were pregnant?

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.320
I hope not.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:55.960
Wait, no.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.520
Never mind.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.440
I was adopted.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.160
Did they smoke while I was pregnant?

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.840
Yeah, but you didn't pay enough attention in school.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.720
That's why you're my least favorite son.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.760
I don't really know what else to say, Mom.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.920
You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.280
and I'm crying.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.320
By the way, what video games have you

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.120
been playing this week, Mom?

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.080
Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me,

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.440
but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.960
The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.720
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.200
Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.760
What is that?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.360
One of those things that chinks like a disk

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.800
because it's 360 degrees?

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.680
Something like that.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.760
I'll have to explain it to you later.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.600
Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.040
I begrudgingly love you, Rob.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.480
I love you, too, prank caller impersonating my mother.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.480
All right.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.760
What the fuck are our listeners smoking?

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.920
Cocaine, Rob.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.380
And of course, now the chat room is

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.880
ringing up Cooking Mama because there was the Wii there.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.000
I really don't know how to respond to that.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.600
You should respond by hanging up quicker.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.560
I guess so.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:25.840
All right.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.080
Anyway, that's definitely going to do it

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.160
for the Skype line tonight.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.280
Congratulations, everybody.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.120
That call ruined it for the rest of you.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.280
We're going to go around and wrap up the show now

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.880
by first off asking if there's any last minute stories here

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.000
in the room.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.720
Any last minute stories?

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.960
I have a last minute story.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.240
Rob, your mom's cool.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.040
What's that?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.520
I have two last minute stories.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:51.280
First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.360
After five months of being broken, that's a story.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.320
What took so long?

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.500
Laziness.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.120
And I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.000
I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.760
out, I can play it.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.520
And then my last minute story is my Magikarp

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.960
evolved into a Gyarados.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.800
Congratulations.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.320
Thank you.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.600
You know, this is completely inappropriate.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.640
But I feel like after that phone call,

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.360
I have no choice but to do this.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.360
So we'll just give it a moment here.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.120
Oh, god.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:27.000
Hello?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:27.560
Hey, Dad.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.080
It's Rob.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.600
Yeah.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.160
Hey, how you doing?

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.240
Good, how are you doing?

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:32.880
Where you at?

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.380
Good.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.800
I'm doing a radio program on the internet right now.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.960
You know the one that embarrasses you that I do?

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.540
Yeah, I am.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.240
Yeah.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.680
All right.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.680
Is mom around?

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.200
Yeah.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.960
Can you put her on real quick?

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.840
Just a second.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.480
All right.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.720
Live radio, boys and girls.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.920
Have I mentioned that before?

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.840
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.800
Live radio while we wait.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.600
I'll play some music.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.760
I don't know what's going on.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.360
Hello?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.000
Hello, Mom?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.600
Yes.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.240
Hi, how are you?

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.480
Hello?

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.360
Hi.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.560
Can you hear me?

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.120
Yeah.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.040
All right.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.440
Yeah, I'm live on the radio doing the internet program.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.560
And Jamie and Matt are here too.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.120
OK.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:20.640
Hi.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.260
And I was calling first off to say Happy Mother's Day

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.520
officially.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.160
Thank you.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.760
But we had a caller just call in and impersonate you

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.000
and said a lot of really mean things to me,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.920
like they were impersonating being my mom

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.360
and really criticizing me.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.280
So I just called.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.720
Why were they impersonating me?

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.640
They don't know me.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.020
I know, because some people are really mean on the internet,

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:41.520
Mom.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.400
I don't know.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.720
But they were calling and saying that I know people are rude.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.040
I shouldn't take those things so seriously, huh?

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.560
What did they say?

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.600
What were they saying?

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.720
They were saying that, oh.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.800
That you were trading for vodka and cigarettes.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.440
Yes, that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.040
Is that true?

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.000
No.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.240
And I wasn't adopted?

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.200
No.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.660
OK, just making sure.

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.040
My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.320
Well, hey, Mom, I want to ask you.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.080
You know, when I was growing up, what did you think?

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.240
I played a lot of video games when I was growing up, huh?

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.000
Tons.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.800
Tons.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.800
Why did you let me play so many video games?

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.520
Because I was an idiot.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.760
Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this,

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.960
where I would have a radio program on the internet

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.640
with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.360
talking about games?

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.560
Not in my weirdest dreams.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.600
I know, it's kind of weird.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.480
How come you never played video games with me?

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.960
I don't like games.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.480
Why not?

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.440
What did the games do to you?

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.320
I don't know, they're boring.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.200
So they're boring?

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.800
I used to play card games with you.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.560
Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.520
Well, video games are too fast paced or something.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.560
There's something.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.480
I don't have the coordination.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.400
Well, you know, but if you played them more often,

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.480
you could build up the coordination.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.400
Maybe, but why would I want to do that?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.040
All right.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.640
Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangelandradio.com,

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.600
they're really liking you, Mom.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.160
JV Monn says she is awesome.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.880
DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.800
The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.680
Oh, really?

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.460
Yeah.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.340
So you're popular.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:35.600
You should come on the show sometime.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.720
I have been on it before, remember?

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.240
When I told the whole world about you

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.600
wearing the pink bunny suit?

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.360
Actually, that was a different show

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.000
that I did before Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.880
But thanks so much for resharing that story.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.120
I appreciate it.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.000
All right, so well, that's it.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.800
I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.560
really my mother.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.400
You really had a mother, and you didn't hatch out of an egg.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.520
Exactly, exactly.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.040
We have other theories about how Rob came to be.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.800
Well, when he was four years old,

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.480
he was like a little old man.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.600
And then when he got to high school,

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600
he reverted back to childhood.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.600
What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.080
I was four years old?

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.640
You were.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.160
You were like a little old man.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.320
You used to order everybody around.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.920
You were like the boss.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.360
I still do that.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.560
You were the boss of me when you were four.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.640
Did video games make me that way?

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.920
You were just really, you know, you were in an adult world.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.400
You didn't have a lot of other children around.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.920
Let's not get into the family drama here on the internet,

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.400
where lots of people are listening.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.160
So you kind of were old for your age.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.560
How do I say it?

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.840
And then when you got into high school, it was like,

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.040
what did I miss?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.640
And then so you started being a child,

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.920
dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.280
You do know this is a radio program about video games,

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:10.800
right?

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.520
And to clarify for the listeners,

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.040
that was the lip sync contest I entered once.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.080
I'm so glad we have a new story to talk about now.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.080
I already knew that one.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.240
No, that's a new one.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.480
Yeah, and the lips excited.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.760
And everyone can forget about the story

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.840
my mom talked about me being a smart ass.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:32.800
Look, suddenly Irene has appeared out of nowhere.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.840
I heard lip syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.520
So I have to open it on this.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.560
Jesus.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.320
When I was in high school, we participated

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.080
in this lip sync contest.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.960
And it was me and my two friends.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.080
And we did Hole by Violet.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.200
You know, go on, take everything.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.000
And I dressed up like Courtney Love.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.480
And my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.000
And my other friend dressed up like Drag Queen.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.920
And we all went out there and sang this song.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:03.600
And we came in last place because my school

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.880
was dominated by Mormons and other religious

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.560
fundamentalists.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.920
And they just didn't get it.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.600
But we had fun.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.400
Maybe you were just terrible at it.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.200
And I smoked a cigarette on stage, and my wig fell off.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.480
It was awesome.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.360
That's the best part.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.480
Did you film this at all?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480
Did anyone have to do?

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.040
I think it was on public access.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.520
I need to see this.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.880
But I really actually need to go, so bye.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.800
All right, bye.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.840
Anyway, sorry, mom.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.240
Thanks, mom, for bringing that up.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.040
I appreciate that.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.880
Oh, OK.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.160
What about all the good things I did?

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.640
Would you be one thing?

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.800
Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.800
Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.840
was in the newspaper and on the local news?

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.480
Uh-huh.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.560
Good.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.640
Very.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.120
She sounds so convinced.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.120
All right, mom, I appreciate you calling.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.480
I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.080
like, so there you go.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.240
Well, she's like a female rob.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.520
So a rob.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.120
Shut up, Shane.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.240
All right, mom, thanks so much for playing along.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240
I appreciate it.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.520
You always know on Mother's Day or something

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.120
to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.400
I love you.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.720
I was waiting for you to call, actually.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.000
I love you.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.520
And so do all the chatters.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.120
All right.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:20.800
All right, take care.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.600
Happy Mother's Day.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.120
Bye.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:22.880
Bye, friends.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.360
Bye.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.000
Did she say, bye, friend?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.760
I think she did.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.440
I think she's like, bye, friend.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.560
She said, friends.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.640
Oh, bye, friends.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.360
Yeah.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.480
That had nothing to do with you.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:33.680
I like your mom.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:33.920
I know.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.560
She's funny.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.120
I've met your mom in person.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.960
I like your mom, too, because of the whole.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.720
Why don't we call my mom next week?

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.120
Well, we just might have to.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.280
Or maybe, you know, who knows, it

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.760
might be her birthday or something.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.160
My mom's birthday's in November.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.400
Oh, it's a ways off.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.000
We'll see.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.760
Anyway, sorry.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.640
My mom's going to be 49, no, 48.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.000
My mom's going to be 49.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.960
I keep forgetting.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.520
This is actually part of the podcast,

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:01.320
so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.520
However, I would like to see, I do have a request.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.600
Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviews rejected

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.600
last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.400
or whatever it was.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.440
Like, iTunes was rejecting the word piss.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.000
Maybe you guys want to say, this show

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.280
is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:18.840
I don't know.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.720
That would be great.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.480
My mom would like that.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.200
I could show it to her.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200
And she'd be like, what?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.280
I don't get it.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.320
So there you go.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:24.840
All right.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.200
Anyhow, we got to wrap it up.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.560
Any last minute stories for real?

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.560
No.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.560
All right, nothing for you, Logie?

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.120
I'm surprised.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.640
He's distracted by the interwebs.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.120
I know.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.280
What are you doing on the internet?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.320
Stuff.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.200
All right.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.840
Crisis Corps coming out in Japan September 13.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.360
There you go.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.160
There you go.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.120
All right, well, then let's go around and get

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.400
everybody's final thoughts.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.400
Shane, thank you for being on the show,

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.520
even though you never say anything.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.320
But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.440
It's always funny.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.160
All right, so your final thought, Shane?

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.000
I don't know.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:02.800
All right, thanks.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.720
Thanks for sharing.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.280
All right, Logie, your final thought?

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.640
Stupid postage is going up to $0.41 tomorrow.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.760
My final thought is zombie movie, Shane.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.240
We're going to be fun.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.600
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.720
I have ice cream at home that's low sugar, and I can eat it.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.600
I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.440
because I was having a bad day, and I didn't eat that.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.560
But it was really good.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.640
So don't point at my fat.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.600
All right.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.280
I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.320
when it's in the theater.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.120
All right.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.080
All right, well, that's going to do it for another week

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.120
