0	28000	Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Fauna Bay!
28000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	46000	And we're here live at Fauna Bay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.
46000	49000	So thank you guys very much. I appreciate that.
49000	55000	And Loki's Mack Heckler is back from last year, so we appreciate you coming out.
55000	58000	Welcome to Fauna Bay everybody.
58000	62000	Thank you guys so much for coming out and we have verified Loki is recording this year, so we appreciate that, yes?
62000	64000	It's not paused, I'm paused.
64000	67000	Alright, awesome. So we're going to get right into it.
67000	71000	You know we like to start off our show talking about our gaming week and what we've been into.
71000	74000	So, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off. How was your gaming week?
74000	78000	I've been playing with my Pokemans. Let me show you them.
78000	80000	Are they in your pants right now?
80000	81000	No, they're in my purse.
81000	82000	Oh, okay. That's not as exciting.
82000	89000	After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it.
89000	94000	Interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
94000	98000	So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.
98000	102000	And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.
102000	105000	And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.
105000	107000	Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?
107000	108000	Well, yeah.
108000	114000	Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.
114000	119000	And also he had the double dragon thing. He's been playing a lot of that.
119000	124000	But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.
124000	126000	You're so random sometimes.
126000	127000	Well, no.
127000	129000	Do we have any Saturn fans in the house?
129000	131000	You know it's a dead system, right? They don't make games for it anymore.
131000	133000	It will never die.
133000	134000	Alright.
134000	135000	Knights.
135000	140000	Hey look, Sega's making the new knights for the Wii and Sega's track record.
140000	142000	I'm not too excited, I have to say.
142000	145000	Everything's been a let down since Phantasy Star Universe.
145000	147000	Anything else, Dark Sakura?
147000	148000	No.
148000	151000	No, alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?
151000	157000	I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because I can't stop playing the damn game.
157000	163000	And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.
163000	172000	Now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on two gig memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.
172000	175000	So this is going to be even faster. About ten times faster actually.
175000	186000	And then, other than that, just co-op Crackdown and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta. Not too much because I don't really care.
186000	190000	Is it just me or is Halo 3 just Halo 2 like a little prettier?
190000	191000	Yeah.
191000	193000	I thought it was just me. But I've never been a big fan of first person shooters.
193000	198000	At least you can jump in it. I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.
198000	201000	It's like jump technology. It's now. It's not later.
201000	203000	Perfect dark zero jumping?
203000	207000	Yeah, seriously. You need to be able to jump in that game.
207000	212000	Alright. My gaming week. Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.
212000	218000	And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week. I've played about every new game they have out there.
218000	224000	And Russian Attack. What was that? I never played that game back in the 80s. I don't even remember that game.
224000	226000	I remember. It's really hard.
226000	230000	But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past ten years.
230000	235000	So it should be no surprise that the game showed up on Xbox Live. But they did a nice job with it. It's nice.
235000	238000	And you get punched in the face when you die. And that's kind of funny.
238000	244000	And sometimes they punch you in the back. And my roommate was like, did you just get donkey punched to death?
244000	246000	We don't have any kids in the audience.
246000	251000	Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?
251000	254000	I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive. They just hate us.
254000	256000	We need Kid Dracula for life.
256000	260000	They hate us. I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.
260000	264000	Like, you know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?
264000	267000	No. If you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious.
267000	271000	Which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.
271000	278000	Like, I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s. You know, like your Gradius and your R-types of the world.
278000	279000	R-type is sexy.
279000	284000	Exactly. All right. So that's it. How about you guys? What have you been playing this week?
284000	285000	Wow.
285000	287000	Pokemons. Wow.
287000	288000	Mario.
288000	290000	Mario. Pop and music.
290000	291000	DJ Max Portable 2.
291000	292000	Huh?
292000	293000	DJ Max Portable 2.
293000	296000	DJ Max Portable 2. Oh, that's a hardcore music fan there.
296000	299000	Stolen copies of Oh and Don 2. All right.
299000	302000	Luckily, no one listens to this show, so the feds won't be after you.
302000	304000	So I play it like you stole it?
304000	307000	BBNA 2DS. I actually did play Oh and Don 2, speaking of that.
307000	312000	It's, you know, there's a, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.
312000	320000	But, no, it's not as good. But they have a mode in it in Oh and Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.
320000	325000	And it makes the game infinitely harder. It's kind of sad. So I'm really horrible at it.
325000	331000	So, anyway, some quick housekeeping. Since this is going to our podcast feed, we just wanted to say for our listeners out there,
331000	334000	we're actually not going to be live on June 10th, because I'm going on vacation.
334000	338000	And so everybody's going on vacation that week, so there'll be no live show June 10th.
338000	341000	That's the week after this one. No Disneyland this time.
341000	342000	No Disneyland.
341000	344000	I'm actually going to New York City this time.
344000	348000	And actually we have, straight from New York City in the back there, Rama.
348000	352000	If you've ever listened to the show, he's the guy that calls in like every week.
352000	354000	He's here. Come up here and say something, Rama.
354000	358000	Did anybody come from further than New York? I didn't think so.
358000	361000	So say something to the folks, Rama.
361000	363000	Call in first.
363000	365000	Ring, ring. How you doing?
365000	367000	I'm doing good. How about you guys?
367000	371000	Good. So we're going to hang in New York City, right? We're going to do another OLR con something.
371000	373000	Oh, yeah. Let me ask you, do you like sushi?
373000	374000	It's all right.
374000	376000	I know, a couple of cool places.
376000	379000	Sounds good. All right. So we'll check the forums for more information on the Meetup.
379000	383000	And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
383000	384000	Maybe.
384000	385000	All right. Sounds good.
385000	388000	But if it wasn't for dark soccer, I would not be here.
388000	390000	Thank you, Rama.
390000	396000	That makes me feel happy in a special place.
396000	399000	Careful. This is a family event. All right.
399000	402000	In my liver.
402000	406000	I was going to ask if there's any other website plugs in the house, because we're here pimping our website.
406000	409000	We thought we'd give you a chance to pimp yours since you came out and saw us.
409000	411000	Anybody have a website?
411000	413000	Anime secrets dot org.
413000	415000	Anybody else?
415000	417000	Anime hell dot org.
417000	419000	Anime hell dot org. That sounds like fun.
419000	421000	Anime sucks dot biz.
421000	423000	Anime sucks dot biz. Is that even a real site?
423000	425000	I think so.
425000	426000	All right.
426000	430000	It's a dot biz site. Of course it's real.
430000	432000	You don't just give those to anybody.
432000	437000	I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says like Viagra, Viagra now, Viagra.
437000	443000	No, it lists a bunch of different various themes on it. You can buy this for your soul or something.
443000	445000	Google dot com.
445000	450000	Google, Google dot com. How about porno2?
450000	456000	I found out though that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.
456000	457000	All right.
457000	459000	All right. Enough of the website plugs.
459000	461000	No beetards allowed.
461000	463000	Let's get into some news this week, because we don't have a whole lot of time.
463000	470000	We're going to talk about some gaming news. How many of you guys excited for a Super Smash Brothers Melee on the Nintendo Wii?
470000	472000	About freaking time, I agree.
472000	473000	Brawl.
473000	475000	Oh, whoops.
475000	478000	Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.
478000	480000	Yes, thank you. Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
480000	483000	Sorry. I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while actually.
483000	488000	But of course there's a website up the Smash Brothers Dojo and they have this whole blog going on there.
488000	493000	And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.
493000	498000	And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.
498000	503000	I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi Totaka.
503000	505000	What's his name? The little, his dog?
505000	506000	Totakeke.
506000	507000	That's right.
507000	512000	And you have Kenji Yamamoto who did Super Metroid, the Metroid Prime series.
512000	515000	Jun Fukuda who did Killer7.
515000	516000	Other stuff too.
516000	517000	This is amazing.
517000	518000	They just have this whole list here.
518000	521000	You've got the guy from Kingdom Hearts, Yoko Shimomura.
521000	523000	You've got the guy from Fire Emblem.
523000	526000	Yansori Mitsuda from Chrono Trigger.
526000	530000	And my favorite, Yuzoku Shiro from Actraiser Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum Tune.
530000	534000	I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.
534000	537000	They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum Tune in the game.
537000	539000	You think that would be one of the hidden characters?
539000	541000	If it worked for Fighters Megamix, then...
541000	545000	I hope our mics are picking up some of the heckling from the audience.
545000	546000	That's great.
546000	549000	So, yeah, what do you guys think might be some of the...
549000	556000	Because some folks are reading into this that maybe this list is going to be revealing some of the future hidden characters that we have in the game.
556000	560000	Like, you know, we have, yeah, you have, well, I don't know so much about Yuzoku Shiro because he's the narrative.
560000	563000	But look, what if you had Chrono in the game?
563000	564000	Give us the master.
564000	567000	I was actually looking at Iraha for Silfied.
567000	571000	Well, you think of planets that come in and...
571000	575000	From Game Arch, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.
575000	578000	Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.
578000	581000	You know, well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.
581000	583000	Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.
583000	585000	Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?
585000	586000	That would be fun.
586000	587000	Cut up Mario.
587000	588000	It would be a good time.
588000	590000	We've already got Snake ready to garrote, you know.
590000	594000	Rama wants to see the Black Mage from...
594000	599000	We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.
599000	601000	All right, so yeah, that's that.
601000	603000	So I'm definitely looking forward to this game.
603000	608000	And the website's been updating a lot with character profiles and all that stuff, so good times.
608000	613000	Well, in other news, you know, how many people are a fan of Geometry Wars?
613000	614000	Woo!
614000	615000	Woo, okay.
615000	616000	You know, like four? All right, good deal.
616000	623000	Well, there is some talk going around that Geometry Wars Galaxies is aiming for the Wii and the DS.
623000	625000	So imagine having your...
625000	629000	I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.
629000	633000	I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.
633000	638000	You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.
638000	641000	Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?
641000	642000	Oh, on the Wii.
642000	644000	Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.
644000	650000	Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around,
650000	653000	and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.
653000	659000	Well, one thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.
659000	662000	I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.
662000	664000	It is going to be multiplayer.
664000	665000	Online?
665000	666000	Online.
666000	667000	Online.
667000	668000	On the Wii?
668000	669000	Yes, on the Wii.
669000	672000	Then why would they say that they specified single-player?
672000	675000	Well, because they're going to have like the single-player campaign, right?
675000	676000	No.
676000	679000	Story mode for Geometry Wars?
679000	680000	A square approaches.
680000	686000	On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.
686000	689000	So, they decided to kill them all.
689000	690000	Wow.
690000	693000	How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?
693000	694000	That's going to be something else.
694000	695000	Well, here's how they are basically.
695000	697000	In the nightmare of a mathematician.
697000	703000	They said, well, early tests it says with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising,
703000	706000	and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.
706000	710000	This is according to a new story now on Joystick.
710000	713000	So, interesting.
713000	717000	I'm more excited about the fact that the Wii version is online, because what Wii online
717000	718000	games do they have?
718000	719000	Nothing.
719000	722000	Well, Pokemon is going to be the first one.
722000	724000	That's not out yet.
724000	726000	No, about a month.
726000	727000	Anyways.
727000	732000	I like Trauma Center online where you can, you know, kill your patients together.
732000	734000	Cause trauma.
734000	738000	So, if you're, you know, a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of
738000	741000	the download games, and coming to the Virtual Console soon you're going to have some pretty
741000	747000	good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there,
747000	749000	kind of their version of the ESRB.
749000	751000	So, that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.
751000	757000	Also, according to Nintendo Power, coming to the Virtual Console there.
757000	759000	Paper Mario, the original.
759000	762000	So, you'll be able to check that out as well.
762000	767000	Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega
767000	772000	Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?
772000	773000	Yeah.
773000	774000	Right?
774000	775000	On the GameCube?
775000	776000	anniversary collection.
776000	779000	Okay, and this you could probably pick up for 20 bucks new, maybe even less used, right?
779000	780000	Yeah.
780000	782000	And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.
782000	783000	Yeah.
783000	786000	And they're going to charge me five bucks for old school Mega Man Y.
786000	787000	Yeah.
787000	789000	Well, because you'll buy it.
789000	791000	People are stupid.
791000	792000	Is it the convenience of it?
792000	794000	It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.
794000	796000	Well, you can get it on eBay.
796000	798000	I'm sure it's not that hard to find.
798000	800000	Oh, but that involves me buying it online.
800000	801000	I mean, who shops online?
801000	803000	14 bucks?
803000	806000	Game crazy, 14 bucks, says the audience.
806000	812000	Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon.
812000	815000	ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.
815000	820000	And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.
820000	825000	Which I could just play at home on the Neo Geo.
825000	828000	By the way, it's about freaking time ActRaiser's on its way over here.
828000	831000	It's rumored because ESRB has a rating now.
831000	832000	Well, come on.
832000	833000	Japan's got it.
833000	834000	Europe's got it.
834000	836000	How long do I have to wait for my ActRaiser?
836000	837000	Forever.
837000	838000	That's one word.
838000	840000	How long am I supposed to download it?
840000	841000	I know.
841000	842000	Don't worry.
842000	843000	Don't worry, Rob.
843000	846000	The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere
846000	847000	in a box.
847000	848000	It's on schedule.
848000	851000	It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.
851000	853000	They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel.
853000	856000	And then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.
856000	857000	Joy.
857000	858000	All right.
858000	861000	Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?
861000	864000	Thank you, Jamie.
864000	866000	Hey, only for one game.
866000	869000	This is kind of interesting.
869000	870000	There's a couple.
870000	873000	There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.
873000	874000	Well, I don't know.
874000	877000	Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.
877000	878000	Oh, wait, wait.
878000	879000	I forgot.
879000	882000	I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.
882000	883000	Oh, my God.
883000	887000	That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?
887000	889000	Was it you that wrote it?
889000	892000	Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fanboy.
892000	894000	Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.
894000	896000	They were basically saying, what are you talking about?
896000	899000	Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.
899000	903000	They didn't list all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
903000	906000	I don't know if that's a game or not.
906000	907000	Life is a game.
907000	912000	I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft,
912000	917000	and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.
917000	918000	All right.
918000	919000	Well, maybe, I don't know.
919000	922000	Maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.
922000	923000	I don't know.
923000	924000	But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?
924000	925000	No.
925000	930000	Well, then you won't care because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now thanks to the 1.80 patch.
930000	931000	Why can't it do?
931000	933000	You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.
933000	936000	And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled too.
936000	939000	So that's kind of fun if you can actually notice the difference.
939000	943000	Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.
943000	946000	You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.
946000	947000	Ooh.
947000	949000	My Epson printer sucks.
949000	955000	You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.
955000	959000	So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.
959000	961000	And PSP remote play over the Internet.
961000	972000	One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out, though, a really nice high-scale printer that will do, you know, high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.
972000	980000	So imagine something like that, though, with the, you know, printing out your PlayStation stuff to, you know, as nice as those would come out.
980000	985000	Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?
985000	986000	Rob.
986000	987000	Anyway.
987000	988000	Rob.
988000	989000	What?
989000	990000	Rob.
990000	991000	Rob.
991000	992000	What?
992000	993000	All right.
993000	994000	All right.
994000	995000	Even live.
995000	997000	I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.
997000	998000	All right.
998000	999000	So that's it.
999000	1002000	For God's sake, I'm healed by the power of evil.
1002000	1003000	All right.
1003000	1006000	So, Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3?
1006000	1007000	News wise.
1007000	1008000	Actually, yes.
1008000	1009000	What's that?
1009000	1011000	Which is a big, you know, what do you?
1011000	1019120	back up according to a game facts forum member that I know this is why I'm like
1019120	1028160	well to be fair it's from PSN magazine it's it's a guy that saw it was a forum
1028160	1035640	post by a guy who had a magazine but at any rate they were saying that rumors
1035640	1040600	are popping up again about the six axis having rumble feature again and actually
1040600	1044920	I could see it happening because you know Sony and immersion you know said
1044920	1050560	okay this is stupid and you know money was involved of course so it could
1050560	1054780	happen I don't really miss it the only game that I ever thought the rumble
1054780	1059760	feature was any good in was like the first Metal Gear Solid I was to say
1059760	1062840	yeah Metal Gear Solid 4 coming I will move your controller with the power of
1062840	1071000	my mind it had a zen of gears reference to it before the game came out yeah
1071000	1075240	remember rumble is so last-gen remember that I remember when you used to have to
1075240	1080480	attach things to get your rumble oh is that is are you talking about the res
1080480	1092680	thingy I'm talking about the Nintendo 64 anyways something coming to the
1092680	1099200	PlayStation 3 and also 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 and it's getting a limited
1099200	1104400	edition as well basically you're gonna get this nice little almost looks like a
1104400	1109480	lockbox or a metal safety deposit box and included in that will be an art book
1109480	1113880	a soundtrack which you know their soundtracks are always awesome and key
1113880	1120040	chain and of course keys to the safety deposit box yay crap I don't need I have
1120040	1124600	my order already you know that sounds like a good so and a limited-edition
1124600	1134720	Rockstar duffel bag $90 okay that that's that's actually a good set that would be
1134720	1137840	something worth while again the the card capture Sakura box on Dreamcast was
1137840	1144880	ridiculous you know I can't I think it's cool to get an art book and to get you
1144880	1148120	know a CD and to get a duffel bag I don't think it's as cool to get a plate
1148120	1154640	o'clock and a fork how many of you cool kids want a Rockstar duffel bag that's
1154640	1157760	what I thought one two three all the girls raised their hand first that was

1445640	1451220	do you do you touch her and she goes whatever star soldier though has a
1451220	1454160	special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever
1454160	1460560	star Parodia anyone ever is a PC engine fan star Parodia is a game where you
1460560	1468240	play as bomber man or a flying PC engine or the what was the or this or the the
1468240	1470600	plane from star soldier and you basically play through a parody of star
1470600	1474840	soldier but but I like playing as a flying PC engine oh please say those

1508760	1514760	for PC and a History Channel game great battles of room oh yeah and Tomb Raider
1514760	1518200	but who cares okay and warrior master of disguise and
1518200	1524000	medias Disney Edition good times medias Disney Edition I never did pick that up
1524000	1527720	over here anybody have medias Disney Edition in the house anybody it's not
1527720	1531960	much this is not selling very well remember remember medias Disney Edition
1531960	1541440	goes faster at night I hate you um just kidding now this this is lawsuits must
1541440	1543760	go faster at night as well because there's another one that just came out
1543760	1548400	this week and Sony got the smackdown about blu-ray why are you applauding
1548400	1554520	that that's kind of sad actually didn't Meg Z say so right from the beginning
1554520	1561920	really what I don't remember what how can it fail well you of course you know
1561920	1564920	Sony's already been in court before they had to pay all those damages to
1564920	1569680	immersion over it and what happened is that target technology not the store but
1569680	1573440	target technology actually filed the suit earlier this month and it has to do
1573440	1577000	with patent violations and they're related to Sony's blu-ray technology and
1577000	1583800	basically the Sony or the suit says that Sony America Sony Pictures Sony da DC it
1583800	1586660	says that all their products marketed under the blu-ray name actually
1586660	1590520	infringe on a patent that target already owns for these reflective layer
1590520	1594480	materials and optical discs so it's another one of those like hey we
1594480	1597520	invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about
1597520	1603920	it until now no it seems like doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience no
1603920	1609880	because they were using it on DVDs on dual layer DVDs for a while so but I'm
1609880	1614400	talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now and that's that's what
1614400	1619200	I mean about these lawsuits like did did somebody just roll out of bed and see
1619200	1622360	the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3 you know how long things
1622360	1625000	take in the corporate world once you realize that you've got a problem how
1625000	1629360	long does it take to go through meetings check with legal I don't know do we have
1629360	1636560	any rocks or fans in the house that might know anybody just just teasing
1636560	1641680	little DDR joke by the way for any for anything that occurs in the corporate
1641680	1646000	world you can expect at least a three month delay when before they start
1646000	1650000	thinking about doing something all right well this is sure to cause another
1650000	1655320	lawsuit but yes no one can hear you no one here you're on the he's bringing up
1655320	1658800	the whole issue with blackberry hurry up hurry up come on anyway that's 20
1658800	1664320	minutes so they need to ask orange lunch go go go go go go rapid fanboy power go
1664320	1667520	basically same thing happened with blackberry and research in motion
1667520	1670400	research in motion suit blackberry over different copyright infringements and
1670400	1673760	patent technologies and stuff they settled out but if they had one they
1673760	1676760	would be no longer been able to sell blackberries and all that and those who
1676760	1683520	use them would have been screwed that's a pretty massive market all right well
1683520	1687240	speaking of things that are likely to get sued over the dark soccer likes to
1687240	1690880	surf the internet up and down and all over every week and find her favorite

1783760	1789160	have a little a little bit of a story I want about to tell you all right it was
1789160	1795200	like I think it was about 2001 it was 2001 it was over at the yes Santa Clara
1795200	1800800	Convention Center and I believe it was um it was the same year that our good
1800800	1805960	friend Mel had won his DDR machine it was it was yeah he won a solo 2000
1805960	1813640	it was out March of 2001 and one of those nights I got a little a little
1813640	1820360	tipsy rather inebriated and it was less than I was feeling the need to play some
1820360	1826480	some DDR so I go down to where the DDR machines are at they had the solo
1826480	1830520	machine right behind where the fourth place was that and I got my little games
1830520	1834800	on played it I was really really little tipsy to a point where I actually tried
1834800	1841160	to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the on the on the pad so but the knee drop
1841160	1846880	was leet yeah it was next thing you know my friend Brandon decides you know
1846880	1852640	checks me up puts a bandage on my knee and as I decide to uh sit down and try
1852640	1858080	to relax try to relax and just like try to sober up so I sit down over at the
1858080	1862760	right by the side of the ER machine and I'm sitting right next to this woman and
1862760	1870360	I look to her and I say hi how are you my name is Wendell what are you and this
1870360	1877320	woman I'm the love doctor and strangely enough the woman replies to me and says
1877320	1883760	hi my name is Jamie otherwise known as Dark Sakura so this was the first time
1883760	1887480	that I actually first met Dark Sakura and then I was formally introduced her
1887480	1893080	at the you turn sober when I was sober later on in October for a tournament
1893080	1898160	though Batman is probably like a very special place where I first met the very
1898160	1903640	lovely and talented Dark Sakura there's another note to that you play DDR with
1903640	1907120	me when I was still trying to pass sevens and you passed and you passed
1907120	1912960	your first eight that night I think I believe it was drunk drunk yes also
1912960	1917280	remember that after I spoke with her I proceeded to fall asleep right next to
1917280	1925800	her and then everybody came up it was Mike no no no and all of them came and
1925800	1933520	fetched you I think that was the case because I deprived and he was one night
1933520	1943320	drunk I don't remember the rest of that night Wendell I got one more question

1998760	2001920	about stories here so all right so the website of the week is Fonda me calm and
2001920	2006800	you can pre-write your 2008 yes do it all right all right what's up next
2006800	2014160	well an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic traveled
2014160	2022200	through time killed a baby anyways and that is no not the Phantom Phantom
2022200	2028880	never came out but anyways that is the claim apparently of some folks that are
2028880	2034400	trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart claiming that an overheated Xbox power
2034400	2040840	supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade
2040840	2047640	unfortunately box stole my baby they're seeking they're seeking 50,000 in
2047640	2054920	damages that's all yes you know this I really I really shouldn't make cuz you
2054920	2061440	know a baby did die and that's really sad but somebody's suing Microsoft over
2061440	2065440	but here's the best part though this is the best part remember this took place
2065440	2070960	in December 2004 however Microsoft a representative was kind to remind us
2070960	2075600	that the 360 was not available in December of 2004 and in fact came out a
2075600	2083080	few years later I don't know about you guys but when I hear about idiotic
2083080	2087000	lawsuits involving our beloved video games I get very angsty what about you
2087000	2091240	guys I'm permanently angsty so you know what that means it's high time for the
2091240	2112720	FUs of the week yes I can smell the funk a fanboy a mile down the road at the
2112720	2118640	pita place do yourselves a favor if you're going to go to a convention if
2118640	2123080	you can pay to get in and buy crap in the dealer's room you can afford to use

2129040	2133800	the breeze in your you know package every year
2136160	2143480	the breeze on my package might burn a little bit actually all right my FU of

2148160	2151840	passed on the way here they are out in force today
2151840	2158040	my FU of the week goes to Comcast and I'll explain why I'm watching a TV show
2158040	2162240	it sounds like this all sudden commercial comes on and it's like that
2162240	2168480	I hate the fact that the volume jumps up like 50 fucking decimals when a
2168480	2173360	commercial comes on I'm just sitting there watching TV all them buy stuff no
2173360	2181760	it's like okay Wow so after you the Comcast um that's it for the FUs of the
2181760	2185120	week we only have about 10 minutes left and we want to get to your questions so
2185120	2188520	we're really gonna jam through these last few stories we have for you guys of
2188520	2191120	course there's a lot of gaming news this week we couldn't get to but if you want
2191120	2196440	to hear more tune in next week at orange lounge radio.com there is an 80 gigabyte
2196440	2200840	PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea if you live in South Korea

2204480	2207800	that's gonna be coming over to South Korea it's gonna cost you five hundred
2207800	2212400	and fifty six dollars and it lands on June 16th could it be coming to the US
2212400	2216960	but what's 20 gigs gonna do I mean what exactly can you put on that drive right
