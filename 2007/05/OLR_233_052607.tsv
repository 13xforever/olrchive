14365	20129	Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Funabay!
31693	36655	Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36695	41078	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41398	46040	And we're here live at Fonamay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.
46080	47120	So thank you guys very much.
47140	48401	I appreciate that.
48941	51583	And Loki's Mac Heckler is back.
53448	54689	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
54709	56030	I've been playing with my Pokemans.
56050	56611	Let me show you them.
56631	58072	Are they in your pants right now?
80313	80993	No, they're in my purse.
81073	81494	Oh, okay.
81534	82374	That's not as exciting.
82734	93741	After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it, interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
94501	98043	So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.
98123	101525	And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.
102386	104447	And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.
105666	107727	Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?
107867	112668	Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.
113909	117430	And also he had the Double Dragon thing.
117470	118270	He's been playing a lot of that.
118890	123292	But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.
124272	125532	You're so random sometimes.
126753	127993	We have any Saturn fans in the house?
129054	130194	You know it's a dead system, right?
130214	131014	They don't make games for you anymore.
131034	131934	It will never die.
133235	133515	All right.
134472	137676	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
154724	156566	because I can't stop playing the damn game.
157206	162551	And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.
162731	171700	We're now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on 2GB memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.
172140	174242	So it's going to be even faster, about 10 times faster, actually.
175323	178866	And then, other than that, just co-op...
180799	183120	Crackdown, and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta.
183280	185121	Not too much, because I don't really care.
186001	189462	Is it just me, or is Halo 3 just Halo 2, like a little prettier?
190003	190163	Yeah.
190483	191703	Okay, I thought it was just me.
191723	193724	But I've never been a big fan of first-person shooters.
193764	194764	At least you can jump in it.
194804	197806	I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.
198826	200146	It's like jump technology.
200246	201747	It's now, it's not later.
201767	202867	Perfect Dark Zero jumping?
204188	206729	Yeah, seriously, you need to be able to jump in that game.
207054	207314	All right.
208154	208915	My gaming week.
208975	212436	Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.
212796	216478	And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
216518	218218	I've played about every new game they have out there.
218759	220139	And Russian Attack.
220639	221119	What was that?
221740	223380	I never played that game back in the 80s.
223400	224681	I don't even remember that game.
224761	225101	I remember.
225141	225721	It's really hard.
225801	230343	But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past 10 years.
230708	230988	DarkSakura
245084	246044	We don't have any kids in the audience.
246144	250505	Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?
251245	253325	I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive.
253385	253966	They just hate us.
254326	256006	We need Kid Dracula for life.
256026	256346	They hate us.
256646	260087	I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.
260547	264447	You know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?
264767	271088	No, if you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious, which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.
271609	273829	I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s.
274614	277435	DJ Max Portable 2 DJ Max Portable 2
304710	305330	BBNA 2DS.
305390	307271	I actually did play Owen Don 2, speaking of that.
307751	312172	You know, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.
314113	314793	No, it's not as good.
314813	319555	But they have a mode in it, in Owen Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.
320095	320875	And it makes the game...
321508	323549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
350365	352005	He's the guy that calls in like every week.
352386	352826	He's here.
352906	354006	Come up here and say something, Ranma.
355606	357247	Did anybody come from further than New York?
357747	358347	I didn't think so.
358447	361548	So say something to the folks, Ranma.
363709	364109	Ring, ring.
364849	365269	How you doing?
365829	366409	I'm doing good.
366449	367169	How about you guys?
367189	367510	Good.
367750	369150	So we're going to hang in New York City, right?
369170	371131	We're going to do another OLR con something.
371771	372171	Oh, yeah.
372211	373291	Let me ask you, do you like sushi?
374271	374731	It's all right.
374912	376132	I know a couple of cool places.
376232	376552	Sounds good.
377188	379649	All right, so we'll check the forums for more information on the meetup.
380149	383131	And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
383431	383811	Maybe.
383871	384611	All right, sounds good.
385352	387773	If it wasn't for DarkSakura, I would not be here.
388873	392255	Thank you, Ranma.
392935	395236	That makes me feel happy in a special place.
396236	398177	Careful, this is a family event.
398597	398918	All right.
399618	400298	In my liver.
402492	403653	AnimeSecrets.org AnimeHell.org AnimeSucks.biz
430154	431655	They don't just give those to anybody.
431675	437138	I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says, like, Viagra, Viagra Now, Viagra... Anyway.
437398	440720	No, it lists a bunch of different various, you know, themes on it.
440740	443902	You can buy this for your soul or something.
444763	446004	Google, google.com.
446044	455770	How about... However, I found out... I found out, though, that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.
456690	457210	All right.
457591	458031	Enough of the...
458379	460121	No B-tards allowed.
461302	463644	Let's get into some news this week because we don't have a whole lot of time.
463664	464985	We're going to talk about some gaming news.
465025	467667	How many of you guys are excited for Super Smash Bros.
467828	469189	Melee on the Nintendo Wii?
470430	473453	About freaking time, I agree.
473553	478057	Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.
478999	480199	Yes, thank you, Super Smash Bros.
480239	480560	Brawl.
480600	483481	Sorry, I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while, actually.
483921	485981	But, of course, there's a website up, the Smash Bros.
486022	488162	Dojo, and they have this whole blog going on there.
488622	492884	And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.
493424	497806	And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.
497886	502447	I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi, Totaka.
503288	504288	What's his name, the little...
505378	506239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
526173	530258	and my favorite, Yuzo Koshiro from Actraiser, Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum 2.
530498	534082	And I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.
534122	537206	They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum 2 in the game.
537466	538767	You think that would be one of the hidden characters?
539068	541270	If it works for Fighters Megamix, then...
546727	548168	I was actually looking at Iraha for Sylphid.
571181	572983	You think a plane's going to come in and shoot?
573143	575965	From Game Arts, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.
576225	579168	Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.
579228	582191	Well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.
582211	584172	Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.
584192	585674	Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?
585714	586234	That would be fun.
586674	587255	Cut up Mario.
587315	588296	It would be a good time.
588316	590618	We've already got Snake ready to garrot.
590738	594822	Ranma wants to see the Black Mage.
594882	598625	We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.
600880	603602	I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.
629858	633319	I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.
633979	638381	You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.
638601	642442	Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?
642562	644463	Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.
645063	653066	Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.
653786	659388	One thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.
659986	662207	I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.
662968	664068	It is going to be multiplayer.
665229	665869	But on the Wii?
666309	666750	Online.
666970	667390	On the Wii?
667590	668731	Yes, on the Wii.
668791	670011	About freaking time.
670031	671632	They specified single player.
672472	675054	Because they're going to have the single player campaign, right?
675114	675414	No.
676234	679276	Story mode for Geometry Wars?
679536	680777	A square approaches.
680797	686079	On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.
687100	688921	So they decided to kill them all.
690017	690377	Wow.
691318	693300	How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?
693320	694281	That's going to be something else.
694441	696723	Here's how they're basically... In the nightmare of a mathematician.
697323	706051	They said, well, early tests, it says, with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising, and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.
706533	711957	Trauma Center Online, where you can, you know, kill your patients together.
711977	712677	Cause trauma.
734323	738605	So if you're a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of the download games.
738745	748710	And coming to the Virtual Console soon, you're going to have some pretty good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there, kind of their version of the ESRB.
749190	751091	So that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.
751251	759116	Also, according to Nintendo Power coming to the Virtual Console there, Paper Mario, the original.
759376	761057	So you'll be able to check that out as well.
761417	761577	Cool.
762356	771642	Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?
772002	772143	Yeah.
772283	772443	Right?
772503	772883	On the GameCube?
772903	774004	On the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
774044	778367	Okay, and this you could probably pick up for $20 new, maybe even less used, right?
778767	779007	Yeah.
779507	781949	And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.
782329	782609	Yeah.
782649	787433	And they're going to charge me $5 for old school Mega Man Y. Yeah.
787933	788713	Because you'll buy it.
789074	789374	Yeah.
790225	791065	People are stupid.
791145	792285	Is it the convenience of it?
792365	793966	It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.
795246	796726	Well, you can get it on eBay.
796746	797667	I'm sure it's not that hard to find.
797747	800067	Oh, but that involves me buying it online.
800107	802047	I mean, who shops online?
802307	802047	$14?
804688	806388	GameCrazy, $14, says the audience.
806948	815190	Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon, ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.
816110	819851	And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.
822498	824159	Which I can just play at home on the Neo Geo.
824960	826121	By the way, it's about freaking time.
826181	827382	Actraiser's on its way over here.
828383	830825	It's rumored, because ESRB has a rating now.
831045	831786	Oh, come on!
831846	833447	Japan's got it, Europe's got it.
833487	835910	How long do I have to wait for my Actraiser?
836690	837291	Forever.
840775	841556	Don't worry, Rob.
842136	846058	The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere.
846638	847779	It's on schedule.
847879	850820	It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.
850840	855342	They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel, and then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.
855702	856042	Joy.
857083	857383	All right.
858143	860204	Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?
861345	861925	Woo!
863066	863666	Thank you, Jamie.
865307	866487	Hey, only for one game.
866507	867948	This is kind of interesting.
869781	870321	There's a couple.
870341	873003	There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.
873563	874123	Well, I don't know.
874163	877345	Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.
877385	877865	Oh, wait, wait.
877945	878345	I forgot.
878625	882087	I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.
882207	882887	Oh, my God.
882927	885168	That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?
887189	888210	Was it you that wrote it?
889131	892452	Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fan.
892612	894273	Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.
894293	895954	They were basically saying, what are you talking about?
896014	898655	Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.
899135	903576	I hear it lists all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
903816	905837	I don't know if that's a game or not.
906317	906918	Life is a game.
907098	916501	I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft, and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.
917904	921907	All right, well, maybe, I don't know, maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.
921947	922207	I don't know.
922227	924229	But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?
924509	924709	No.
924749	929673	Well, then you won't care, because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now, thanks to the 1.80 patch.
929793	932775	You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.
933496	935957	And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled, too.
936057	938800	So that's kind of fun, if you can actually notice the difference.
938900	942002	Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.
942871	946012	You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.
947073	948433	My Epson printer sucks.
948753	954496	You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.
954616	958377	So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.
958877	960958	And PSP remote play over the internet.
961318	970785	One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out a really nice high-scale printer that will do high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.
972206	980512	So imagine something like that, though, with printing out your PlayStation stuff as nice as those would come out.
980532	982214	Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?
985116	985356	Rob.
985416	985656	Anyway.
985977	986317	Rob.
986577	986777	What?
986937	987217	Rob.
987338	987598	What?
988118	988318	Hi.
990300	990600	All right.
991583	994284	I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.
994865	995945	Alright, so that's it.
996145	997446	I'm fueled by the power of evil.
999387	1002848	Alright, so Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3, news-wise?
1003088	1003869	Actually, yes.
1004149	1004549	What's that?
1005309	1007490	Which is a big, you know, whoop-de-hoo.
1007770	1016034	But anyway, there's rumors coming back up, according to a GameFAQs forum member that... GameFAQs?
1017114	1019815	I know, this is why I'm like, who?
1019996	1023918	Well, to be fair, it's... The guy from PSN Magazine.
1026199	1029981	It's a guy that saw, it was a forum post by a guy who had a magazine.
1031161	1032082	Again, who?
1034011	1034852	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1067362	1070305	and it had a Zetagears reference to it before the game came out.
1070906	1073388	Yeah, remember, Rumble is so last gen.
1073408	1073868	Remember that?
1074229	1076511	I remember when you used to have to attach things to get your Rumble.
1078112	1081035	Oh, are you talking about the Rez thingy?
1081155	1087521	No, I'm talking about the... I'm talking about the Nintendo 64... Anyways...
1091933	1100195	Something coming to the PlayStation 3 and also the 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, and it's getting a limited edition as well.
1101276	1112439	Basically, you're going to get this nice little, almost looks like a lockbox or a metal safety deposit box, and included in that will be an art book, a soundtrack, which, you know, their soundtracks are always awesome.
1113210	1117133	and Keychain and of course keys to the safety deposit box.
1117173	1117574	Yay!
1117674	1118935	Crap I don't need!
1118955	1121657	I have mine on order already.
1122437	1123658	That sounds like a good set.
1124099	1126020	And a limited edition Rockstar duffel bag.
1127842	1130344	What was the price point on that?
1130364	1130344	$90.
1131505	1134307	Okay, that's actually a good set.
1134387	1135748	That would be something worthwhile to get.
1135848	1138270	The Cardcaptor Sakura box on Dreamcastle is ridiculous.
1142645	1146728	I think it's cool to get an art book and to get a CD and to get a duffel bag.
1146848	1148909	I don't think it's as cool to get a plate, a clock, and a fork.
1151130	1153331	How many of you cool kids want a rock star duffel bag?
1154552	1154992	That's what I thought.
1155132	1155612	One, two, three.
1155913	1157513	All the girls raised their hand first.
1157553	1158354	That was interesting.
1159655	1160055	Interesting.
1160135	1160375	All right.
1161334	1166297	All right, anyhow, if you want to get something a little more sooner than that, there's some release dates.
1166357	1172581	And this is the best part of the show, by the way, especially for you guys here, because I know a lot of you guys are into your anime and all that stuff.
1172961	1176203	You get to hear me horribly mispronounce Japanese release dates.
1176743	1177384	Good times.
1177824	1179745	You get to horribly hear me pronounce this stuff.
1179785	1184648	So we have coming out in Japan, we have Foza Force.
1185068	1186909	I can't even pronounce the English ones right.
1187110	1187630	God.
1187650	1187710	God.
1188362	1189443	I'm just so nervous.
1189503	1191766	I feel naked because everybody's looking at us.
1192067	1192948	Thank God you're not really.
1193148	1197974	Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out in the Asian regions anyway because it's coming to the U.S.
1198014	1198454	as well.
1198614	1199836	Any Forza fans in the house?
1200817	1201498	I see one hand.
1203493	1209375	Coming to the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard 4, which you know is Resident Evil 4, on May 31st.
1209415	1211635	So it's a little more than a week out, but it's almost coming.
1212216	1223779	And also coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot, over on the PlayStation 2, you get Guilty Gear XX Accent Core is coming out in Japan on May 31st.
1225700	1227140	Guilty Gear fans in the house.
1227760	1229181	I'm totally going to be getting that.
1229481	1233302	And hooray, another Pachinko game, Aladdin Destiny from Sega.
1233462	1235742	Sega cranks out these Pachinko games every week over there.
1235762	1236542	It's like brain training.
1237003	1243244	And then here's my favorite title of the week, Love Drops.
1243644	1248125	It's coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan from Dimple Entertainment.
1248883	1249823	Okay, this one seems cute.
1249843	1251204	Bringing you some love drops.
1252304	1255245	That's funny because that's Sasa's old nickname, the Kirito.
1255626	1256106	Love drops?
1256446	1257726	No, the Kirito one.
1257786	1258447	I want love drops.
1258867	1262448	Panic Palette is another game coming out over in Japan as well.
1262968	1264149	Did I say Galaxy Angel?
1264569	1269451	On the Nintendo DS, New Zealand Story DS, another update of an old-ass game.
1269811	1271071	Go figure on May 31st.
1271271	1274253	New Zealand Story, that's an old-ass game.
1274353	1275193	Boring, I know.
1276301	1278522	No offense to the New Zealanders who may be listening.
1280003	1285167	Anyways, coming out in the U.S., a whole lot of, I don't know.
1285607	1290510	Anyways, Surf Supps coming out on almost everything, although you probably won't be playing it.
1291270	1292711	Forza Motorsports 2 on the 360.
1292751	1294192	Forza!
1295813	1298435	Shadowrun on the 360 and for Vista.
1299936	1303418	Also, are we sure it won't get delayed due to partial nudity?
1304719	1305139	I don't know.
1306076	1308638	You should have an advanced release with extra partial nudity.
1310019	1314102	Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is coming out on 360, so that should be pretty cool.
1315083	1315664	Let's see here.
1315684	1317325	Just a small little title.
1317425	1319627	Mario Party 8 is going to be coming out as well.
1320087	1322649	Tamagotchi Party On for the Wii.
1323670	1325251	We have a Tamagotchi fan in the house.
1325331	1325812	All right.
1327653	1327993	There you go.
1328033	1329014	She's got the first one at home.
1329495	1332397	And on the DS, Pony Friends.
1334747	1336709	Wake Me Up When It's My Little Pony Friends.
1336829	1338751	And Tank Beat, which is actually kind of neat.
1339672	1340472	Pony Friends, Jamie.
1341594	1341954	Yay!
1342254	1345117	PSP also has Crush coming out.
1345277	1346058	That should be pretty cool.
1347440	1351564	And then on PC, you've always got a bunch of weird name titles, including...
1353553	1358637	Dream Day Wedding, and Circus Empire.
1359958	1363200	Is that like one of those roller coaster tycoon type games, Circus Empire?
1363981	1364341	Maybe.
1365442	1367984	I want to have an attraction where clowns kill each other.
1368004	1368844	That would be pretty fun.
1369825	1370505	Clown Survivor.
1370886	1372407	Good times.
1372427	1373868	I still like Clown Quake.
1375191	1375731	The old Quake mod.
1375751	1376532	Oh, is there like an old mod?
1376572	1376772	Really?
1376792	1376932	Yeah.
1377112	1377752	That's fine.
1377892	1380693	Why doesn't Xbox 360 put mods for like Doom and stuff?
1380753	1381154	It's downloadable.
1381174	1384415	No, they totally need to start doing the old Quake mods up.
1384655	1386556	No, but like legit mods, you know?
1386616	1387996	Something that Microsoft approves.
1388057	1389637	Like, you know, this can be downloadable content.
1389657	1392298	You know, change all the Doom sprites to... You know what I want on Xbox Live?
1392919	1393759	I want ASCII Quake.
1396367	1405557	I was also going to mention, real quick, this is kind of an exclusive, no one's heard about this yet, but... Uh-oh, here we go again, we're going to get busted.
1405577	1406698	It's not a Namco game, is it?
1406778	1408520	That's okay, I have my cyanide pill ready.
1408680	1409120	Thank God.
1409261	1411223	No, coming out to the U.S.
1411343	1417089	are going to be remakes of old Hudson titles, and these are not being released by Konami, it's being released by yet another company.
1417409	1419211	I believe that they go... I'm trying to...
1420049	1429291	Anyways, we're going to see, not a good Bomberman, but we're going to see remakes of Adventure Island, Bonk, and Star Soldier coming out over here in the fall.
1429771	1433592	So those are going to be starting in August and kind of running through the rest of the year.
1433932	1437333	But those will not be coming from Konami.
1437933	1439074	They're already out in Japan already.
1439094	1441894	Can I also say there's a Betty Boop game coming to Nintendo DS?
1442034	1443095	That's pretty awesome.
1444215	1445355	Betty Boop the game.
1446015	1447656	Do you touch her and she goes, boop, boop, boop?
1447856	1448156	I hope not.
1449923	1455207	Star Soldier, though, has a special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever, Star Parodia.
1456207	1458209	Anyone ever a PC Engine fan?
1459249	1470897	Star Parodia is a game where you play as Bomberman or a flying PC Engine or the plane from Star Soldier and you basically play through a parody of Star Soldier.
1472058	1473799	But I like playing as a flying PC Engine.
1474119	1475340	Oh, please say those titles.
1476336	1482179	There's two titles coming out from another smaller company called Smart Boys Game Room and Smart Girls Playhouse.
1484439	1486200	What does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?
1486800	1487301	I don't know.
1487321	1489061	Jamie, what does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?
1490182	1490682	Assault weapons.
1492523	1492823	I see.
1493523	1494103	All right, your turn.
1494744	1497065	Well, coming out in the UK, a few things.
1497145	1499306	On the 31st, we have the Marvel Trading Card Game.
1499606	1500046	Yay.
1500066	1500126	Yay.
1501572	1513163	On the first, we have Capcom Puzzle World, Legend of the Dragon, SBK07 Super Bike World Championship, Shadowrun for PC, and a History Channel game, Great Battles of Rome.
1513884	1515505	Oh yeah, and Tomb Raider, but who cares?
1516206	1517668	Okay, and Wario Master of Disguise.
1518708	1519970	And Meteus Disney Edition.
1520370	1521091	Good times.
1522210	1523111	Meteos Disney Edition.
1523171	1524491	I never did pick that up over here.
1524531	1526753	Anybody have Meteos Disney Edition in the house?
1527033	1527293	Anybody?
1527533	1528233	It's not much different.
1528253	1529094	It's not selling very well.
1529234	1532656	Remember, Meteos Disney Edition goes faster at night.
1535805	1536226	I hate you.
1537307	1537727	Just kidding.
1559907	1563488	Well, of course, Sony's already been in court before.
1563568	1565929	They had to pay all those damages to Immersion over it.
1566409	1572171	And what happened is that Target Technology, not the store, but Target Technology actually filed a suit earlier this month.
1572651	1576813	And it has to do with patent violations, and they're related to Sony's Blu-ray technology.
1577353	1592145	and basically the suit says that Sony America, Sony Pictures, Sony DADC, it says that all their products marketed under the Blu-ray name actually infringe on a patent that Target already owns for these reflective layer materials and optical discs.
1592525	1598570	So it's another one of those like, hey, we invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about it until now.
1600407	1601888	No, they've been using it.
1601928	1603708	It doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience.
1603808	1608190	No, because they were using it on DVDs, on dual-layer DVDs for a while.
1609670	1612231	But I'm talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now?
1614132	1615832	That's what always puzzles me about these lawsuits.
1616172	1621034	Like, did somebody just roll out of bed and see the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3?
1621074	1623435	Keep in mind, you know how long things take in the corporate world.
1623515	1626896	Once you realize that you've got a problem, how long does it take to go through meetings, check with legal...
1628837	1631018	I don't know, do we have any Rockstar fans in the house that might know?
1631799	1632119	Anybody?
1633920	1635381	Just teasing.
1637382	1639424	Little DDR joke, by the way.
1640304	1643806	For anything that occurs in the corporate world, you can expect at least a three-month delay.
1645407	1647068	Before they start thinking about doing something.
1647469	1648729	All right.
1648809	1650611	Well, this is sure to cause another lawsuit.
1651091	1651371	Yes?
1652892	1653592	No one can hear you.
1653612	1654673	Yeah, no one can hear you, Ranma.
1654853	1656734	He's bringing up the whole issue with BlackBerry.
1656854	1657495	Hurry up, hurry up.
1657675	1657835	Come on.
1658371	1659031	We've got 20 minutes.
1660152	1662373	Go, go, go, go, go.
1663473	1664374	Rapid fanboy power, go.
1664534	1667535	Basically, same thing happened with BlackBerry and Research in Motion.
1667575	1671656	Research in Motion sued BlackBerry over different copyright infringements and patent technologies and stuff.
1671676	1677839	They settled out, but if they had won, they would have no longer been able to sell BlackBerrys and all that, and those who use them would have been screwed.
1678899	1680380	That's a pretty massive market.
1682801	1683141	All right.
1683442	1695067	Well, speaking of things that are likely to get sued over, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down and all over every week and find her favorite website to share with you guys, and we call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
1697289	1698369	That's the wrong music, by the way.
1699650	1700590	That's all I have.
1701070	1702271	Live radio, boys and girls.
1702311	1702711	All right, fine.
1702731	1704032	We'll just go with it.
1704232	1704552	All right.
1706473	1710735	My Website of the Week is fairly simple, one that you've all been to if you're here at faname.com.
1712370	1713611	Let's hear it for the staff.
1714111	1716212	Fonamay.com, let's hear it for the Fonamay staff.
1716533	1718314	Wendell from Stage Zero's in the house.
1719334	1719955	My hero.
1720955	1722936	Wendell, did you hear me yelling at you earlier to take it off?
1724657	1731201	Wait, before we came up to the room, I said something a lot nicer.
1732562	1733402	Uh-oh, here he comes.
1733463	1735664	Wendell's coming towards the front of the room.
1736865	1740807	No, we do want to say a big thanks to the Fonamay staff, though, for having us here a second year in a row, suckers.
1741300	1743161	Hey, we appreciate you coming over.
1743181	1744401	No problem.
1744681	1747462	Part of my voice that's been kind of... What the fuck happened to your voice?
1747543	1748503	You know what?
1748563	1751124	It's not necessarily that I've been working all day.
1751144	1753785	It's just that I've had really bad allergies over the last two weeks.
1755186	1758027	It's like the county that I'm living in, it's just horrible.
1759107	1761768	Coming down to San Jose, I've been breathing a little better.
1761828	1765570	My voice is being a little better, but I know by the end of the convention I'll be all right.
1765790	1767050	Thank you so much, DarkSakura.
1767931	1768731	It was Tic Tacs?
1769466	1772068	She's got me some... It's like a pack of smokes from right here.
1772108	1773410	I ain't gonna help.
1773510	1774631	They're lozenges from Ikea.
1775331	1787442	I just wanted to say, though, that Fatima is a very special place, or like a special time for me, because I have a little bit of a story that I'm about to tell you.
1787682	1787962	All right.
1789003	1793387	It was like, I think it was about 2001.
1793427	1793627	It was 2001.
1793667	1795849	It was over at the Santa Clara Convention Center.
1796550	1796650	And...
1797822	1803166	I believe it was the same year that our good friend Mel had won his DDR machine.
1803667	1803987	It was.
1804327	1806129	Yeah, he won his solo 2000 machine.
1806149	1807570	It was about March of 2001.
1808490	1821581	And one of those nights I got a little tipsy, rather inebriated, and I was feeling the need to play some DDR.
1822301	1825384	So I go down to where the DDR machines are at.
1825704	1826905	They had the solo machine.
1827625	1829246	Right behind where the fourth plus was at.
1829706	1831627	And I got my little games on, played it.
1831807	1838892	I was really, really, a little tipsy to a point where I actually tried to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the pad.
1838912	1841673	But the knee drop was late.
1842634	1843374	Yeah, it was.
1844515	1848897	Next thing you know, my friend Brandon decides, you know, checks me up, puts a bandage on my knee.
1849237	1855341	And as I decide to sit down and try to relax, try to relax and just like try to sober up.
1856021	1866448	So, I sit down over at the, right by the side of the ER machine, and I'm sitting right next to this woman, and I look to her and I say, Hi, how are you?
1867489	1868569	My name is Wendell.
1869230	1869750	What are you?
1870170	1871771	And this woman... And I'm the love doctor.
1874673	1881097	And strangely enough, the woman replies to me and says, Hi, my name is Jamie, otherwise known as DarkSakura.
1882618	1884840	So, this was the first time that I actually first met
1885472	1888634	DarkSakura, and then I was formally introduced to her at the tournament.
1888654	1889275	When you were sober.
1889675	1892997	When I was sober, later on in October for a tournament.
1893978	1901022	So, anime is probably like a very special place where I first met the very lovely and talented DarkSakura.
1901283	1902403	There's another note to that.
1902804	1908668	You played DDR with me when I was still trying to pass sevens, and you passed your first eight that night, I think.
1908948	1909908	I believe it was.
1909928	1910229	Drunk.
1910749	1911950	Drunk, yes.
1911970	1912210	Yes.
1912659	1917602	I also remember that after I spoke with her, I proceeded to fall asleep right next to her.
1917782	1919423	And then everybody came up.
1919563	1923885	It was Mike Noe and Mel.
1924846	1926406	And all of them came and fetched you.
1927927	1931489	I think that was the case because I don't remember the rest of it.
1931509	1933970	I was two days sleep deprived and he was one night drunk.
1934831	1936412	I don't remember the rest of that night.
1936432	1939413	I was like, bye Wendell, nice to meet you.
1939473	1940314	I'm going to sit here.
1941664	1946068	Wendell, I got one more question for you before we get back to the game news because we've only got 15 minutes left.
1946849	1950492	First off, thank you since you're here and you're on Fanime staff for having us, of course, again this year.
1951012	1953955	Fanime is very thankful that you came by once again.
1953975	1954855	No problemo.
1954875	1955876	It's good times, good times.
1955916	1959519	I don't get to see people play dress-up except on Halloween usually, so this is a good time.
1959900	1962442	So what did you have to do to get those beats?
1967026	1968147	That's all I wanted to ask.
1970003	1971363	It was a painful experience.
1971583	1971863	All right.
1971884	1973004	Well, then we won't make it.
1973024	1975024	Maybe that panel will happen actually later on tonight.
1975144	1975444	Oh, no.
1975825	1980146	I basically had to pay for it online with like $10 worth of shipping and handling.
1981206	1981466	All right.
1981866	1985587	Well, Wendell from Stage Zero, everybody, thank you for reminiscing.
1985667	1987948	I got to head back to Stage Zero myself, so I got to do it.
1987988	1988468	All right.
1988488	1989348	Much love to Jamie.
1989408	1990568	Much love to Rob.
1990908	1991509	What's up, Loki?
1992309	1992609	All right.
1992849	1993569	Thank you very much, sir.
1994309	1996450	So we get random celebrity drop-ins from the Faname staff.
1996490	1996970	Appreciate it.
1997552	1999493	All right, to reminisce about stories here.
1999573	2002554	So, all right, so the website of the week is Fonamay.com, and you can pre-reg for 2008.
2002874	2004135	Yes, you can.
2004155	2004455	Do it.
2004775	2005035	All right.
2005676	2006656	All right, what's up next?
2007656	2016980	Well, an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic, traveled through time, killed a baby.
2018121	2021722	Anyways, and that is, no, not the Phantom.
2021923	2022903	Phantom never came out.
2023906	2040576	But anyways, that is the claim, apparently, of some folks that are trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart, claiming that an overheated Xbox power supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade.
2041256	2043698	Unfortunately... The Xbox stole my baby!
2044378	2045779	They are seeking $50,000 in damages.
2045879	2046139	That's all?
2046159	2046219	Yes.
2052502	2056783	I really shouldn't make, because a baby did die, and that's really sad.
2058184	2063405	But somebody's suing Microsoft over... But here's the best part, though.
2063425	2064225	This is the best part.
2064546	2066026	Remember, this took place in December 2004.
2067166	2076509	However, Microsoft, a representative, was kind to remind us that the 360 was not available in December of 2004, and in fact came out a few years later.
2080407	2080667	Yes, and it is.
2102100	2107122	My FU of the week is addressed to the people who are not bathing at this convention.
2107923	2113485	I can smell the funk of fanboy a mile down the road at the pita place.
2115226	2116527	Do yourselves a favor.
2116587	2126592	If you are going to go to a convention, if you can pay to get in and buy crap in the dealer's room, you can afford to use a bathroom and at least buy some freaking deodorant.
2126652	2126992	Hello.
2128492	2131933	They should put Febreze in your package every year.
2132693	2134173	Use it, babe, please.
2135173	2136754	Fanboy Funk is not sexy.
2136794	2139334	Febreze on my package might burn a little bit, actually.
2142115	2148976	All right, my FU of the week would go to traffic on the way down here and the five CHP officers I passed on the way here.
2149016	2150297	They are out in force today.
2150317	2151157	That's crazy.
2152317	2156498	My FU of the week goes to Comcast, and I'll explain why.
2157051	2159316	I'm watching a TV show, it sounds like this.
2159476	2162021	All of a sudden, commercial comes on, and it's like that.
2164344	2165244	and I'll see you next time.
2194496	2199521	Uh, there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea.
2200201	2200902	If you live in South Korea.
2200922	2202643	Maybe they can put StarCraft on it eventually.
2202663	2203324	That would be a good time.
2203844	2206426	So, uh, yeah, that's going to be coming over to South Korea.
2206546	2210469	It's going to cost you $556 and it lands on June 16th.
2210870	2212171	Could it be coming to the U.S.?
2213312	2214713	But what's 20 gigs going to do?
2214873	2217095	I mean, what exactly can you put on that drive right now?
2217825	2225772	Well, you have to remember, though, that the 80-gig PS3 that's coming out in Korea is actually going to be coming out with a video-on-demand service as well.
2225913	2231177	So, you know, that's probably what they're going to put on that drive.
2232038	2235341	Unless it's Korean schoolgirl hentai, I don't think most people are really going to care.
2237223	2239225	Well, you know, I could import them.
2240886	2241227	Oh, really?
2242248	2242588	No, really.
2244778	2245218	Go ahead.
2245438	2245618	What?
2246399	2255463	Famitsu is talking about, well, it's an ad out for a new R-Type that's an R-Type Tactics, and all I have to say to that is, what the hell?
2256824	2260486	No, just give me more R-Type, regular old R-Type with shooting things.
2261106	2263167	What exactly is R-Type Tactics?
2263247	2264988	Like, you have to move your ship around?
2265148	2265569	Yep.
2266029	2267590	That's so stupid.
2270011	2272212	You don't need to make every game into a Tactics game.
2273939	2275099	I don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S.
2275119	2275679	anytime soon.
2275919	2279060	There was only one really good tactics game, and that's none of them.
2279940	2280380	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2280400	2281701	Final Fantasy Tactics, good times.
2282481	2284241	Uh, uh, Vandal Hearts?
2284921	2286182	Actually, no, oops, sorry.
2286622	2289262	Actually, um, Fire, the Fire Emblem.
2289282	2289662	Disgaea.
2291043	2291303	All right.
2291363	2291783	Fire Emblem.
2291803	2293063	One more, then we'll get Task Force Launch.
2293243	2300104	And then some genius out there decided to purchase the rights for The Sims to make it into a movie.
2300565	2302305	And that genius company would be
2303692	2305333	No, 20th Century Fox.
2305373	2307534	They have just picked up the movie rights to The Sims.
2308515	2309035	Why?
2310076	2322243	Because don't you want to see it in a movie where you have a house full of eight... Actually, I think a Sims reality show would be awesome where you'll put eight people in a house and then forget to build a toilet and watch what happens.
2323224	2324905	Because that's all I ever did in The Sims.
2324925	2326285	Make sure none of them know how to cook.
2327986	2330448	Or there was the house that my friend made once.
2332332	2339695	My friend Billy, who is a huge homosexual, made this house that had seven guys and one girl.
2339995	2342336	And all the guys would just make out with each other all day.
2342697	2346538	And the girl had to cook and clean and wipe up their pee because he forgot to build a toilet.
2347059	2347799	Hilarious.
2348119	2348819	Love the Sims.
2348959	2350280	I'm hoping Spore is just as fun.
2351260	2351580	All right.
2351981	2353781	Let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.
2353801	2355502	We want your feedback and questions.
2355562	2357343	We don't have a whole lot of time, so we've got to make it quick.
2361175	2363837	Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
2363877	2364917	Okay, that's enough of Rob's singing.
2364957	2366318	Alright, who's got a question?
2366358	2366758	Come on down.
2366778	2367159	You, sir.
2367219	2368279	Come on down.
2368299	2369540	Come on down, because otherwise we can't hear you.
2370220	2372862	What's your name and where are you from?
2373342	2373923	Ray, GS68.
2374043	2374543	Ray, GS68!
2374583	2375043	What's up?
2375443	2378946	So, I have a question.
2379946	2381367	Have you watched any anime here?
2382488	2384709	I just got here like an hour and a half ago, so no.
2386070	2386990	I did in the hotel.
2387050	2389652	Actually, what we watched last night in the hotel room was Shaun of the Dead and Hard Gay.
2396968	2399930	I may watch some Yowie later if I can find it.
2399990	2401110	So I'll be late.
2401151	2401551	Thank you.
2401571	2405533	All right.
2405673	2405993	Oh, yes.
2406154	2406534	Oh, goody.
2406894	2407835	I can get smacked later.
2407875	2408335	That'll be fun.
2409656	2410976	Oh, you're going to go down there to get the questions?
2411537	2413718	Well, as far as this mic cord will take me.
2413778	2413978	All right.
2413998	2414379	Sounds good.
2414419	2414899	Any other questions?
2414919	2415879	Which is about this far.
2416380	2417040	Yeah.
2417140	2418181	Oh, here's our heckler.
2419021	2420002	Come on down, sir.
2421568	2422229	What's your name?
2422269	2422789	Where are you from?
2423729	2425470	Jacob, and I'm from the interweb.
2425790	2427731	All right, Jacob from the interweb.
2427751	2428411	What's your question?
2429492	2433154	Back in the day, Loki was quite the edit maker for DDR.
2433854	2435415	Which was your favorite edit you made?
2436375	2442578	I don't remember what they're called now, but there was the one on, what was it, Ecstasy that was pretty fun.
2443218	2443738	It stopped.
2444259	2445299	Oh, I remember one now.
2445319	2448240	There was one that was on Exotic Ethnic that was a double.
2448660	2449081	It was like...
2450290	2450930	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2479864	2481245	that I won the Hell Edit contest with.
2482346	2483027	Yeah, I remember.
2483067	2484728	Whatever happened to the Step Edit contest?
2484748	2485909	Yeah, it was DXY called another.
2486009	2489092	Yes, the classic Make Edit Get Porn contest.
2489292	2492775	I have a whole lot of hentai things to... Good times.
2493296	2494717	All right, any other questions, folks?
2494737	2494997	Come on down.
2495037	2495718	Oh, yes, you in the back.
2495758	2496098	Come on down.
2497820	2498540	Isn't she cute?
2498641	2499541	We have a loli.
2502304	2502964	What's your name, sweetie?
2502984	2503465	Where are you from?
2504526	2505747	Cassie from Marina.
2506047	2507028	All right, what's on your mind?
2507506	2510388	Well, it's a really obscure question, but it's for her.
2510668	2510888	Okay.
2511249	2512690	What was your starter Pokemon in Pearl?
2513831	2514611	I used Chimchar.
2515052	2515472	Chimchar.
2516893	2518014	Oh, she just made a face.
2518034	2520475	I'm going to take you out in the parking lot.
2520515	2522537	Keep in mind, I'm obsessed with fire.
2523037	2524178	I like the water Pokemon.
2524278	2533425	Ever since, well, my first video game Pokemon that I played was Blue version, and I started out with Squirtle, and from that, the obsession began.
2533565	2534846	I started off with Charmander.
2535563	2537404	You know, I picked... It starts from the very beginning.
2537424	2543949	Because everybody in Pokemans is picking that penguin, I decided to pick the grass Pokemon so I could kill them all very quickly.
2544850	2547292	See, for me, if I can't burn it, what good is it?
2547512	2547772	Alright.
2548733	2553837	However, for those of you guys that know Miklatov, who listens to the show, he also has a chimchar and he has the best name ever for it.
2554217	2555218	It's HoMonkey.
2557176	2560457	I accidentally skipped past where I was going to name it, but I was going to name it Firebutt.
2560477	2561998	Or Homoki, whatever you want to say.
2562198	2562398	All right.
2562718	2568660	One more question, then we've got to get out of here because I see more people coming in, which means people more popular than us must be waiting to start a panel.
2569060	2569680	One more.
2569920	2570360	You already went.
2570420	2570840	One more question.
2570880	2571140	Anybody?
2571381	2571681	Anybody?
2572701	2573041	Go.
2573101	2573461	Question.
2573941	2579463	Five, four, three, two, one.
2579483	2579883	Let's go home.
2579923	2580844	Bye.
2580864	2581124	All right.
2581144	2581444	Here we go.
2581464	2582164	Come on up real quick.
2584332	2585352	Hold on.
2586613	2588074	Do you guys remember the PTS movie?
2589454	2590015	Our little panel?
2590855	2592116	Lack thereof, I should say.
2592796	2595837	We made a big, big, big plug on it a long time ago.
2595937	2596458	Never finished.
2597158	2599639	Is that the group, people that suck or something?
2600079	2601040	People talking shit.
2601060	2603461	People talking shit.
2604201	2604962	We were banned.
2604982	2605702	Wow, I screwed up.
2605942	2608183	We were banned from like every forum ever.
2609564	2610384	Congratulations.
2610424	2611505	That's quite an accomplishment.
2611565	2611925	Good job.
2612805	2616146	But you're here, we haven't banned you from the room, so... Not yet.
2617187	2618247	Hey, hey, I didn't start it.
2618267	2619067	Don't shoot the messenger.
2619347	2619647	All right.
2621128	2621468	All right.
2623889	2625890	Well, you're here, and you got on our show, so there you go.
2625910	2627050	We will help grant your voice.
2627270	2631952	All right, well, we'd like to thank all you guys very much for coming out and seeing our show live.
2632012	2632692	We appreciate it.
2634307	2638150	And thank you guys, of course, for supporting independent podcasting.
2638170	2639191	That's the most important thing.
2639351	2644134	Even if you think our show sucks, please support other independent podcasts because there's a lot of great ones out there.
2644154	2646396	That Orange Lens Radio is just crap.
2646576	2646876	I know.
2647277	2647997	Especially that Rob guy.
2648017	2649458	I'm going to go listen to the PTS show.
2649498	2650499	They sound more fun than us.
2650559	2651079	So there it is.
2651240	2651620	There it is.
2652240	2653721	I want to go listen to G4 Radio.
2653761	2655523	G4 Radio.
2659819	2661140	Do we have the ending music?
2661220	2662481	And of course I was 100% lying.
2662641	2663762	Quick, play the ending music.
2663822	2666644	They're getting out the torches and going to take us outside and beat us up.
2667085	2667585	Rabble, rabble.
2670628	2672810	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2673390	2676072	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
