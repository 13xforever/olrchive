Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, May 20th, 2007, Blizzard officially announces Starcraft 2

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Halo 3 gets an official release date

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Project Gotham 3 is mistaken for a Sony game once again

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I don't have to go to work tomorrow

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And I didn't go Thursday or Friday

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I was supposed to go to a wedding and we decided not to go

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So I went and did nerdy stuff yesterday

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
And slept a lot

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
I had time off set to go on vacation to L.A.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Actually, I think I was supposed to go to Disneyland

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
But this was a couple of years ago

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
This was before Disneyland was the cool thing to do between us

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And for some reason or other the trip got cancelled

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
We didn't end up going

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
But I just kept the time off of work

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And that was the same week that Final Fantasy XI came out

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh God

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I remember that

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I sat at home and played Final Fantasy XI for like four days straight

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Early days of your addiction

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh, it was horrendous

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Just looking back on that

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I did that when Final Fantasy VI came out

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, three over here came out

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
When I was in high school

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
And I stayed home with the flu

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I had a fever

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And it needed more Final Fantasy

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I have a fever

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And the only cure is more treasure hunters

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the flu

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
I need cure three

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Alright, anyway

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Uh, Loki, Techmaster Loki is here as well

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, I am

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Have you ever called in sick or used your vacation to play a video game?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yes

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
What was that?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't remember

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
But you remember taking the time off to play it?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Uh, yes

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Alright

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You don't remember what it was, but you took off

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I think I may have done it for San Andreas

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Oh, okay

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Maybe

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Alright, you gonna do it for Grand Theft Auto IV?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
No, because we'll be playing it at work

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
So it's not a big deal

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
You know a lot of people were pissed off

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Because there were a lot of people that took the day off for the Halo 3 beta

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And we're gonna talk more Halo 3 probably in part B tonight

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
But you know the Halo 3 beta came out

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And a lot of people called in sick to work that day

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Because they were gonna sit at home and play the Halo 3 beta

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
And then the damn thing didn't show up for like 13 hours

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And people were pissed

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You know, because they'd taken the time off work

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
But it's hard

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I know it's hard to get upset when it's like, you know, kind of free

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And they never promised it on a certain day to begin with really

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
You know, it's kind of one of those tricky situations

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't know

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
But I thought that was interesting

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So anyway

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Alright, so we're gonna get into some gaming news tonight

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But first we're gonna start it off with a little bit of

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
How was your gaming week?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
No special guests tonight, but we do have the chat room

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Harvey's here, Rob

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Look at what?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Harvey

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Who's Harvey?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Did you see the movie?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
No

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Invisible Rabbit?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
No

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
It was a Jimmy Stewart movie

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, what's, no, a little

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
The Wonder Hamster?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
No

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
You need to watch some classic movies every so often, Rob

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Once in a while I do

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Broaden Your Horizons

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I do, I've seen like Casablanca

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And the Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies ever

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm going to find the DVD of Harvey and buy it for you

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
And you're gonna watch it

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And Hitchcock, I love old Hitchcock movies like Psycho

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Casablanca is so like, you know, the simple life

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It's just like

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh my god, there's this war going on

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Why is that the inconvenience me?

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Wow, my headache just came back

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Good job

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Alright

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I just swallowed like five Excedrin

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm looking at our chat room right now to see what's going on

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Of course we do tape live on Sunday nights

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And then release this to our audio RSS feed is the technical name for it

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
But most people just call it a podcast or a blog cast or whatever

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Let's see, anyway, look in the chat room, what's going on

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Gaming week

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Huh?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Gaming week

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah, we'll get to that

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Can't we say hello to the chatters real quick?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
No

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Alright, well

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
ActDeaf says I hope OLR cheers me up

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, not with Jamie's current attitude

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Hi

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
She won't be

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
She happy, dammit

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
She won't be cheering anybody up there

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Be of good cheer or I'll kick your ass

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's see, PK, I'm sorry, I always say his name wrong

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Peaker Uno, I think is how I'm supposed to say it

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Says we need to have an OLR me we suck at Halo game

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, we do

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
GS68 said Rob floods go faster at night

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I guess in response to chat going Rob, Rob, Rob

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You know Sauce was at Disneyland Friday

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Lucky

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
No, and she said they closed down Pirates for the premiere and then they opened it back

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
up

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Oh, the Pirates premiere was going on, that's cool, fun

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Alright, we're not a Disneyland podcast, so tell us about your gaming week

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, I played something like seven hours of, no not seven, because I took a break

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance because I had to start over because there

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
were fingerprints on the rental

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
We get free rentals from Hollywood Video, so I just played a whole bunch

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
And I was very pissed off because I played Iron Man on the Mandarin stage

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Only I used the Ultimate Armor because it looks a lot better than his dorky, you know, asshole armor

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Sorry, I've been reading, I read a lot of comics

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And so there wasn't any of the dialogue and I was like, well this is crap

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And so I just went back to playing a whole lot of Deadpool because he's funny

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
And god damn stupid computer

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
You know, I had my computer on Power Saver because I was moving files anyway

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
So I also went to Pen-a-Go-Go

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Which was this, I want to say it was big, but it really wasn't

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It was like in a warehouse in Dixon

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, actually the big, you know, hall at the Dixon Fairgrounds

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
For our international listeners, how can we describe Dixon, California?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Podunk

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
It's like going to the country

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's the suburb of a suburb, right?

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
You have like this old town and then you drive like five minutes and you have farm

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Like Davis is a suburb of Sacramento, right?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Where the school is, where the first season of sorority life was, right?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So most people know UC Davis

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Well Dixon is a suburb of Davis, okay?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So that's, to put it in perspective, like it's not even as populated

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I apologize if we have any listeners in Dixon

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I do love Mary's Pizza Shack, which is in Dixon, but that's about it

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I went to this sweet stuff place, I think it was called

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And it was really yummy and I had banana ice cream

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Anyway, sorry, Pen-a-Go-Go, pinball

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay, yeah, I'm actually pulling up the list of the games I played at Pen-a-Go-Go

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And this isn't all of them because I did play a bunch of really old, old, old machines

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Like the ones from before

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Like, these are so old that they had the flippy numbers, you know?

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
Where instead of, you know, you have your LED screen, you had the flippy numbers

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Wow, like the counters

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And there was only one of those that was worth mentioning, which is called Skylab

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And the cool thing about Skylab is that you have this middle section

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
That's got a line in between them

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And you have five pinballs in there

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And you have to knock five onto one side of it

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And then you get like some special thing, only I couldn't do it

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
So I played Black Rose, which is a pirate theme with this huge, you know, big old pirate winch on the thing

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And it has cannons in it and you have to like shoot down a pirate ship

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Cool, pirate winches

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And Centaur, which was a cool older table

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
It was before they had the big, you know, LED, the big display, digital displays and everything

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And it was just the numbers and all that

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And I played the new Pirates of the Caribbean machine, which is actually okay

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But it wasn't quite as awesome as I thought it would be

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And I kicked Dan's ass at Theatre of Magic twice

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I love Theatre of Magic, that's a kickass table

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Theatre of Magic is the most sexy pinball table

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I was about ready to offer the dude four thousand bucks on

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
I was like, hello, my retirement money, give me Theatre of Magic

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
But no, I had to use it on school

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But he did win, though, on the third game

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But that's okay because I also kicked his ass at Adam's Family

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
God, I wonder where I could find four thousand dollars to buy a Theatre of Magic table

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It's so tempting

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Apparently it's one of Dan's buddies that owns the machine

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
I played Demolition Man and I thought it would be a great machine because I love ramps

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
No, suck-tastic

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Much like the movie

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Actually, I like the movie

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Demolition Man is one of my guilty pleasures

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Kind of like Me and Showgirls?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Okay, yeah, gotcha

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Just because I love the whole scene when they're in the car scene to old Oscar Mayer commercials

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You know who really brought down that movie?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Who?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Sandra Bullock

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It ruins everything

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It's like poison

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Everything she touches is poison

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The speed was good, the first one

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It had Denis Leary in it, though

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Denis Leary is the reason to watch Demolition Man

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Sorry to interrupt your report, but I have to ask Loki, do you have any guilty pleasure movies?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Guilty pleasure movies?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I guess Wild Zero, maybe

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Dude, I love that movie, too

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
But there's that one

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I have a new one, though, possibly

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I have to watch it, though

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Yo Yo Girl Cop

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh, wait, is that the Sukebon Deca?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
No, that was not a cop

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It's the one about this Asian chick who fights crime

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
She's like a cop by day, crime fighter by night, which is kind of the same thing

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
But anyways, she fights crime with this metal yo-yo

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, the yo-yo started off as a weapon

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That's amazing

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So, it's interesting

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Okay, well, there's more games

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is the worst machine ever

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
It's like it has action figures all over it

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
And the only cool thing about it is this rotating pizza spinner in the middle that will shoot the ball in different directions

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
I played Medieval Madness, but the guy who owned it put extra steep ramps in it

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But I did break down the castle, that was cool

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Pinbot

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Fucking greatest pinball game of ever

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
No

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Ever

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
But it was dingy

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Actually, you need to come to my house and play Bride of Pinbot

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Bride of Pinbot is actually better

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I forgot you have Bride of Pinbot now

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Yes, well, it's not technically ours, it's our friend Will's

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But it lives in my apartment, my garage

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Suddenly we're becoming a pinball podcast, but that's okay

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Pinball is what I played before DDR, which is how I met all you guys

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So, this is like going back to our roots

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
There's a few more worth mentioning

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I played Hyperball

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Hyperball is the worst pinball ever

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, not really worst, it's the weirdest

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
Because you have this big open field and little holes around the perimeter of the thing

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
And you have to shoot the balls into the holes and they're like by the alphabet and it's really stupid

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I played High Speed, which is one of the older ones

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
That was really fun

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
And Cyclone

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
High Speed was the other NES game that fucking no one played

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
They had Pinbot, and then Pinbot was so successful they made High Speed

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
But nobody played High Speed

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
But High Speed is a fucking awesome table

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
It is an awesome, that's why they made it a game

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
But Cyclone has, um

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Now, Cyclone, it was one of the ones I used to play in Mobile at a Godfather's Pizza

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
And the marquee of it has a clown on it and this rollercoaster

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And in the first row is Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
But on the one in Mobile, someone duct taped over the clown because clowns are scary

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
And drew a beard with a big mustache and a cowboy hat on Ronald Reagan

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So, that's always my memory of it

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It's a cool table, I just hate clowns

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
There should be a pinball game where you just hit clowns in the face

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
That'd be fun

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
The biggest disappointment for me, well there's Fun House

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Fun House is one where you can hit this

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
That's right!

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
I hate Fun House though, we almost bought one and I told Dan no because the freaking head scared the crap out of me

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
But the disappointment though is I wanted to see World Cup Soccer and apparently they sold it on Friday and I went on Saturday

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Big Bang Bar, no one had any prototypes there

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
And Big Bang Bar is like, I've gotten to play a Big Bang Bar

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That's the one where there's only like 20 of them in existence

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
16

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And when Capcom closed down their pinball division

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
However, the rights to Big Bang Bar have now been made available

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I think to Stern I think is going to be released

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Don't quote me on that yet

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But I think Stern's going to be releasing them

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Time Machine is the other one I wanted to see

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Jackbot, Black Knight 2000 and Doctor Who of course were the big ones that I wanted to see

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
Other than that, I've been playing stupid Flash games thanks to Loki

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Sorry

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
That's okay, they're kind of addicting

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm going to be doing that all day tomorrow now

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, I was playing Flash games too

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
So what were you playing?

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
I played, actually, I played Crackdown

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
A little bit of co-op Crackdown, that was fun

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I did try the Halo 3 beta once

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
It was okay

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
To be honest, it's exactly like the last Halo game

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Gameplay-wise, they haven't really changed much

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Which is fine, it was good to begin with

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
But I still really suck at Halo

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I had trouble

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
The only thing I kind of regret is the loading screens

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
In some games, they usually show you what the button configuration is

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I went in there and was like, how do I do stuff?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I had to kind of figure that out

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And they still didn't really get the hang of it

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Instead they have the message that says

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Halo 3 Beta, love Bungie

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I thought that was funny

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
So that was okay

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I went back to playing Earth Defense Force 2017 again

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
And I got the fucking super awesome stationary guns

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm going to be able to blow through Inferno difficulty now

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Like, no problem

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
But those are cool

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And then, what else did I play?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh yeah, I tried a little bit of that

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
What was it, Geasswing or whatever?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
It was okay

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Very bland, actually

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
The graphics in it were very kind of, ugh

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Like I threw this together really quick

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Dude, it was free

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't care, I've seen better shit that's been free, okay?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
You know

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Warning Forever, that's free

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And that looked a lot better

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And there wasn't even any background on that

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
So

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
They should, simple, you know

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
They should have done all

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Vectors would have been cool

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Anyways

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
So, then beyond that stuff

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I played a little bit of

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Still playing that

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'll still be playing that

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Until, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I tried a little bit of Saints Row

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That was fun

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
For some reason though, like

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I really, I don't know if anyone has actually tried landing 360 systems

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They are as finicky as shit

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
They will not land with each other if like something's different or whatever

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Like Saints Row, we were trying to land it

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
One of the systems doesn't have the update for it yet

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
The multiplayer update that fixes the lag

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
One system does

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
It won't see each other

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
So that kind of sucked

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Cracked down, we tried landing it again

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
And it won't see each other

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Despite the fact that it's the exact same setup

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
And it worked the other day

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
So I don't know what the fuck's wrong with these things

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
But all I know is Microsoft did not make it fucking easy to land this shit

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
So

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Fuck them

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
That's it

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Alright, well, my gaming week

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I also played the Halo 3 beta

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And, you know, it's pretty cool

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
To me, my first, my initial impression was like

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Okay, it's like Halo 2

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Is prettier and with, you know, the shield

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And other new X button features, right

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
That change up the game a little bit

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
But then I'm kind of thinking like

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Okay, well Halo 2 is a pretty rock solid game

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That people still play online

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Like over and over and over again

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Until their thumbs fall off

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
So if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
So I think, honestly, Halo 3 is going to be pretty cool

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Now there were, like, I found the beta to be a bit confusing at first

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Because I was trying to set up a game that would just be my friends and I

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And like I couldn't, like, we could only like

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Get the friends together to join other games

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
But I guess you can't really be picky choosy

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Because it is a beta

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
They're probably trying to stress the stress

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, it's probably what I meant

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
So I'm not going to complain about that

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I was just like

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Aw, darn, I wish I could have done it this way

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
But I did find that if I don't play ranked mode

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
If I just stay away from ranked mode

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
And play, like, the open mode

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Generally you get people of a lower skill rank

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Which is good, it's better for me to play on

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
So I played a couple games and it was a good time

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Like the training stuff, or?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah, I played, a random O.L.R. listener came in too

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
And I'm sorry, dude, I forgot your name

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
But somebody that was no O.L.R. listener

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Came onto my friends list

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
We played a Halo 3 match together

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
We had a good time

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
I actually got more kills than him

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
So I was all, he's like

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
What do you mean you suck at Halo?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So I was all excited, but it was just luck

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
And sometimes it's just luck

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Especially when nobody knows the maps

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Because they're all new

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
But I thought it was really pretty

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I like that map where you play in the snow

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
It was kind of neat looking

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And the shields look pretty cool

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Like, you know, it's kind of cool

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
The game's going to sell like crazy

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's going to be Halo 2 all over again

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
But just a whole new thing

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
It's going to be huge

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I mean, I wish I wasn't so ignorant

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
When it comes to first person shooters

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because a lot of them feel all the same to me

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Because I don't play a whole lot of them

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Like, I've played Quake 3

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
And some of the other Quakes

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
And, you know, a couple here and there

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
But, you know, Halo's just always kind of stood out

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I hope it has a great single player, though, too

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
For those that don't necessarily like to

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Go online and play random people

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But I can't wait to have the college buddies

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
And I play in the game

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
It's going to be fun

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Let's see, other games I've been playing this week

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I've actually went back to my PlayStation 2

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And picked up a game that I played a lot of

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
When it first came out

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But then they just kind of stopped

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
And neglected it when the Wii came out

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
And that would be Final Fantasy XII

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And what motivated me to play this game again

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Is you might remember last week

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I had a bit of an emo week

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
And Miklotov was here

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
And he talked about how he bought me the Balthier doll

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Who is, like, the reason to play Final Fantasy XII

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Because not only is he sexy

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
But he's just, like, the most interesting character in the game, right?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
He's awesome

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
So, yeah, I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XII

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because I want to play it through to completion

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
But I'm kind of one of those people that's like

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
If I forget what happened in the story

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And it's been, like, you know, a good five months

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Since I've touched the game

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I have to go back and start from the beginning

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
So I started back from the beginning

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
But, God, the battle system in that game is great

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I mean, it's like playing an online game

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
But not online

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Like, where you get total control over all the other people

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
It's great

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I forgot there's a few other things I did play

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I played Eternal Sonata

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Which they have the demo for

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
That demo is amazing

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I loved it

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Did you like it?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
It's awesome

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh my God

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
The Xbox 360 needs a game like Eternal Sonata

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
So bad

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's one of the types of games that Microsoft has been lacking in

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Ever since, like, Xbox One

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And, yes, I know there was, like, Enchanted Arms

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But, seriously, this is like a great role-playing game

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It looks to be shaping up to be one

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I was so impressed with the demo

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
To me, this is how Square Enix should be doing their Final Fantasy games

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
I don't know how Final Fantasy XIII is going to be

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
It looks a little weird

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
But, you know, this is the way I would see them doing it

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
Stick to what you know, you know, like Final Fantasy X was okay

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
And XII was okay

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
But just, you know, that same type of thing

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
You don't need to go all full 3D where you can adjust the camera and stuff

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, I know

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
XII's cool, though

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But I'm excited to see what they do for XIII

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But the battle system in Eternal Sonata is pretty awesome

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Because it's like, you know, you're on a live playing field

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And you run around, like, a la Kingdom Hearts

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You have, like, five seconds

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, but you have five seconds from the second you touch the controller to move

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
And you make all your moves

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
And I thought it was just pretty cool

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Jamie, you really should check this game out, Eternal Sonata

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You have to have a Japanese account to download the demo

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Or you should just come over here and play it or something

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
It's great

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
It's like a Japanese RPG

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Okay

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
But on the 360

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
So it's really nice looking

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I thought the graphics were great, too

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And the weirdest thing about the Japanese demo

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Is it wasn't the Japanese demo

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
It was the US demo

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Because it's Eternal Sonata

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
It's Trusty Bell over there

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
And it's all in English

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm not complaining

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
So I don't understand why they put it over there

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But the other thing I played, of course

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I totally hopped on your account and grabbed it

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Good, because that's

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, yeah

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Love that update, Microsoft

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Really blocked those other accounts out there

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Well, anyways

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
But I did get to play some more Super Paper Mario

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm almost finished with it now

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
But it's fun

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Still liking it

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I also finally picked up Catan

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
The Xbox Live Arcade game

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Wasn't feeling it

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
I mean, like, I'm very happy these types of games are coming to Xbox Live Arcade

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
But this particular one, I just couldn't get into

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
They need risks

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, I want something I'm a little more familiar with

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Monopoly, Risk, Clue

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Oh my god, Monopoly with pillars

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I understand this game is huge among strategy circles

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
And I'm probably getting angry emails from some British listeners right now

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Where the game is big

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But, you know, I just

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
I wasn't all into, like, the trade, barter, that kind of thing

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Although I guess Monopoly is kind of like that, too

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
But I don't know, it's different

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Trust me

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I guess maybe I was just disappointed

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Because somebody told me

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh, you should play Catan

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It's like Civilization

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
It's nothing like Civilization

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
To be honest, Civilization is incredible

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
What was I going to say?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Eternal Sonata actually looks better than Blue Dragon

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You know, sadly enough

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
And then really quickly

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Because I know we want to get into some gaming news

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I won't take up the whole time here

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
But I downloaded some retro classics

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I downloaded Double Dragon

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I downloaded Centipede

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I actually paid for them

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I don't know why I keep dumping all this money into them

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I mean, the remakes aren't bad

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
But it's just, you know, I play them once

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And I hardly ever play them again

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So I really need to just play the demo and be happy with that

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
But I do like the high def graphics on Double Dragon

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And it was somebody other than Digital Eclipse porting it

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
So I was excited

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I laughed at that

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
You didn't like it?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It just didn't seem...

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I mean, it was okay

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
It was kind of cool

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It just didn't quite seem right

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, it is a little weird at first

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Like, I don't know if you played the Centipede one

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But they really changed that one

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
They totally made that, like, HD

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
They didn't just, like, I don't know

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Put the old school graphics in 720p

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
They kind of redid the graphics there

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
It's kind of interesting

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
But I don't know

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm a sucker for classics and all the retro stuff

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
So what can I say

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And that's why I actually kind of enjoyed Aegiswing

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I guess, I don't know how to pronounce it

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Aegiswing I think is what it is

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Aegis, yeah

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Aegis

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
It's free

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
The multiplayer stuff is cool

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
It's a good old

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It's just like a Gradius type shooter

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's like a throwback to 8-bit shooters

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I thought it was gonna be more frantic though

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Like, more, you know, crazy Japanese shooter

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Like Ikaruga or something

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
But that's okay

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I mean, I like, you know, I can't complain

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
It's free

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I would put it on par with Heavy Weapon, honestly

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
And I paid 10 bucks for that one

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I thought Aegiswing was pretty fun

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Stupid Heavy Weapon

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I liked Heavy Weapon

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
It wasn't bad

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
It was certainly one of the better

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Probably the best PopCap game on Xbox right now

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Is Heavy Weapon

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Anyway

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So that's it

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
I'll shut up about my gaming week now

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Let's talk about some housekeeping

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
No live show next Sunday

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
This is important

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Sorry live listeners

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
We love you guys

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
But there will be no live show Memorial Day weekend

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
That's Sunday, May 27th

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Because we will be taping that week's show

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Live at FanaMe

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
We're gonna be at FanaMe

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And we'll be there taping our show live

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
On Saturday, the 26th

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That's May 26th

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
We'll be there

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I don't know what panel room it is yet though

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I missed that little detail

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Zero

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Or whatever

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Not on stage zero

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Not on stage zero

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
We report to stage zero

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
To find out where we're gonna be

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
So we're gonna be somewhere

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Look in your programs

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
We're gonna be there two o'clock

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Probably

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I wouldn't see why they wouldn't

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Last year there was like a big room and two small rooms

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
And we were in the big room

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
So I don't know why we wouldn't be in the big room again

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I hope

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
We'll see

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
If not we'll just have to fill all the butts in the seats in the little room

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
It'll be fun

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
So it'll be 2 p.m. on Saturday at FanaMe in San Jose

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Hopefully we'll be at the same time as the Masquerade

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
No

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
We got a better time this year I think

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Because last year we were like the same time as the Masquerade

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And that really screwed our attendance numbers

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
We had only a handful of people

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
We love those of you that came and showed up anyway

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Even though we were at the same time as that

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
But this year we're like at two o'clock

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And I don't think there's a whole lot going on then

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
It's like right during the high traffic point of the day

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
So I'm really excited

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I think we got a good time

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm excited to talk video games

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
We're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge live

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
We have a lot to cram in an hour

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
So we're gonna do that 2 p.m. on Saturday

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
F-A-N-I-M-E dot com

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
If you want more information if you'll be in the San Jose area

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So again that means no live show Sunday

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
If you do happen to be here Sunday night

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
You will hear the premiere of that episode

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
We will have that edited and ready to play

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
At our usual 6 p.m. time on Sunday

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
So that'll be your first chance to hear it

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Just won't have that live interaction element with the chat room

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Instead it's live in person

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
So that was fun last year

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm looking forward to that this year

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It'll be amazing

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Are you cosplaying this year, yes?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
If I can get my costume sewn this week

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I wanted to do Balthier so bad

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
But it's just too complicated a costume

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I can't do it in time

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Don't buy any sort of 3D

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, so

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I don't know

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Maybe I'll

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I think maybe I'll just wear a shirt

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
That says this is my cosplay or something

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Does that sound like a good idea?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
You're not going to cosplay either, right?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
No, I am not cosplaying

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Alright, so yeah, no show Sunday

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So we'll be back here live

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Though I believe the date is June 3rd

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
We'll be here live

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And that's that

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
So let's go into some gaming news

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Roll that beautiful bean footage

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
Of course the big, big, big, big, big, big news this weekend

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Is that Starcraft 2 was officially announced

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
Blizzard officially rolled out the teaser trailer

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
For Starcraft 2 in Seoul, South Korea

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And of course Korea is a huge

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I mean just a huge place where

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Starcraft is still popular

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's been 10 years since the original game if you can believe it

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And of course there was much speculation leading up to this

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
And Starcraft 2 was one of the things people speculated they would announce

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
People thought it was going to be World of Starcraft

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Diablo 3, a new IP, or this

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
So you know

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It was never going to be World of Starcraft

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Oh, why is that?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
They're not going to compete with themselves

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Not going to compete with themselves

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
But then again, Starcraft 2 is going to be online

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
We know this, right?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Both, so

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Comprehensive website set up at starcraft2.com

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
You can look at some of the clip art from the game

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And some of the stages in action

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
You can look at the teaser trailer

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Which you know, doesn't really show a lot of the game in action

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
But they do have on the site, they have another trailer that you can look at

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Which does have some of the in-game footage

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
No word yet when the game will be released

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
It is going to be a PC release

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
They are not touching the console releases

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Their FAQs kind of made it very vague if they would ever go to consoles

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
But just kind of knowing Blizzard's history

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
They probably won't, at least for a long time

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
So Starcraft 2 coming to PC soon-ish

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Because they haven't said when

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It could be Christmas, it could be next year

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Soon is the ultimate answer

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I would say next summer would be my bet

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I would say like next April

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
The game looks very complete-ish though

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And they had demos and stuff going

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Christmas seems a little soon though

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Especially when you consider all these games have been getting delayed lately

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Like Spore and stuff

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't know

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Well Spore is pretty massive as far as what's involved with that

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
True

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I don't know

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Sooner or better

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Let's see, Nm64 in our chat room says

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Starcraft 2 will come out when it's done

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
GS68 follows up with Starcraft forever

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Jvmon says

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Starcraft 2 gets released

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Thousands of babies die inside hot cars in South Korea

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
That's sad

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Chainsaw Juggling says

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I think Starcraft 2 is being funded by North Korea

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So they can invade South Korea because everyone will be playing the game

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
I'd like to know what our Korean listeners think about that comment

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
You can address those cards and letters to Chainsaw Juggling

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
On behalf of Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Starcraft 2, you guys excited? I don't know if you guys play these types of games

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
No, absolutely not because I really don't care

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You don't play RTSs at all?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I don't play Starcraft

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
You know what's weird?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Starcraft is the one Blizzard game I've never played

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I played World of Warcraft a lot, but I never

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I kind of avoided Starcraft

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I know, I lose total gamer cred in saying that, don't I?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
But face it, guys, there's only so many hours in the day to play games

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
But I'll check it out, certainly, for nothing else

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
And the fact that my current boyfriend's addicted to Starcraft

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And I'll probably have to play it for his sake

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I suppose Dan's probably gonna play it, so

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, so we'll probably see it that way

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
It looks just like Command & Conquer, Tiberium Wars

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I'm like

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
There's not really much you can do with the RTS

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I mean, great, it'll have the Starcraft characters

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
And races and units and whatnot

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah, it is the same three races from the original Starcraft

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Protos, Zerg, and Terrans

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So, I mean, it'll be cool

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I mean, it's great, it needs an update

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
It's been a while, so

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
I don't know, really, how much more excited could you have been

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
From Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2?

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I mean, it's like, eh, it's new stuff

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Who's kind of the same game?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Kind of, yeah, exactly

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
But Warcraft 2 to Warcraft 3 was a huge change

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
That was a huge change

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I don't know

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Alright, forget it, forget it

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Whatever, anyways

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Now, coming, GameTap is really becoming

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
You know, the central

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
For, like, anything that's

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You know, episodic

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Or, you know, a bunch of

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
They're actually using it now to launch a bunch of new games

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Including a new series from American McGee

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Which, I don't know if you can be excited about it

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
He had a hit with, you know, Alice

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Had a flop with Bad Day LA

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
As sad as I'd like to say that

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
But he is going to be coming out with a brand new

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
24-part episodic series

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
That's going to be Grimm

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
And it's based off the Grimm fairy tales

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
That sounds cool

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
In fact, they had some little artwork

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Showing Pinocchio, so that's kind of neat

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Is Hansel and Gretel in it?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Because I still want to push the witch in the oven

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm sure it will be, but they didn't really specify

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
What series, you know, what stories are going to be in there

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But, of course, they're all going to be kind of dark

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And, you know, very Alice-like

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And it says it's supposed to start in 2008

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
So, that's kind of neat

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
GameTap's becoming pretty awesome

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I mean, it's already been, like, a pretty good service

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
And I know, God, you must think I'm on their payroll at this point

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
But I do think it's a really great deal

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
They're a good service

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
If something's quality, why not tell everyone, right?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Exactly

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
This type of stuff's only enhancing it

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And I guess people are so resistant

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Because they feel like they're paying for emulators

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But, you know, these guys know what they're doing

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
They're really putting their all into it

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
So, a lot of folks probably would have given up by now

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I like them

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Well

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Let's hope the game doesn't suck

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Well, in some news of other things that don't suck

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Since we've been on the Blizzard tangent for a little while

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
On the patch 2.1.0 for World of Warcraft

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
We will be getting Black Temple as an instance

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
For anyone who doesn't know

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
It was involved in the Outlands

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Which was a zone that was added for Burning Crusade

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
So, you're gonna have to have, like, a huge ol' massive, you know, raid party

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
To be able to do it

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But, there you go

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
There's also tweaking the

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Some of the newer stuff in the Burning Crusade expansion

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
A new PvP arena

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
And epic flying mounts

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
The Nether Drake

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Will be available with that patch

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Except I won't be able to play that because I'm not a high enough level yet

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But soon, I'm 51

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Jewids are going to have their own epic flight form

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yes

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It will be epic

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
And it will be like the warlock and paladin mount quests

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Alright

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
So that's pretty cool

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
By the way, I forgot to say World of Warcraft during my gaming week

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
We're on a very aggressive recruiting campaign for our guild

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
We don't call ourselves OL Army

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
We have a different name just because we want to kind of blend in

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We don't want to be an obvious radio promo

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
But if you want more information, please go to our forums

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
If you have, like, a dormant character

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
You're thinking about transferring

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
We totally want some non-dickhead people to play with

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
If someone would give me Burning Crusade, I'd play

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I have not even touched the content for Burning Crusade at level 51

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I just want to draw an eye

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
But that's the wrong side

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I want a blood elf too

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Maybe if you're nice

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Somebody will bring that to you for, I don't know, solstice or something

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Okay

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Alright

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I'll buy chocolate

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I was going to say, um

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
I heard that a bunch of people from the old Deathcake guild finally

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
A bunch of people from the old Final Fantasy XI guild finally made the jump

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I will never, never jump into that

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
You need to

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
That's because of the wife

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
But here's the other thing I want to say

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
We posted a plug for our guild in the official server forums

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
And, like, within five minutes

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Some twat responded with some negative comment to my post

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
You know, I'm like

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
God, I hate web forums sometimes

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
I hate twats

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I hate the internet

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I hate twats

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Alright, anyway

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Sorry

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
We can talk about other stuff now

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Like this

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Hey, before there was the WoW addiction

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
There was the music game addiction

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Which a lot of us are still addicted to

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
And one of the granddaddies of the music game genre

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Parappa the Rappa

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Created by Masaya Matsura

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
He has talked about the Playstation 3 sluggish sales in Japan

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
And he's saying that's because the thing's a monster

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
It's a huge game

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Or it's a huge system

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
He says, quote

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
It's not the size of the hardware

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
But of the AC adapter when talking about the Xbox 360

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Who fuckin' who?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Isn't that crazy?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Get over it

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
My God

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
The AC adapter's too big

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
I can't develop for that system

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Well, but here's the thing though

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
He doesn't talk about the Wii at all

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Because he says, quote

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
The Wii is a, quote

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Very good piece of hardware

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
And noting that the controls are pretty awesome

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
And he has said that he's going to be developing a game for the system

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Quote

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Soon

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Maybe

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
My God

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
He jumps on the complete bandwagon

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Like a whole fuckin' year and a half late

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Oh, the AC adapter's too big

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Get over it

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Seriously

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
My God

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
It

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
So what if the brick is huge?

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
It does not matter

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
The Xbox was huge

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I mean, come on

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
No one complained about that

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The fact the size of the controllers originally were like

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't know

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Their own houses

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
It is a little weird

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
That is kind of a weird comment

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
But whatever

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
I mean, that's

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Anyhow

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
That's how he feels

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
That's how he feels

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Bitch and moan, people

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
But

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Apparently, BMG's got the rights now to distribute economic music online

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I know you'll be seeing that popping up in iTunes and Rhapsody

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
And other online distributors

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
But of course

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
You'll be seeing stuff from Castlevania

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Maybe some DDR

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Maybe Silent Hill

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Okay

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
So

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
I don't really have any specific dates on the releases yet, but

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's coming

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
That's pretty cool

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Well, something that's a bit of a relief for a lot of people is that

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
They're saying that Rock Band is going to be affordable

34:40.000 --> 34:47.000
Not the $150 to $200 that people were, you know, thinking that it was going to be

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
But there hasn't been anything specifically said about pricing

34:51.000 --> 34:59.000
But it was said that they don't see a point in making a game that people are not going to be happy buying

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
So

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Hopefully

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
I don't know what their idea of reasonable is

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
It'll be expensive

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
I could swing $100 for a game, but $150 maybe not

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Well, I mean, if it has good peripherals, maybe

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Let me put it this way

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Okay, it's EA putting it out

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
EA has, as far as like, you know, pricing goes

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Their games are a little on the high end

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Even to retailers

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
But it's going to be expensive

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
They're going to milk any sort of money that they could possibly get out of this

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Alright

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Well, that's of course a game we're looking forward to in the far future

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
That game's probably, what, a Christmas release looking at?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Probably November-ish?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah, probably November

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Alright

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Okay, so we're going to be looking at some media releases we have

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
We're going to run down some release dates

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And we'll start in Japan

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Because of course a lot of the games that come out in Japan we end up seeing here

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Starting off on the Xbox

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Or sometimes it goes the other way around too

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
It takes a while for the games to get over there

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It just depends what system you're talking about

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Starting off on the Xbox 360

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out on the 24th of May

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
As well as NBA Street Home Court

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Those are some popular titles over on this side of the pond as well

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Coming out on the Wii

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
A giant name here

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
One patchy slap pachinko blah blah blah

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Sammy's collection Fist of the North Star Wii

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
So I guess it's what?

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
Fist of the North Star pachinko games coming out from Sega on the Wii

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
You would think that they accidentally ran like two names together

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
But no, I'm looking at the box art

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
And it really is Fist of the North Star pachinko games on your Wii

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Pretty awesome

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
That's crazy

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
If you like pachinko and you like Fist of the North Star

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Hey, this is the game for you

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Going on to some other systems on the Playstation 3

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You're also getting NBA Street Home Court

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
For those of you that import your games that want NBA Jam for whatever reason

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
NBA Jam, sorry, NBA Home Court

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Big difference there

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
Playstation 2, Killer7 coming out on the Playstation 2 by Capcom in Japan

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I'm surprised it's not out there already

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Medal of Honor, well that's on the Playstation 2, not the GameCube

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Maybe it just took a while

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
Medal of Honor Vanguard, Shadow of Rome and State of Emergency Revenge

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
All coming out on the Playstation 2

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
As well as the King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But that's just moving into the best collection

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
That was already out there in Japan

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
State of Emergency Revenge

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
That's what it's called

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Coming out on the DS you have a crossword simulator from Hudson coming out on May 24th

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
As well as Hoshigami is coming out on May 24th

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Lots of DS games coming out including an Olympic training game it looks like

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
What is this called? Sansu Olympic Inkai-Koan, Tsuji de Kiteru Noriyoku Training

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
What is that? It looks like Olympic Training or something

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Or maybe some other type of brain training game

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
It's definitely what it looks like there

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Brain Olympics Training

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Maybe that's what it is, Brain Olympics or something like that

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
So all those games coming out in Japan

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
I'm looking to see if there's anything on the PSP real quick this week

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Oh yes a new Bleach game, Bleach Heat the Soul 4

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Just what we need, more Bleach

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
More Bleach

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Oh and my favorite title name of the week is actually coming out on the Sony PSP

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
It's Juiced Eliminator

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
That's great

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
That's actually a racing game and I think it might be something they have over here

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
It's already out over here

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah, Juiced Eliminator

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I have a t-shirt

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
It makes it sound like your PSP will slice and dice

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I still want WTF

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Not Julian, you know, Eliminator

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Anyways, this week the big game coming out of course

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Will be Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Where you get to play as the whole crew

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Including Jack Sparrow, which is not voiced by Jenny Depp unfortunately

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
You also get, of course, on 360, WarTech Second Orundo

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
It's kind of interesting

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
It's like a shooter game, but it's all boss fights almost

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
It's just one-on-one fights

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Halo 2 for Vista, so that's kind of neat

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Odin Sphere, I know a lot of people were waiting for this one

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
That one's finally making its way out here on PlayStation 2

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
Dawn of Mana, that's finally coming out as well

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Got delayed a week

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
About time

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Naruto Ninja Council 3, that's going to be coming out on the DS

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
Brooktown, hi, senior year

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Yay, that's economic game

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Please God, or whatever force is up there in the great beyond

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Listening to our crappy little radio program

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Please, I have one small request for you

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Please, please, please God, who I pray to every night

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Who is so great and holy

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
Please do not let Dawn of Mana suck balls like Legend of Mana

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
Please, please, please, blessed be thy name, amen

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
Okay, anyways, also coming out this week on the DS

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Death Junior and the Science Fair Doom

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
And let's see, Marvel Trading Card Games also coming out on the DS

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
And the New York Times Crosswords on the DS

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Hooray

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Well, we got a bunch of other stuff coming out in the UK

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
Odin Sphere comes out on PlayStation 2 the 22nd

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
On the 25th, a whole crap ton of stuff

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
There's Crush for PSP, Custom Robo Arena on DS

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Halo 2 Vista for PC

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Mario Strikers Charged Football

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
Hopefully with the warning intact, the rating

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Monster Madness on PC and Xbox 360

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
SpongeBob and Friends blah blah blah

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Pirates of the Caribbean on multiple systems

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
And Valhalla Knights on PSP

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I want to mention something real quick

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
I just happened to catch this on Kotaku

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
It happened to do with pirates

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
But if you happen to be going towards Disneyland anytime soon

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
And you have a copy of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End for the DS

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
There are specially marked spots on the rides

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
Or near the attractions that if you have your DS copy there

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
It will actually download exclusive content for you for the games

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I need to get the game and take it to Disneyland

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
That's kind of neat

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
That's actually a really neat kind of tie-in

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I have to give them props for that

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
It's a little crazy, but I like that idea

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Too bad it wasn't for a game I would play a lot more

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
But that's kind of cool

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Wow, that's kind of smart, I like that

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
I'm looking at Chatroom here

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And somebody was responding to my little prayer there

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
Unfortunately they have the generic O.L. Army recruit name

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But O.L. Army recruit number 9148 says

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Donamana does suck

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Uh oh, we're in for trouble there

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
What can we do there?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Let's see, some of the folks talking about Halo 2

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Let's see, some folks are saying here

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Act Def says Critics on Halo 2 Vista, it stinks

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Rama says the Critics don't know shit

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
Mind you these are the same Critics that talked shit about XP when it came out

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
So there you have

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Or it could be The Critic because

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
The Critic also used to say it stinks

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
It stinks

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Alright, there we go

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
So anyhow, moving on to other news

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Going to Sony, we're on DS now

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
We're going to go over to Sony

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Warhawk, what the hell is going on with Warhawk?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
At the latest press event apparently

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Warhawk is going to be back on Blu-ray now

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
There is going to be a Blu-ray disc version of Warhawk

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
After all, it's going to have extra materials

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Developer interviews, behind the scenes footage

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
And a Bluetooth headset

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
But the weird thing is, there still is going to be a PlayStation Network version of the game

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Yes

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
So that's kind of funky

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
But don't worry though, it's not that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's only going to be like 40 bucks

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh okay, well that's not so bad then

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Because the online one will probably be 20 or 30 anyway

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Because they can kind of charge that

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah, like 25 bucks or something

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
So you get all this extra stuff

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Well that's kind of interesting, that's an interesting way to do it

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
There's going to be a public beta of the game starting on May 24th

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
And if you want to sign up, you just have to head on over to the official site

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
warhawk.com

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Already signed up, so I haven't been contacted though

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Some good reviews of the game coming out of Sony Gamer's Day though

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
So we'll see

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
It'll be interesting to see what happens there

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
PlayStation 3 could use all these types of games

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
They need some good news very badly right now

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And this is good

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Again, I'm not trying to pick on Sony or anything

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I'm a fan of all three of the gaming companies

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
But let's face it, Sony's kind of doing an uphill battle right now

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So this is good, I'm glad

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
They need to kick it up a notch

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Kick it up a notch

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
For their download content

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I mean seriously, it hasn't really been that much on there

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
RawSteelUT in the chat room is dogging the game

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Warhawk looks like a generic Battlefield clone

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
$40 for a game with no SP mode, fuck that

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
True, I'm not buying it, but you know, it's interesting

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
Anyways, if you like Warhawk and those online multiplayer only games

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
Guess what? SOCOM Confrontation is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
It's going to be an online only multiplayer game

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
And yeah, it's pretty much more Deathmatch and Captured Flag and all that fun stuff

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
But it's SOCOM and it looks pretty so

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
There you go

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
It will support I believe up to 32 players online

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
And yeah, it's just going to be

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It's going to be very interesting

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
However, if you're not really into the multiplayer only SOCOM for PlayStation 3

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
There will be a single player game coming out later on

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
That will have online elements as well

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
So

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I've never really gotten into this series

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
What is this all about?

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
It's just, you know, it's kind of like Ghost Recon

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
But, you know, sewing his own thing

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
It's, you know, Navy Seals military type first person shooter game

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Before we get to the next story real quick

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I just kind of want to pose this question

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Because we kind of talked a little bit before

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And I want to open this up to the chat as well

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
What kinds of stuff does Sony need right now?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Because we obviously have their Gamers' Day event

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
We have more news coming out of their Gamers' Day event

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
What sorts of announcements does Sony need to be making right now?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Or are they on the right track?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
They need more releases

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
More content on their online service

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
If they can't do new games

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Put out some demos or something

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Or maybe some more, something that makes it interesting

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Because right now they don't really have anything to download

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
It's been like one release a month

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And it's been really slow

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
They need some more exclusives for sure

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Because right now they're hurting

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I mean, and I'm talking first party stuff

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Not necessarily third party exclusives

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
They need more

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Microsoft's kicking their ass as far as, you know, exclusives go

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
They've got at least one new exclusive every month

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
You know, one or two

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
And it's kind of hurting them

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Because it's like, well, you know

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
There'll be a game that comes out on the 360

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And then later on it'll come out on the Playstation 3

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
So you're actually

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
It's almost like that the Playstation 3 is Europe

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
The chat room is lighting up with comments on this one

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Let me get their comments and I'll get to Dark Soccer's reaction if there is any

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Looking at the chat room

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Bandit says simply, a price cut

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
ActDef says more good games

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Let's see

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Jirardomo says hitstun Sony needs a game period

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Because I guess hitstun said something about needing more games there

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Let's see

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Blaze says Sony needs a price cut

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
More download content

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
More big name titles

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
And needs to retain exclusives

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
Hitstun says actually Sony needs some Neo Geo CD backwards compatibility

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Hell yeah

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Let's see

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Rossi says simply games

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Who said

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Somebody said something about more AAA titles

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
DustCap2 said more AAA titles ASAP

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
Kazurai says we're certainly not interested in gimmicks

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
I think that was GS68 changing their name there

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
So there you go

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I think they need more triple X titles

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That would work

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
They just need intelligence in there

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Price cut seems to be the number one thing we're hearing in the chat room though

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
That's not likely

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
That's not likely to happen

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It'll probably happen in the fall but it's not

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
I'd say Christmas

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I think for Christmas to stay competitive I think you'll see it

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
I think they need more intelligence in their marketing

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
But I think the problem is I think Xbox will counter it with a price cut of their own

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
I'm just worried right now that they're getting hosed as far as exclusives go

47:31.000 --> 47:39.000
Because it is Sony's fault because Microsoft actually is developing a lot of games in house for themselves

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And they're not relying on third party exclusives

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
They've got their own

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
They've got themselves covered each month with a new game coming out from them

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
You know and you can't say that about Sony

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I mean that's kind of the problem

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
It's like well we've got Halo 3

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Well we've got Killzone 2 coming out

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Okay great

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
I mean that's coming out eventually but that's way in the future

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So I don't know

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
It's just kind of sad

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
I mean again you know I'm not trying to beat Sony when they're down or whatever

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And I'm sure we've had enough of this on the program

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Because I love Playstation 2

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Such a great solid console

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I'm still playing today

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
PS2 is awesome

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
You know I've been treating my Playstation 3 like my PSP

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
At one time I had quite a few games for it

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
I stopped playing them so I sold them back

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And now I'm only playing like one game on it

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Actually now on the Playstation 3 I'm not playing anything on it

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm playing other systems

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
You know Motorstorm I got a little bored with it

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
And you know nothing new

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
I'm still playing lots and lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah but you're about ready to throw the six axis out the window right?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I know I'm ready to explode it into tiny bits

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
When I buy it I'm buying it on Xbox 360

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Wow

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Well you know I believe this week actually

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
I've got more controllers

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I was going to say I think it was either this week or last week

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
That Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition came out for the 360

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
That's the other reasons I don't have to worry about spending the points downloading the characters I won

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
Because you know first thing I'm going to do is we can play through every level I can with Hawkeye

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Our Sony fanboys can take comfort in this

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
I don't know how you guys feel

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
I'm the only one of the three of us that doesn't own a Playstation 3 yet

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
You're not missing it

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
I will go out and buy a Playstation 3 if Final Fantasy 13 stays exclusive to Sony

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Because I'm that much a whore for the Final Fantasy series I will have to have it

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
And you know home looks cool and little big planet

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
You know those are all like extra yeas for me

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
With the things they want to do with Final Fantasy 13 I don't think there's processing wise a way it can be done on the other systems

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And have it come out the way they want it to

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
So I'll be changing my tune single handedly by that game

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
I mean hell Final Fantasy 7 is the reason I bought a Playstation 1

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Yep

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
So that ended up being an okay buy so hey why not

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I need a new Jet Moto game

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
New Jet Moto

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Less Sony bashing more stories

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Let's throw a little bit of love Sony's way

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
Even so I'm not highly excited about this because I played the demo at E3 last year

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
But Heavenly Sword is they're stating that they may have multiplayer as downloadable content

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Which is sort of interesting I guess

50:11.000 --> 50:21.000
Still I mean they're saying that when they do it they want to make it you know full on multiplayer not just an afterthought

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
There's also rumors of you know a co-op and deathmatch but yeah

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
But the game right now though is from what I understand still on schedule for the September release

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
It looks awesome

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Okay good good news there that's some very good news Heavenly Sword looks good

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah exactly they need to catch up with that September

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
It was like playing the singing level in Kingdom Hearts 2

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
Remember that was one small glimpse of the game it was like a year ago a lot could have changed

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I hope I really hope

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
You know what's actually kind of exciting and this is kind of funny

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction that game coming out

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
It's developed by the same people that did Resistance and they're actually using an improved version of the Resistance engine

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
It looks awesome so far it's very cinematic in the way that it plays and stuff

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
You know and I don't even I'm not really into that kind of you know Ratchet and Clank

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
But you know I'm almost kind of thinking to picking it up just because it looks awesome

51:14.000 --> 51:20.000
Alright well sorry I promise that we wouldn't have much more negative Sony stuff

51:20.000 --> 51:29.000
But I just can't not talk about this one and this would have to do with a recent PlayStation 3 promotion

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
And what happened is that there was an ad for

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
Okay basically it's on this Spanish website for Kia

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
Okay it was promoting the Kia car and I guess they're doing this promotion right now with the PlayStation

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
Because they're running this you know like I don't know maybe you enter to win a PlayStation 3 if you test drive one of their cars

51:51.000 --> 51:58.000
But here's the thing in the ad they show the PlayStation 3 and then they show a screenshot on the TV

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
Of Project Gotham Racing 3 which isn't good because that's a Microsoft game

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
And is especially not good because this mistake has happened before on a different website

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
So wishful thinking maybe

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
Somebody needs to let the marketing department know that Project Gotham is not a PlayStation title

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
It gets even worse

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Oh lord

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
Remember there's a Dutch magazine called Media Market that actually did a article on the PlayStation 3

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
And there's Project Gotham printed in their magazine

52:33.000 --> 52:41.000
Damn somebody at Sony marketing needs to get fired right at Sony International Marketing

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
Well I think it's a lot of people because it's Kia but somebody I don't know where they're fucking up

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
It's just a bad mistake to make repeatedly like do it once and it's funny haha people forget

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
But do it now three times and people start to go what the hell seriously why can't people understand that Project Gotham is a Microsoft title

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
To be honest I'm going to get some hate mail for this one it's not even my favorite Microsoft racing title by far

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You know there's just different types of titles

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Do You For Speed Carbon was good

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Really?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I didn't play it very much I like Burnout that's my favorite I think is Burnout

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Because I like to blow things up

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
There's a lot of need for speed

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Burnout Paradise

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Oh I fucking can't wait for new Burnout yay

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I do like Burnout for exploding

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
Exactly Burnout has fire therefore it wins

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
I wish I could say the same for Full Auto although it wasn't bad sorry

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
So here's something else that's kind of funny a little story

53:31.000 --> 53:39.000
Apparently there's some guy that uh some gamer that was kind of saying farewell to his Playstation 2

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
Because he has a brand new Playstation 3

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
I don't know why he decided to do this but he figured the best send off was to piss on it

53:47.000 --> 53:54.000
And I guess he got drunk and you know pissed on his Playstation 2 and being the dumbass that he is left it plugged in

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
And basically knocked himself out after pissing on

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Didn't mommy ever tell you don't piss on the electric fence

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
What was that episode of Beavis and Butthead where they were playing don't piss on the electric fence

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
No it was Ren and Stimpy

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
They were playing don't piss on the electric fence

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah there's a little song that goes with it I know

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
I remember the song

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
Dark Soccer you've had many consoles come and go throughout your house right?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Mostly just consoles come

54:16.000 --> 54:25.000
Have you ever done this send off for a console have you ever you know pulled down your trousers and peed on a console to send it off

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
No because I'm not stupid

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
Especially if you're in your house why would you piss on it in your own house you stupid moron

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
God I'm gonna piss on it

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
You know usually when they break we gut them and try to do something neat with the husks

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
Seriously haven't you been paying attention to the internet the thing to do with consoles is to slam them with a sledgehammer

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Put it on YouTube

54:48.000 --> 54:56.000
And the best way to do that is to play the music from what was that scene in Office Space and recreate it out in the field

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Oh with the copier yeah that was a good time

54:58.000 --> 55:09.000
So anyway whenever we hear stories about dumbasses like this one it can make us feel anything else but anger and you know what that means boys and girls

55:09.000 --> 55:27.000
N.M. 64 says Rob Roberts remember it's harder for females not really I mean you know she could take a dookie on it if she wanted to

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
Anyway dark soccer your F.U. of the week please

55:30.000 --> 55:42.000
It goes to you I was going to say F.U. to the Pollen and Dixon for making me all stuffed up and getting all over my car

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
But no F.U. to Rob because you've never had to go out in the wild

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
You don't know that I went camping once

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
But you've never had well okay you've never been a woman going to the bathroom in the wild

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Just squat behind a tree what's wrong with that

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
It's a lot it's not as easy as it sounds

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
You make it sound like some assembly is required

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
That's why I love living in the modern world where we have things called toilets

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
And not living in Japan where the public toilets are spot toilets

56:16.000 --> 56:26.000
Rob you remember though it's not always a good idea to go behind Neil Bush and stuff especially if you're a woman because the drag queen fairy may come and turn you into a man

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And then they'll make a movie out of that that's horrible

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What movie was that again

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
I can't remember it was like penis envy that's what it was

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
Actually there's another thing it was a movie with Adam Sandler who's coming out

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Oh is that the gay marriage one

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
The trailer already pisses me the hell off so fuck them

56:51.000 --> 57:00.000
I'm willing to give the movie a chance to see what the message is in the end but yeah the trailer does make it look like I can't even describe it

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
It's very trivializing

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Yeah it does

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Draw Them Together did it first

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Draw Them Together did it funny

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
I'll give the movie a chance but the trailer does not look promising anyway Logie

57:10.000 --> 57:20.000
Screw all the software makers on the 360 for making it so fucking hard to do a system link game with your goddamn games

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
Stop having the patch shit so it's incompatible with unpatched shit

57:25.000 --> 57:32.000
And then F.U. did my work for not actually having an internet connection in the one room there where we have the game consoles so I can just update them right there

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So I have to take them home

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Okay is it my turn to give an F.U.?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Well my first F.U. is to Draw Them

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
I don't like Draw Them

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Nobody likes Draw Them and Draw Them is no fun

57:44.000 --> 57:51.000
And then I have a second F.U. and this one's pretty serious so I have to kill the music here for a minute

57:51.000 --> 58:03.000
I had to give an F.U. to myself because something really bad happened and it's kind of hard for me to admit this openly

58:03.000 --> 58:15.000
But it's just a very difficult thing for me I have to give an F.U. to myself because I kind of like a Fergie song

58:15.000 --> 58:26.000
I know I failed the internets completely I failed our listeners but I just like this new Fergie song this big girls don't cry

58:26.000 --> 58:36.000
This is a song that's beautiful

58:36.000 --> 58:50.000
So I like Fergie and for that I deserve to be mocked and made fun of openly by others and I hate myself

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I'm pointing at you

58:52.000 --> 58:58.000
Alright that's it more news

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
No I'd say we take an ice cream break

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
An ice cream break no we only have a few more stories six more stories we can do it

59:07.000 --> 59:17.000
Fine fine fine well speaking of F.Us Sony is committed to the PS3 for ten years and beyond

59:17.000 --> 59:29.000
Basically the S.C.E.A. president Jack Trenton is quoted saying we didn't get into PS3 for the first six months of 2007

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
We're into this for the next ten years and beyond a million units one way or another at this point isn't going to worry us

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
So this is what they're saying well our sales suck but we hope to make it up in ten years

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Good luck

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
We're dedicated to this console to infinity and beyond

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
Has any console well I guess you know what it makes sense we kind of look at this and go oh ha ha ha

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You know but come to think of it you know consoles live on even after the next generation I mean technically we are still in the PlayStation 2's life span right

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
They're still putting that crap for it

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Exactly I mean and good crap we had God of War 2 we have this what the role playing game folks looking forward to Final Fantasy 12 is not that old all things considered you know it's console still got a lot of life left in it

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So you know I could see how the console they can say it might be lasting that long before they you know put a bullet in it I don't know

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Anyway sorry I was reading some chat room while Jamie was reading that story there and Mystic Gohan reminded me that big girls don't cry so I need to just suck it up here on the show

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Also big girls and big boys alike love the Chronicles of Riddick or at least you know feel okay about it I don't know sorry bad segue but hey you know what even if you didn't like the movie the game wasn't bad there was a huge game that came out on the Xbox the Chronicles of Riddick game and guess what there is a next gen version coming out

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The UK trade publication MCV has confirmed that Star Breeze is working on a new version of the game for next gen systems the game is called Assault on Dark Athena X and it's going to have a single player mode which is a little bit longer than last time

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000
An all new multiplayer mode and a developers commentary mode so what does that mean you get running commentary while you're playing the game kind of like a DVD track

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And man this part was such a bitch to program I swear code here and code this didn't quite work together so we had to do this to make them work and blah blah blah blah blah and the rest of us are going um yeah I don't speak your language

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's like Final Fantasy 7 and it's like yeah and then the scene where Eris dies oh crap that hasn't happened yet oh shit um forget I said anything about that that oh dammit

01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Good job Loki maybe hey maybe in that remake that they keep saying they're gonna do for you know the internet loves to rumor that one for the Playstation 3 maybe it can have developer commentary in it

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And maybe my skin will turn blue

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Maybe it will Jamie maybe it will

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So Sony plans on bringing the pain to the Playstation 3 and actually the Playstation Network it's a game called Pain and it involves you launching a poor hapless victim into stuff

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm gonna buy it

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Wait is this the one where I saw a screenshot where it was just a guy on a like a slingshot and they were gonna fling him into a building or something

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Pretty much and it has monkeys getting injured so injured monkeys people getting hurt sounds like a game I'm gonna buy so yeah that's gonna be coming out later on

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's like jackass but actually funny

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Sort of um yeah I don't know it's just using the physics engine so you just you know launch your character into stuff to get him hurt as badly as possible

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And they have different games like including like a horse mode or spank the monkey and mime toss

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Hey I like that part

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Dr. Burst in chat asks what's with the Sony bashing tonight dude this looks great pain looks great and we said the mystic sword looks cool

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Heavenly sword and rat things

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000
You're right I'm exposed I hate Sony haha got me

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Well you know though speaking of games that I'm not buying Vivendi is putting time shift on PS3 so it will be up there with the PC and PC 360 I'm sorry Xbox 360 oh my did that slip out

01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Oh I was just gonna say I have a laugh sometimes with like gaming press out there they always make stories for themselves like this whole time shift is coming to PlayStation 3 it's always been scheduled to come out on PlayStation 3

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You know even when when Atari had the rights for it but then it went away for a while

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Thank you for reading the whole rest of the story for me

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Oh sorry

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
You ass

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I'm not on top of things

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
That's it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I only read my story

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:32.000
This is what you're gonna do Jamie you know what story he does next because you can see it so read ahead and when he starts reading it cut him off and finish it okay Jamie

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
You know I'm just gonna leave

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
No you're not you get about two minutes to prep because I have a story here first

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
No I don't care

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It's about the PlayStation 3

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Okay I'm gonna sit here and read my comics for the rest of the show

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Alright

01:04:46.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Here we go now this is something the chat room said earlier is that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut and you know gamers have said this and you know you've written the magazines you've read it on your online game blogs and now it's publishers saying that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Specifically Ubisoft and Yves Guillemont who is the president and CEO of Ubisoft has said that Sony will quote for sure have a lower market share than before because of the PlayStation 3's cost

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And he said quote they have to decrease the price quite significantly

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Very interesting

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
However Ubisoft is continuing to support the PlayStation 3 they're bringing an exclusive title to Europe

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Don't know what that means it's an exclusive PlayStation 3 Europe title so those of you guys in Europe that always feel like you're getting pooped on and neglected Ubisoft is hearing your pain and is bringing you something exclusive

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Of course we have absolutely zero idea what that is yet

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Far Cry Cricket

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Who knows Far Cry Cricket

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's Cricket in the Jungle

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We'll see

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Anyways so Sega is licensing the Unreal 3 engine yes the same engine that's been in practically everything lately but you know hey it's yet another game thoughts are though that it's going to be used in the upcoming I guess they're enhancing or remaking the Alien franchise

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Like Alien Syndrome and that stuff?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
No like Aliens as in

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Oh the movies oh I didn't know Sega owned the rights to that

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Now you know

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Okay

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Wait no that must be a different thing I'm thinking of

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But they haven't made an Alien movie since the Winona Ryder one which was years ago

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Well they made a crappy Aliens vs Predator movie and then they're making a sequel

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Aliens vs Predator was fun

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
They're making a sequel

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Speaking of guilty pleasure movies there we go

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
When Aliens make out with a black chick yeah

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Or no I'm sorry that was a predator

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I swear to god

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Well at the end of the movie to spoil it for you the predator looks at the one chick and it looks like they're going to make out and then they don't

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Oh so they don't actually kiss

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
They don't actually kiss

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
So you lied to me

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It looks like they are

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Thanks for spoiling the movie OMG spoilers

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It's ridiculous it's a ridiculous movie

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I would have liked to see like maybe Aliens vs Jason or something like that

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Aliens vs Predator was like the big fan thing

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Freddy vs the Predator

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
TigerClawnChat says the best Aliens was the arcade version from Konami

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It was that's what I was thinking of

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But Ross Steel UT says hey Tiger, Aliens vs Predator arcade by Capcom equals sex and act deaf degrees over in Capcom

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
No I was thinking of the Capcom one because it's all about playing through the game with Lynn Karasawa

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
With her freaking sword of death

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Awesome game

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Anything else about the unreal engine?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Sorry we cut you off but you deserved it

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
No it's going to be probably a first person shooter since people really like to think outside the box

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Sonic 3D again

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Did you happen to catch that video that was like the Sonic concept that they were going to do that was supposed to be based off the cartoon series?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yes I actually did see that some YouTube-age I don't remember where I saw it posted

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Where like Sonic moved a little more 3D but it was still like a platformer

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
That looked so fake to me that looked so incredibly fake

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Because I cannot believe that they would make a game like that where Sonic moved like molasses

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Because if you watch that video it was slow

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I know which system they'd put it out on too, the CDI

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
It looked horrible

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I don't know where did you see that YouTube posted?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Kotaku

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Was it?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It looked fake I'm sorry it screamed of fakeness to me like they took some unknown game and sprited Sonic into it

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I don't know I don't want to believe it because it looked horrible

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Maybe that was the beginning of the end of Sega who knows

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Let's see

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I'm looking at what's in chat going on there

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
ActDeft wants to see a video game, Aliens vs Predator vs Marvel vs Capcom vs SNK

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Well that would be the ultimate wouldn't it?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Alright and let's see

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
GS68 is kicking Sonic while they're down here

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I tried the Sonic 360 demo and the controls nearly made me have a stroke

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Heart attack, stomach acid overflow, HIV and loose stools all at once

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You know what they need to have now that Sega is doing third party titles now?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Nintendo vs Sega

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
The fighting game to end all fighting

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Dude Smash Brothers hello Sonic

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
No I'm talking about a bigger roster we're talking like hundreds of characters

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
We never did get the Namco Capcom game out here

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Oh that's true the Namco Cross Capcom or whatever it was?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It was a big RPG I know someone who has it

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I played the Playstation 2 Japanese one and I'm kind of glad that we didn't because it was kind of lame

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
It sounded so cool in theory

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Bandit reminds us they do have Sonic vs Mario in the upcoming Olympics game

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
We talked about it a few shows ago

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You know what I want?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I want another

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Crap I just lost the game

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I want another Strider

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000
What was that ridiculous Sega fighting game that they had where you can actually play as a Daytona car and punch things?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That was in Fighter's Megamix which I have

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
That's the kind of ridiculous gameplay I want

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I want you to be able to play as Rob the Robot or as one of the unicycles from Uniracers

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
This is something really ridiculous

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Instead of Captain Falcon I want to play as the car

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Exactly

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I'll just turn around and use Nitro Boost

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I want to play as a little spinny fire thing from Dungeons and Super Mario Brothers

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I want to play as a Bob-omb

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Where your final attack is explode

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
That's awesome

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I guess it's break time boys and girls

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
We're going to take a quick break here

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in part B

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Lots of news coming up in part B tonight

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
We haven't even touched the Xbox 360 or the Wii

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
This has kind of been the Sony segment

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
We have lots of 360 and Wii news coming up in part B of Orange Lounge Radio

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
We'll be back right after this
