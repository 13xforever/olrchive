7000	12000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko
14000	18000	Tonight, May 20th, 2007, Blizzard officially announces Starcraft 2
19000	21000	Halo 3 gets an official release date
21000	25000	Project Gotham 3 is mistaken for a Sony game once again
25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
55000	57000	I don't have to go to work tomorrow
60000	62000	And I didn't go Thursday or Friday
65000	67000	I was supposed to go to a wedding and we decided not to go
67000	70000	So I went and did nerdy stuff yesterday
70000	72000	And slept a lot
72000	82000	I had time off set to go on vacation to L.A.
82000	84000	Actually, I think I was supposed to go to Disneyland
84000	86000	But this was a couple of years ago
86000	89000	This was before Disneyland was the cool thing to do between us
89000	92000	And for some reason or other the trip got cancelled
92000	93000	We didn't end up going
93000	94000	But I just kept the time off of work
94000	97000	And that was the same week that Final Fantasy XI came out
97000	98000	Oh God
98000	99000	I remember that
99000	102000	I sat at home and played Final Fantasy XI for like four days straight
102000	103000	Early days of your addiction
103000	105000	Oh, it was horrendous
105000	106000	Just looking back on that
106000	108000	I did that when Final Fantasy VI came out
108000	110000	Well, three over here came out
110000	111000	When I was in high school
111000	114000	And I stayed home with the flu
116000	117000	I had a fever
117000	119000	And it needed more Final Fantasy
119000	120000	I have a fever
120000	123000	And the only cure is more treasure hunters
125000	128000	I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate the flu
128000	129000	I need cure three
129000	130000	Alright, anyway
130000	133000	Uh, Loki, Techmaster Loki is here as well
133000	134000	Yes, I am
134000	137000	Have you ever called in sick or used your vacation to play a video game?
137000	138000	Yes
138000	139000	What was that?
139000	140000	I don't remember
140000	143000	But you remember taking the time off to play it?
143000	144000	Uh, yes
144000	145000	Alright
145000	147000	You don't remember what it was, but you took off
147000	149000	I think I may have done it for San Andreas
149000	150000	Oh, okay
150000	151000	Maybe
151000	153000	Alright, you gonna do it for Grand Theft Auto IV?
153000	155000	No, because we'll be playing it at work
155000	156000	So it's not a big deal
156000	158000	You know a lot of people were pissed off
158000	161000	Because there were a lot of people that took the day off for the Halo 3 beta
161000	163000	And we're gonna talk more Halo 3 probably in part B tonight
163000	165000	But you know the Halo 3 beta came out
165000	167000	And a lot of people called in sick to work that day
167000	169000	Because they were gonna sit at home and play the Halo 3 beta
169000	172000	And then the damn thing didn't show up for like 13 hours
172000	174000	And people were pissed
174000	176000	You know, because they'd taken the time off work
176000	177000	But it's hard
177000	180000	I know it's hard to get upset when it's like, you know, kind of free
180000	183000	And they never promised it on a certain day to begin with really
183000	186000	You know, it's kind of one of those tricky situations
186000	187000	I don't know
187000	189000	But I thought that was interesting
189000	191000	So anyway
191000	194000	Alright, so we're gonna get into some gaming news tonight
194000	196000	But first we're gonna start it off with a little bit of
196000	198000	How was your gaming week?
198000	200000	No special guests tonight, but we do have the chat room
200000	202000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
202000	204000	Harvey's here, Rob
204000	205000	Look at what?
205000	206000	Harvey
206000	207000	Who's Harvey?
207000	208000	Did you see the movie?
208000	209000	No
209000	210000	Invisible Rabbit?
210000	211000	No
211000	212000	It was a Jimmy Stewart movie
212000	214000	Oh, what's, no, a little
214000	215000	The Wonder Hamster?
215000	217000	No
217000	220000	You need to watch some classic movies every so often, Rob
220000	221000	Once in a while I do
221000	222000	Broaden Your Horizons
222000	224000	I do, I've seen like Casablanca
224000	226000	And the Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies ever
226000	229000	I'm going to find the DVD of Harvey and buy it for you
229000	230000	And you're gonna watch it
230000	232000	And Hitchcock, I love old Hitchcock movies like Psycho
232000	235000	Casablanca is so like, you know, the simple life
235000	236000	It's just like
236000	238000	Oh my god, there's this war going on
238000	241000	Why is that the inconvenience me?
241000	245000	Wow, my headache just came back
245000	246000	Good job
246000	247000	Alright
247000	249000	I just swallowed like five Excedrin
249000	252000	I'm looking at our chat room right now to see what's going on
252000	254000	Of course we do tape live on Sunday nights
254000	258000	And then release this to our audio RSS feed is the technical name for it
258000	261000	But most people just call it a podcast or a blog cast or whatever
261000	264000	Let's see, anyway, look in the chat room, what's going on
264000	265000	Gaming week
265000	266000	Huh?
266000	267000	Gaming week
267000	268000	Yeah, we'll get to that
268000	269000	Can't we say hello to the chatters real quick?
269000	270000	No
270000	271000	Alright, well
271000	273000	ActDeaf says I hope OLR cheers me up
273000	274000	Well, not with Jamie's current attitude
274000	275000	Hi
275000	276000	She won't be
276000	277000	She happy, dammit
277000	278000	She won't be cheering anybody up there
278000	280000	Be of good cheer or I'll kick your ass
280000	284000	Let's see, PK, I'm sorry, I always say his name wrong
284000	286000	Peaker Uno, I think is how I'm supposed to say it
286000	289000	Says we need to have an OLR me we suck at Halo game
289000	290000	Yes, we do
290000	294000	GS68 said Rob floods go faster at night
294000	296000	I guess in response to chat going Rob, Rob, Rob
296000	298000	You know Sauce was at Disneyland Friday
298000	299000	Lucky
299000	303000	No, and she said they closed down Pirates for the premiere and then they opened it back
303000	304000	up
304000	307000	Oh, the Pirates premiere was going on, that's cool, fun
307000	311000	Alright, we're not a Disneyland podcast, so tell us about your gaming week
311000	317000	Well, I played something like seven hours of, no not seven, because I took a break
317000	321000	I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance because I had to start over because there
321000	323000	were fingerprints on the rental
323000	326000	We get free rentals from Hollywood Video, so I just played a whole bunch
326000	332000	And I was very pissed off because I played Iron Man on the Mandarin stage
332000	337000	Only I used the Ultimate Armor because it looks a lot better than his dorky, you know, asshole armor
337000	341000	Sorry, I've been reading, I read a lot of comics
341000	345000	And so there wasn't any of the dialogue and I was like, well this is crap
345000	349000	And so I just went back to playing a whole lot of Deadpool because he's funny
349000	352000	And god damn stupid computer
352000	357000	You know, I had my computer on Power Saver because I was moving files anyway
357000	363000	So I also went to Pen-a-Go-Go
363000	367000	Which was this, I want to say it was big, but it really wasn't
367000	369000	It was like in a warehouse in Dixon
369000	373000	Well, actually the big, you know, hall at the Dixon Fairgrounds
373000	377000	For our international listeners, how can we describe Dixon, California?
377000	379000	Podunk
379000	382000	It's like going to the country
382000	384000	It's the suburb of a suburb, right?
384000	390000	You have like this old town and then you drive like five minutes and you have farm
390000	394000	Like Davis is a suburb of Sacramento, right?
394000	396000	Where the school is, where the first season of sorority life was, right?
396000	398000	So most people know UC Davis
398000	401000	Well Dixon is a suburb of Davis, okay?
401000	405000	So that's, to put it in perspective, like it's not even as populated
405000	407000	I apologize if we have any listeners in Dixon
407000	410000	I do love Mary's Pizza Shack, which is in Dixon, but that's about it
410000	413000	I went to this sweet stuff place, I think it was called
413000	415000	And it was really yummy and I had banana ice cream
415000	417000	Anyway, sorry, Pen-a-Go-Go, pinball
417000	421000	Okay, yeah, I'm actually pulling up the list of the games I played at Pen-a-Go-Go
421000	426000	And this isn't all of them because I did play a bunch of really old, old, old machines
426000	428000	Like the ones from before
428000	432000	Like, these are so old that they had the flippy numbers, you know?
432000	439000	Where instead of, you know, you have your LED screen, you had the flippy numbers
439000	441000	Wow, like the counters
441000	444000	And there was only one of those that was worth mentioning, which is called Skylab
444000	447000	And the cool thing about Skylab is that you have this middle section
447000	450000	That's got a line in between them
450000	452000	And you have five pinballs in there
452000	454000	And you have to knock five onto one side of it
454000	457000	And then you get like some special thing, only I couldn't do it
457000	463000	So I played Black Rose, which is a pirate theme with this huge, you know, big old pirate winch on the thing
463000	466000	And it has cannons in it and you have to like shoot down a pirate ship
466000	468000	Cool, pirate winches
468000	471000	And Centaur, which was a cool older table
471000	477000	It was before they had the big, you know, LED, the big display, digital displays and everything
477000	479000	And it was just the numbers and all that
479000	482000	And I played the new Pirates of the Caribbean machine, which is actually okay
482000	485000	But it wasn't quite as awesome as I thought it would be
485000	488000	And I kicked Dan's ass at Theatre of Magic twice
488000	490000	I love Theatre of Magic, that's a kickass table
490000	492000	Theatre of Magic is the most sexy pinball table
492000	495000	I was about ready to offer the dude four thousand bucks on
495000	499000	I was like, hello, my retirement money, give me Theatre of Magic
499000	502000	But no, I had to use it on school
502000	505000	But he did win, though, on the third game
505000	507000	But that's okay because I also kicked his ass at Adam's Family
507000	511000	God, I wonder where I could find four thousand dollars to buy a Theatre of Magic table
511000	513000	It's so tempting
513000	516000	Apparently it's one of Dan's buddies that owns the machine
516000	521000	I played Demolition Man and I thought it would be a great machine because I love ramps
521000	524000	No, suck-tastic
524000	526000	Much like the movie
526000	528000	Actually, I like the movie
528000	532000	Demolition Man is one of my guilty pleasures
532000	533000	Kind of like Me and Showgirls?
533000	534000	Yeah
534000	535000	Okay, yeah, gotcha
535000	538000	Just because I love the whole scene when they're in the car scene to old Oscar Mayer commercials
538000	540000	You know who really brought down that movie?
540000	541000	Who?
541000	542000	Sandra Bullock
542000	543000	It ruins everything
543000	544000	It's like poison
544000	545000	Everything she touches is poison
545000	547000	The speed was good, the first one
547000	549000	It had Denis Leary in it, though
549000	552000	Denis Leary is the reason to watch Demolition Man
552000	555000	Sorry to interrupt your report, but I have to ask Loki, do you have any guilty pleasure movies?
555000	557000	Guilty pleasure movies?
557000	560000	I guess Wild Zero, maybe
560000	562000	Dude, I love that movie, too
562000	564000	But there's that one
564000	566000	I have a new one, though, possibly
566000	567000	I have to watch it, though
567000	569000	Yo Yo Girl Cop
569000	572000	Oh, wait, is that the Sukebon Deca?
572000	573000	No, that was not a cop
573000	576000	It's the one about this Asian chick who fights crime
576000	580000	She's like a cop by day, crime fighter by night, which is kind of the same thing
580000	584000	But anyways, she fights crime with this metal yo-yo
584000	586000	Well, the yo-yo started off as a weapon
586000	587000	That's amazing
587000	589000	So, it's interesting
589000	591000	Okay, well, there's more games
591000	594000	I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is the worst machine ever
594000	596000	It's like it has action figures all over it
596000	603000	And the only cool thing about it is this rotating pizza spinner in the middle that will shoot the ball in different directions
603000	608000	I played Medieval Madness, but the guy who owned it put extra steep ramps in it
608000	610000	But I did break down the castle, that was cool
610000	612000	Pinbot
613000	616000	Fucking greatest pinball game of ever
616000	617000	No
617000	618000	Ever
618000	619000	But it was dingy
619000	620000	Actually, you need to come to my house and play Bride of Pinbot
620000	622000	Bride of Pinbot is actually better
622000	623000	I forgot you have Bride of Pinbot now
623000	626000	Yes, well, it's not technically ours, it's our friend Will's
626000	629000	But it lives in my apartment, my garage
629000	631000	Suddenly we're becoming a pinball podcast, but that's okay
631000	632000	Okay
632000	635000	Pinball is what I played before DDR, which is how I met all you guys
635000	637000	So, this is like going back to our roots
637000	638000	There's a few more worth mentioning
638000	639000	I played Hyperball
639000	641000	Hyperball is the worst pinball ever
641000	643000	Well, not really worst, it's the weirdest
643000	649000	Because you have this big open field and little holes around the perimeter of the thing
649000	653000	And you have to shoot the balls into the holes and they're like by the alphabet and it's really stupid
653000	656000	I played High Speed, which is one of the older ones
656000	657000	That was really fun
657000	658000	And Cyclone
658000	662000	High Speed was the other NES game that fucking no one played
662000	665000	They had Pinbot, and then Pinbot was so successful they made High Speed
665000	666000	But nobody played High Speed
666000	668000	But High Speed is a fucking awesome table
668000	669000	It is an awesome, that's why they made it a game
669000	671000	But Cyclone has, um
671000	676000	Now, Cyclone, it was one of the ones I used to play in Mobile at a Godfather's Pizza
676000	682000	And the marquee of it has a clown on it and this rollercoaster
682000	685000	And in the first row is Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan
685000	690000	But on the one in Mobile, someone duct taped over the clown because clowns are scary
690000	696000	And drew a beard with a big mustache and a cowboy hat on Ronald Reagan
696000	698000	So, that's always my memory of it
698000	700000	It's a cool table, I just hate clowns
700000	704000	There should be a pinball game where you just hit clowns in the face
704000	705000	That'd be fun
705000	707000	The biggest disappointment for me, well there's Fun House
707000	709000	Fun House is one where you can hit this
709000	710000	That's right!
710000	715000	I hate Fun House though, we almost bought one and I told Dan no because the freaking head scared the crap out of me
715000	721000	But the disappointment though is I wanted to see World Cup Soccer and apparently they sold it on Friday and I went on Saturday
721000	724000	Big Bang Bar, no one had any prototypes there
724000	728000	And Big Bang Bar is like, I've gotten to play a Big Bang Bar
728000	730000	That's the one where there's only like 20 of them in existence
730000	731000	16
731000	734000	And when Capcom closed down their pinball division
734000	738000	However, the rights to Big Bang Bar have now been made available
738000	741000	I think to Stern I think is going to be released
741000	742000	Don't quote me on that yet
742000	744000	But I think Stern's going to be releasing them
744000	747000	Time Machine is the other one I wanted to see
747000	753000	Jackbot, Black Knight 2000 and Doctor Who of course were the big ones that I wanted to see
753000	759000	Other than that, I've been playing stupid Flash games thanks to Loki
759000	760000	Sorry
760000	762000	That's okay, they're kind of addicting
762000	764000	I'm going to be doing that all day tomorrow now
764000	767000	Yeah, I was playing Flash games too
767000	768000	So what were you playing?
768000	773000	I played, actually, I played Crackdown
773000	776000	A little bit of co-op Crackdown, that was fun
776000	779000	I did try the Halo 3 beta once
779000	780000	It was okay
780000	785000	To be honest, it's exactly like the last Halo game
785000	788000	Gameplay-wise, they haven't really changed much
788000	791000	Which is fine, it was good to begin with
791000	794000	But I still really suck at Halo
794000	797000	I had trouble
797000	800000	The only thing I kind of regret is the loading screens
800000	803000	In some games, they usually show you what the button configuration is
803000	806000	I went in there and was like, how do I do stuff?
806000	808000	I had to kind of figure that out
808000	810000	And they still didn't really get the hang of it
810000	812000	Instead they have the message that says
812000	814000	Halo 3 Beta, love Bungie
814000	816000	I thought that was funny
816000	818000	So that was okay
818000	821000	I went back to playing Earth Defense Force 2017 again
821000	824000	And I got the fucking super awesome stationary guns
824000	827000	I'm going to be able to blow through Inferno difficulty now
827000	829000	Like, no problem
829000	831000	But those are cool
831000	833000	And then, what else did I play?
833000	835000	Oh yeah, I tried a little bit of that
835000	837000	What was it, Geasswing or whatever?
837000	839000	It was okay
839000	841000	Very bland, actually
841000	844000	The graphics in it were very kind of, ugh
844000	846000	Like I threw this together really quick
846000	847000	Dude, it was free
847000	850000	I don't care, I've seen better shit that's been free, okay?
850000	851000	You know
851000	853000	Warning Forever, that's free
853000	855000	And that looked a lot better
855000	857000	And there wasn't even any background on that
857000	858000	So
858000	860000	They should, simple, you know
860000	862000	They should have done all
862000	864000	Vectors would have been cool
864000	865000	Anyways
865000	868000	So, then beyond that stuff
868000	871000	I played a little bit of
871000	874000	Well, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories
874000	876000	Still playing that
876000	878000	I'll still be playing that
878000	881000	Until, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out
881000	883000	I tried a little bit of Saints Row
883000	884000	That was fun
884000	886000	For some reason though, like
886000	890000	I really, I don't know if anyone has actually tried landing 360 systems
890000	892000	They are as finicky as shit
892000	896000	They will not land with each other if like something's different or whatever
896000	898000	Like Saints Row, we were trying to land it
898000	902000	One of the systems doesn't have the update for it yet
902000	904000	The multiplayer update that fixes the lag
904000	905000	One system does
905000	907000	It won't see each other
907000	908000	So that kind of sucked
908000	910000	Cracked down, we tried landing it again
910000	911000	And it won't see each other
911000	913000	Despite the fact that it's the exact same setup
913000	914000	And it worked the other day
914000	916000	So I don't know what the fuck's wrong with these things
916000	919000	But all I know is Microsoft did not make it fucking easy to land this shit
919000	920000	So
920000	921000	Fuck them
921000	923000	That's it
923000	925000	Alright, well, my gaming week
925000	927000	I also played the Halo 3 beta
927000	929000	And, you know, it's pretty cool
929000	931000	To me, my first, my initial impression was like
931000	933000	Okay, it's like Halo 2
933000	935000	Is prettier and with, you know, the shield
935000	937000	And other new X button features, right
937000	938000	That change up the game a little bit
938000	939000	But then I'm kind of thinking like
939000	941000	Okay, well Halo 2 is a pretty rock solid game
941000	943000	That people still play online
943000	945000	Like over and over and over again
945000	946000	Until their thumbs fall off
946000	948000	So if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
948000	951000	So I think, honestly, Halo 3 is going to be pretty cool
951000	954000	Now there were, like, I found the beta to be a bit confusing at first
954000	957000	Because I was trying to set up a game that would just be my friends and I
957000	959000	And like I couldn't, like, we could only like
959000	961000	Get the friends together to join other games
961000	963000	But I guess you can't really be picky choosy
963000	964000	Because it is a beta
964000	966000	They're probably trying to stress the stress
966000	967000	Yeah, it's probably what I meant
967000	968000	So I'm not going to complain about that
968000	969000	I was just like
969000	971000	Aw, darn, I wish I could have done it this way
971000	975000	But I did find that if I don't play ranked mode
975000	976000	If I just stay away from ranked mode
976000	977000	And play, like, the open mode
977000	980000	Generally you get people of a lower skill rank
980000	982000	Which is good, it's better for me to play on
982000	984000	So I played a couple games and it was a good time
984000	986000	Like the training stuff, or?
986000	989000	Yeah, I played, a random O.L.R. listener came in too
989000	990000	And I'm sorry, dude, I forgot your name
990000	992000	But somebody that was no O.L.R. listener
992000	993000	Came onto my friends list
993000	995000	We played a Halo 3 match together
995000	996000	We had a good time
996000	997000	I actually got more kills than him
997000	998000	So I was all, he's like
998000	999000	What do you mean you suck at Halo?
999000	1001000	So I was all excited, but it was just luck
1001000	1002000	And sometimes it's just luck
1002000	1004000	Especially when nobody knows the maps
1004000	1005000	Because they're all new
1005000	1006000	But I thought it was really pretty
1006000	1007000	I like that map where you play in the snow
1007000	1008000	It was kind of neat looking
1008000	1010000	And the shields look pretty cool
1010000	1012000	Like, you know, it's kind of cool
1012000	1013000	The game's going to sell like crazy
1013000	1015000	It's going to be Halo 2 all over again
1015000	1016000	But just a whole new thing
1016000	1017000	It's going to be huge
1017000	1019000	I mean, I wish I wasn't so ignorant
1019000	1020000	When it comes to first person shooters
1020000	1022000	Because a lot of them feel all the same to me
1022000	1023000	Because I don't play a whole lot of them
1023000	1024000	Like, I've played Quake 3
1024000	1025000	And some of the other Quakes
1025000	1026000	And, you know, a couple here and there
1026000	1029000	But, you know, Halo's just always kind of stood out
1029000	1031000	I hope it has a great single player, though, too
1031000	1032000	For those that don't necessarily like to
1032000	1034000	Go online and play random people
1034000	1036000	But I can't wait to have the college buddies
1036000	1037000	And I play in the game
1037000	1038000	It's going to be fun
1038000	1039000	Yeah
1039000	1040000	Let's see, other games I've been playing this week
1040000	1043000	I've actually went back to my PlayStation 2
1043000	1045000	And picked up a game that I played a lot of
1045000	1046000	When it first came out
1046000	1048000	But then they just kind of stopped
1048000	1049000	And neglected it when the Wii came out
1049000	1051000	And that would be Final Fantasy XII
1051000	1053000	And what motivated me to play this game again
1053000	1054000	Is you might remember last week
1054000	1055000	I had a bit of an emo week
1055000	1056000	And Miklotov was here
1056000	1059000	And he talked about how he bought me the Balthier doll
1059000	1061000	Who is, like, the reason to play Final Fantasy XII
1061000	1063000	Because not only is he sexy
1063000	1065000	But he's just, like, the most interesting character in the game, right?
1065000	1066000	He's awesome
1066000	1068000	So, yeah, I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XII
1068000	1070000	Because I want to play it through to completion
1070000	1072000	But I'm kind of one of those people that's like
1072000	1074000	If I forget what happened in the story
1074000	1076000	And it's been, like, you know, a good five months
1076000	1077000	Since I've touched the game
1077000	1079000	I have to go back and start from the beginning
1079000	1080000	So I started back from the beginning
1080000	1083000	But, God, the battle system in that game is great
1083000	1085000	I mean, it's like playing an online game
1085000	1086000	But not online
1086000	1089000	Like, where you get total control over all the other people
1089000	1090000	It's great
1090000	1092000	I forgot there's a few other things I did play
1092000	1094000	I played Eternal Sonata
1094000	1095000	Which they have the demo for
1095000	1097000	That demo is amazing
1097000	1098000	I loved it
1098000	1099000	Did you like it?
1099000	1100000	Yeah, it was pretty awesome
1100000	1101000	It's awesome
1101000	1102000	Oh my God
1102000	1105000	The Xbox 360 needs a game like Eternal Sonata
1105000	1106000	So bad
1106000	1108000	It's one of the types of games that Microsoft has been lacking in
1108000	1110000	Ever since, like, Xbox One
1110000	1112000	And, yes, I know there was, like, Enchanted Arms
1112000	1116000	But, seriously, this is like a great role-playing game
1116000	1118000	It looks to be shaping up to be one
1118000	1119000	I was so impressed with the demo
1119000	1123000	To me, this is how Square Enix should be doing their Final Fantasy games
1123000	1127000	I don't know how Final Fantasy XIII is going to be
1127000	1128000	It looks a little weird
1128000	1131000	But, you know, this is the way I would see them doing it
1131000	1136000	Stick to what you know, you know, like Final Fantasy X was okay
1136000	1137000	And XII was okay
1137000	1140000	But just, you know, that same type of thing
1140000	1143000	You don't need to go all full 3D where you can adjust the camera and stuff
1143000	1144000	Yeah, I know
1144000	1146000	XII's cool, though
1146000	1148000	But I'm excited to see what they do for XIII
1148000	1150000	But the battle system in Eternal Sonata is pretty awesome
1150000	1153000	Because it's like, you know, you're on a live playing field
1153000	1156000	And you run around, like, a la Kingdom Hearts
1156000	1157000	You have, like, five seconds
1157000	1160000	Yeah, but you have five seconds from the second you touch the controller to move
1160000	1161000	And you make all your moves
1161000	1162000	And I thought it was just pretty cool
1162000	1164000	Jamie, you really should check this game out, Eternal Sonata
1164000	1166000	You have to have a Japanese account to download the demo
1166000	1168000	Or you should just come over here and play it or something
1168000	1169000	It's great
1169000	1170000	It's like a Japanese RPG
1170000	1171000	Okay
1171000	1172000	But on the 360
1172000	1173000	So it's really nice looking
1173000	1174000	I thought the graphics were great, too
1174000	1176000	And the weirdest thing about the Japanese demo
1176000	1178000	Is it wasn't the Japanese demo
1178000	1179000	It was the US demo
1179000	1181000	Because it's Eternal Sonata
1181000	1182000	It's Trusty Bell over there
1182000	1183000	And it's all in English
1183000	1184000	I'm not complaining
1184000	1186000	So I don't understand why they put it over there
1186000	1188000	But the other thing I played, of course
1188000	1190000	I totally hopped on your account and grabbed it
1190000	1191000	Good, because that's
1191000	1192000	Yeah, yeah
1192000	1194000	Love that update, Microsoft
1194000	1197000	Really blocked those other accounts out there
1197000	1198000	Well, anyways
1198000	1201000	But I did get to play some more Super Paper Mario
1201000	1202000	I'm almost finished with it now
1202000	1203000	But it's fun
1203000	1205000	Still liking it
1205000	1208000	I also finally picked up Catan
1208000	1210000	The Xbox Live Arcade game
1210000	1211000	Wasn't feeling it
1211000	1215000	I mean, like, I'm very happy these types of games are coming to Xbox Live Arcade
1215000	1218000	But this particular one, I just couldn't get into
1218000	1219000	They need risks
1219000	1221000	Yeah, I want something I'm a little more familiar with
1221000	1223000	Monopoly, Risk, Clue
1223000	1225000	Oh my god, Monopoly with pillars
1225000	1228000	I understand this game is huge among strategy circles
1228000	1231000	And I'm probably getting angry emails from some British listeners right now
1231000	1232000	Where the game is big
1232000	1234000	But, you know, I just
1234000	1238000	I wasn't all into, like, the trade, barter, that kind of thing
1238000	1239000	Although I guess Monopoly is kind of like that, too
1239000	1240000	But I don't know, it's different
1240000	1241000	Trust me
1241000	1242000	I guess maybe I was just disappointed
1242000	1243000	Because somebody told me
1243000	1244000	Oh, you should play Catan
1244000	1246000	It's like Civilization
1246000	1247000	It's nothing like Civilization
1247000	1249000	To be honest, Civilization is incredible
1249000	1250000	What was I going to say?
1250000	1252000	Eternal Sonata actually looks better than Blue Dragon
1252000	1254000	You know, sadly enough
1254000	1255000	And then really quickly
1255000	1256000	Because I know we want to get into some gaming news
1256000	1257000	I won't take up the whole time here
1257000	1260000	But I downloaded some retro classics
1260000	1261000	I downloaded Double Dragon
1261000	1262000	I downloaded Centipede
1262000	1263000	I actually paid for them
1263000	1265000	I don't know why I keep dumping all this money into them
1265000	1266000	I mean, the remakes aren't bad
1266000	1268000	But it's just, you know, I play them once
1268000	1269000	And I hardly ever play them again
1269000	1272000	So I really need to just play the demo and be happy with that
1272000	1275000	But I do like the high def graphics on Double Dragon
1275000	1278000	And it was somebody other than Digital Eclipse porting it
1278000	1279000	So I was excited
1279000	1280000	I laughed at that
1280000	1281000	You didn't like it?
1281000	1283000	It just didn't seem...
1283000	1284000	I mean, it was okay
1284000	1285000	It was kind of cool
1285000	1287000	It just didn't quite seem right
1287000	1289000	Yeah, it is a little weird at first
1289000	1291000	Like, I don't know if you played the Centipede one
1291000	1293000	But they really changed that one
1293000	1295000	They totally made that, like, HD
1295000	1297000	They didn't just, like, I don't know
1297000	1299000	Put the old school graphics in 720p
1299000	1302000	They kind of redid the graphics there
1302000	1303000	It's kind of interesting
1303000	1304000	But I don't know
1304000	1306000	I'm a sucker for classics and all the retro stuff
1306000	1307000	So what can I say
1307000	1310000	And that's why I actually kind of enjoyed Aegiswing
1310000	1311000	I guess, I don't know how to pronounce it
1311000	1312000	Aegiswing I think is what it is
1312000	1313000	Aegis, yeah
1313000	1314000	Aegis
1314000	1315000	It's free
1315000	1317000	The multiplayer stuff is cool
1317000	1318000	It's a good old
1318000	1321000	It's just like a Gradius type shooter
1321000	1323000	It's like a throwback to 8-bit shooters
1323000	1325000	I thought it was gonna be more frantic though
1325000	1328000	Like, more, you know, crazy Japanese shooter
1328000	1330000	Like Ikaruga or something
1330000	1331000	But that's okay
1331000	1332000	I mean, I like, you know, I can't complain
1332000	1333000	It's free
1333000	1335000	I would put it on par with Heavy Weapon, honestly
1335000	1336000	And I paid 10 bucks for that one
1336000	1337000	Yeah
1337000	1338000	I thought Aegiswing was pretty fun
1338000	1339000	Stupid Heavy Weapon
1339000	1340000	I liked Heavy Weapon
1340000	1341000	It wasn't bad
1341000	1342000	It was certainly one of the better
1342000	1344000	Probably the best PopCap game on Xbox right now
1344000	1345000	Is Heavy Weapon
1345000	1346000	Anyway
1346000	1347000	So that's it
1347000	1348000	I'll shut up about my gaming week now
1348000	1351000	Let's talk about some housekeeping
1351000	1353000	No live show next Sunday
1353000	1354000	This is important
1354000	1355000	Sorry live listeners
1355000	1356000	We love you guys
1356000	1358000	But there will be no live show Memorial Day weekend
1358000	1360000	That's Sunday, May 27th
1360000	1363000	Because we will be taping that week's show
1363000	1365000	Live at FanaMe
1365000	1366000	We're gonna be at FanaMe
1366000	1368000	And we'll be there taping our show live
1368000	1370000	On Saturday, the 26th
1370000	1372000	That's May 26th
1372000	1373000	We'll be there
1373000	1375000	I don't know what panel room it is yet though
1375000	1376000	I missed that little detail
1376000	1377000	Zero
1377000	1378000	Or whatever
1378000	1379000	Not on stage zero
1379000	1380000	Not on stage zero
1380000	1381000	We report to stage zero
1381000	1382000	To find out where we're gonna be
1382000	1383000	Yeah
1383000	1384000	So we're gonna be somewhere
1384000	1385000	Look in your programs
1385000	1386000	We're gonna be there two o'clock
1386000	1387000	Probably
1387000	1388000	I wouldn't see why they wouldn't
1388000	1390000	Last year there was like a big room and two small rooms
1390000	1391000	And we were in the big room
1391000	1392000	So I don't know why we wouldn't be in the big room again
1392000	1393000	I hope
1393000	1394000	We'll see
1394000	1397000	If not we'll just have to fill all the butts in the seats in the little room
1397000	1398000	It'll be fun
1398000	1401000	So it'll be 2 p.m. on Saturday at FanaMe in San Jose
1401000	1404000	Hopefully we'll be at the same time as the Masquerade
1404000	1405000	No
1405000	1407000	We got a better time this year I think
1407000	1409000	Because last year we were like the same time as the Masquerade
1409000	1411000	And that really screwed our attendance numbers
1411000	1412000	We had only a handful of people
1412000	1414000	We love those of you that came and showed up anyway
1414000	1415000	Even though we were at the same time as that
1415000	1416000	But this year we're like at two o'clock
1416000	1418000	And I don't think there's a whole lot going on then
1418000	1421000	It's like right during the high traffic point of the day
1421000	1422000	So I'm really excited
1422000	1423000	I think we got a good time
1423000	1424000	I'm excited to talk video games
1424000	1426000	We're gonna do Ask Orange Lounge live
1426000	1428000	We have a lot to cram in an hour
1428000	1430000	So we're gonna do that 2 p.m. on Saturday
1430000	1432000	F-A-N-I-M-E dot com
1432000	1435000	If you want more information if you'll be in the San Jose area
1435000	1437000	So again that means no live show Sunday
1437000	1439000	If you do happen to be here Sunday night
1439000	1442000	You will hear the premiere of that episode
1442000	1444000	We will have that edited and ready to play
1444000	1446000	At our usual 6 p.m. time on Sunday
1446000	1447000	So that'll be your first chance to hear it
1447000	1450000	Just won't have that live interaction element with the chat room
1450000	1452000	Instead it's live in person
1452000	1453000	So that was fun last year
1453000	1454000	I'm looking forward to that this year
1454000	1455000	It'll be amazing
1455000	1457000	Are you cosplaying this year, yes?
1457000	1459000	If I can get my costume sewn this week
1459000	1461000	I wanted to do Balthier so bad
1461000	1463000	But it's just too complicated a costume
1463000	1464000	I can't do it in time
1464000	1465000	Don't buy any sort of 3D
1465000	1466000	Yeah, so
1466000	1467000	I don't know
1467000	1468000	Maybe I'll
1468000	1469000	I think maybe I'll just wear a shirt
1469000	1471000	That says this is my cosplay or something
1471000	1472000	Does that sound like a good idea?
1472000	1473000	You're not going to cosplay either, right?
1473000	1475000	No, I am not cosplaying
1475000	1477000	Alright, so yeah, no show Sunday
1477000	1479000	So we'll be back here live
1479000	1481000	Though I believe the date is June 3rd
1481000	1482000	We'll be here live
1482000	1484000	And that's that
1484000	1487000	So let's go into some gaming news
1487000	1489000	Roll that beautiful bean footage
1489000	1494000	Of course the big, big, big, big, big, big news this weekend
1494000	1496000	Is that Starcraft 2 was officially announced
1496000	1500000	Blizzard officially rolled out the teaser trailer
1500000	1502000	For Starcraft 2 in Seoul, South Korea
1502000	1504000	And of course Korea is a huge
1504000	1507000	I mean just a huge place where
1507000	1509000	Starcraft is still popular
1509000	1511000	It's been 10 years since the original game if you can believe it
1511000	1514000	And of course there was much speculation leading up to this
1514000	1517000	And Starcraft 2 was one of the things people speculated they would announce
1517000	1520000	People thought it was going to be World of Starcraft
1520000	1523000	Diablo 3, a new IP, or this
1523000	1524000	So you know
1524000	1526000	It was never going to be World of Starcraft
1526000	1527000	Oh, why is that?
1527000	1529000	They're not going to compete with themselves
1529000	1531000	Not going to compete with themselves
1531000	1533000	But then again, Starcraft 2 is going to be online
1533000	1534000	We know this, right?
1534000	1535000	Both, so
1535000	1539000	Comprehensive website set up at starcraft2.com
1539000	1542000	You can look at some of the clip art from the game
1542000	1544000	And some of the stages in action
1544000	1546000	You can look at the teaser trailer
1546000	1548000	Which you know, doesn't really show a lot of the game in action
1548000	1551000	But they do have on the site, they have another trailer that you can look at
1551000	1553000	Which does have some of the in-game footage
1553000	1556000	No word yet when the game will be released
1556000	1558000	It is going to be a PC release
1558000	1560000	They are not touching the console releases
1560000	1564000	Their FAQs kind of made it very vague if they would ever go to consoles
1564000	1566000	But just kind of knowing Blizzard's history
1566000	1568000	They probably won't, at least for a long time
1568000	1572000	So Starcraft 2 coming to PC soon-ish
1572000	1574000	Because they haven't said when
1574000	1576000	It could be Christmas, it could be next year
1576000	1578000	Soon is the ultimate answer
1578000	1580000	I would say next summer would be my bet
1580000	1582000	I would say like next April
1582000	1585000	The game looks very complete-ish though
1585000	1587000	And they had demos and stuff going
1587000	1588000	Christmas seems a little soon though
1588000	1590000	Especially when you consider all these games have been getting delayed lately
1590000	1592000	Like Spore and stuff
1592000	1593000	I don't know
1593000	1595000	Well Spore is pretty massive as far as what's involved with that
1595000	1597000	True
1597000	1599000	I don't know
1599000	1601000	Sooner or better
1601000	1603000	Let's see, Nm64 in our chat room says
1603000	1605000	Starcraft 2 will come out when it's done
1605000	1607000	GS68 follows up with Starcraft forever
1607000	1609000	Jvmon says
1609000	1611000	Starcraft 2 gets released
1611000	1614000	Thousands of babies die inside hot cars in South Korea
1614000	1616000	That's sad
1616000	1618000	Chainsaw Juggling says
1618000	1621000	I think Starcraft 2 is being funded by North Korea
1621000	1624000	So they can invade South Korea because everyone will be playing the game
1624000	1627000	I'd like to know what our Korean listeners think about that comment
1627000	1630000	You can address those cards and letters to Chainsaw Juggling
1630000	1632000	On behalf of Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
1632000	1635000	Starcraft 2, you guys excited? I don't know if you guys play these types of games
1635000	1638000	No, absolutely not because I really don't care
1638000	1640000	You don't play RTSs at all?
1640000	1641000	I don't play Starcraft
1641000	1642000	You know what's weird?
1642000	1644000	Starcraft is the one Blizzard game I've never played
1644000	1646000	I played World of Warcraft a lot, but I never
1646000	1648000	I kind of avoided Starcraft
1648000	1650000	I know, I lose total gamer cred in saying that, don't I?
1650000	1653000	But face it, guys, there's only so many hours in the day to play games
1653000	1656000	But I'll check it out, certainly, for nothing else
1656000	1659000	And the fact that my current boyfriend's addicted to Starcraft
1659000	1661000	And I'll probably have to play it for his sake
1661000	1663000	I suppose Dan's probably gonna play it, so
1663000	1665000	Yeah, so we'll probably see it that way
1665000	1667000	It looks just like Command & Conquer, Tiberium Wars
1667000	1669000	I'm like
1669000	1671000	There's not really much you can do with the RTS
1671000	1674000	I mean, great, it'll have the Starcraft characters
1674000	1678000	And races and units and whatnot
1678000	1680000	Yeah, it is the same three races from the original Starcraft
1680000	1682000	Protos, Zerg, and Terrans
1682000	1684000	So, I mean, it'll be cool
1684000	1686000	I mean, it's great, it needs an update
1686000	1688000	It's been a while, so
1688000	1691000	I don't know, really, how much more excited could you have been
1691000	1693000	From Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2?
1693000	1696000	I mean, it's like, eh, it's new stuff
1696000	1698000	Who's kind of the same game?
1698000	1700000	Kind of, yeah, exactly
1700000	1703000	But Warcraft 2 to Warcraft 3 was a huge change
1703000	1705000	That was a huge change
1705000	1707000	I don't know
1707000	1709000	Alright, forget it, forget it
1709000	1711000	Whatever, anyways
1711000	1714000	Now, coming, GameTap is really becoming
1714000	1716000	You know, the central
1716000	1718000	For, like, anything that's
1718000	1720000	You know, episodic
1720000	1722000	Or, you know, a bunch of
1722000	1724000	They're actually using it now to launch a bunch of new games
1724000	1727000	Including a new series from American McGee
1727000	1729000	Which, I don't know if you can be excited about it
1729000	1731000	He had a hit with, you know, Alice
1731000	1734000	Had a flop with Bad Day LA
1734000	1736000	As sad as I'd like to say that
1736000	1739000	But he is going to be coming out with a brand new
1739000	1742000	24-part episodic series
1742000	1744000	That's going to be Grimm
1744000	1746000	And it's based off the Grimm fairy tales
1746000	1747000	That sounds cool
1747000	1749000	In fact, they had some little artwork
1749000	1751000	Showing Pinocchio, so that's kind of neat
1751000	1753000	Is Hansel and Gretel in it?
1753000	1755000	Because I still want to push the witch in the oven
1755000	1758000	I'm sure it will be, but they didn't really specify
1758000	1761000	What series, you know, what stories are going to be in there
1761000	1763000	But, of course, they're all going to be kind of dark
1763000	1765000	And, you know, very Alice-like
1765000	1768000	And it says it's supposed to start in 2008
1768000	1771000	So, that's kind of neat
1771000	1773000	GameTap's becoming pretty awesome
1773000	1776000	I mean, it's already been, like, a pretty good service
1776000	1778000	And I know, God, you must think I'm on their payroll at this point
1778000	1781000	But I do think it's a really great deal
1781000	1783000	They're a good service
1783000	1785000	If something's quality, why not tell everyone, right?
1785000	1786000	Exactly
1786000	1788000	This type of stuff's only enhancing it
1788000	1790000	And I guess people are so resistant
1790000	1792000	Because they feel like they're paying for emulators
1792000	1794000	But, you know, these guys know what they're doing
1794000	1796000	They're really putting their all into it
1796000	1798000	So, a lot of folks probably would have given up by now
1798000	1799000	I like them
1799000	1800000	Well
1800000	1802000	Let's hope the game doesn't suck
1802000	1804000	Well, in some news of other things that don't suck
1804000	1807000	Since we've been on the Blizzard tangent for a little while
1807000	1812000	On the patch 2.1.0 for World of Warcraft
1812000	1815000	We will be getting Black Temple as an instance
1815000	1817000	For anyone who doesn't know
1817000	1820000	It was involved in the Outlands
1820000	1822000	Which was a zone that was added for Burning Crusade
1822000	1826000	So, you're gonna have to have, like, a huge ol' massive, you know, raid party
1826000	1828000	To be able to do it
1828000	1830000	But, there you go
1830000	1834000	There's also tweaking the
1834000	1838000	Some of the newer stuff in the Burning Crusade expansion
1838000	1840000	A new PvP arena
1840000	1843000	And epic flying mounts
1843000	1845000	The Nether Drake
1845000	1848000	Will be available with that patch
1848000	1851000	Except I won't be able to play that because I'm not a high enough level yet
1851000	1853000	But soon, I'm 51
1853000	1857000	Jewids are going to have their own epic flight form
1857000	1858000	Yes
1858000	1860000	It will be epic
1860000	1865000	And it will be like the warlock and paladin mount quests
1865000	1866000	Alright
1866000	1867000	So that's pretty cool
1867000	1870000	By the way, I forgot to say World of Warcraft during my gaming week
1870000	1873000	We're on a very aggressive recruiting campaign for our guild
1873000	1875000	We don't call ourselves OL Army
1875000	1877000	We have a different name just because we want to kind of blend in
1877000	1879000	We don't want to be an obvious radio promo
1879000	1881000	But if you want more information, please go to our forums
1881000	1883000	If you have, like, a dormant character
1883000	1885000	You're thinking about transferring
1885000	1889000	We totally want some non-dickhead people to play with
1889000	1892000	If someone would give me Burning Crusade, I'd play
1892000	1895000	I have not even touched the content for Burning Crusade at level 51
1895000	1897000	I just want to draw an eye
1897000	1898000	But that's the wrong side
1898000	1900000	I want a blood elf too
1900000	1902000	Maybe if you're nice
1902000	1906000	Somebody will bring that to you for, I don't know, solstice or something
1906000	1907000	Okay
1907000	1908000	Alright
1908000	1909000	I'll buy chocolate
1909000	1911000	I was going to say, um
1911000	1915000	I heard that a bunch of people from the old Deathcake guild finally
1915000	1918000	A bunch of people from the old Final Fantasy XI guild finally made the jump
1918000	1919000	Yeah, it's pretty cool
1919000	1922000	I will never, never jump into that
1922000	1923000	You need to
1923000	1924000	That's because of the wife
1924000	1925000	But here's the other thing I want to say
1925000	1931000	We posted a plug for our guild in the official server forums
1931000	1933000	And, like, within five minutes
1933000	1936000	Some twat responded with some negative comment to my post
1936000	1937000	You know, I'm like
1937000	1939000	God, I hate web forums sometimes
1939000	1940000	I hate twats
1940000	1941000	I hate the internet
1941000	1942000	I hate twats
1942000	1944000	Alright, anyway
1944000	1945000	Sorry
1945000	1947000	We can talk about other stuff now
1947000	1948000	Like this
1948000	1950000	Hey, before there was the WoW addiction
1950000	1951000	There was the music game addiction
1951000	1953000	Which a lot of us are still addicted to
1953000	1956000	And one of the granddaddies of the music game genre
1956000	1957000	Parappa the Rappa
1957000	1959000	Created by Masaya Matsura
1959000	1964000	He has talked about the Playstation 3 sluggish sales in Japan
1964000	1967000	And he's saying that's because the thing's a monster
1967000	1968000	It's a huge game
1968000	1970000	Or it's a huge system
1970000	1971000	He says, quote
1971000	1973000	It's not the size of the hardware
1973000	1977000	But of the AC adapter when talking about the Xbox 360
1977000	1979000	Who fuckin' who?
1979000	1980000	Isn't that crazy?
1980000	1981000	Get over it
1981000	1982000	My God
1982000	1983000	The AC adapter's too big
1983000	1984000	I can't develop for that system
1984000	1986000	Well, but here's the thing though
1986000	1988000	He doesn't talk about the Wii at all
1988000	1989000	Because he says, quote
1989000	1990000	The Wii is a, quote
1990000	1992000	Very good piece of hardware
1992000	1996000	And noting that the controls are pretty awesome
1996000	1999000	And he has said that he's going to be developing a game for the system
1999000	2000000	Quote
2000000	2001000	Soon
2001000	2002000	Maybe
2002000	2003000	My God
2003000	2005000	He jumps on the complete bandwagon
2005000	2008000	Like a whole fuckin' year and a half late
2008000	2011000	Oh, the AC adapter's too big
2011000	2012000	Get over it
2012000	2013000	Seriously
2013000	2014000	My God
2014000	2015000	It
2015000	2017000	So what if the brick is huge?
2017000	2018000	It does not matter
2018000	2020000	The Xbox was huge
2020000	2021000	I mean, come on
2021000	2022000	No one complained about that
2022000	2024000	The fact the size of the controllers originally were like
2024000	2025000	I don't know
2025000	2026000	Their own houses
2026000	2028000	It is a little weird
2028000	2030000	That is kind of a weird comment
2030000	2031000	But whatever
2031000	2032000	I mean, that's
2032000	2034000	Anyhow
2034000	2035000	That's how he feels
2035000	2036000	That's how he feels
2036000	2038000	Bitch and moan, people
2038000	2039000	But
2039000	2041000	So
2041000	2042000	Yeah
2042000	2047000	Apparently, BMG's got the rights now to distribute economic music online
2047000	2051000	I know you'll be seeing that popping up in iTunes and Rhapsody
2051000	2054000	And other online distributors
2054000	2056000	But of course
2056000	2059000	You'll be seeing stuff from Castlevania
2059000	2060000	Maybe some DDR
2060000	2063000	Maybe Silent Hill
2063000	2064000	Okay
2064000	2065000	So
2065000	2069000	I don't really have any specific dates on the releases yet, but
2069000	2071000	It's coming
2071000	2073000	That's pretty cool
2073000	2077000	Well, something that's a bit of a relief for a lot of people is that
2077000	2080000	They're saying that Rock Band is going to be affordable
2080000	2087000	Not the $150 to $200 that people were, you know, thinking that it was going to be
2087000	2091000	But there hasn't been anything specifically said about pricing
2091000	2099000	But it was said that they don't see a point in making a game that people are not going to be happy buying
2099000	2100000	So
2100000	2101000	Hopefully
2101000	2105000	I don't know what their idea of reasonable is
2105000	2108000	It'll be expensive
2108000	2112000	I could swing $100 for a game, but $150 maybe not
2112000	2114000	Well, I mean, if it has good peripherals, maybe
2114000	2115000	Let me put it this way
2115000	2117000	Okay, it's EA putting it out
2117000	2121000	EA has, as far as like, you know, pricing goes
2121000	2124000	Their games are a little on the high end
2124000	2126000	Even to retailers
2126000	2128000	But it's going to be expensive
2128000	2132000	They're going to milk any sort of money that they could possibly get out of this
2132000	2134000	Alright
2134000	2138000	Well, that's of course a game we're looking forward to in the far future
2138000	2141000	That game's probably, what, a Christmas release looking at?
2141000	2142000	Probably November-ish?
2142000	2143000	Yeah, probably November
2143000	2144000	Alright
2144000	2147000	Okay, so we're going to be looking at some media releases we have
2147000	2148000	We're going to run down some release dates
2148000	2150000	And we'll start in Japan
2150000	2154000	Because of course a lot of the games that come out in Japan we end up seeing here
2154000	2155000	Starting off on the Xbox
2155000	2157000	Or sometimes it goes the other way around too
2157000	2158000	It takes a while for the games to get over there
2158000	2160000	It just depends what system you're talking about
2160000	2161000	Starting off on the Xbox 360
2161000	2164000	Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out on the 24th of May
2164000	2166000	As well as NBA Street Home Court
2166000	2169000	Those are some popular titles over on this side of the pond as well
2169000	2171000	Coming out on the Wii
2171000	2173000	A giant name here
2173000	2176000	One patchy slap pachinko blah blah blah
2176000	2179000	Sammy's collection Fist of the North Star Wii
2179000	2180000	So I guess it's what?
2180000	2184000	Fist of the North Star pachinko games coming out from Sega on the Wii
2184000	2188000	You would think that they accidentally ran like two names together
2188000	2189000	But no, I'm looking at the box art
2189000	2193000	And it really is Fist of the North Star pachinko games on your Wii
2193000	2194000	Pretty awesome
2194000	2195000	That's crazy
2195000	2198000	If you like pachinko and you like Fist of the North Star
2198000	2199000	Hey, this is the game for you
2199000	2202000	Going on to some other systems on the Playstation 3
2202000	2204000	You're also getting NBA Street Home Court
2204000	2208000	For those of you that import your games that want NBA Jam for whatever reason
2208000	2211000	NBA Jam, sorry, NBA Home Court
2211000	2212000	Big difference there
2212000	2218000	Playstation 2, Killer7 coming out on the Playstation 2 by Capcom in Japan
2218000	2220000	I'm surprised it's not out there already
2220000	2223000	Medal of Honor, well that's on the Playstation 2, not the GameCube
2223000	2224000	Maybe it just took a while
2224000	2229000	Medal of Honor Vanguard, Shadow of Rome and State of Emergency Revenge
2229000	2231000	All coming out on the Playstation 2
2231000	2234000	As well as the King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2
2234000	2236000	But that's just moving into the best collection
2236000	2240000	That was already out there in Japan
2240000	2243000	State of Emergency Revenge
2243000	2244000	That's what it's called
2244000	2249000	Coming out on the DS you have a crossword simulator from Hudson coming out on May 24th
2249000	2253000	As well as Hoshigami is coming out on May 24th
2253000	2257000	Lots of DS games coming out including an Olympic training game it looks like
2257000	2264000	What is this called? Sansu Olympic Inkai-Koan, Tsuji de Kiteru Noriyoku Training
2264000	2267000	What is that? It looks like Olympic Training or something
2267000	2270000	Or maybe some other type of brain training game
2270000	2272000	It's definitely what it looks like there
2272000	2274000	Brain Olympics Training
2274000	2277000	Maybe that's what it is, Brain Olympics or something like that
2277000	2280000	So all those games coming out in Japan
2280000	2284000	I'm looking to see if there's anything on the PSP real quick this week
2284000	2288000	Oh yes a new Bleach game, Bleach Heat the Soul 4
2288000	2290000	Just what we need, more Bleach
2290000	2291000	More Bleach
2291000	2294000	Oh and my favorite title name of the week is actually coming out on the Sony PSP
2294000	2297000	It's Juiced Eliminator
2297000	2298000	That's great
2298000	2301000	That's actually a racing game and I think it might be something they have over here
2301000	2302000	It's already out over here
2302000	2304000	Yeah, Juiced Eliminator
2304000	2305000	I have a t-shirt
2305000	2309000	It makes it sound like your PSP will slice and dice
2309000	2311000	I still want WTF
2311000	2314000	Not Julian, you know, Eliminator
2314000	2318000	Anyways, this week the big game coming out of course
2318000	2320000	Will be Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End
2320000	2323000	Where you get to play as the whole crew
2323000	2328000	Including Jack Sparrow, which is not voiced by Jenny Depp unfortunately
2328000	2333000	You also get, of course, on 360, WarTech Second Orundo
2333000	2336000	It's kind of interesting
2336000	2341000	It's like a shooter game, but it's all boss fights almost
2341000	2343000	It's just one-on-one fights
2343000	2346000	Halo 2 for Vista, so that's kind of neat
2346000	2349000	Odin Sphere, I know a lot of people were waiting for this one
2349000	2352000	That one's finally making its way out here on PlayStation 2
2352000	2355000	Dawn of Mana, that's finally coming out as well
2355000	2357000	Got delayed a week
2357000	2359000	About time
2359000	2363000	Naruto Ninja Council 3, that's going to be coming out on the DS
2363000	2367000	Brooktown, hi, senior year
2367000	2370000	Yay, that's economic game
2370000	2373000	Please God, or whatever force is up there in the great beyond
2373000	2376000	Listening to our crappy little radio program
2376000	2378000	Please, I have one small request for you
2378000	2381000	Please, please, please God, who I pray to every night
2381000	2383000	Who is so great and holy
2383000	2388000	Please do not let Dawn of Mana suck balls like Legend of Mana
2388000	2392000	Please, please, please, blessed be thy name, amen
2392000	2396000	Okay, anyways, also coming out this week on the DS
2396000	2398000	Death Junior and the Science Fair Doom
2398000	2402000	And let's see, Marvel Trading Card Games also coming out on the DS
2402000	2407000	And the New York Times Crosswords on the DS
2407000	2410000	Hooray
2410000	2413000	Well, we got a bunch of other stuff coming out in the UK
2413000	2418000	Odin Sphere comes out on PlayStation 2 the 22nd
2418000	2421000	On the 25th, a whole crap ton of stuff
2421000	2425000	There's Crush for PSP, Custom Robo Arena on DS
2425000	2427000	Halo 2 Vista for PC
2427000	2430000	Mario Strikers Charged Football
2430000	2432000	Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops
2432000	2437000	Hopefully with the warning intact, the rating
2437000	2441000	Monster Madness on PC and Xbox 360
2441000	2443000	Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2
2443000	2446000	SpongeBob and Friends blah blah blah
2446000	2449000	Pirates of the Caribbean on multiple systems
2449000	2452000	And Valhalla Knights on PSP
2452000	2454000	I want to mention something real quick
2454000	2457000	I just happened to catch this on Kotaku
2457000	2459000	It happened to do with pirates
2459000	2463000	But if you happen to be going towards Disneyland anytime soon
2463000	2467000	And you have a copy of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End for the DS
2467000	2470000	There are specially marked spots on the rides
2470000	2475000	Or near the attractions that if you have your DS copy there
2475000	2479000	It will actually download exclusive content for you for the games
2479000	2481000	I need to get the game and take it to Disneyland
2481000	2482000	That's kind of neat
2482000	2484000	That's actually a really neat kind of tie-in
2484000	2486000	I have to give them props for that
2486000	2489000	It's a little crazy, but I like that idea
2489000	2491000	Too bad it wasn't for a game I would play a lot more
2491000	2493000	But that's kind of cool
2493000	2495000	Wow, that's kind of smart, I like that
2495000	2498000	I'm looking at Chatroom here
2498000	2500000	And somebody was responding to my little prayer there
2500000	2503000	Unfortunately they have the generic O.L. Army recruit name
2503000	2505000	But O.L. Army recruit number 9148 says
2505000	2507000	Donamana does suck
2507000	2509000	Uh oh, we're in for trouble there
2509000	2511000	What can we do there?
2511000	2514000	Let's see, some of the folks talking about Halo 2
2514000	2516000	Let's see, some folks are saying here
2516000	2519000	Act Def says Critics on Halo 2 Vista, it stinks
2519000	2521000	Rama says the Critics don't know shit
2521000	2525000	Mind you these are the same Critics that talked shit about XP when it came out
2525000	2526000	So there you have
2526000	2528000	Or it could be The Critic because
2528000	2531000	The Critic also used to say it stinks
2531000	2533000	It stinks
2533000	2535000	Alright, there we go
2535000	2538000	So anyhow, moving on to other news
2538000	2540000	Going to Sony, we're on DS now
2540000	2542000	We're going to go over to Sony
2542000	2545000	Warhawk, what the hell is going on with Warhawk?
2545000	2547000	At the latest press event apparently
2547000	2550000	Warhawk is going to be back on Blu-ray now
2550000	2553000	There is going to be a Blu-ray disc version of Warhawk
2553000	2555000	After all, it's going to have extra materials
2555000	2558000	Developer interviews, behind the scenes footage
2558000	2560000	And a Bluetooth headset
2560000	2564000	But the weird thing is, there still is going to be a PlayStation Network version of the game
2564000	2565000	Yes
2565000	2566000	So that's kind of funky
2566000	2568000	But don't worry though, it's not that
2568000	2570000	It's only going to be like 40 bucks
2570000	2572000	Oh okay, well that's not so bad then
2572000	2573000	Yeah
2573000	2575000	Because the online one will probably be 20 or 30 anyway
2575000	2576000	Because they can kind of charge that
2576000	2577000	Yeah, like 25 bucks or something
2577000	2578000	So you get all this extra stuff
2578000	2581000	Well that's kind of interesting, that's an interesting way to do it
2581000	2584000	There's going to be a public beta of the game starting on May 24th
2584000	2587000	And if you want to sign up, you just have to head on over to the official site
2587000	2589000	warhawk.com
2589000	2592000	Already signed up, so I haven't been contacted though
2592000	2596000	Some good reviews of the game coming out of Sony Gamer's Day though
2596000	2597000	So we'll see
2597000	2600000	It'll be interesting to see what happens there
2600000	2603000	PlayStation 3 could use all these types of games
2603000	2606000	They need some good news very badly right now
2606000	2608000	And this is good
2608000	2610000	Again, I'm not trying to pick on Sony or anything
2610000	2612000	I'm a fan of all three of the gaming companies
2612000	2616000	But let's face it, Sony's kind of doing an uphill battle right now
2616000	2618000	So this is good, I'm glad
2618000	2621000	They need to kick it up a notch
2621000	2622000	Kick it up a notch
2622000	2623000	For their download content
2623000	2626000	I mean seriously, it hasn't really been that much on there
2626000	2629000	RawSteelUT in the chat room is dogging the game
2629000	2631000	Warhawk looks like a generic Battlefield clone
2631000	2634000	$40 for a game with no SP mode, fuck that
2634000	2638000	True, I'm not buying it, but you know, it's interesting
2638000	2644000	Anyways, if you like Warhawk and those online multiplayer only games
2644000	2650000	Guess what? SOCOM Confrontation is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3
2650000	2653000	It's going to be an online only multiplayer game
2653000	2658000	And yeah, it's pretty much more Deathmatch and Captured Flag and all that fun stuff
2658000	2661000	But it's SOCOM and it looks pretty so
2661000	2662000	There you go
2662000	2666000	It will support I believe up to 32 players online
2666000	2670000	And yeah, it's just going to be
2670000	2672000	It's going to be very interesting
2672000	2677000	However, if you're not really into the multiplayer only SOCOM for PlayStation 3
2677000	2681000	There will be a single player game coming out later on
2681000	2683000	That will have online elements as well
2683000	2684000	So
2684000	2686000	I've never really gotten into this series
2686000	2687000	What is this all about?
2687000	2690000	It's just, you know, it's kind of like Ghost Recon
2690000	2692000	But, you know, sewing his own thing
2692000	2697000	It's, you know, Navy Seals military type first person shooter game
2697000	2699000	Before we get to the next story real quick
2699000	2700000	I just kind of want to pose this question
2700000	2702000	Because we kind of talked a little bit before
2702000	2704000	And I want to open this up to the chat as well
2704000	2707000	What kinds of stuff does Sony need right now?
2707000	2709000	Because we obviously have their Gamers' Day event
2709000	2711000	We have more news coming out of their Gamers' Day event
2711000	2715000	What sorts of announcements does Sony need to be making right now?
2715000	2717000	Or are they on the right track?
2717000	2719000	They need more releases
2719000	2722000	More content on their online service
2722000	2725000	If they can't do new games
2725000	2727000	Put out some demos or something
2727000	2730000	Or maybe some more, something that makes it interesting
2730000	2732000	Because right now they don't really have anything to download
2732000	2733000	It's been like one release a month
2733000	2735000	And it's been really slow
2735000	2738000	They need some more exclusives for sure
2738000	2741000	Because right now they're hurting
2741000	2743000	I mean, and I'm talking first party stuff
2743000	2745000	Not necessarily third party exclusives
2745000	2746000	They need more
2746000	2749000	Microsoft's kicking their ass as far as, you know, exclusives go
2749000	2752000	They've got at least one new exclusive every month
2752000	2753000	You know, one or two
2753000	2755000	And it's kind of hurting them
2755000	2758000	Because it's like, well, you know
2758000	2760000	There'll be a game that comes out on the 360
2760000	2762000	And then later on it'll come out on the Playstation 3
2762000	2763000	So you're actually
2763000	2767000	It's almost like that the Playstation 3 is Europe
2767000	2770000	The chat room is lighting up with comments on this one
2770000	2773000	Let me get their comments and I'll get to Dark Soccer's reaction if there is any
2773000	2775000	Looking at the chat room
2775000	2777000	Bandit says simply, a price cut
2777000	2779000	ActDef says more good games
2779000	2781000	Let's see
2781000	2785000	Jirardomo says hitstun Sony needs a game period
2785000	2788000	Because I guess hitstun said something about needing more games there
2788000	2789000	Let's see
2789000	2790000	Blaze says Sony needs a price cut
2790000	2791000	More download content
2791000	2792000	More big name titles
2792000	2796000	And needs to retain exclusives
2796000	2801000	Hitstun says actually Sony needs some Neo Geo CD backwards compatibility
2801000	2802000	Hell yeah
2802000	2803000	Let's see
2803000	2806000	Rossi says simply games
2806000	2807000	Who said
2807000	2808000	Somebody said something about more AAA titles
2808000	2811000	DustCap2 said more AAA titles ASAP
2811000	2815000	Kazurai says we're certainly not interested in gimmicks
2815000	2818000	I think that was GS68 changing their name there
2818000	2820000	So there you go
2820000	2822000	I think they need more triple X titles
2822000	2824000	That would work
2824000	2826000	They just need intelligence in there
2826000	2830000	Price cut seems to be the number one thing we're hearing in the chat room though
2830000	2831000	That's not likely
2831000	2833000	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
2833000	2834000	That's not likely to happen
2834000	2836000	It'll probably happen in the fall but it's not
2836000	2837000	I'd say Christmas
2837000	2839000	I think for Christmas to stay competitive I think you'll see it
2839000	2842000	I think they need more intelligence in their marketing
2842000	2846000	But I think the problem is I think Xbox will counter it with a price cut of their own
2846000	2851000	I'm just worried right now that they're getting hosed as far as exclusives go
2851000	2859000	Because it is Sony's fault because Microsoft actually is developing a lot of games in house for themselves
2859000	2861000	And they're not relying on third party exclusives
2861000	2862000	They've got their own
2862000	2867000	They've got themselves covered each month with a new game coming out from them
2867000	2871000	You know and you can't say that about Sony
2871000	2873000	I mean that's kind of the problem
2873000	2875000	It's like well we've got Halo 3
2875000	2877000	Well we've got Killzone 2 coming out
2877000	2878000	Okay great
2878000	2882000	I mean that's coming out eventually but that's way in the future
2882000	2884000	So I don't know
2884000	2885000	It's just kind of sad
2885000	2888000	I mean again you know I'm not trying to beat Sony when they're down or whatever
2888000	2890000	And I'm sure we've had enough of this on the program
2890000	2892000	Because I love Playstation 2
2892000	2894000	Such a great solid console
2894000	2896000	I'm still playing today
2896000	2897000	PS2 is awesome
2897000	2901000	You know I've been treating my Playstation 3 like my PSP
2901000	2904000	At one time I had quite a few games for it
2904000	2907000	I stopped playing them so I sold them back
2907000	2909000	And now I'm only playing like one game on it
2909000	2912000	Actually now on the Playstation 3 I'm not playing anything on it
2912000	2913000	I'm playing other systems
2913000	2916000	You know Motorstorm I got a little bored with it
2916000	2919000	And you know nothing new
2919000	2922000	I'm still playing lots and lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance
2922000	2925000	Yeah but you're about ready to throw the six axis out the window right?
2925000	2927000	I know I'm ready to explode it into tiny bits
2927000	2930000	When I buy it I'm buying it on Xbox 360
2930000	2931000	Wow
2931000	2933000	Well you know I believe this week actually
2933000	2934000	I've got more controllers
2934000	2936000	I was going to say I think it was either this week or last week
2936000	2939000	That Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition came out for the 360
2939000	2944000	That's the other reasons I don't have to worry about spending the points downloading the characters I won
2944000	2949000	Because you know first thing I'm going to do is we can play through every level I can with Hawkeye
2949000	2951000	Our Sony fanboys can take comfort in this
2951000	2952000	I don't know how you guys feel
2952000	2955000	I'm the only one of the three of us that doesn't own a Playstation 3 yet
2955000	2956000	You're not missing it
2956000	2963000	I will go out and buy a Playstation 3 if Final Fantasy 13 stays exclusive to Sony
2963000	2966000	Because I'm that much a whore for the Final Fantasy series I will have to have it
2966000	2969000	And you know home looks cool and little big planet
2969000	2971000	You know those are all like extra yeas for me
2971000	2977000	With the things they want to do with Final Fantasy 13 I don't think there's processing wise a way it can be done on the other systems
2977000	2979000	And have it come out the way they want it to
2979000	2981000	So I'll be changing my tune single handedly by that game
2981000	2984000	I mean hell Final Fantasy 7 is the reason I bought a Playstation 1
2984000	2985000	Yep
2985000	2989000	So that ended up being an okay buy so hey why not
2989000	2991000	I need a new Jet Moto game
2991000	2992000	New Jet Moto
2992000	2994000	Less Sony bashing more stories
2994000	2996000	Let's throw a little bit of love Sony's way
2996000	3001000	Even so I'm not highly excited about this because I played the demo at E3 last year
3001000	3008000	But Heavenly Sword is they're stating that they may have multiplayer as downloadable content
3008000	3011000	Which is sort of interesting I guess
3011000	3021000	Still I mean they're saying that when they do it they want to make it you know full on multiplayer not just an afterthought
3021000	3026000	There's also rumors of you know a co-op and deathmatch but yeah
3026000	3032000	But the game right now though is from what I understand still on schedule for the September release
3032000	3033000	It looks awesome
3033000	3037000	Okay good good news there that's some very good news Heavenly Sword looks good
3037000	3039000	Yeah exactly they need to catch up with that September
3039000	3042000	It was like playing the singing level in Kingdom Hearts 2
3042000	3047000	Remember that was one small glimpse of the game it was like a year ago a lot could have changed
3047000	3049000	I hope I really hope
3049000	3053000	You know what's actually kind of exciting and this is kind of funny
3053000	3056000	Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction that game coming out
3056000	3061000	It's developed by the same people that did Resistance and they're actually using an improved version of the Resistance engine
3061000	3066000	It looks awesome so far it's very cinematic in the way that it plays and stuff
3066000	3070000	You know and I don't even I'm not really into that kind of you know Ratchet and Clank
3070000	3074000	But you know I'm almost kind of thinking to picking it up just because it looks awesome
3074000	3080000	Alright well sorry I promise that we wouldn't have much more negative Sony stuff
3080000	3089000	But I just can't not talk about this one and this would have to do with a recent PlayStation 3 promotion
3089000	3095000	And what happened is that there was an ad for
3095000	3100000	Okay basically it's on this Spanish website for Kia
3100000	3105000	Okay it was promoting the Kia car and I guess they're doing this promotion right now with the PlayStation
3105000	3111000	Because they're running this you know like I don't know maybe you enter to win a PlayStation 3 if you test drive one of their cars
3111000	3118000	But here's the thing in the ad they show the PlayStation 3 and then they show a screenshot on the TV
3118000	3125000	Of Project Gotham Racing 3 which isn't good because that's a Microsoft game
3125000	3132000	And is especially not good because this mistake has happened before on a different website
3132000	3134000	So wishful thinking maybe
3134000	3140000	Somebody needs to let the marketing department know that Project Gotham is not a PlayStation title
3140000	3141000	It gets even worse
3141000	3142000	Oh lord
3142000	3149000	Remember there's a Dutch magazine called Media Market that actually did a article on the PlayStation 3
3149000	3153000	And there's Project Gotham printed in their magazine
3153000	3161000	Damn somebody at Sony marketing needs to get fired right at Sony International Marketing
3161000	3167000	Well I think it's a lot of people because it's Kia but somebody I don't know where they're fucking up
3167000	3172000	It's just a bad mistake to make repeatedly like do it once and it's funny haha people forget
3172000	3179000	But do it now three times and people start to go what the hell seriously why can't people understand that Project Gotham is a Microsoft title
3179000	3184000	To be honest I'm going to get some hate mail for this one it's not even my favorite Microsoft racing title by far
3184000	3186000	You know there's just different types of titles
3186000	3188000	Do You For Speed Carbon was good
3188000	3189000	Really?
3189000	3190000	Yeah
3190000	3192000	I didn't play it very much I like Burnout that's my favorite I think is Burnout
3192000	3194000	Because I like to blow things up
3194000	3195000	There's a lot of need for speed
3195000	3196000	Burnout Paradise
3196000	3198000	Oh I fucking can't wait for new Burnout yay
3198000	3200000	I do like Burnout for exploding
3200000	3204000	Exactly Burnout has fire therefore it wins
3204000	3207000	I wish I could say the same for Full Auto although it wasn't bad sorry
3207000	3211000	So here's something else that's kind of funny a little story
3211000	3219000	Apparently there's some guy that uh some gamer that was kind of saying farewell to his Playstation 2
3219000	3222000	Because he has a brand new Playstation 3
3222000	3227000	I don't know why he decided to do this but he figured the best send off was to piss on it
3227000	3234000	And I guess he got drunk and you know pissed on his Playstation 2 and being the dumbass that he is left it plugged in
3234000	3236000	And basically knocked himself out after pissing on
3236000	3240000	Didn't mommy ever tell you don't piss on the electric fence
3240000	3244000	What was that episode of Beavis and Butthead where they were playing don't piss on the electric fence
3244000	3246000	No it was Ren and Stimpy
3246000	3248000	They were playing don't piss on the electric fence
3248000	3250000	Yeah there's a little song that goes with it I know
3250000	3251000	I remember the song
3251000	3255000	Dark Soccer you've had many consoles come and go throughout your house right?
3255000	3256000	Mostly just consoles come
3256000	3265000	Have you ever done this send off for a console have you ever you know pulled down your trousers and peed on a console to send it off
3265000	3267000	No because I'm not stupid
3267000	3272000	Especially if you're in your house why would you piss on it in your own house you stupid moron
3272000	3274000	God I'm gonna piss on it
3274000	3280000	You know usually when they break we gut them and try to do something neat with the husks
3280000	3286000	Seriously haven't you been paying attention to the internet the thing to do with consoles is to slam them with a sledgehammer
3286000	3288000	Put it on YouTube
3288000	3296000	And the best way to do that is to play the music from what was that scene in Office Space and recreate it out in the field
3296000	3298000	Oh with the copier yeah that was a good time
3298000	3309000	So anyway whenever we hear stories about dumbasses like this one it can make us feel anything else but anger and you know what that means boys and girls
3309000	3327000	N.M. 64 says Rob Roberts remember it's harder for females not really I mean you know she could take a dookie on it if she wanted to
3327000	3330000	Anyway dark soccer your F.U. of the week please
3330000	3342000	It goes to you I was going to say F.U. to the Pollen and Dixon for making me all stuffed up and getting all over my car
3342000	3347000	But no F.U. to Rob because you've never had to go out in the wild
3347000	3351000	You don't know that I went camping once
3351000	3357000	But you've never had well okay you've never been a woman going to the bathroom in the wild
3357000	3361000	Just squat behind a tree what's wrong with that
3361000	3364000	It's a lot it's not as easy as it sounds
3364000	3368000	You make it sound like some assembly is required
3368000	3372000	That's why I love living in the modern world where we have things called toilets
3372000	3376000	And not living in Japan where the public toilets are spot toilets
3376000	3386000	Rob you remember though it's not always a good idea to go behind Neil Bush and stuff especially if you're a woman because the drag queen fairy may come and turn you into a man
3386000	3389000	And then they'll make a movie out of that that's horrible
3389000	3391000	What movie was that again
3391000	3396000	I can't remember it was like penis envy that's what it was
3396000	3403000	Actually there's another thing it was a movie with Adam Sandler who's coming out
3403000	3406000	Oh is that the gay marriage one
3406000	3411000	The trailer already pisses me the hell off so fuck them
3411000	3420000	I'm willing to give the movie a chance to see what the message is in the end but yeah the trailer does make it look like I can't even describe it
3420000	3421000	It's very trivializing
3421000	3422000	Yeah it does
3422000	3424000	Draw Them Together did it first
3424000	3426000	Draw Them Together did it funny
3426000	3430000	I'll give the movie a chance but the trailer does not look promising anyway Logie
3430000	3440000	Screw all the software makers on the 360 for making it so fucking hard to do a system link game with your goddamn games
3440000	3445000	Stop having the patch shit so it's incompatible with unpatched shit
3445000	3452000	And then F.U. did my work for not actually having an internet connection in the one room there where we have the game consoles so I can just update them right there
3452000	3454000	So I have to take them home
3457000	3459000	Okay is it my turn to give an F.U.?
3459000	3461000	Well my first F.U. is to Draw Them
3461000	3462000	I don't like Draw Them
3462000	3464000	Nobody likes Draw Them and Draw Them is no fun
3464000	3471000	And then I have a second F.U. and this one's pretty serious so I have to kill the music here for a minute
3471000	3483000	I had to give an F.U. to myself because something really bad happened and it's kind of hard for me to admit this openly
3483000	3495000	But it's just a very difficult thing for me I have to give an F.U. to myself because I kind of like a Fergie song
3495000	3506000	I know I failed the internets completely I failed our listeners but I just like this new Fergie song this big girls don't cry
3506000	3516000	This is a song that's beautiful
3516000	3530000	So I like Fergie and for that I deserve to be mocked and made fun of openly by others and I hate myself
3530000	3532000	I'm pointing at you
3532000	3538000	Alright that's it more news
3538000	3542000	No I'd say we take an ice cream break
3542000	3547000	An ice cream break no we only have a few more stories six more stories we can do it
3547000	3557000	Fine fine fine well speaking of F.Us Sony is committed to the PS3 for ten years and beyond
3557000	3569000	Basically the S.C.E.A. president Jack Trenton is quoted saying we didn't get into PS3 for the first six months of 2007
3569000	3576000	We're into this for the next ten years and beyond a million units one way or another at this point isn't going to worry us
3576000	3581000	So this is what they're saying well our sales suck but we hope to make it up in ten years
3581000	3583000	Good luck
3583000	3587000	We're dedicated to this console to infinity and beyond
3587000	3592000	Has any console well I guess you know what it makes sense we kind of look at this and go oh ha ha ha
3592000	3601000	You know but come to think of it you know consoles live on even after the next generation I mean technically we are still in the PlayStation 2's life span right
3601000	3603000	They're still putting that crap for it
3603000	3613000	Exactly I mean and good crap we had God of War 2 we have this what the role playing game folks looking forward to Final Fantasy 12 is not that old all things considered you know it's console still got a lot of life left in it
3613000	3620000	So you know I could see how the console they can say it might be lasting that long before they you know put a bullet in it I don't know
3620000	3633000	Anyway sorry I was reading some chat room while Jamie was reading that story there and Mystic Gohan reminded me that big girls don't cry so I need to just suck it up here on the show
3633000	3658000	Also big girls and big boys alike love the Chronicles of Riddick or at least you know feel okay about it I don't know sorry bad segue but hey you know what even if you didn't like the movie the game wasn't bad there was a huge game that came out on the Xbox the Chronicles of Riddick game and guess what there is a next gen version coming out
3658000	3672000	The UK trade publication MCV has confirmed that Star Breeze is working on a new version of the game for next gen systems the game is called Assault on Dark Athena X and it's going to have a single player mode which is a little bit longer than last time
3672000	3681000	An all new multiplayer mode and a developers commentary mode so what does that mean you get running commentary while you're playing the game kind of like a DVD track
3681000	3695000	And man this part was such a bitch to program I swear code here and code this didn't quite work together so we had to do this to make them work and blah blah blah blah blah and the rest of us are going um yeah I don't speak your language
3695000	3710000	It's like Final Fantasy 7 and it's like yeah and then the scene where Eris dies oh crap that hasn't happened yet oh shit um forget I said anything about that that oh dammit
3710000	3722000	Good job Loki maybe hey maybe in that remake that they keep saying they're gonna do for you know the internet loves to rumor that one for the Playstation 3 maybe it can have developer commentary in it
3722000	3726000	And maybe my skin will turn blue
3726000	3729000	Maybe it will Jamie maybe it will
3729000	3742000	So Sony plans on bringing the pain to the Playstation 3 and actually the Playstation Network it's a game called Pain and it involves you launching a poor hapless victim into stuff
3742000	3745000	I'm gonna buy it
3745000	3753000	Wait is this the one where I saw a screenshot where it was just a guy on a like a slingshot and they were gonna fling him into a building or something
3753000	3765000	Pretty much and it has monkeys getting injured so injured monkeys people getting hurt sounds like a game I'm gonna buy so yeah that's gonna be coming out later on
3765000	3768000	It's like jackass but actually funny
3768000	3777000	Sort of um yeah I don't know it's just using the physics engine so you just you know launch your character into stuff to get him hurt as badly as possible
3777000	3784000	And they have different games like including like a horse mode or spank the monkey and mime toss
3784000	3786000	Hey I like that part
3786000	3796000	Dr. Burst in chat asks what's with the Sony bashing tonight dude this looks great pain looks great and we said the mystic sword looks cool
3796000	3800000	Heavenly sword and rat things
3800000	3806000	You're right I'm exposed I hate Sony haha got me
3806000	3827000	Well you know though speaking of games that I'm not buying Vivendi is putting time shift on PS3 so it will be up there with the PC and PC 360 I'm sorry Xbox 360 oh my did that slip out
3827000	3840000	Oh I was just gonna say I have a laugh sometimes with like gaming press out there they always make stories for themselves like this whole time shift is coming to PlayStation 3 it's always been scheduled to come out on PlayStation 3
3840000	3848000	You know even when when Atari had the rights for it but then it went away for a while
3848000	3850000	Thank you for reading the whole rest of the story for me
3850000	3854000	Oh sorry
3854000	3858000	You ass
3858000	3860000	I'm not on top of things
3860000	3862000	That's it
3862000	3864000	I only read my story
3864000	3872000	This is what you're gonna do Jamie you know what story he does next because you can see it so read ahead and when he starts reading it cut him off and finish it okay Jamie
3872000	3874000	You know I'm just gonna leave
3874000	3878000	No you're not you get about two minutes to prep because I have a story here first
3878000	3880000	No I don't care
3880000	3882000	It's about the PlayStation 3
3882000	3884000	Okay I'm gonna sit here and read my comics for the rest of the show
3884000	3886000	Alright
3886000	3904000	Here we go now this is something the chat room said earlier is that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut and you know gamers have said this and you know you've written the magazines you've read it on your online game blogs and now it's publishers saying that the PlayStation 3 needs a price cut
3904000	3920000	Specifically Ubisoft and Yves Guillemont who is the president and CEO of Ubisoft has said that Sony will quote for sure have a lower market share than before because of the PlayStation 3's cost
3920000	3924000	And he said quote they have to decrease the price quite significantly
3924000	3926000	Very interesting
3926000	3931000	However Ubisoft is continuing to support the PlayStation 3 they're bringing an exclusive title to Europe
3931000	3943000	Don't know what that means it's an exclusive PlayStation 3 Europe title so those of you guys in Europe that always feel like you're getting pooped on and neglected Ubisoft is hearing your pain and is bringing you something exclusive
3943000	3947000	Of course we have absolutely zero idea what that is yet
3947000	3949000	Far Cry Cricket
3949000	3952000	Who knows Far Cry Cricket
3952000	3954000	It's Cricket in the Jungle
3954000	3956000	We'll see
3956000	3975000	Anyways so Sega is licensing the Unreal 3 engine yes the same engine that's been in practically everything lately but you know hey it's yet another game thoughts are though that it's going to be used in the upcoming I guess they're enhancing or remaking the Alien franchise
3975000	3977000	Like Alien Syndrome and that stuff?
3977000	3979000	No like Aliens as in
3979000	3983000	Oh the movies oh I didn't know Sega owned the rights to that
3983000	3985000	Now you know
3985000	3987000	Okay
3987000	3990000	Wait no that must be a different thing I'm thinking of
3990000	3995000	But they haven't made an Alien movie since the Winona Ryder one which was years ago
3995000	3999000	Well they made a crappy Aliens vs Predator movie and then they're making a sequel
3999000	4001000	Aliens vs Predator was fun
4001000	4002000	They're making a sequel
4002000	4004000	Speaking of guilty pleasure movies there we go
4004000	4007000	When Aliens make out with a black chick yeah
4007000	4010000	Or no I'm sorry that was a predator
4010000	4012000	I swear to god
4012000	4019000	Well at the end of the movie to spoil it for you the predator looks at the one chick and it looks like they're going to make out and then they don't
4019000	4021000	Oh so they don't actually kiss
4021000	4022000	They don't actually kiss
4022000	4023000	So you lied to me
4023000	4024000	It looks like they are
4024000	4026000	Thanks for spoiling the movie OMG spoilers
4026000	4028000	It's ridiculous it's a ridiculous movie
4028000	4033000	I would have liked to see like maybe Aliens vs Jason or something like that
4033000	4038000	Aliens vs Predator was like the big fan thing
4038000	4040000	Freddy vs the Predator
4040000	4045000	TigerClawnChat says the best Aliens was the arcade version from Konami
4045000	4047000	It was that's what I was thinking of
4047000	4054000	But Ross Steel UT says hey Tiger, Aliens vs Predator arcade by Capcom equals sex and act deaf degrees over in Capcom
4054000	4058000	No I was thinking of the Capcom one because it's all about playing through the game with Lynn Karasawa
4058000	4061000	With her freaking sword of death
4061000	4062000	Awesome game
4062000	4064000	Anything else about the unreal engine?
4064000	4067000	Sorry we cut you off but you deserved it
4067000	4074000	No it's going to be probably a first person shooter since people really like to think outside the box
4074000	4076000	Sonic 3D again
4076000	4084000	Did you happen to catch that video that was like the Sonic concept that they were going to do that was supposed to be based off the cartoon series?
4084000	4088000	Yes I actually did see that some YouTube-age I don't remember where I saw it posted
4088000	4092000	Where like Sonic moved a little more 3D but it was still like a platformer
4092000	4096000	That looked so fake to me that looked so incredibly fake
4096000	4101000	Because I cannot believe that they would make a game like that where Sonic moved like molasses
4101000	4103000	Because if you watch that video it was slow
4103000	4106000	I know which system they'd put it out on too, the CDI
4106000	4109000	It looked horrible
4109000	4112000	I don't know where did you see that YouTube posted?
4112000	4113000	Kotaku
4113000	4114000	Was it?
4114000	4120000	It looked fake I'm sorry it screamed of fakeness to me like they took some unknown game and sprited Sonic into it
4120000	4123000	I don't know I don't want to believe it because it looked horrible
4123000	4125000	Maybe that was the beginning of the end of Sega who knows
4125000	4129000	Let's see
4129000	4134000	I'm looking at what's in chat going on there
4134000	4140000	ActDeft wants to see a video game, Aliens vs Predator vs Marvel vs Capcom vs SNK
4140000	4143000	Well that would be the ultimate wouldn't it?
4143000	4145000	Alright and let's see
4145000	4148000	GS68 is kicking Sonic while they're down here
4148000	4152000	I tried the Sonic 360 demo and the controls nearly made me have a stroke
4152000	4156000	Heart attack, stomach acid overflow, HIV and loose stools all at once
4156000	4162000	You know what they need to have now that Sega is doing third party titles now?
4162000	4165000	Nintendo vs Sega
4165000	4167000	The fighting game to end all fighting
4167000	4169000	Dude Smash Brothers hello Sonic
4169000	4173000	No I'm talking about a bigger roster we're talking like hundreds of characters
4173000	4177000	We never did get the Namco Capcom game out here
4177000	4180000	Oh that's true the Namco Cross Capcom or whatever it was?
4180000	4184000	It was a big RPG I know someone who has it
4184000	4189000	I played the Playstation 2 Japanese one and I'm kind of glad that we didn't because it was kind of lame
4189000	4191000	It sounded so cool in theory
4191000	4195000	Bandit reminds us they do have Sonic vs Mario in the upcoming Olympics game
4195000	4197000	We talked about it a few shows ago
4197000	4199000	You know what I want?
4199000	4202000	I want another
4202000	4205000	Crap I just lost the game
4205000	4208000	I want another Strider
4208000	4215000	What was that ridiculous Sega fighting game that they had where you can actually play as a Daytona car and punch things?
4215000	4220000	That was in Fighter's Megamix which I have
4220000	4223000	That's the kind of ridiculous gameplay I want
4223000	4228000	I want you to be able to play as Rob the Robot or as one of the unicycles from Uniracers
4228000	4230000	This is something really ridiculous
4230000	4233000	Instead of Captain Falcon I want to play as the car
4233000	4235000	Exactly
4235000	4237000	I'll just turn around and use Nitro Boost
4237000	4242000	I want to play as a little spinny fire thing from Dungeons and Super Mario Brothers
4242000	4244000	I want to play as a Bob-omb
4244000	4248000	Where your final attack is explode
4248000	4250000	That's awesome
4250000	4252000	I guess it's break time boys and girls
4252000	4254000	We're going to take a quick break here
4254000	4256000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in part B
4256000	4258000	Lots of news coming up in part B tonight
4258000	4260000	We haven't even touched the Xbox 360 or the Wii
4260000	4262000	This has kind of been the Sony segment
4262000	4265000	We have lots of 360 and Wii news coming up in part B of Orange Lounge Radio
4265000	4267000	We'll be back right after this
