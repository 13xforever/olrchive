13908	24740	Tonight, May 20th, 2007, Blizzard officially announces StarCraft II, Halo 3 gets an official release date, and Project Gotham 3 is mistaken for a Sony game once again.
32287	36448	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36468	41789	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41829	46450	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46770	47270	Hi.
47530	48431	How are you doing, Ms.
48491	48831	Summers?
49611	50251	Worn out.
50291	52171	All this vacationing is really getting to me.
52551	54332	Oh, gee, you poor, poor thing.
54692	55112	I know.
55432	56532	I don't have to go to work tomorrow.
56912	57993	Oh, my gosh.
58053	59453	The agony, the agony.
59758	61280	and I didn't go Thursday or Friday.
63362	64903	Do you actually work at all right now?
64923	71149	I was supposed to go to a wedding and we decided not to go so I went and did nerdy stuff yesterday and slept a lot.
71430	75354	So you just used the time off that you already took off anyway to just say, ah, screw it.
75394	77436	To sleep in every morning until noon.
78076	80699	You know, I had something like that happen once is that I had time off
81107	82649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
94693	97354	and that was the same week that Final Fantasy XI came out.
97474	97974	Oh God.
98354	99275	I remember that.
99495	102195	I sat at home and played Final Fantasy XI for like four days straight.
102215	103416	The early days of your addiction.
103556	105557	Oh, it was horrendous.
105637	106677	Just looking back on that, oh my God.
106697	108137	I did that when Final Fantasy VI came out.
108357	109778	Three over here came out.
110318	113999	When I was in high school and I stayed home with the flu.
116440	118961	I had a fever and it needed more Final Fantasy.
119395	121417	I think I may have done it for San Andreas
149725	150165	Oh, okay.
150246	150526	Maybe.
150966	152347	Alright, you gonna do it for Grand Theft Auto 4?
153368	156330	No, because we'll be playing it at work, so it's not a big deal.
156590	176203	You know, a lot of people were pissed off because there were a lot of people that took the day off for the Halo 3 beta, and we're gonna talk more Halo 3 probably in Part B tonight, but you know, the Halo 3 beta came out and a lot of people called in sick to work that day because they were gonna sit at home and play the Halo 3 beta, and then the damn thing didn't show up for like 13 hours, and people were pissed, you know, because they'd taken the time off work, but
177446	183708	I know it's hard to get upset when it's like, you know, kind of free and they never promised it on a certain day to begin with, really.
183748	186808	You know, it's kind of one of those tricky situations.
186868	188449	I don't know, but I thought that was interesting.
189849	190349	So anyway.
191750	194790	All right, so we're going to get into some gaming news tonight.
194810	198111	But first, we're going to start it off with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
198191	203232	No special guests tonight, but we do have the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
203692	204593	Harvey's here, Rob.
204833	205273	Looking at what?
205493	205813	Harvey.
206240	206761	Who's Harvey?
207302	208223	Did you see the movie?
208584	208864	No.
208885	210207	The Invisible Rabbit?
210648	210848	No.
211168	211910	We have an Invisible Rabbit?
211930	213593	It was a Jimmy Stewart movie.
213613	213893	Oh, what?
213913	213953	No.
214254	215095	The Wonder Hamster?
215616	215876	No.
217877	220418	You need to watch some classic movies every so often, Ron.
220478	221239	Once in a while, I do.
221259	222280	Broaden your horizons.
222300	222600	I do.
222700	226743	I've seen, like, Casablanca and Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies ever.
226823	230366	I'm going to find the DVD of Harvey and buy it for you, and you're going to watch it.
230386	230666	And Hitchcock.
230686	232347	I love old Hitchcock movies, like Psycho.
232367	235389	Casablanca is so, like, you know, the simple life.
235449	238571	It's just like, oh my god, there's this war going on.
238692	241193	Why is it the inconvenience me?
241213	244836	Wow, my headache just came back.
245376	245917	Good job.
246654	248696	I just swallowed like five Excedrin.
249076	249536	Gaming week.
249556	250217	Gaming week.
250237	250277	No.
270660	272762	Actdeft says, I hope OLR cheers me up.
272862	274563	Well, not with Jamie's current attitude.
274783	275043	Hi!
275063	276384	Be happy, dammit!
276484	278226	She won't be cheering anybody up there.
278446	280347	Be of good cheer or I'll kick your ass.
281248	283630	Let's see, PK, I'm sorry, I always say his name wrong.
284050	288793	Peker Uno, I think is how I'm supposed to say it, says, we need to have an OL Army We Suck It Halo game.
288853	289334	Yes, we do.
291495	293937	GS68 said, Rob floods go faster at night.
294057	295919	I guess in response to the chat going, Rob, Rob, Rob.
295939	298160	You know, Sauce was at Disneyland Friday.
298180	298781	Lucky.
298821	299121	Lucky.
300209	303250	No, and she said they closed down Pirates for the premiere, and then they opened it back up.
304491	305791	Oh, the Pirates premiere was going on.
306031	306491	That's cool.
306551	307412	Fun.
307432	309733	We're not a Disneyland podcast, so tell us about your gaming week.
311053	316635	Well, I played something like seven hours of... No, not seven, because I took a break.
317375	322137	I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance because I had to start over because there were fingerprints on the rental.
322997	325798	We get free rentals from Hollywood Video, so I just played a whole bunch.
326599	326699	And...
328170	328910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
351960	352360	Podunk
379259	381962	It's like going to the country.
382142	383544	It's the suburb of a suburb.
383964	391852	You have this old town, and then you drive five minutes and you have farm.
391932	396377	Davis is a suburb of Sacramento, where the school is, where the first season of Sorority Life was.
396977	397958	Most people know UC Davis.
398259	399920	Well, Dixon is a suburb of Davis.
400481	401222	Okay, so that's...
402162	403262	to put it in perspective.
403302	407544	Like, it's not even as popular as... I apologize if we have any listeners in Dixon.
407884	410725	I do love Mary's Pizza Shack, which is in Dixon, but that's about it.
411345	415446	I went to this sweet stuff place, I think it was called, and it was really yummy, and I had banana ice cream.
415646	416167	Anyway, sorry.
416207	416727	Pinnagogo.
416867	417227	Pinball.
417787	418347	Okay, yeah.
418467	420628	I'm actually pulling up the list of the games I played at Pinnagogo.
422365	426590	and this isn't all of them because I did play a bunch of really old, old, old machines.
427070	428432	Like the ones from before.
428832	432216	Like, these are so old that they had the flippy numbers, you know?
433818	438944	Where instead of, you know, you have your LED screen, you had the flippy numbers.
439084	440326	Wow, like the counters...
440825	443947	and there was only one of those that was worth mentioning which is called Skylab.
444508	456697	And the cool thing about Skylab is that you have this middle section that's got a line in between them and you have five pinballs in there and you have to knock five onto one side of it and then you get like some special thing only I couldn't do it.
457918	466264	So I played Black Rose which is a pirate theme with this huge, you know, big old pirate wench on the thing and it has cannons in it and you have to like shoot down a pirate ship.
466404	467405	Cool, pirate wenches.
468226	469367	And Centaur which was a
470144	471129	A cool older table.
471169	472435	It was before they had the big...
473840	479064	You know, LED, the big display, digital displays and everything, and it was just the numbers and all that.
479464	484388	And I played the new Pirates of the Caribbean machine, which was actually okay, but it wasn't quite as awesome as I thought it would be.
485028	487810	And I kicked Dan's ass at Theater of Magic twice.
488271	489251	I love Theater of Magic.
489271	490172	That's a cute guy's table.
490192	491993	Theater of Magic is the most sexy pinball table.
492434	494435	I was about ready to offer the dude $4,000 on it.
494495	498838	I was like, hello, my retirement money, give me Theater of Magic.
499038	501220	But no, I had to use it on school.
501815	504416	But he did win, though, on the third game.
504636	506757	But that's okay, because I also kicked his ass at Addams Family.
507398	511059	God, I wonder where I could find $4,000 to buy a theater or magic table.
511099	511740	It's so tempting.
512680	513620	It's a fucking great game.
513681	516282	Apparently it's one of Dan's buddies that owns the machine.
517302	521204	I played Demolition Man, and I thought it would be a great machine because I love ramps.
522004	522224	No.
522965	523985	Suck-tastic.
524746	525466	Much like the movie.
526431	527552	Actually, I like the movie.
527832	531854	Demolition Man is one of my guilty pleasures.
532054	533095	Kind of like me in Showgirls?
533435	533715	Yeah.
533775	534575	Okay, yeah, gotcha.
535216	538477	Just because I love the whole scene when they're in the car singing to old Oscar Mayer commercials.
538497	540218	You know who really brought down that movie?
540498	540699	Who?
540859	541499	Sandra Bullock.
541619	541779	Why?
541819	542700	She ruins everything.
542740	543780	It's like poison.
543880	545421	Everything she touches is poison.
545461	546842	But Speed was good, the first one.
546862	548383	It had Dennis Leary in it, though.
548923	551544	Dennis Leary is the reason to watch Demolition Man.
552425	554946	Sorry to interrupt your report, but I have to ask Loki, do you have any guilty pleasure movies?
555558	560142	Guilty Pleasure Movies, I guess, um, Wild Zero, maybe.
560723	561664	Dude, I love that movie, too.
562364	563606	But, uh, there's that one.
563826	564727	I have a new one, though.
565127	565688	Possibly.
565828	566869	Well, I have to watch it, though.
567309	568410	Yo-Yo Girl Cop.
570172	571833	Oh, wait, is that the Tsukibondeca?
572074	573435	No, that was not a cop.
573535	580782	It's the one about this Asian chick who fights crime, and she's like a cop by day, crime fighter by night, which is kind of the same thing, but...
581149	583711	Anyways, she fights crime with this metal yo-yo.
583931	586033	Well, yeah, the yo-yo started off as a weapon.
587274	589255	So, uh, it's interesting.
589616	590476	Okay, well, there's more games.
591157	594039	I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is the worst machine ever.
594720	603106	It's like it has action figures all over it, and the only cool thing about it is this rotating pizza spinner in the middle that will, like, shoot the ball in different directions.
603607	607870	I played Medieval Madness, but the guy who owned it put extra steep ramps in it.
608751	609872	But I did break down the castle.
609912	610332	That was cool.
610819	611279	Pinbot!
611299	616743	Pinball is what I played before DDR, which is how I met all you guys.
616783	618505	So this is like going back to our roots.
618525	619365	There's a few more worth mentioning.
619405	619966	I played Hyperball.
639088	640549	Hyperball is the worst pinball ever.
640609	642509	Well, not really worst, it's the weirdest.
642990	648992	Because you have this big open field and little holes around the perimeter of the thing.
649312	652633	And you have to shoot the balls into the holes and they're like by the alphabet and it's really stupid.
653694	656115	I played High Speed, which is one of the older ones.
656615	657195	That was really fun.
657577	658397	and Cyclone.
658637	662338	High Speed was the other NES game that fucking no one played.
662598	666660	They had Pinbot and then Pinbot was so successful they made High Speed but nobody played High Speed.
666680	667960	But High Speed's a fucking awesome table.
667980	669260	It is an awesome, that's why they made it a game.
669480	685785	But Cyclone has, um, now, I wanted, Cyclone, it was one of the ones I used to play in Mobile at a Godfather's Pizza and, um, the, the marquee of it has a clown on it and this, um, rollercoaster and then the first row is Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan and,
686437	690278	But on the one in Mobile, someone duct-taped over the clown because clowns are scary.
691099	695880	And drew a beard with a big mustache and a cowboy hat on Ronald Reagan.
696521	697981	So that's always my memory of it.
698281	699862	It's a cool table, just I hate clowns.
702443	704683	There should be a pinball game where you just hit clowns in the face.
705003	705484	That'd be fun.
705544	707684	The biggest disappointment for me, well, there's Funhaus.
707904	709705	Funhaus is one where you can hit... That's right!
710005	711066	I hate Funhaus, though.
711106	714927	We almost bought one and I told Dan no because the freaking head scared the crap out of me.
716073	721438	But the disappointment, though, is I wanted to see a World Cup soccer and apparently they sold it on Friday and I went on Saturday.
722458	724300	Big Bang Bar, no one had any prototypes there.
724680	728063	And Big Bang Bar is like, I've gotten to play a Big Bang Bar.
728323	731086	That's the one where there's only like 20 of them in existence, right?
731106	731086	16.
731126	734008	And when Capcom closed down their pinball division.
734389	741474	However, the rights to Big Bang Bar have now been made available, I think, to Stern, I think, is going to be released.
741635	744377	Don't quote me on that yet, but I think Stern's going to be releasing them.
745500	753004	Time Machine is the other one I wanted to see, Jackbot, Black Knight 2000, and Doctor Who, of course, were the big ones that I wanted to see.
755845	759046	Other than that, I've been playing stupid Flash games, thanks to Loki.
759967	760287	Sorry.
760787	761327	That's okay.
761447	762488	They're kind of addicting.
762888	764389	I'm going to be doing that all day tomorrow now.
765469	767670	Yeah, I was playing Flash games, too.
767970	768711	So what were you playing?
770111	773813	I played, actually, I played Crackdown.
774318	775579	A little bit of co-op crackdown.
775739	776259	That was fun.
777981	779742	I did try the Halo 3 beta once.
780483	781523	It was okay.
781703	785846	To be honest, it's exactly like the last Halo game.
786887	789849	Gameplay-wise, they haven't really changed much, which is fine.
790190	791230	It was good to begin with.
792311	793952	But I still really suck at Halo.
793972	794212	I had...
796678	799879	The only thing I kind of regret is the loading screens.
800059	802660	In some games they usually show you what the button configuration is.
802981	805702	I went in there and I'm like, how do I do stuff?
806942	810203	I had to kind of figure that out and I still didn't really get the hang of it.
810323	813205	Instead they have the message that says, Halo 3 Beta, love Bungie.
813225	814325	I thought that was funny.
816286	817266	So that was okay.
818127	824029	I went back to playing Earth Defense Force 2017 again and I got the fucking super awesome stationary guns.
824673	826534	I don't care, I've seen better shit that's been free, okay?
826554	828575	Warning Forever, that's free.
853922	855083	And that looked a lot better.
855503	857004	And there wasn't even any background on that.
857525	863229	So, they should, simple, you know, they should have done all vectors would have been cool.
864029	873956	Anyways, so, then beyond that stuff, I played a little bit of, well, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
874357	875417	Still playing that.
875858	880601	We'll still be playing that until, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.
881142	882242	Tried a little bit of Saints Row.
882523	883003	That was fun.
883410	909633	for some reason though, like, I really, I don't know anyone who's actually tried landing 360 systems, they are as finicky as shit, they will not land with each other if like something's different or whatever, like Saints Row, we were trying to land it, one of the systems doesn't have the update for it yet, the multiplayer update that fixes the lag, one system does, it won't see each other, so that kind of sucked, Cracked Dome, we tried landing it again,
910071	922338	and it won't see each other despite the fact that it's the exact same setup and it worked the other day so I don't know what the fuck's wrong with these things but all I know is Microsoft did not make it fucking easy to land this shit so fuck them that's it
923382	928146	Halo 2 is a pretty rock solid game that people still play online over and over and over again until their thumbs fall off.
928166	929326	So if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
948928	949428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
973084	981367	that if I don't play ranked mode, if I just stay away from ranked mode and play like the open mode, generally you get people of a lower skill rank, which is good.
981407	982547	It's better for me to play on.
982927	984828	So I played a couple games, and it was a good time.
984948	986809	Like the training stuff?
986969	987109	Yeah.
987609	993251	A random OLR listener came in, too, and I'm sorry, dude, I forgot your name, but somebody that was an OLR listener came onto my friends list.
993511	995232	We played a Halo 3 match together.
995252	995852	We had a good time.
995892	999653	I actually got more kills than him, so I was all, and he's like, what do you mean you suck at Halo?
999693	1001074	So I was all excited, but it was just luck.
1001634	1002454	Sometimes it's just luck.
1002904	1003724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1028089	1029410	Halo's just always kind of stood out.
1029490	1034455	I hope it has a great single player, though, too, for those that don't necessarily like to go online and play random people.
1034495	1036977	But I can't wait to have the college buddies and I playing the game.
1037037	1037558	It's going to be fun.
1039520	1040801	Let's see, other games I've been playing this week.
1040821	1050650	I've actually went back to my PlayStation 2 and picked up a game that I played a lot of when it first came out, but then I just kind of stopped and neglected it when the Wii came out, and that would be Final Fantasy XII.
1051494	1064886	and what motivated me to play this game again is you might remember last week I had a bit of an emo week and Miklatov was here and he talked about how he bought me the Balthier doll who is like the reason to play Final Fantasy XII because not only is he sexy but he's just like the most interesting character in the game, right?
1064926	1065526	He's awesome.
1065927	1076496	So yeah, I decided to go back to Final Fantasy XII because I want to play it through to completion but I'm kind of one of those people that's like if I forget what happened in the story and it's been like a good five months since I've touched the game
1076943	1078264	I have to go back and start from the beginning.
1078524	1079826	So I started back from the beginning.
1080286	1082548	God, the battle system in that game is great!
1082648	1085691	I mean, it's like playing an online game, but not online.
1085751	1088714	Like, where you get total control over all the other people.
1088754	1089394	It's great!
1089514	1091616	I forgot there's a few other things I did play.
1091796	1094999	I played Eternal Sonata, which they have the demo for.
1095039	1096521	That demo is amazing!
1096821	1097381	I loved it.
1097421	1098022	Did you like it?
1098482	1099423	Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
1099443	1100164	It's awesome!
1100264	1100784	Oh my god!
1101105	1101645	The Xbox 360...
1103058	1103759	and so on.
1124313	1126735	I don't know how Final Fantasy XIII is going to be.
1126755	1131038	It looks a little weird, but this is the way I would see them doing it.
1131399	1132700	Stick to what you know.
1132720	1139845	Final Fantasy X was okay, and XII was okay, but just that same type of thing.
1139885	1143048	You don't need to go all full 3D where you can adjust the camera and stuff.
1143248	1143708	Yeah, I know.
1143728	1147852	XII's cool, though, but I'm excited to see what they do for XIII.
1147872	1150574	But the battle system in Eternal Sonata is pretty awesome because...
1151047	1155893	It's like, you know, you're on a live playing field and you run around like a la Kingdom Hearts.
1155913	1157054	Yeah, like five seconds.
1157134	1160839	Yeah, but you have five seconds from the second you touch the controller to move to make all your moves.
1161320	1162421	I thought it was just pretty cool.
1162501	1164583	Jamie, you really should check this game out, Eternal Sonata.
1164864	1168268	You have to have a Japanese account to download the demo or you should just come over here and play it or something.
1168328	1168708	It's great.
1168789	1169049	It's like a...
1169400	1171222	Japanese RPG, but on the 360.
1171482	1173544	So it's really nice looking.
1173764	1175045	I thought the graphics were great, too.
1175065	1183693	The weirdest thing about the Japanese demo is it wasn't the Japanese demo, it was the US demo, because it's Eternal Sonata, it's Trusty Bell over there, and it's all in English.
1183753	1184654	I'm not complaining.
1184714	1190479	So I don't understand why they put it over there, but the other thing I played, of course... I totally hopped on your account and grabbed it.
1191119	1191680	Good, because that's...
1192280	1192921	Yeah, yeah.
1193341	1194822	Love that update, Microsoft.
1194922	1197104	Really blocked those other accounts out there.
1197484	1197984	Well, anyways.
1199165	1201447	But I did get to play some more Super Paper Mario.
1201467	1203728	I'm almost finished with it now, but it's fun.
1203988	1205249	Still liking it.
1206130	1210193	I also finally picked up Catan, the Xbox Live Arcade game.
1210693	1211394	Wasn't feeling it.
1211554	1216157	I mean, like, I'm very happy these types of games are coming to Xbox Live Arcade, but
1216496	1217417	Catan, Civilization
1246713	1248113	Nothing like Civilization.
1248133	1249034	Civilization is incredible.
1249194	1249814	What was I going to say?
1249854	1252054	Eternal Sonata actually looks better than Blue Dragon.
1253474	1253995	Sadly enough.
1254695	1256595	And then really quickly, because I know we want to get into some gaming news.
1256635	1260076	I don't want to take up the whole time here, but I downloaded some retro classics.
1260196	1261296	I downloaded Double Dragon.
1261356	1262276	I downloaded Centipede.
1262316	1263156	I actually paid for them.
1263196	1265097	I don't know why I keep dumping all this money into them.
1265377	1269438	I mean, the remakes aren't bad, but it's just, you know, I play them once and I hardly ever play them again.
1269518	1270318	So I really need to just
1271138	1272740	Play the demo and be happy with that.
1272820	1275142	But I do like the high def graphics on Double Dragon.
1275442	1278185	And it was somebody other than Digital Eclipse porting it.
1278485	1279126	So I was excited.
1279226	1280807	I laughed at that.
1280867	1281528	You didn't like it?
1282329	1284411	It just didn't seem... I mean, it was okay.
1284451	1285131	It was kind of cool.
1285552	1287173	It just didn't quite seem right.
1287894	1289455	Yeah, it is a little weird at first.
1290036	1293419	I don't know if you played the Centipede one, but they really changed that one.
1293960	1295581	They totally made that like HD.
1295621	1296362	They didn't just like...
1297361	1303157	I don't know, put the old school graphics in 720p they kind of redid the graphics there it's kind of interesting
1303993	1304733	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1333038	1336300	I would put it on par with Heavy Weapon, honestly, and I paid $10 for that one.
1336760	1337980	I thought it was pretty fun.
1338000	1338781	Stupid Heavy Weapon.
1339021	1339861	I liked Heavy Weapon.
1339881	1340402	It wasn't bad.
1340462	1344724	It was certainly one of the better, probably the best PopCap game on Xbox right now is Heavy Weapon.
1345464	1346665	Anyway, so that's it.
1346825	1348085	I'll shut up about my gaming week now.
1348726	1350186	Let's talk about some housekeeping.
1351447	1353228	No live show next Sunday.
1353268	1354028	This is important.
1354088	1355049	Sorry, live listeners.
1355109	1355809	We love you guys.
1356129	1358410	But there will be no live show Memorial Day weekend.
1358430	1359271	That's Sunday, May 27th.
1360256	1360416	Zero.
1376758	1377238	or whatever.
1377558	1379419	No, that's stage zero.
1379439	1381700	We report to stage zero to find out where we're going to be.
1382001	1383461	Yeah, so we're going to be somewhere.
1383501	1384382	Look in your programs.
1384702	1385722	I know we're there at 2 o'clock.
1386283	1387223	I wouldn't see why they wouldn't.
1387523	1390164	Last year there was like a big room and two small rooms and we were in the big room.
1390204	1391745	So I don't know why we wouldn't be in the big room again.
1392065	1392385	I hope.
1392746	1393106	We'll see.
1394206	1396808	If not, we'll just have to fill all the butts in the seats in the little room.
1396828	1397288	It'll be fun.
1397348	1398148	So it'll be 2 p.m.
1398488	1401270	on Saturday at Faname in San Jose at the San Jose Convention Center.
1401290	1403751	Hopefully it won't be at the same time as the Masquerade.
1404602	1410288	No, we got a better time this year, I think, because last year we were like the same time as the Masquerade, and that really screwed our attendance numbers.
1410328	1411469	We had only a handful of people.
1411789	1414912	We love those of you that came and showed up anyway, even though we were at the same time as that.
1415112	1418456	But this year we're like at 2 o'clock, and I don't think there's a whole lot going on then.
1418496	1421038	It's like right during the high traffic point of the day.
1421078	1421819	So I'm really excited.
1421839	1422660	I think we got a good time.
1422680	1424501	I'm excited to talk video games.
1424521	1426023	We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live.
1426323	1429086	We have a lot to cram in an hour, so we're going to do that.
1429717	1430378	2pm on Saturday.
1430578	1434780	F-A-N-I-M-E dot com if you want more information if you'll be in the San Jose area.
1435121	1436782	So again, that means no live show Sunday.
1437142	1441785	If you do happen to be here Sunday night, you will hear the premiere of that episode.
1441845	1445527	We will have that edited and ready to play at our usual 6pm time on Sunday.
1445547	1446828	So that'll be your first chance to hear it.
1447168	1449650	Just won't have that live interaction element with the chat room.
1449930	1451431	Instead, it's live in person.
1451491	1452592	So that was fun last year.
1452612	1453713	I'm looking forward to that this year.
1453733	1454473	It'll be amazing.
1454953	1456234	Are you cosplaying this year, yes?
1457035	1458936	If I can get my costume sewn this week.
1459249	1462571	I wanted to do Balthier so bad, but it's just too complicated a costume.
1462811	1463591	I can't do it in time.
1463631	1464612	It's any sort of 3D.
1464832	1466253	Yeah, so, I don't know.
1466373	1470215	I think maybe I'll just wear a shirt that says this is my cosplay or something.
1470515	1470895	Right, Loki?
1470915	1471696	Does that sound like a good idea?
1471716	1472736	You're not going to cosplay either, right?
1473296	1474817	No, I am not cosplaying.
1475918	1481221	All right, so yeah, no show Sunday, so we'll be back here live, though I believe the date is June 3rd.
1481581	1482501	We'll be here live.
1484229	1484689	That's that.
1485029	1487590	So, let's go into some gaming news.
1487850	1489130	Roll that beautiful bean footage.
1491331	1496672	Of course, the big, big, big, big, big, big news this weekend is that StarCraft II was officially announced.
1497252	1502654	Blizzard officially rolled out the teaser trailer for StarCraft II in Seoul, South Korea.
1502674	1508995	And, of course, Korea is a huge place where StarCraft is still popular.
1509035	1511416	It's been 10 years since the original game, if you can believe it.
1511755	1512335	StarCraft II StarCraft II
1535697	1561513	comprehensive website set up at StarCraft2.com you can look at some of the clip art from the game and some of the stages in action you can look at the teaser trailer which you know doesn't really show a lot of the game in action but they do have on the site they have another trailer that you can look at which does have some of the in-game footage no word yet when the game will be released it is going to be a PC release they are not touching the console releases their FAQs kind of
1561977	1591365	made it very vague if they would ever go to consoles but just kind of knowing Blizzard's history they probably won't at least for a long time so StarCraft 2 coming to PC soon-ish because they haven't said when it could be Christmas it could be next year soon is the ultimate answer I would say next summer would be my bet I would say like next April the game looks very complete-ish though and they had you know demos and stuff going I don't know Christmas seems a little soon though especially when you consider all these games have been getting delayed lately like Spore and stuff
1592561	1595864	Well, Spore is pretty massive as far as what's involved with that.
1596404	1600448	I don't know.
1600688	1601089	Let's see.
1601349	1604712	NM64 in our chatroom says StarCraft 2 will come out when it's done.
1605453	1607494	GS68 follows up with StarCraft forever.
1608115	1610317	JVmon says StarCraft 2 gets released.
1610677	1613540	Thousands of babies die inside hot cars in South Korea.
1615161	1615682	That's sad.
1617105	1623950	ChainsawJuggling says, I think StarCraft 2 is being funded by North Korea so they can invade South Korea because everyone will be playing the game.
1624650	1626872	I'd like to know what our Korean listeners think about that comment.
1627232	1632075	You can address those cards and letters to ChainsawJuggling on behalf of Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1632315	1633456	StarCraft 2, you guys excited?
1633476	1634917	I don't know if you guys play these types of games.
1635557	1637639	No, absolutely not because I really don't care.
1637919	1639020	You don't play RTSs at all?
1640160	1640941	I don't play StarCraft.
1641411	1641972	You know what's weird?
1642032	1643953	StarCraft is the one Blizzard game I've never played.
1643993	1647636	I played World of Warcraft a lot, but I kind of avoided StarCraft.
1647677	1650359	I know, I lose total gamer cred in saying that, don't I?
1650419	1653201	But face it, guys, there's only so many hours in the day to play games.
1654122	1660288	But I'll check it out, certainly, for nothing else than the fact that my current boyfriend's addicted to StarCraft, and I'll probably have to play it for his sake.
1660448	1663510	I suppose Dan's probably going to play it, so... Oh, yeah, so we'll probably see it that way.
1663530	1667314	I was just like, eh, it looks just like Command & Conquer Tiberium Wars.
1667354	1667594	I'm like,
1668891	1678277	There's not really much you can do with the RTS, I mean, great, it'll have, you know, the StarCraft characters and, you know, races and, you know, units and whatnot.
1678317	1682200	Yeah, it is the same three races from the original StarCraft, Protoss, Zerg, and Terrans.
1682460	1693327	So, I mean, it'll be cool, I mean, it's great, it needs an update, you know, it's been a while, so, I don't know, I mean, really, I mean, how much more excited could you have been from, you know, Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2, I mean...
1694022	1695803	It's like, eh, it's new stuff.
1695923	1698225	It was kind of the same game.
1698285	1700007	Kind of, yeah, exactly.
1700947	1703469	But Warcraft 2 to Warcraft 3 was a huge change.
1703529	1704490	That was a huge change.
1706291	1706752	I don't know.
1707012	1707432	Forget it.
1707773	1708153	Forget it.
1708373	1708773	Whatever.
1708933	1709174	Anyways.
1710455	1717280	Now, GameTap is really becoming the center for anything that's...
1718479	1728383	You know, episodic or, you know, a bunch of... They're actually using it now to launch a bunch of new games, including a new series from American McGee, which I don't know if you can be excited about it.
1728403	1735906	I mean, he had a hit with, you know, Alice, had a flop with Bad Day LA, as sad as I'd like to say that.
1737007	1745371	But he is going to be coming out with a brand new 24-part episodic series that's going to be Grimm, and it's based off the Grimm fairy tales.
1745391	1746251	That sounds cool.
1746547	1747688	GameTap's becoming pretty awesome.
1773672	1781155	I mean, it's already been a pretty good service, and I know, God, you must think I'm on their payroll at this point, but I do think it's a really great deal.
1781815	1782536	They're a good service.
1782676	1784636	If something's quality, why not tell everyone, right?
1784657	1785057	Exactly.
1785537	1787658	And this type of stuff's only enhancing it.
1788178	1793740	And I guess people are so resistant because they feel like they're paying for emulators, but these guys know what they're doing.
1794460	1797302	They're really putting their all into it, so a lot of folks probably would have given up by now.
1797942	1798262	I like them.
1799743	1800583	Let's hope the game doesn't suck.
1801601	1815288	Well, in some years of other things that don't suck, since we've been on the Blizzard tangent for a little while, on the patch 2.1.0 for World of Warcraft, we will be getting Black Temple as an instance.
1815568	1829595	For anyone who doesn't know, it was involved in the Outlands, which was a zone that was added for Burning Crusade, so you're going to have to have a huge old massive raid party to be able to do it, but there you go.
1830128	1842871	There's also tweaking some of the newer stuff in the Burning Crusade expansion, a new PvP arena, and epic flying mounts.
1844251	1847471	The Nether Drake will be available with that patch.
1848432	1850732	Except I won't be able to play that because I'm not a high enough level yet.
1850812	1851232	But soon.
1851712	1852132	I'm 51.
1852933	1856553	Druids are going to have their own epic flight form.
1856693	1856933	Yes.
1858874	1859574	It will be epic.
1861485	1865207	And it will be like the Warlock and Paladin mount quests.
1865947	1866248	Alright.
1867468	1869750	By the way, I forgot to say World of Warcraft during my gaming week.
1869790	1873111	We're on a very aggressive recruiting campaign for our guild.
1873452	1874912	We don't call ourselves OL Army.
1874952	1877334	We have a different name just because we want to kind of blend in.
1877374	1879055	We don't want to be an obvious radio promo.
1879295	1881396	But if you want more information, please go to our forums.
1881476	1888640	If you have like a dormant character you're thinking about transferring, we totally want some non-dickhead people to play with.
1889306	1891307	If someone would give me Burning Crusade, I'd play.
1892587	1895189	I have not even touched the content for Burning Crusade at level 51.
1895229	1896149	I just want a Draenei.
1896909	1898010	But that's the wrong side.
1898030	1898350	Or a Horde guild.
1898370	1899110	I want a Blood Elf too.
1899130	1899831	Then get a Blood Elf.
1900631	1905393	Maybe if you're nice, somebody will bring that to you for, I don't know, Solstice or something.
1906393	1906794	Okay.
1907014	1907294	Alright.
1907734	1908674	I'll buy chocolate.
1909335	1917899	I was going to say, I heard that a bunch of people from the old Death Cake guild finally... A bunch of people from the old Final Fantasy XI guild finally made the jump.
1917939	1918919	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
1919486	1922347	I will never, never jump into that.
1922367	1923167	You need to.
1923187	1923887	That's because of the wife.
1924187	1925147	But here's the other thing I want to say.
1925388	1936390	We posted a plug for our guild in the official server forums, and within five minutes, some twat responded with some negative comment to my post.
1936990	1939491	I'm like, God, I hate web forums sometimes.
1939511	1939991	I hate twats.
1940071	1940811	I hate the internet.
1940831	1941472	I hate twats.
1943332	1943772	All right, anyway.
1944252	1944472	Sorry.
1945393	1947013	We can talk about other stuff now.
1947967	1966795	Like this, hey, before there was the WoW addiction, there was the music game addiction, which a lot of us are still addicted to, and one of the granddaddies of the music game genre, Parappa the Rapper, created by Masaya Matsuda, he has talked about the PlayStation 3 sluggish sales in Japan, and he's saying that's because the thing's a monster.
1967176	1969277	It's a huge game, or it's a huge system.
1970237	1975659	He says, quote, it's not the size of the hardware, but of the AC adapter, when talking about the Xbox 360.
1977671	1979372	Who fucking who?
1979713	1980613	Get over it.
1980673	1981374	My God.
1981694	1982254	Oh, my God.
1982274	1983295	The ACW is too big.
1983455	1984696	I can't develop for that system.
1984736	1985977	Well, but here's the thing, though.
1986317	1992181	He doesn't talk about the Wii at all because he says, quote, the Wii is a, quote, very good piece of hardware.
1992722	1995764	And noting that the controls are pretty awesome.
1996184	2001148	And he has said that he's going to be developing a game for the system, quote, soon, maybe.
2001969	2007571	My god, he jumps on the complaint bandwagon like a whole fucking year and a half late.
2008712	2011433	Oh, the AC adapter's too big.
2011613	2013113	Get over it, seriously.
2013833	2017295	My god, so what if the brick is huge?
2017335	2018155	It does not matter.
2018695	2020056	The Xbox was huge.
2020096	2021776	I mean, come on, no one complained about that.
2022157	2026018	The fact that the size of the controllers originally were like, I don't know, their own houses.
2027645	2028586	It is a little weird.
2029106	2031028	That is kind of a weird comment, but whatever.
2031048	2034670	I mean, that's... Anywho.
2034690	2035491	That's how he feels.
2035611	2036372	That's how he feels.
2036992	2037893	Bitchin' moon, people.
2039474	2041656	So, yeah.
2041916	2046619	Apparently, BMG's got the rights now to distribute Konami music online.
2047140	2053244	I know you'll be seeing that popping up in iTunes and Rhapsody and other online distributors.
2053785	2054805	But, of course...
2056071	2060933	You'll be seeing stuff from Castlevania, maybe some DDR, maybe Silent Hill.
2064634	2069576	They don't really have any specific dates on their releases yet, but it's coming.
2071417	2072037	That's pretty cool.
2073558	2079300	Something that's a bit of a relief for a lot of people is that they're saying that Rock Band is going to be affordable.
2079740	2080360	Not the $150-$200 that people were
2083765	2110312	thinking that it was going to be but there hasn't been anything specifically said about pricing but it was said that they don't see a point in making a game that people are not going to be happy buying so hopefully I don't know what their idea of reasonable is it'll be expensive I could swing $100 for a game but $150 maybe not
2112376	2114217	Well, I mean, it has good peripherals, maybe.
2114238	2115078	Let me put it this way.
2115358	2116619	It's EA putting it out.
2116759	2125166	EA has, as far as pricing goes, their games are a little on the high end, even to retailers.
2125326	2127727	But it's going to be expensive.
2127747	2131230	They're going to milk any sort of money they could possibly get out of this.
2132351	2132651	All right.
2133967	2138109	Well, that's, of course, a game we're looking forward to in the far future.
2138329	2140450	That game's probably, what, a Christmas release looking at?
2140510	2141250	Probably November-ish?
2141271	2141911	Yeah, probably November.
2142011	2142251	All right.
2142651	2144992	Well, some more immediate releases we have.
2145012	2151735	We're going to run down some release dates, and we'll start in Japan because, of course, a lot of the games that come out in Japan we end up seeing here.
2152476	2155017	Starting off on the Xbox, or sometimes it goes the other way around, too.
2155057	2156457	It takes a while for the games to get over there.
2156477	2157718	It just depends what system you're talking about.
2158414	2164457	Starting off on the Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out on the 24th of May as well as NBA Street Home Court.
2165017	2167438	Those are some popular titles over on this side of the pond as well.
2168258	2171199	Coming out on the Wii, a giant name here.
2171239	2178162	Let's see, it's Jason Pachislapachinko blah blah blah Sammy's Collection Fist of the North Star Wii.
2179571	2184252	So I guess it's what, Fist of the North Star Pachinko games coming out from Sega on the Wii.
2184752	2192395	You would think that they accidentally ran like two names together, but no, I'm looking at the box art and it really is Fist of the North Star Pachinko games on your Wii.
2193795	2194335	Pretty awesome.
2194855	2195615	That's crazy.
2195776	2198996	If you like Pachinko and you like Fist of the North Star, hey, this is the game for you.
2199797	2208239	Going on to some other systems on the PlayStation 3, you're also getting NBA Street Home Court for those of you that import your games that want NBA Jam for whatever reason.
2209080	2210801	NBA Jam, sorry, NBA Home Court.
2211341	2212102	Big difference there.
2213062	2218385	PlayStation 2, Killer7 coming out on the PlayStation 2 by Capcom in Japan.
2218405	2220887	I'm surprised it's not out there already.
2220967	2224569	Medal of Honor, well, that's on the PlayStation 2, not the GameCube, so maybe it just took a while.
2224869	2233714	Medal of Honor Vanguard, Shadow of Rome, and State of Emergency Revenge all coming out on the PlayStation 2, as well as the King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2.
2234554	2236135	But that's just moving into the best collection.
2236155	2236835	That was already...
2238268	2244451	State of Emergency Revenge Sanzu Olympic Inkaikoan Suji di Kiteru Noriyuku Training Olympic Training
2268032	2268592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2297674	2299015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2329063	2333004	You also get, of course, on 360, Wartek, Second Orlando.
2335384	2336364	It's kind of interesting.
2336584	2340905	It's like a shooter game, but it's all boss fights almost.
2341025	2343286	It's just one-on-one fighting.
2343366	2345686	Halo 2 for Vista, so that's kind of neat.
2346406	2348847	Odin Sphere, I know a lot of people were waiting for this one.
2349507	2351787	That one's finally making its way out here on PlayStation 2.
2352807	2355328	Donna Mana, that's finally coming out as well.
2355788	2356368	Got delayed a week.
2357417	2358338	About time.
2358878	2362259	Yeah, Naruto Ninja Council 3, that's going to be coming out in the DS.
2363820	2366661	Brooktown, hi, senior year.
2368382	2370063	Yay, that's an economic game.
2370223	2378587	Please, God, or whatever force is up there in the great beyond listening to our crappy little radio program, please, I have one small request for you.
2378687	2383149	Please, please, please, God, who I pray to every night, who is so great and holy.
2383169	2383529	Thank you, Donald.
2383971	2388574	Please do not let Dawn of Mana suck balls like Legend of Mana.
2388654	2390015	Please, please, please.
2390475	2391596	Blessed be thy name.
2391696	2392056	Amen.
2392616	2393077	Okay.
2393437	2396699	Anyways, also coming out this week on the DS, Death Jr.
2396719	2397780	and the Science Fair Doom.
2398920	2402082	And let's see, Marvel Trading Card Games also coming out on the DS.
2402983	2406925	And the New York Times crosswords on the DS.
2408066	2408886	Hooray.
2410447	2412669	Well, we got a bunch of other stuff coming out in the UK.
2412689	2412909	Okay.
2414000	2417943	Odin's Fair comes out on PlayStation 2 the 22nd.
2418864	2420605	On the 25th, a whole crap ton of stuff.
2421186	2442942	There's Crush for PSP, Custom Robo Arena on DS, Halo 2 Vista for PC, Mario Strikers Charged Football, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, hopefully with the warning intact, the rating, Monster Madness on PC and Xbox 360, Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2,
2443740	2459141	Spongebob and Friends blah blah blah Pirates of the Caribbean on multiple systems and Valhalla Nights on PSP I want to mention something real quick I just happened to catch this on Kotaku it happened to do with Pirates
2459668	2478239	But if you happen to be going towards Disneyland anytime soon and you have a copy of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End for the DS, there are specially marked spots on the rides or near the attractions that if you have your DS copy there, it will actually download exclusive content for you for the games.
2479199	2480760	I need to get the game and take it to Disneyland now.
2480780	2481841	That's kind of neat.
2482261	2484242	That's actually a really neat kind of tie-in.
2484282	2485803	I have to give them props for that.
2486324	2488325	It's a little crazy, but I like that idea.
2488345	2488745	Mm-hmm.
2489198	2490679	ActDeft, Critics on Halo 2 Vista, It Stinks,
2519096	2520777	Ranma says, the critics don't know shit.
2521057	2524018	Mind you, these are the same critics that talked shit about XP when it came out.
2524818	2526059	So there you have it.
2526079	2530820	Or it could be the critic, because the critic also used to say, it stinks.
2530840	2531461	It stinks.
2534342	2535082	All right, there we go.
2536294	2536354	Yes.
2564838	2565721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2570635	2571916	Oh, okay, well that's not so bad then.
2572036	2572256	Yeah.
2572416	2575779	Because the online one will probably be $20 or $30 anyway, because they can kind of charge that.
2575879	2576840	Yeah, like $25 or something.
2577020	2578201	So you get all this extra stuff.
2578221	2579402	Well, that's kind of interesting.
2579442	2580543	That's an interesting way to do it.
2581424	2589090	There's going to be a public beta of the game starting on May 24th, and if you want to sign up, you just have to head on over to the official site, warhawk.com.
2589210	2591912	Already signed up, so I haven't been contacted, though.
2592112	2596896	Some good reviews of the game coming out of Sony Gamers Day, though, so we'll see.
2597928	2599789	It'll be interesting to see what happens there.
2600049	2602991	PlayStation 3 could use all these types of games.
2603792	2607474	They need some good news very badly right now, and this is good.
2608254	2609975	Again, I'm not trying to pick on Sony or anything.
2610015	2616379	I'm a fan of all three of the gaming companies, but let's face it, Sony's kind of doing an uphill battle right now.
2617359	2617960	So this is good.
2618040	2618440	I'm glad.
2618540	2620281	They need to kick it up a notch.
2620681	2621302	Kick it up a notch.
2622247	2623729	for their download content.
2623769	2626311	I mean, seriously, there hasn't really been that much on there.
2626591	2628874	RawSteelUT in the chatroom is dogging the game.
2628914	2631797	Warhawk looks like a generic Battlefield clone.
2632097	2633418	$40 for a game with no SP mode?
2633539	2634119	Fuck that.
2634880	2635060	True.
2635220	2637963	I'm not buying it, but, you know, it's interesting.
2638644	2644490	Anyways, if you like Warhawk and, you know, those online multiplayer-only games...
2644932	2645412	Guess what?
2645632	2649694	SOCOM Confrontation is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3.
2650554	2658457	It's going to be an online-only multiplayer game, and yeah, it's pretty much more Deathmatch and Captured Flag and all that fun stuff.
2658897	2662298	But it's SOCOM, and it looks pretty, so there you go.
2662878	2672121	It will support, I believe, up to 32 players online, and yeah, it's just going to be very interesting.
2672321	2674242	However, if you're not really into the
2675450	2677391	Multiplayer only SOCOM for PlayStation 3.
2677652	2683816	There will be a single player game coming out later on that will have online elements as well.
2684936	2686277	I've never really gotten into this series.
2686337	2687078	What is this all about?
2687658	2692561	It's just, you know, it's kind of like Ghost Recon, but, you know, sowing his own thing.
2692962	2696624	It's, you know, Navy SEALs, military type first person shooter game.
2697622	2703466	Before we get to the next story real quick, I just kind of want to pose this question because we kind of talked a little bit before and I want to open this up to the chat as well.
2703986	2707588	What kinds of stuff does Sony need right now?
2707608	2709049	Because we obviously have their Gamers Day event.
2709089	2710871	We have more news coming out of their Gamers Day event.
2712031	2715053	What sorts of announcements does Sony need to be making right now?
2715193	2716274	Or are they on the right track?
2717615	2722358	They need more releases, more content on their online service.
2722498	2724139	If they can't do new games...
2725919	2728240	Put out some demos or something or maybe some more.
2728440	2731761	Something that makes it interesting because right now they don't really have anything to download.
2731801	2733142	It's been like one release a month.
2733802	2734802	It's been really slow.
2735863	2740785	They need some more exclusives for sure because right now they're hurting.
2741185	2744826	I mean, and I'm talking first party stuff, not necessarily third party exclusives.
2744886	2745407	They need more.
2745907	2749208	Microsoft's kicking their ass as far as, you know, exclusives go.
2749248	2751769	They've got at least one new exclusive every month.
2752264	2753745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2780072	2784555	Let's see, Gerardomo says, HitStun, Sony needs a game, period.
2785155	2787497	Because I guess HitStun said something about needing more games there.
2788218	2794182	Let's see, Blaze says, Sony needs a price cut, more download content, more big name titles, and needs to retain exclusives.
2796424	2800207	HitStun says, actually, Sony needs some Neo Geo CD backwards compatibility.
2801288	2802669	Hell yeah.
2802769	2805011	Let's see, Rossi says, simply, games, period.
2806199	2808582	Uh, who said, somebody said something about more AAA titles.
2808642	2811224	Oh, Duscap2 said, more AAA titles, ASAP.
2811965	2815007	Uh, KazHorai says, we're certainly not interested in gimmicks.
2815448	2818611	I think that was GS68 changing their name there.
2819171	2819892	So, there you go.
2820512	2822434	I think they need more XXX titles.
2823896	2824336	That would work.
2824396	2826358	No, they just need intelligence in there.
2827058	2829801	Price cut seems to be the number one thing we're hearing in the chatroom, though.
2830686	2831367	That's not likely.
2831607	2833888	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com That's not likely to happen.
2834029	2836230	It'll probably happen in the fall, but it's not.
2836290	2837011	I'd say Christmas.
2837211	2839313	I think for Christmas to stay competitive, I think you'll see it.
2839693	2842295	I think they need more intelligence in their marketing.
2842355	2845757	But I think the problem is, I think Xbox will counter it with a price cut of their own.
2846618	2852983	I'm just worried right now that they're getting hosed as far as exclusives go because it's not
2854157	2861703	It is Sony's fault because Microsoft actually is developing a lot of games in-house for themselves, and they're not relying on third-party exclusives.
2861823	2862603	They've got their own.
2862863	2867226	They've got themselves covered each month with a new game coming out from them.
2868327	2871169	You know, and you can't say that about Sony.
2871369	2873070	I mean, that's kind of the problem.
2873110	2874732	It's like, well, we've got Halo 3.
2875092	2877073	Well, we've got Killzone 2 coming out.
2877373	2878134	Okay, great.
2878234	2882417	I mean, that's coming out eventually, but that's way in the future, so...
2884309	2885230	It's just kind of sad.
2913735	2914476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2931704	2934346	Well, you know, I believe this week, actually, Marvel... I've got more controllers.
2934646	2939228	I was going to say, I think it was either this week or last week that Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition came out for the 360.
2939729	2948354	That's the other reasons I don't have to worry about spending the points downloading the characters I want, because you know the first thing I'm going to do is we can play through every level I can with Hawkeye.
2949835	2951456	Our Sony fanboys can take comfort in this.
2951516	2952236	I don't know how you guys feel.
2952276	2954858	I'm the only one of the three of us that doesn't own a PlayStation 3 yet.
2954898	2955898	You're not missing it.
2956679	2957059	I will...
2958112	2962654	I will go out and buy a PlayStation 3 if Final Fantasy XIII stays exclusive to Sony.
2963134	2966175	Because I'm that much a whore for the Final Fantasy series, I will have to have it.
2966835	2968896	And, you know, Home looks cool and LittleBigPlanet.
2969136	2970977	You know, those are all like extra yays for me.
2971237	2978459	With the things they want to do with Final Fantasy XIII, I don't think there's, processing-wise, a way it can be done on the other systems and have it come out the way they want it to.
2978499	2980780	So I'll be changing my tune single-handedly by that game.
2980820	2983561	I mean, hell, Final Fantasy VII is the reason I bought a PlayStation 1.
2983961	2984061	Yep.
2985225	2987066	and that ended up being an okay bye-bye.
2987126	2988787	So, hey, why not?
2989328	2990849	I need a new Jet Moto game.
2991129	2991969	New Jet Moto.
2992089	2993490	Less Sony bashing, more stories.
2993650	2996111	Let's throw a little bit of love Sony's way, if we can.
2996131	3001554	Well, even so, I'm not highly excited about this because I played the demo at E3 last year.
3001955	3011020	But Heavenly Sword, they are stating that they may have multiplayer as downloadable content, which is sort of interesting, I guess.
3011280	3011560	Yeah.
3013507	3021413	Still, I mean, they're saying that when they do it, they want to make it, you know, full-on, you know, multiplayer, not just an afterthought.
3022654	3026897	There's also rumors of, you know, a co-op and deathmatch, but yeah.
3027317	3032321	But the game right now, though, is, from what I understand, still on schedule for the September release.
3032621	3033221	It looks awesome.
3033902	3034662	Okay, good.
3034862	3035283	Good news.
3035323	3036203	There, that's some very good news.
3036223	3037124	Heavenly Sword looks good.
3037284	3038165	Yeah, exactly.
3038405	3039546	They need to catch up with that September.
3039586	3042188	It was like playing the singing level in Kingdom Hearts 2.
3043919	3044979	Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction
3068488	3074131	I'm not really into that kind of ratchet and clank, but I'm almost kind of thinking of picking it up just because it looks awesome.
3074551	3074831	All right.
3075291	3076512	Well, sorry.
3076912	3092840	I promise that we wouldn't have much more negative Sony stuff, but I just can't not talk about this one, and this would have to do with a recent PlayStation 3 promotion, and what happened is that there was an ad that
3094525	3122437	for, okay, basically it's on this Spanish website for Kia, okay, was promoting the Kia car, and I guess they're doing this promotion right now with the PlayStation, because they're running this, you know, like, I don't know, maybe you enter to win a PlayStation 3 if you test drive one of their cars, but here's the thing, in the ad, they show the PlayStation 3, and then they show a screenshot on the TV of Project Gotham Racing 3, which isn't
3123086	3124867	Project Gotham Printed in Their Magazine
3155472	3155992	Damn.
3157334	3159676	Somebody at Sony Marketing needs to get fired right now.
3159696	3160617	Sony International Marketing.
3160637	3162619	I think it's a lot of people because it's Kia.
3162959	3166262	But somebody, I mean, somebody, I don't know where they're fucking up.
3166282	3168704	It's just a bad mistake to make repeatedly.
3168864	3171467	Like, do it once and it's funny, ha ha, people forget.
3171507	3175030	But do it now three times and people start to go, what the hell?
3175270	3178373	Seriously, why can't people understand that Project Gotham is a Microsoft title?
3178834	3180295	And to be honest, I'm going to...
3180757	3181397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3204462	3206583	Wish I could say the same for full auto, although it wasn't bad.
3207023	3210745	So here's something else that's kind of funny, a little story.
3211105	3221290	Apparently there's some guy, some gamer that was kind of saying farewell to his PlayStation 2 because he has a brand new PlayStation 3.
3222710	3227292	I don't know why he decided to do this, but he figured the best send-off was to piss on it.
3227592	3228973	And I guess he got drunk and
3229721	3236726	You know, pissed on his PlayStation 2 and being the dumbass that he is, left it plugged in and basically knocked himself out after pissing on it.
3236766	3239248	Didn't Mommy ever tell you don't piss on the electric fence?
3241229	3241809	What was that?
3241970	3243190	An episode of Beavis and Butthead?
3243671	3246433	No, it was Ren and Stimpy.
3246453	3248054	Don't whiz on the electric fence.
3248434	3249775	There's a little song that goes with it, I know.
3251290	3254891	DarkSakura, you've had many consoles come and go throughout your house, right?
3255191	3256491	Mostly just consoles come.
3256731	3259672	Have you ever done this send-off for a console?
3259692	3265093	Have you ever, you know, pulled down your trousers and peed on a console to send it off?
3265313	3266813	No, because I'm not stupid.
3266973	3268233	Especially if you're in your house.
3268273	3271594	Why would you piss on it in your own house, you stupid moron?
3272174	3274194	God, I'm going to piss on it.
3274394	3277835	You know, usually when they break, we gut them and try to do something neat with the...
3278940	3279941	The Husk.
3280081	3282324	Seriously, haven't you been paying attention to the internet?
3282344	3286008	The thing to do with consoles is to slam them with a sledgehammer.
3286048	3286729	That's what you gotta do.
3286769	3287330	Put it on YouTube.
3287610	3288331	Put it on YouTube, yes.
3288351	3294138	And you have to play, the best way to do that is to play the music from, what was that scene in Office Space?
3295079	3296320	And recreate it out in the field.
3296360	3298603	Oh, with the copier and they were, yeah, yeah, yeah, those were good times.
3298623	3298703	Yeah.
3299404	3299544	So.
3300020	3307664	Anyway, whenever we hear stories about dumbasses like this one, it can make us feel anything else but anger.
3307784	3309365	And you know what that means, boys and girls.
3310245	3311365	Not really.
3311686	3319069	I mean, you know, she could take a dookie on it if she wanted to.
3328078	3329598	Anyway, DarkSakura, your F.U.
3329618	3330398	of the week, please.
3330778	3331679	It goes to you.
3334119	3335579	I was going to say F.U.
3335619	3341680	to the pollen in Dixon for making me all stuffed up and getting all over my car.
3342561	3343201	But no, F.U.
3343241	3347241	to Rob, because you've never had to go out in the wild.
3348822	3349662	You don't know that.
3350002	3350962	I went camping once.
3351182	3356683	But you've never had, well, okay, you've never been a woman going to the bathroom in the wild.
3359110	3361211	Just squat behind a tree, what's wrong with that?
3361692	3364414	It's not as easy as it sounds.
3365614	3368296	You make it sound like some assembly is required.
3368796	3372399	That's why I love living in the modern world where we have things called toilets.
3373299	3376562	And not living in Japan with the public toilets and squat toilets.
3378022	3386208	Probably remember though, it's not always a good idea to go behind Neil Bush and stuff, especially if you're a woman, because a drag queen fairy may come and turn you into a man.
3387049	3387229	What?
3387249	3388950	What movie was that again?
3389571	3391732	I can't remember.
3391792	3393774	It was like Penis Envy.
3394554	3395274	That's what it was.
3396335	3397756	Actually, there's another thing.
3397796	3400798	It was a movie with Adam Sandler.
3401679	3402339	It's coming out.
3404340	3406262	Oh, it's the gay marriage one?
3407682	3410644	The trailer already pisses me the hell off, so fuck them.
3411125	3414567	I'm willing to give the movie a chance to see what the message is in the end.
3415020	3418842	But yeah, the trailer does make it look like I can't even describe it.
3418922	3420803	It makes it look like it's very trivializing.
3420903	3421603	Yeah, it does.
3421964	3423224	Drawn Together did it first.
3424025	3425325	But Drawn Together did it funny.
3426646	3429327	I'll give the movie a chance, but the trailer does not look promising.
3429367	3430688	Anyway, Loki.
3430828	3440453	Screw all the software makers on the 360 for making it so fucking hard to do a system-linked game with your goddamn games.
3440933	3444655	Stop having to patch shit so it's incompatible with unpatched shit
3446140	3452285	And then F you to my work for not actually having an internet connection in the one room there where we have the game console so I can just update them right there.
3453166	3454007	I have to take them home.
3457269	3458971	Okay, is it my turn to give an F you?
3459811	3461353	Well, my first F you is to drama.
3461933	3462854	I don't like drama.
3462914	3464415	Nobody likes drama, and drama's no fun.
3464956	3470540	And then I have a second F you, and this one's pretty serious, so I have to kill the music here for a minute.
3472802	3474804	I had to give an F you to myself because...
3477256	3486799	Something really bad happened, and it's kind of hard for me to admit this openly, but it's just a very difficult thing for me.
3487739	3495282	I have to give an F you to myself because I kind of like a Fergie song.
3496742	3497122	I know.
3498583	3500623	God, I failed the internets completely.
3501304	3502744	I failed our listeners, but
3503584	3506586	I just like this new Fergie song, this Big Girls Don't Cry.
3506606	3511469	Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
3511990	3513451	You're making my hair hurt again.
3514812	3525939	So, I like Fergie, and for that I deserve to be mocked and made fun of openly by others.
3526279	3527260	And I hate myself.
3527380	3531643	Rob, I'm pointing at you.
3535646	3536726	Alright, that's it.
3537447	3537847	More news.
3539528	3541649	No, I'd say we take an ice cream break.
3542570	3543411	An ice cream break?
3543451	3544952	No, we only have a few more stories.
3545412	3546512	Six more stories, we can do it.
3546833	3548554	Fine, fine, fine.
3549354	3557039	Well, speaking of FUs, Sony is committed to the PS3 for ten years and beyond.
3557059	3557099	Uh...
3560789	3568232	Basically, the SCEA president, Jack Trenton, is quoted saying we didn't get into PS3 for the first six months of 2007.
3569092	3571473	We're into this for the next 10 years and beyond.
3571933	3575414	A million units one way or another at this point isn't going to worry us.
3576755	3580896	So basically they're saying, well, our sales suck, but we hope to make it up in 10 years.
3582137	3582537	Good luck.
3583260	3583740	Yeah.
3583840	3587001	We're dedicated to this console to infinity and beyond.
3587121	3589042	Has any console... Well, I guess, you know what?
3589162	3589542	It makes sense.
3589562	3591663	We kind of look at this and go, oh, ha, ha, ha.
3592103	3597364	You know, but come to think of it, you know, consoles live on even after the next generation.
3597384	3600865	I mean, technically, we are still in the PlayStation 2's lifespan, right?
3601386	3602506	They're still putting that crap for it.
3602646	3603146	Exactly.
3603226	3604426	I mean, and good crap.
3604506	3605267	We had God of War 2.
3605607	3608228	We have this, what, the role-playing game folks are looking forward to.
3608708	3610948	Final Fantasy XII is not that old, all things considered.
3610988	3612969	You know, this console's still got a lot of life left in it.
3613450	3618932	So, you know, I could see how the console, they can say it might be lasting that long before they, you know, put a bullet in it.
3619412	3619692	I don't know.
3621813	3632757	Anyway, sorry, I was reading some chat room while Jamie was reading that story there, and Mystic Gohan reminded me that big girls don't cry, so I need to just suck it up here on the show.
3634257	3641120	Also, big girls and big boys alike love the Chronicles of Riddick, or at least, you know,
3642253	3643054	Feel okay about it.
3643114	3643435	I don't know.
3644376	3645397	Sorry, bad segue.
3645778	3646979	But hey, you know what?
3647019	3648842	Even if you didn't like the movie, the game wasn't bad.
3649483	3651225	There was a game that came out.
3657511	3666257	Starbreeze is working on a new version of the game for Next Gen Systems.
3666558	3677045	The game is called Assault on Dark Athena X, and it's going to have a single player mode, which is a little bit longer than last time, an all new multiplayer mode, and a developer's commentary mode.
3677799	3678379	So what does that mean?
3678399	3680141	You get running commentary while you're playing the game?
3680201	3681461	Kind of like a DVD track on a movie?
3681542	3683443	And man, this part was such a bitch to program.
3683883	3695051	I swear, code here and code this didn't quite work together, so we had to do this to make them work, and blah blah blah blah blah, and the rest of us are going, um, yeah, I don't speak your language.
3695371	3705738	It's like totally like Final Fantasy 7, and it's like, yeah, and then the scene where Eris dies, oh crap, that hasn't happened yet, oh shit, uh, um, forget I said anything about that.
3706558	3706818	That, oh.
3708479	3708779	Damn it.
3710301	3710881	Good job, Loki.
3711041	3720329	Maybe, hey, maybe in that remake that they keep saying they're going to do for, you know, the internet loves to rumor that one for the PlayStation 3, maybe it can have developer commentary in it.
3722911	3724773	And maybe my skin will turn blue.
3726434	3727355	Maybe it will, Jamie.
3727655	3728216	Maybe it will.
3729297	3735562	So, Sony plans on bringing the pain to the PlayStation 3, and actually the PlayStation Network.
3735682	3736703	It's a game called Pain.
3737396	3741458	and it involves you launching a poor hapless victim into stuff.
3743138	3743758	I'm going to buy it.
3745019	3753342	Wait, is this the one where I saw a screenshot where it was just a guy on a slingshot and they were going to fling him into a building or something?
3753962	3754362	Pretty much.
3754742	3758103	And it has monkeys getting injured.
3758203	3760364	So, injured monkeys, people getting hurt.
3760744	3762025	Sounds like a game I'm going to buy.
3762725	3763665	So, yeah.
3763965	3765466	That's going to be coming out later on.
3765894	3767955	It's like Jackass, but actually funny.
3768535	3768915	Sort of.
3768935	3770776	Yeah, I don't know.
3770836	3776957	It's just using the physics engine, so you just launch your character into stuff to get him hurt as badly as possible.
3777438	3783639	They have different games, including Horse Mode or Spank the Monkey and Mime Toss.
3784720	3785420	I like that part.
3785980	3789021	Dr. Burst in chat asks, what's with the Sony bashing tonight?
3789161	3790201	Dude, this looks great.
3791102	3792002	Pain looks great.
3792682	3796146	And we said the Mystic Sword looks cool.
3796326	3800511	Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank.
3800531	3801192	You're right.
3802113	3803074	I'm exposed.
3803214	3804015	I hate Sony.
3804115	3805116	Ha ha, got me.
3806378	3810182	Well, you know, speaking of games that I'm not buying...
3811236	3814979	Vivendi is putting Timeshift on PS3.
3815739	3821183	So it will be up there with the PC and PC 360.
3821504	3822725	I'm sorry, Xbox 360.
3823525	3824646	Oh my, did that slip out?
3826888	3827068	What?
3827308	3830930	Oh, I was just going to say, I have a laugh sometimes with gaming press out there.
3831231	3833372	They always make stories for themselves.
3833452	3836855	Like this whole Timeshift is coming to PlayStation 3.
3837095	3839637	It's always been scheduled to come out on PlayStation 3.
3840980	3843442	even when Atari had the rights for it.
3846285	3847426	But then it went away for a while.
3848466	3850068	Thank you for reading the whole rest of the story for me.
3850528	3851209	Oh, sorry.
3854351	3854972	You ass.
3858294	3859656	I'm not on top of things.
3860556	3861037	D'oh.
3861764	3862204	That's it.
3862224	3863764	Tell him to read my story.
3863784	3864425	This is what you're going to do.
3864445	3865305	This is what you're going to do, Jamie.
3865445	3868585	You know what story he does next because you can see Super C. So read ahead.
3869045	3871306	And when he starts reading it, cut him off and finish it.
3871346	3871826	Okay, Jamie?
3872586	3873986	You know, I'm just going to leave.
3874006	3874626	Bye.
3874746	3875246	No, you're not.
3875286	3878347	You get about two minutes to prep because I have a story here first.
3878507	3879567	No, I don't care.
3879927	3881288	It's about the PlayStation 3.
3881748	3882128	I don't care.
3882168	3884268	I'm going to sit here and read my comics for the rest of the show.
3884528	3884828	All right.
3886228	3886729	There we go.
3887249	3889229	Now, this is something the chat room said earlier.
3889828	3891809	The PlayStation 3 needs a price cut.
3909329	3920000	Gullimont, who is the president and CEO of Ubisoft, has said that Sony will, quote, for sure have a lower market share than before because of the PlayStation 3's cost.
3920521	3924465	And he said, quote, they have to decrease the price quite significantly.
3925226	3925847	Very interesting.
3926147	3928489	However, Ubisoft is continuing to support PlayStation 3.
3928710	3930952	They're bringing an exclusive title to Europe.
3932216	3934138	Far Cry Cricket It's cricket in the jungle We'll see
3955825	3959666	Anyways, so Sega is licensing the Unreal 3 engine.
3960086	3963766	Yes, the same engine that's been in practically everything lately, but, you know.
3964546	3966347	Hey, it's yet another game.
3967327	3975588	Thoughts are, though, that it's going to be used in the upcoming, I guess they're enhancing or remaking the Alien franchise video game.
3975628	3976929	Like Alien Syndrome and that stuff?
3977349	3979829	No, like Aliens as in... Oh, the movies!
3980409	3980529	Oh.
3981169	3982570	I didn't know Sega owned the rights to that.
3983970	3984530	Now you know.
3984790	3985070	Okay.
3986797	3987437	Wait.
3988418	3990118	No, that must be a different thing I'm thinking of.
3990178	3994699	But they haven't made an Alien movie since the Winona Ryder one, which was years ago.
3994819	3998060	Well, they made a crappy Aliens vs. Predator movie, and then they're making a sequel.
3998160	3999841	Aliens vs. Predator was fun.
4000421	4001281	They're making a sequel.
4001801	4003682	Speaking of guilty pleasure movies, there we go.
4003702	4006523	When aliens make out with a black chick, yeah.
4007623	4008123	Or no, I'm sorry.
4008143	4008743	I never saw it.
4008763	4009584	That was a Predator.
4010084	4010624	I never saw it.
4012110	4012670	Freddy vs. The Predator
4040801	4044582	TigerClaw in chat says, the best Aliens was the arcade version from Konami.
4045002	4046782	It was, that's what I was thinking of.
4046902	4052224	But Ross Steel UT says, hey Tiger, Aliens vs. Predator arcade by Capcom equals sex.
4052784	4053684	And Actdeft agrees.
4053704	4057925	No, I was thinking of the Capcom one, because it's all about playing through the game with Lynn Kurosawa.
4058545	4059985	With her freaking sword of death.
4061746	4062266	Awesome game.
4062726	4064286	Anything else about the Unreal Engine?
4064767	4066467	Sorry, we cut you off, but you deserved it.
4068186	4073829	No, it's going to be probably a first person shooter since, you know, people really like to think outside the box.
4073909	4075470	Sonic 3D again.
4078011	4084555	Did you happen to catch that video that was like the Sonic concept that they were going to do that it was supposed to be based off the cartoon series?
4084595	4085836	Yes, I actually did see that.
4085916	4086656	Some YouTube-age.
4086676	4087957	I don't remember where I saw it posted.
4087997	4091919	Yeah, where like Sonic moved a little more 3D, but it was still like a platformer.
4092372	4094013	That looked so fake to me.
4094053	4096075	That looked so incredibly fake.
4096275	4101720	Because I cannot believe that they would make a game like that where Sonic moved like molasses.
4101740	4103381	Because if you watch the video, he was slow.
4103562	4105183	I know which system they'd put it out on, too.
4105483	4106184	The CDI.
4107105	4107245	Oh.
4108246	4109166	It looked horrible.
4109967	4110267	I don't know.
4110888	4112169	Where did he see that YouTube post?
4112189	4112549	Kotaku.
4113070	4113370	Was it?
4113750	4114111	Yeah.
4114131	4115452	Okay, well, it looked fake.
4115492	4115852	I'm sorry.
4115912	4117113	It screamed a fakeness to me.
4117173	4120256	Like they took some unknown game and sprited Sonic into it.
4120728	4120988	I don't know.
4121008	4122509	I don't want to believe it because it looks horrible.
4123470	4125011	Maybe that was the beginning of the end of Sega.
4125051	4125391	Who knows?
4127753	4128213	Let's see.
4130915	4133437	I'm looking at what's in chats going on there.
4134778	4136199	Actdeft wants to see a video game.
4136319	4139661	Aliens vs. Predator vs. Marvel vs. Capcom vs. SNK.
4140522	4142483	Well, that would be the ultimate, wouldn't it?
4143184	4143484	All right.
4144224	4145125	And let's see.
4145325	4147747	GS68's kicking Sonic while they're down here.
4148038	4155463	I tried the Sonic 360 demo and the controls nearly made me have a stroke, heart attack, stomach acid overflow, HIV, and loose stools all at once.
4155583	4161666	You know what they need to have now that Sega's doing third-party titles now?
4162687	4163688	Nintendo vs. Sega.
4164908	4166590	The fighting game to end all fights.
4166610	4167650	Dude, Smash Bros.
4167870	4168211	Hello?
4168591	4170992	No, I'm talking about a bigger roster.
4171012	4173094	We're talking like hundreds of characters.
4173634	4176916	We never did, though, get the Namco Capcom game out here.
4177865	4178425	Oh, that's true.
4178485	4179885	The Namco Cross Capcom or whatever it was?
4180386	4180666	True.
4181046	4181846	It was a big RPG.
4183086	4183986	I know someone who has it.
4184206	4188407	I played the PlayStation 2 Japanese one and I'm kind of glad that we didn't because it was kind of lame.
4189207	4190608	It sounded so cool in theory.
4191528	4196769	Oh, Bandit reminds us they do have Sonic vs. Mario in the upcoming Olympics game that we talked about a few shows ago.
4197409	4198109	You know what I want?
4199329	4204050	I want another... Crap, I just lost the game.
4206391	4207311	I want another Strider.
4208615	4209496	Yes, Strider, please.
4209636	4215200	What was that ridiculous Sega fighting game that they had where you can actually play as a Daytona car and punch things?
4215340	4219063	That was in Fighter's Megamix, which I have.
4219083	4220004	Yeah, Fighter's Megamix.
4221084	4223266	That's the kind of ridiculous gameplay I want.
4223606	4227769	I want you to be able to play as Rob the Robot or as one of the unicycles from Uniracers.
4228089	4229871	This is something really ridiculous.
4230131	4232533	Instead of Captain Falcon, I want to play as the car.
4232553	4233453	Exactly.
4233513	4234294	Exactly.
4234995	4235556	DarkSakura.com
4249181	4251303	All right, well, I guess it's break time, boys and girls.
