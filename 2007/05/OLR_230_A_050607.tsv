7000	14000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	19000	Tonight, May 6, 2007, another DS game has the bubble bubble curse of brokenness,
19000	22000	Microsoft locks down on region control,
22000	27000	and an old Commodore 64 classic returns to the Nintendo Wii.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	40000	We are that video game podcast dedicated to gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle.
40000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
45000	46000	Hi.
46000	49000	How are you doing Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?
49000	50000	Hi.
50000	53000	Alright, we'll leave it at that then I guess.
53000	56000	No, I'm goofy.
56000	57000	Did you have a good week?
57000	60000	Sort of. The parts that I wasn't at work were okay.
60000	63000	That's good, I guess. Work is always good.
63000	66000	Is there anybody who really, truly just says like,
66000	70000	oh, I love every single minute at work, I just want to live there if I could?
70000	72000	I will when I quit.
72000	75000	Because then I'll be working full time as a massage therapist,
75000	78000	which means I'll be working 13 hours a week.
78000	79000	I mean, don't get me wrong-
79000	81000	Making $60,000.
81000	83000	Shut, don't rub it in.
83000	88000	I love my job, I do, but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy,
88000	92000	it's a very exhausting job, what I do, so I enjoy that time when I get to come home.
92000	94000	And even massage therapy, I know that's really exhausting
94000	97000	because I remember when you were doing your test thing on me,
97000	99000	you were like breaking out in a sweat when you were done.
99000	101000	And it was just like, all you did was-
101000	102000	It doesn't matter how cold it is, come on.
102000	104000	It was just because you're so hot and sexy.
104000	107000	There's Tech Master Loki with a smart-ass mouth as usual.
107000	108000	Hi, Loki.
108000	109000	Hello.
109000	113000	Look at my wrist, you see I have swelling on my wrist again.
113000	115000	I'm doing massage therapy.
115000	117000	I know part of it was because I was so hot and sexy,
117000	120000	but I was like, I did not know that dark Sakura touching my butt
120000	123000	would make her break out in a sweat.
123000	125000	I'm going to go ahead and say this.
125000	131000	Actually, giving an hour of massage is an actual anaerobic workout,
131000	133000	as well as strength training.
133000	136000	You actually burn close to 320 calories doing an hour of massage.
136000	138000	You know, it doesn't surprise me when you stop to think about it.
138000	140000	I'm like, oh yeah, like when I give other people massages,
140000	141000	like you're doing-
141000	143000	Why do you think I was fucking eating whatever I wanted to
143000	144000	while I was in school?
144000	148000	Because I was giving hour massages at least four times a week,
148000	150000	especially when I was doing my finals.
150000	151000	DDR not needed for you.
151000	154000	Hell no, now I'm like, I've only been doing a couple of this.
154000	156000	I need to go play DDR.
156000	157000	All right.
157000	159000	Well, there's another smart-ass voice in studio tonight,
159000	162000	and that could only belong to the one and only Drew Nami is back tonight.
162000	164000	Boys and girls, say hello to Drew Nami.
164000	165000	Hello.
165000	166000	How are you doing?
166000	167000	Oh, I'm all right.
167000	168000	Excellent.
168000	172000	All right, and we're here in Orange Lounge Radio's chat room,
172000	174000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
174000	176000	but I noticed my chat room hasn't updated in a few seconds,
176000	178000	which might mean, yep, I just got disconnected.
178000	179000	Go figure.
179000	180000	There you go.
180000	181000	Live radio.
181000	182000	Bye, guys.
182000	183000	I just pinged out of chat.
183000	185000	Live radio, boys and girls, what can you do?
185000	187000	We do tape live Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com,
187000	192000	where we run a fully functional 24-hour a day, seven-day a week station
192000	194000	with other awesome programming.
194000	196000	For instance, Dark Sakura has a show.
196000	198000	She calls Pump Up the Volume.
198000	199000	Sometimes.
199000	200000	Sometimes I just call it crap.
200000	204000	And Travis Donovan has a cool little sci-fi show on Saturday nights,
204000	208000	Travis Donovan Live, and brand new shows being piloted right now.
208000	209000	Can't say too much more.
209000	211000	Those of you that have been listening on Wednesdays know about it,
211000	213000	but those of you that don't,
213000	216000	you're just in the dark for a little while longer while we get the kinks worked out.
216000	217000	So tune in.
217000	218000	That's right.
218000	220000	Some people like it kinky, though.
220000	222000	Some people like their kinks, and there's nothing wrong with that,
222000	224000	nothing wrong with a little kink.
224000	226000	All right, there's also nothing wrong with starting off a podcast
226000	228000	talking about your gaming week.
228000	234000	As we've been doing ever since we started podcasting back in like January of 2005,
234000	235000	it's always been how was your gaming week?
235000	237000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
237000	239000	It was kind of dead.
239000	240000	Oh, no, no, no.
240000	242000	I did play some more Marvel Ultimate Alliance,
242000	244000	and then Dan took the game back,
244000	246000	but it's like fucking funny to play it with Deadpool.
246000	248000	So that's all I've been doing.
248000	253000	And I was supposed to get my Pokemans,
253000	257000	but my husband didn't pull through for me and bring me my Pokemans.
257000	258000	Fired!
258000	259000	I know.
259000	261000	I need to trade him in for a more attentive model.
261000	262000	No, I love...
262000	264000	What?
264000	267000	Now you make it sound like you're trading Pokemans.
267000	271000	I'm going to trade a level 32 Dan for...
271000	272000	No, he's level 31.
272000	274000	Level 69 boobs.
274000	275000	No.
275000	276000	No, no, no.
276000	282000	I'll trade in my Dan for your Drew Barrymore.
282000	283000	No.
283000	284000	No, you're David Tennant.
284000	285000	There you go.
285000	286000	But no.
286000	287000	But it's...
287000	293000	I've been listening to other people talk about their Pokemans,
293000	295000	and I want to show you mine.
295000	297000	I don't have mine yet.
297000	298000	All right.
298000	299000	And I've been playing...
299000	303000	I've been really, really fucking pissed off at Twilight Zone.
303000	304000	It's a pinball.
304000	308000	Because Twilight Zone is awesome, and I can get in the zone,
308000	311000	and then it's like, you're in the zone, train.
311000	312000	What?
312000	313000	I'm so sad.
313000	314000	Multiball.
314000	315000	No, drain.
315000	316000	Bitch.
316000	322000	And Dan finally fixed our little problem we had on our Guns N' Roses.
322000	324000	Kyle Snyder is in chat.
324000	327000	Kyle's been listening to us for a while, and of course we know him from the DDR days.
327000	329000	He says, Pokemon is dead to me.
329000	331000	I'm wondering what happened.
331000	333000	You should let me show you my Pokemans.
333000	334000	I wonder why...
334000	336000	Why, Kyle, is Pokemon dead to you?
336000	338000	A lot of folks have been eating this game up.
338000	340000	It's been bringing a lot of people back into the series.
340000	343000	Maybe some long-time fans feel it's just a little too much.
343000	344000	I need a new Digimon game.
344000	347000	Why do people still play this damn game?
347000	348000	Seriously.
348000	353000	Oh, look, we added more monsters that look very similar to the other ones.
353000	354000	Buy it again.
354000	356000	To answer Tigerclaw, by the way, I've been...
356000	361000	And in fact, buy our new color of DS or something to go along with it.
361000	364000	Tigerclaw, I've been playing on PlayStation 3,
364000	368000	but we've decided to purchase the Xbox 360 version so that, number one,
368000	370000	I don't have to fuck with the stupid 6-axis.
370000	373000	And number two, we have more controllers already,
373000	376000	so I can actually have multiplayer in my house.
376000	379000	Kyle Snyder simply says, I got bored of Pokemon.
379000	381000	Maybe to support Loki's theory.
381000	382000	I don't know.
382000	384000	Loki, I can't explain the allure of Pokemon.
384000	390000	It's kind of like when everybody bought Spice Girls albums, you know, 10 years ago.
390000	392000	It's like you don't know why you're buying such crap.
392000	393000	Everybody didn't.
393000	395000	Everybody didn't buy those.
395000	397000	Look, 7 million people beg to differ.
397000	398000	What?
398000	399000	Spice World was fucking funny, though.
399000	400000	It was.
400000	401000	Meatloaf is the bus driver.
401000	402000	See, it was really funny.
402000	404000	But anyway, this is a shitty game out of it, too.
404000	409000	Oh, my God, the Spice Girls video game is the best party game ever on the PlayStation 1.
409000	414000	If you've ever played the Spice Girls game, it is so horrible because, oh, my God,
414000	416000	like the funniest thing ever.
416000	419000	You have the girls, you like choreograph dances,
419000	421000	and all the girls can like do their dance.
421000	424000	Well, we made Stupid Spice, I don't know, the blonde one.
424000	425000	We call her Stupid Spice.
425000	428000	What we did is we would have her always be a count late,
428000	433000	and then halfway through the dance, she just gives up and does the little sway back and forth.
433000	436000	And then you can have them actually lip sync the song.
436000	437000	It's the stupidest game.
437000	440000	Hours of entertainment, especially if you're intoxicated.
440000	441000	That's all I have to say.
441000	442000	Only Rob.
442000	443000	Only Rob.
443000	444000	Hi.
444000	448000	Anything else in your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
448000	449000	No.
449000	450000	All right.
450000	452000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
452000	454000	How was it?
454000	455000	One last thing, sorry.
455000	456000	Yes.
456000	459000	Dan downloaded that pinball game, the demo of the pinball game,
459000	462000	and it's okay, but it's very high def.
462000	464000	Done.
464000	468000	Is it just me, or is like nothing ever going to be a substitute for real pinball?
468000	472000	I think that's the game's biggest flaw, is like, yeah, it gets really, really close
472000	475000	to emulating real pinball, but it's not real pinball.
475000	476000	Pinmame?
476000	477000	Even pinmame.
477000	480000	I can't play pinmame like I can a real pinball machine.
480000	481000	It's just not the same.
481000	482000	I'm sorry.
482000	485000	I mean, it's nothing against the game's ball physics or anything like that,
485000	488000	which are all done fine, and the graphics are great, but it's not the same.
488000	489000	I can't explain it.
489000	491000	That's why you have to have a couple thousand dollars on hand
491000	492000	to buy yourself a pinball machine.
492000	493000	Yeah, well.
493000	495000	What they need to do, they need to make a full-size pinball table
495000	499000	that has like a really huge LCD or plasma screen in there,
499000	501000	and then you're just playing it on the actual table.
501000	507000	Actually, there is, in works, using widescreen LCD monitors
507000	512000	to do an at-home full pinball emulation.
512000	513000	Yes, exactly.
513000	515000	Using two screens.
515000	516000	Exactly as I was saying.
516000	517000	Anyways.
517000	518000	Can I say chat real quick?
518000	521000	Chat's saying Fireboma says Spice World is almost the worst game ever,
521000	524000	to which Jared Jay says you've obviously not played Night Trap.
524000	528000	Jbmon says Spice World is better than Sonic was for the Wii.
528000	529000	What?
529000	530000	There you have it.
530000	531000	Sorry, Loki.
531000	532000	Go ahead.
532000	533000	That's sad.
533000	537000	So this week, I played, of course, More Earth Defense Force 2017.
537000	540000	A lot less of it, though, because I've been trying to set up
540000	546000	a network at our work with both my 360 and my friend Sean's 360,
546000	549000	but for some reason, it just does not want to work.
549000	551000	It's defying all logic and everything.
551000	553000	We're hooking it up correctly, and it's just like, no.
553000	555000	One of them wants to see the network,
555000	556000	and the other one doesn't.
556000	557000	It doesn't make any sense.
557000	558000	So whatever.
558000	560000	We'll have to fix that later.
560000	562000	But we've also been playing.
562000	564000	I played a little bit of Boom Boom Rocket today,
564000	565000	and that was kind of fun,
565000	568000	and just working through some of the medium-leveled stuff
568000	571000	so I can get a little higher on the leaderboards there.
571000	574000	And then a little bit of Crackdown.
574000	575000	Crackdown's still fun.
575000	579000	You know, I think I still have a top 100 score on Boom Boom Rocket
579000	581000	for the grand leaderboards,
581000	584000	and yet still there is someone on my friends list who outranks me.
584000	589000	PK or Uno, I am going to beat your ass at Boom Boom Rocket.
589000	590000	Mark my words.
590000	593000	I will keep practicing until I take down your score.
593000	597000	But now we're looking at maybe picking up a copy of Saints Row
597000	600000	so we can do some Saints Row multiplayer on the two consoles as well.
600000	602000	I don't know how much fun two-player multiplayer will be,
602000	604000	but it sounds fun.
604000	605000	I don't know.
605000	608000	So that'll tide us over until Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.
608000	610000	Oh, that game will be awesome.
610000	611000	Yeah.
611000	612000	Okay.
612000	613000	I'm pissed off now.
613000	614000	Why?
614000	619000	SSG 100 Matt, the only great game on Sega CD apart from Sonic CD
619000	621000	was not fucking Night Trap.
621000	622000	There was Popful Mail.
622000	625000	There was Silfied, Revenge of the Ninja, Microcosm.
625000	628000	Okay, there was Sewer Shark, but that doesn't count either.
628000	629000	And all the Lunar games.
629000	630000	So you know what?
630000	631000	Shut up.
631000	632000	Wait.
632000	634000	He's saying there were no good.
634000	635000	Then Night Trap.
635000	636000	Was a good game?
636000	637000	Was the only other good game.
637000	638000	I'm like, the fuck it was.
638000	640000	I've got the same.
640000	642000	Night Trap wasn't even a good game.
642000	644000	It had Dana Play-Doh in it.
644000	645000	Shit.
645000	647000	It didn't have boobies in it.
647000	648000	Yeah, because it was Dana Play-Doh,
648000	649000	but she didn't have very big boobies.
649000	650000	Well, there you go.
650000	653000	I mean, that's instantly in the good game section.
653000	657000	But I've got the 32X one, actually.
657000	658000	Oh, well, there you go.
658000	659000	Yeah, the Terminator game was good, too.
659000	660000	The 32X is crap.
660000	662000	Hey, Chaotix kidnapped you.
662000	663000	No, it did not.
663000	664000	Yes, it did.
664000	665000	Oh, my God.
665000	666000	Chaotix was awful.
666000	667000	And Calibri.
667000	668000	Did you play Calibri?
668000	669000	Yeah.
669000	671000	Wasn't there an Echo game that was 32X compatible?
671000	673000	There was, but it wasn't very good.
673000	676000	I just mostly played Chaotix.
676000	677000	Jamie?
677000	678000	Afterburner.
678000	679000	Jamie?
679000	680000	What?
680000	681000	I love you.
681000	682000	Calibri sucks.
682000	683000	Calibri was cute.
683000	690000	But, no, Afterburner and, uh, fuck, Space Harrier for 32X.
690000	692000	And they said it was a flop.
692000	694000	And they were the actual arcade versions.
694000	696000	It was really fucking cool.
696000	697000	Anyway.
697000	698000	It was really lame.
698000	700000	I was like, why the fuck are they chained to each other?
700000	702000	And this is so awful.
702000	705000	It's just like a fucking anchor being dragged behind the guy.
705000	708000	It was a horrible, horrible game.
708000	710000	It's the Bionic Commando Factor.
710000	713000	Sonic Crackers, anyone?
713000	714000	That works.
714000	715000	That works.
715000	716000	Anyway.
716000	720000	Of course, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories because that game never gets old.
720000	723000	Although, we still get pissed off at each other.
723000	725000	A lot.
725000	729000	Me, I've been playing WoW off and on.
729000	733000	Some Neverwinter Nights 2 and some Unreal Tournament.
733000	735000	Just kind of a return to old school stuff.
735000	737000	No, I am not an addict.
737000	742000	No, I do not plan to be an addict, but I still play WoW.
742000	745000	My gaming week was somewhat very similar to Jiranami's.
745000	748000	I played pretty much nothing but WoW all week.
748000	750000	I'm hit to level 49.
750000	751000	I guess there's that.
751000	752000	I know.
752000	753000	Big WoW, huh?
753000	756000	I actually have not been doing a lot of console gaming this week.
756000	757000	It's kind of sad.
757000	759000	Like, I played the pinball game at least one more time.
759000	760000	Like, twice or something.
760000	762000	To just kind of see if I liked it.
762000	764000	I tried the demo for the mini golf game.
764000	765000	Hated it.
765000	768000	I've just never liked mini golf games on consoles.
768000	769000	It's just not the same.
769000	770000	It's like pinball.
770000	772000	That's my review for everything this week.
772000	774000	It's not the same as the real thing.
774000	775000	Here's the problem though with it.
775000	779000	They really fucked up this whole thing when they went 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.
779000	781000	It's really lame now.
781000	783000	See, 3D Ultra Mini Golf was pretty fun.
783000	785000	Because you can play against other people.
785000	788000	They even had some modes that people would create and stuff in it.
788000	792000	My favorite was if I was doing bad, I just hit someone's ball across the entire course.
792000	794000	And that was worth it right there.
794000	795000	It was awesome.
795000	796000	I don't know.
796000	797000	The game's okay.
797000	798000	Graphically.
798000	799000	It's very creative.
799000	800000	A lot of the holes are very creative.
800000	803000	It's certainly not your typical mini golf game.
803000	804000	But, I don't know.
804000	807000	I wasn't feeling it for some reason.
807000	809000	So, I didn't buy the full version.
809000	813000	I really wanted to try Catan, but the demo wasn't working and I guess they fixed it now.
813000	814000	So, I need to go back and try it.
814000	816000	Because I've heard lots of great things about Catan.
816000	819000	It was either on my Twitter or live journal.
819000	822000	Somebody compared it to Civilization.
822000	823000	And I was like, sold!
823000	825000	So, I definitely want to check that out.
825000	828000	Because Civilization is my favorite PC game ever.
828000	829000	Ever.
829000	830000	You know what?
830000	831000	The other game is exactly like Civilization.
831000	832000	Civ 1.
832000	833000	Civ 1 for life.
833000	834000	You know what?
834000	836000	Other games exactly like Civilization.
836000	837000	What?
837000	838000	Spice World.
838000	839000	Totally like Civilization.
839000	840000	Go fuck yourself, monkey.
840000	841000	You gotta go buy it now.
841000	842000	Just go fuck yourself.
842000	844000	I guess that's it.
844000	845000	I haven't really been playing a whole lot else.
845000	847000	I'm trying to think.
847000	849000	Oh, I tried the demo.
849000	851000	Because I got a new monitor for my computer.
851000	853000	I finally got a widescreen monitor.
853000	855000	Which, by the way, is working out great for the show.
855000	857000	Because I can have all the windows up at once.
857000	859000	But I was like, oh, it's really pretty.
859000	860000	I want to download movies.
860000	861000	I want to download other games.
861000	862000	I want to see how.
862000	863000	Because widescreen and wow.
863000	864000	Oh.
864000	865000	Fap, fap, fap.
865000	866000	It's beautiful.
866000	867000	It's so awesome.
867000	868000	I can't even explain it.
868000	869000	But I wanted to try other stuff.
869000	870000	So, I was like, I'll try a driving game.
870000	874000	So, I tried to download the Need for Speed Carbon demo for the PC.
874000	875000	Crashed on me.
875000	878000	Like, I was about ready to get to where I'd actually race.
878000	879000	Crashed on me.
879000	880000	And, like, I'm sorry.
880000	882000	But I'm not going to sit here and troubleshoot a demo.
882000	884000	So, I just deleted it.
884000	886000	Which is sad because I had a Ladytron track in it.
886000	887000	And I like Ladytron a lot.
887000	890000	That's exactly what I did with that Dance Online.
890000	891000	Crash sent me away.
891000	892000	Ah, fuck it.
892000	893000	I ain't going to play.
893000	894000	Dance Online I was able to play.
894000	897000	It's just something corrupted wanting to download.
897000	898000	I'm like, I'm not downloading this thing yet.
898000	899000	All right.
899000	901000	Get the Command and Conquer 3 demo.
901000	902000	It works with widescreen.
902000	903000	No, it did download, though.
903000	910000	I downloaded eDuke, which is a modified version of Duke Nukem 3D that works on Windows XP.
910000	911000	Oh.
911000	913000	That I want to check out.
913000	914000	That might be pretty fun.
914000	915000	That might be very fun.
915000	916000	Can you play it over the internet or something?
916000	917000	I think so.
917000	918000	Oh my god.
918000	919000	Loki, we need to play this game.
919000	923000	And they also have, like, a high-res pack that you can do where all the monsters are
923000	925000	made into, like, 3D and stuff.
925000	927000	They kind of, like, Quake-ified it.
927000	931000	Oh, Dark Soccer, I have to ask your opinion on this.
931000	936520	I'm not sure who got the job on this topic, but JVMon is saying, I would cream for a Doctor
936520	939320	Who MMO.
939320	944040	That's not entirely possible unless they set it before the current series, because there's
944040	946140	only one Time Lord now.
946140	949160	So you couldn't, like, go around in your own TARDIS or anything.
949160	951200	What if they did something a while back or something else?
951200	952200	Who knows?
952200	957880	If it was pre-movie, it'd be possible, but it wouldn't work.
957880	963520	And I really, really doubt that they'd let something like that out now, given the attention
963520	964680	to continuity.
964680	968680	Don't you get a little nervous, too, when you hear, like, your favorite shows or whatever
968680	969880	are going to be turned into games?
969880	973680	Like, you know, they're talking about turning Heroes into a video game now, because, you
973680	978440	know, the show's been very successful, and I love me some Heroes, but I get very nervous
978440	979800	about a Heroes video game.
979800	985240	If they said EA's making a Heroes game, that might be a little more confident in saying
985240	991040	SNK's making a Heroes game, which would never happen, because that's neither, you know,
991040	996440	Metal Slug, Art of Fighting, King of Fighters, it's none of those, and it's not a game that
996440	999640	they've already made, so obviously that wouldn't be one of their games.
999640	1004620	Oh, cue what brings up a good point, 24 the game, like, okay, yeah, 24 didn't work out
1004620	1005620	so well.
1005620	1007720	Well, here's the problem, they made a game that took place between Seasons 2 and 3, and
1007720	1013040	it came out, like, after Season 5 or 4 or something like that, so it's like, wow, this
1013040	1014040	is a little old.
1014040	1017640	All right, before we get into gaming news this week, I noticed the chat room is all
1017640	1021680	stuck on Spider-Man 3, like, you know, here we are, like, almost 20 minutes into the show,
1021680	1025600	they're still talking about Spider-Man 3 as they were before the show started tonight,
1025600	1029960	even though we're a video game show, but I see, Spider-Man 3 is not a game, it's a horrible
1029960	1030960	review.
1030960	1032640	Spider-Man 3 is a popular part of culture.
1032640	1033640	Horrible reviews.
1033640	1034640	Really?
1034640	1038680	Yeah, the game I was reading, like, PlayStation 2 game, they said it just looked like crap,
1038680	1043520	the PlayStation 3 one was just getting average reviews, it was just horrible, usually the
1043520	1047040	Spider-Man games, it was just like, everyone, you know.
1047040	1050800	Speaking of things people love and turning them into bastardized video games.
1050800	1051800	Yeah.
1051800	1055120	Well, I mean, it had potential, but, like, even they were showing, like, the Wii version
1055120	1059560	of it and stuff, and, you know, half of Brooklyn Bridge would be not even there, it's just,
1059560	1064340	you know, stuff like that, none of the buildings had textures on them and stuff like that.
1064340	1068160	I feel like one of the non-cool kids, because I didn't bother to see the movie this weekend,
1068160	1069760	but I hate seeing movies opening weekend.
1069760	1074560	Like, it used to be the cool thing to do, but I just, I hate teenagers at the theater.
1074560	1077360	No offense to the teenagers that listen to this show, I'm sure you guys know how to be
1077360	1082040	respectful, but unfortunately, not all teenagers of the world can be, it just ruins it for
1082040	1083040	me.
1083040	1084960	I went yesterday and I had a fairly quiet theater, there was one child that started
1084960	1087000	crying and the parent escorted him out.
1087000	1088000	Good.
1088000	1090480	And one phone that went off there, everyone pretty much, you know, turned around and said,
1090480	1091480	turn that fucker off!
1091480	1092960	I can top that.
1092960	1100880	We had a work screening and one dumb bitch at my work dropped her kids off at the screening
1100880	1106360	and one of her kids was recording the film with his camera phone, to which Nellie turned
1106360	1107360	him in.
1107360	1110000	I love your wife, I really do.
1110000	1114280	And the manager came over to him and told him to turn off the phone, that's it.
1114280	1118400	I was hoping that he'd be dragged out and parents called and stuff like that, but unfortunately
1118400	1120200	that didn't happen.
1120200	1123160	Because management is afraid to be mean because they'll get sued or something.
1123160	1124160	Oh, I punched the fuck.
1124160	1128240	I punched the kid in the face and then dragged him out by his hair.
1128240	1129240	You know what?
1129240	1132320	Instead of telling the manager, you should have called the RIAA or whatever, or not,
1132320	1133320	not, sorry.
1133320	1134320	Not the MPAA.
1134320	1135320	Not down here real quick!
1135320	1136320	Sorry, the MPAA.
1136320	1139240	Sorry, boy, I'm going to get hate mail for that mistake.
1139240	1143520	All right, anyway, all right, sorry, enough about movies.
1143520	1150000	Moving on to, wait, I'm looking at, actually I'm looking at Chet, let's see, Blaze says,
1150000	1153120	I'm a teen and I hate a lot of teens that go to the movies.
1153120	1156280	Footy Monster says, I hate, hate, hate, hate teenagers.
1156280	1161920	And Jack Ransom responds to that saying, we hate, hate, hate you.
1161920	1163320	Come join in the love.
1163320	1166800	Chat.orangesontrader.com, live on this Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time.
1166800	1171440	Well, I remember when I was their age and stuff going, man, I don't act like that.
1171440	1175000	And now I go, man, I never acted like that, I just don't understand it.
1175000	1178160	Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just say when I was your age?
1178160	1179160	Yes.
1179160	1183520	Because that was like almost 10 years ago.
1183520	1184520	You're old.
1184520	1185520	We're all old.
1185520	1186520	All right, anyhow.
1186520	1187520	No, I know.
1187520	1190760	We were, and Jared Jay says, well, we were all teenagers at one point.
1190760	1195440	Yeah, but I wasn't a jackass, exactly.
1195440	1196440	That's what I'm saying.
1196440	1200760	Probably the people listening to this show, I would hope, if you're smart enough to download
1200760	1205420	this show or listen live, you're probably smart enough to not be a jackass at the theater.
1205420	1206420	So I'm not talking about you.
1206420	1207420	Wait, Rob.
1207420	1208420	I'm talking about.
1208420	1209420	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
1209420	1210420	I was never a teenager.
1210420	1211420	This is craziness.
1211420	1212420	Calling me a teenager.
1212420	1213420	What?
1213420	1214420	Are you 12?
1214420	1215420	I was never a teenager.
1215420	1216420	Are you 12?
1216420	1217420	Only if you're 12.
1217420	1218420	It's all about the jocks.
1218420	1222160	It's always the jocks that are the problems of everything, and the nerds get the rap for
1222160	1223160	it.
1223160	1224160	Nerds.
1224160	1225160	Sorry.
1225160	1230600	Did I ever tell you, did I ever tell the Grudge story on this show when I went to go
1230600	1231600	see the Grudge?
1231600	1232600	I think I was with you.
1232600	1233600	Several times.
1233600	1234600	Really?
1234600	1235600	Okay, then I'm not going to tell it again.
1235600	1236600	Yeah, I was with you.
1236600	1237600	Tell it again, though.
1237600	1238600	Tell it better.
1238600	1239600	I wasn't there.
1239600	1240600	I thought you were.
1240600	1241600	No.
1241600	1242600	Okay.
1242600	1243600	When we saw the Grudge, were you there, Loki?
1243600	1244600	I was there.
1244600	1245600	You tell it.
1245600	1246600	I don't remember.
1246600	1247600	Okay.
1247600	1248600	Okay.
1248600	1250600	I wasn't even there, and I remember this fucking story.
1250600	1251600	All right.
1251600	1255840	Some people were in the back, what, talking and hooting at the movie and being assholes.
1255840	1262880	They were doing that thing that jocks do, yeah, they're going, oh my god, I'm so scared.
1262880	1266700	Like through the whole end of the movie, through the scary parts, like they're trying to impress
1266700	1267700	their girlfriends.
1267700	1272360	Like, you know how jocks talk to each other?
1272360	1276720	Any girl that's impressed by that, by the way, needs to fucking get shot.
1276720	1278480	So it was a sold out theater, right?
1278480	1284580	It was a sold out theater, and the jocks in the back, so I don't know if it's the Rocky
1284580	1288340	Horror Picture Show goer in me or whatever, but I'm not afraid to yell in a crowded theater.
1288340	1291700	So I turned around and I yelled out, would the man with the little penis in the back
1291700	1294280	row please shut the fuck up?
1294280	1299000	And the entire audience started applauding, because you know they were all sick of it,
1299000	1300500	they just didn't want to say anything about it.
1300500	1303840	So I yelled that out, everybody applauded, and he shut the fuck up.
1303840	1310680	And yet you hear these girls in the back start going, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, because
1310680	1312680	his girlfriend knew it was true.
1312680	1313680	So it was great.
1313680	1316480	It was a good time, good time.
1316480	1320600	So maybe I should go to the movies more often on opening weekend, because I'm not afraid
1320600	1322240	to yell at people while the movie's going on.
1322240	1327160	Sometimes it is fun to yell at movies, like I remember when we went and saw, work screening
1327160	1332880	again because I wouldn't pay to see this, Charlie's Angels 2, and I will never forget
1332880	1338200	the one moment in the movie where it's just like, okay, you can kind of suspend disbelief
1338200	1343280	for a lot of the movie and stuff, but when the fucking, there's a boat exploding and
1343280	1348900	they grab ahold of this rope and get pulled up through the ceiling and shrapnel from the
1348900	1356480	explosion causes wood to splinter into snowboard-shaped pieces of wood to which the girls land on
1356480	1363160	those and then grind down the ropes from the ship to the dock, and I was like, oh, really?
1363160	1364160	Come on.
1364160	1365160	Yeah.
1365160	1366160	Yeah, really.
1366160	1370760	It was almost like The Transporter, but The Transporter, though, you expect that.
1370760	1375320	You see, there are right movies to MST and there are wrong movies to MST.
1375320	1378880	MST and Charlie's Angels, yeah.
1378880	1381240	Or Snakes on a Plane, hell yeah.
1381240	1383600	There's some movies that you just have to see that are bad.
1383600	1386600	No, you have to give some respect to movies like 300.
1386600	1391800	Or the end of the Premonition where I started busting up laughing because it was so stupid,
1391800	1396360	or the end of Fracture where it was just like, wow, nothing really happened in the entire
1396360	1397360	movie.
1397360	1398360	So next on Movie Chat.
1398360	1399360	Sorry.
1399360	1400960	You know what?
1400960	1402720	It's all right to get off topic once in a while.
1402720	1403720	I know.
1403720	1404720	Embrace it.
1404720	1405720	Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.
1405720	1406720	Remember last week?
1406720	1408960	We tried not to give a shit and people hated it.
1408960	1413760	Oh, speaking of Mr. Sandstorm 3000, I got a new tape, or not tape, a DVD from work.
1413760	1416840	Apparently the guys that do it are starting a new series.
1416840	1417840	Oh, yeah.
1417840	1418840	Oh, really?
1418840	1421160	I don't remember what it's called now because I don't have the disc in front of me, but
1421160	1422680	there is a new series coming out.
1422680	1423680	Cool.
1423680	1424680	They have a website, but I don't know.
1424680	1425680	Does it have mics?
1425680	1426680	Research it.
1426680	1427680	Yeah.
1427680	1428680	Chat feedback real quick.
1428680	1431520	Bandit says, it might have been his mom laughing.
1431520	1433680	I fucking love Chat.
1433680	1434960	Her jeans.
1434960	1438440	Tigerclaw says, Sky, and they didn't yell back at you saying, you shut the fuck up.
1438440	1442320	No, they didn't because the entire audience applauded.
1442320	1445000	If that didn't happen, maybe they would have, but yeah.
1445000	1446000	Anyway.
1446000	1447000	There you go.
1447000	1448000	All right.
1448000	1449000	How about game news?
1449000	1450000	No.
1450000	1451000	How about housekeeping?
1451000	1452000	Real quick.
1452000	1453000	Some housekeeping.
1453000	1456080	We announced it at the end of last week's show, but we wanted to say upfront, or at
1456080	1460640	least 25 minutes once Movie Chat's done, we wanted to say that we are going to be live
1460640	1462240	at Fauna Mae again this year.
1462240	1463600	We're really excited about that.
1463600	1467280	Fauna Mae Convention happens in San Jose, California at their convention center over
1467280	1468600	Memorial Day weekend.
1468600	1470480	This year we only have one panel, not two.
1470480	1473320	We're not going to do a general podcasting panel, but that's all right because we're
1473320	1477600	still going to record our show live, and it happens at 2 p.m. on Saturday, so we hope
1477600	1481520	that a lot of you guys will come out and say hello and make plans to come see us at Fauna
1481520	1482520	Mae.
1482520	1486560	We'll all be there, so we're excited.
1486560	1487560	So that's it.
1487560	1488960	Let's get into some gaming news.
1488960	1494240	Well, I have some news, and this is very interesting stuff.
1494240	1500640	Now the PlayStation 3 store is starting to stock PlayStation 1 games.
1500640	1507640	We have Two Extreme, Crash Bandicoot, Destruction Derby, Jet Moto, Jumping Flash, which I fucking
1507640	1515760	love Jumping Flash, Medieval, Rally Cross, Siphon Filter, which is actually a good game,
1515760	1526520	Back in 2, and Wipeout, so you will actually be able to share your PSP games between the
1526520	1530280	handheld and the PS3, so you'll keep your save games with you.
1530280	1533680	You can play them at work, play them at home.
1533680	1539440	It has not yet been confirmed for Europe, however, so we just got to wait.
1539440	1542800	However, these downloads are $5.99 a piece.
1542800	1546640	They've had them up for the PSP for a while, and it's always kind of weird how you had
1546640	1551080	to have the PS3 to download the ones for the PSP, which didn't make any sense, and now
1551080	1556040	with the new version 1.7 patch that they had for the firmware on the PS3, now you can actually
1556040	1560120	play them on the PlayStation 3 instead of just on the PSP.
1560120	1562280	I just think it's good that your saves are going to work between the two.
1562280	1566400	Well, that's kind of nice, and it's also nice that there's something to actually download
1566400	1568640	on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.
1568640	1572120	You know, there was a system that tried to do this before, not necessarily with having
1572120	1576660	the handheld version, but remember the Neo Geo tried to do this before with the arcade
1576660	1578120	versions and with the AVS.
1578120	1580120	Well, there's also the TurboGrafx-16.
1580120	1584880	No, the TurboGrafx didn't have arcade compatibility.
1584880	1589720	Well, they had the Turbo Duo, though, or the Turbo Express.
1589720	1593520	The Turbo Express had no way to transfer the saves between the systems.
1593520	1595800	Well, I thought it was on the cartridges, though.
1595800	1600680	Well, yeah, I mean, but that's like playing with your Super Game Boy.
1600680	1603320	Well, I guess it would be the same as the Nomad in Genesis.
1603320	1605800	Yeah, it's the same as the Nomad.
1605800	1610840	In this case, though, it was having your, you know, bringing home your arcade game to
1610840	1613720	play on your arcade version at home.
1613720	1614720	Too different.
1614720	1615720	Hello.
1615720	1622000	Bandit in our chat room says, great, now I can use my $600 investment to play really
1622000	1623000	old PS1 games.
1623000	1624000	Great, thanks, Sony.
1624000	1629840	Dude, I love Jumping Flash, shut up.
1629840	1630840	That's what it was.
1630840	1633840	Okay, sorry to interject this real quick.
1633840	1637120	The Film Crew is what the new thing is called, the new series.
1637120	1642640	It stars Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett, and Mike Nelson.
1642640	1643640	Thanks.
1643640	1644640	How about some game news?
1644640	1652920	Okay, now, Mr. Demanding, anyways, so, also tying in with the PlayStation 3, home beta
1652920	1655680	has finally kicked off in both the US and UK.
1655680	1659080	Look, I just don't care if it doesn't have Tom Servo, okay?
1659080	1666520	Okay, so, a lot of people are getting to try out the brand new free, you know, Avatar system
1666520	1673520	that's very similar to The Sims, and everybody's saying, oh, it's so much better than Xbox
1673520	1677000	Live, yay.
1677000	1679400	I thought they all had to sign an NDA to get in that.
1679400	1683880	Oh, well, they did, but, you know, they can still say that they're part of this, you know,
1683880	1689240	this and that, it's awesome, because, you know, awesome is not covered under the NDA,
1689240	1697160	so, I don't know, but, apparently, also, there's gonna be some more entries into the beta coming
1697160	1698160	out soon.
1698160	1703200	If you really wanna get into the beta, you need to make sure that you register your PlayStation
1703200	1710640	3 with Sony, which I haven't done yet, so, I need to do that, and then, it's all random
1710640	1713640	from there, so, good luck.
1713640	1718320	Hopefully you get to try out the home beta before everybody else, not that I, personally,
1718320	1721800	I don't really care, I'll just wait for it to be done, and it won't be working correctly
1721800	1724480	when it is done anyways, because everybody likes to patch shit.
1724480	1727840	Well, it is in beta, it's early.
1727840	1728840	True.
1728840	1736400	The Rob D., by the way, says, Kevin Murphy is Tom Servo, so he's trying to pwn me there,
1736400	1737400	but, whatever.
1737400	1740040	Does he have a giant underwear collection?
1740040	1741040	I think not.
1741040	1743760	Alright, moving on.
1743760	1744760	Please do.
1744760	1752640	Speaking of playing old PlayStation 1 games on the PlayStation 3, I think it's very interesting
1752640	1758240	because Masaya Matsura created, of course, Parappa the Rappa, he also created a little
1758240	1763040	game we love called Vib-Ribbon, which is awesome, I'm very excited.
1763040	1768120	Matsura was actually hinting that, possibly, Vib-Ribbon might be on its way to the PlayStation
1768120	1769120	network.
1769120	1770120	Hey!
1770120	1772760	Parappa the Rappa is very similar in idea to Vib-Ribbon.
1772760	1776960	It's about analyzing audio and creating a game from that data, but it uses MP3 audio
1776960	1778360	instead of CDs.
1778360	1782200	We are discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of Vib-Ribbon for Sony,
1782200	1783200	but I don't know yet.
1783200	1786440	Sony only recently launched their downloadable service in Japan, so we kind of need to wait
1786440	1789360	a while before releasing a title with that kind of appeal.
1789360	1790360	That would be awesome.
1790360	1792880	Vib-Ribbon, if you've never played it, is so friggin' cute.
1792880	1797880	I'm so glad I lucked into my copy, because I paid enough for it too, didn't I?
1797880	1800600	I think so, didn't it go into Best Hits in Japan, though, eventually?
1800600	1801600	I can't remember.
1801600	1806880	Well, I bought an original for like 50 bucks used, but then again, this is fucking cool.
1806880	1810160	At the time, yeah, it was absolutely worth it.
1810160	1813640	The cool thing about it, though, is that you could use any CD with it, and although the
1813640	1815640	results were somewhat mixed, it was just kind of fun.
1815640	1816640	What did we try to do?
1816640	1817640	We tried Max 300.
1817640	1819200	Yeah, it was better than Dance Factory.
1819200	1820200	That was fun.
1820200	1821200	Picture-writing stuff.
1821200	1822840	No, we did Dropout.
1822840	1824240	That was what we used.
1824240	1825560	We tried to play it to Dropout.
1825560	1826560	Good times.
1826560	1827560	Good times.
1827560	1828560	So I hope this happens.
1828560	1834320	That would be a really fun game for PlayStation Network, certainly better than the Duck game.
1834320	1843600	Well, there is in process, excuse me for a moment while I breathe again, they're talking
1843600	1850360	about a new Dead or Alive, a Mega Man, and Kingdom Hearts for PS3.
1850360	1856660	In the last issue of EGM Magazine, there were these rumors coming out.
1856660	1864880	So Team Ninja has an exclusive for a new Dead or Alive for the PS3, and there's also the
1864880	1872400	notice that Capcom is working on a new, actually not a new Mega Man, they were updating the
1872400	1876320	original Mega Man with new graphics for a download.
1876320	1883120	And Nippon Ichi is working on a new Disgaea for PS3.
1883120	1890440	So it's basically Mega Man, powered up Mega Man, except without a giant head, hopefully.
1890440	1893200	Let's hope.
1893200	1896040	Because he had a giant fucking head in the game.
1896040	1900000	And we're pretty much sure, you know, Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be PS3.
1900000	1906600	Anyways, so there is some new stuff coming out, also from Square, actually.
1906600	1910520	They're talking a little bit about Kingdom Hearts, and of course the next progression
1910520	1915120	for it, apparently, is going to be a portable spin-off and not Kingdom Hearts 3, although
1915120	1918920	I'm assuming Kingdom Hearts 3 is probably in the works as well, but the next game you'll
1918920	1921320	see will be a portable spin-off.
1921320	1926280	And no word exactly what it's going to be, I'm sure we'll find out a little bit more
1926280	1933780	after the whole Square Enix press party or whatever they have in Fan Party.
1933780	1938880	So hopefully we'll hear a little bit more about that, because I know it wasn't a chain
1938880	1942000	of memories or whatever, didn't that suck really bad?
1942000	1944800	Chain of Memories is a different game.
1944800	1953800	I do not recommend playing it on a DS Micro, not DS, the Game Boy Advance Micro, but it
1953800	1958520	wasn't that bad, I'm actually looking forward to the PS2 version.
1958520	1959520	I don't know.
1959520	1963040	They just, don't fuck it up, please.
1963040	1966880	Most people play Kingdom Hearts for the, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memory for the story, not
1966880	1969600	the game.
1969600	1972040	I'm glad they played it for something.
1972040	1979520	Alright, well, last week somebody listened to us, apparently, or somebody had the same
1979520	1984620	idea, because remember when last week we talked about the whole God of War promotional thing
1984620	1988220	in the UK, they had the goat with the head chopped off and all that stuff, remember that?
1988220	1990200	And I said, somebody should email PETA?
1990200	1992320	Well somebody did!
1992320	1995360	Somebody somehow told PETA what was going on, I don't know if that's because of this
1995360	1998640	show or what, I'm sure somebody else had the same idea.
1998640	2003480	But PETA did post in their, I guess, official blog, it looks like it's just one guy that
2003480	2011260	runs it, but they have a blog over at blog.peta.com, somebody actually posted about it, and basically
2011260	2016040	what it came down to is that they sort of said, PETA said they're kind of not going
2016040	2020900	to do anything about it, that it's obviously an idiotic thing, they would not name the
2020900	2026800	game in the blog entry because they have no desire to help them promote it, and they noticed
2026800	2031660	that Sony obviously apologized for it and Sony is recalling the magazine and everything,
2031660	2036520	but PETA was just kind of going, just kind of like shaking their head disapprovingly.
2036520	2039440	But what was interesting is they took a squeak at Jack Thompson in the little blog post,
2039440	2043320	which was kind of cool, because in the blog post the author said, quote, always sided
2043320	2046420	with the video game industry against the Jack Thompsons of the world who are out to make
2046420	2050080	a name for themselves by blaming gamers for all of society's problems.
2050080	2052760	So that was kind of interesting.
2052760	2056860	But unfortunately no big pickets out front of Sony headquarters with topless women saying
2056860	2062880	I'd rather be naked than, you know, look at decapitated goats and all that stuff.
2062880	2064880	Sorry boys.
2064880	2066560	Hi.
2066560	2068160	Hello.
2068160	2078280	Well, you know how Taito had that big problem with Bubble Bobble?
2078280	2080120	You can't get past level 30?
2080120	2082000	No, never heard of it.
2082000	2083000	Rob.
2083000	2084000	Of course.
2084000	2085600	We made fun of it endlessly on this show.
2085600	2095600	Well, it's happened to SNK and Capcom Card Fighter Clash for the DS, yeah, which is funny
2095600	2097600	because my husband bought the game right when it came out.
2097600	2101300	So I'm just wondering if you've hit that point yet, and I'm going to laugh.
2101300	2103200	You just got Bubble Bobbled.
2103200	2109800	Apparently, if you go to the ninth floor of the tower through the second playthrough,
2109800	2112880	the game will crash after you talk to someone named John.
2112880	2118000	You have to fight him to, you know, of course make it past that area so you're pretty much
2118000	2119960	just stuck.
2119960	2127780	No, there is a message from SNK stating that we're going to hear something soon, but nothing
2127780	2130380	as of yet as far as I know.
2130380	2138620	So let's hope that, more than positive, they're going to recall it or do something for it.
2138620	2142360	Is the message going to say something along the lines of, we're really fucking sorry we
2142360	2143800	didn't beta test this game?
2143800	2146840	I mean, because when things like this are announced, it makes me think that the game
2146840	2150640	is so god awful that not even their own internal QA department could play through the ninth
2150640	2151640	floor.
2151640	2154680	I mean, that's seriously the impression that I get about the game, is that if the game
2154680	2159440	is so broken that not even their QA department was interested in playing it that far, what
2159440	2161440	else am I left to think?
2161440	2162440	Oh?
2162440	2164080	Well, it's good enough.
2164080	2168200	I mean, hell, if the first couple levels worked in them, the whole game's probably good.
2168200	2170760	I mean, after all, they're not that much different.
2170760	2171760	I mean, come on.
2171760	2174720	You want me to play through the whole thing?
2174720	2175720	Whatever.
2175720	2180080	Well, news about broken video games makes us a little bit angsty, and you know what
2180080	2181920	that means when we get angsty?
2181920	2183920	People die.
2183920	2193640	It's time for the FUs of the week.
2193640	2196200	Dark Sakura, take it away.
2196200	2207800	You know, FU goes towards certain people in management positions at my unlisted place
2207800	2215560	of employment, and it's not really, you know, again, it's not necessarily a, I'd say it
2215560	2216560	was a misthought.
2216560	2218560	I'll put it that way.
2218560	2222600	Assuming that I don't have enough work already to do with the one thing that I was already
2222600	2223600	doing.
2223600	2227680	True, I get a couple days a month where they don't, you know, open as many assignments
2227680	2235600	to me to finish, and I need extra things to do to keep busy, but I told them right up
2235600	2239160	front, I was like, look, I'm not going to be able to do all this.
2239160	2243120	I'm one person, and I'm sure as hell I'm not going to work overtime, unless you really
2243120	2246680	want me to work overtime and pay me for it, sure, yeah.
2246680	2251180	And true enough, you know, I finally said, you know what, if you're going to do this
2251180	2254040	to me, then I'm just going to let them know when I can't get it all done in one day, and
2254040	2255600	we'll see what they think of that.
2255600	2260680	So finally the realization has dawned, and oh my God, she really is only one person.
2260680	2265320	And while her productivity is amazing, not everybody can do all of this.
2265320	2270280	So yeah, we're going to not let, you know, this employee go nuts and kill everybody in
2270280	2271280	the company.
2271280	2273280	So it's going to take a while.
2273280	2276280	But the FV just goes to the situation.
2276280	2277280	Loki.
2277280	2284920	Uh, FV goes to, I think, my router, because I can't get it to fucking put two 360s together.
2284920	2289440	It's just, one of them wants to work, the other one doesn't, and there's no rhyme or
2289440	2290440	reason to it.
2290440	2293440	It's just, uh-uh, I don't want to work.
2293440	2301840	So I guess I've got to buy a Switch instead of purchasing shit.
2301840	2307440	My FV of the week goes to Survivor, the ride at Great America, where I was at yesterday.
2307440	2309960	We took a trip for Extraverse Sisters.
2309960	2312280	I booked this ride out of the park.
2312280	2313280	I know.
2313280	2317000	First of all, how the hell do you make a ride out of Survivor?
2317000	2318000	It's pretty cheesy, but whatever.
2318000	2320400	Is it where you have to starve yourself and make it?
2320400	2321400	No, no.
2321400	2326040	Okay, you start off the ride, like when you're waiting in the queue, the little line before
2326040	2327760	you actually get on the ride, right?
2327760	2331120	They make you do, when it's your turn to go next, first you have to do this little tribal
2331120	2332120	stomp.
2332120	2334360	You have to do this stupid ass dance.
2334360	2337120	Nobody ever does it, but they say you have to do it, right?
2337120	2340040	And sometimes the little kids will get into it, but that's about it.
2340040	2343520	And if you don't do it, then you're going to get sprayed in the face with water on the
2343520	2344520	ride.
2344520	2348200	Okay, and you get on the ride, and basically what it is, it's this big disc thing with
2348200	2350440	a big tribal mask in the middle, right?
2350440	2354640	It's this big disc thing that goes around like a W-shaped track back and forth, and
2354640	2355640	it spins.
2355640	2356640	So it's kind of fun.
2356640	2357640	I mean, Neil, it's really-
2357640	2359200	It's not something I would hate, is it?
2359200	2360200	I don't think you'd hate it.
2360200	2361200	It's just different.
2361200	2362200	It's certainly not like anything at Disneyland.
2362200	2365000	It's a different type of ride, but it doesn't go upside down or anything.
2365000	2366520	But here's the thing.
2366520	2371080	Sometimes the ride will spray water at you, but at the very end of the ride, I was just
2371080	2372080	in the right spot.
2372080	2375160	There were these huge tiki torches right at the end of the coaster.
2375160	2378280	The thing shot fire in my face.
2378280	2380600	So F.U. is a survivor of the ride for shooting fire at me.
2380600	2382280	That was not funny.
2382280	2387240	And I scream like a little girl, because seriously, Disneyland is one thing when I get on the
2387240	2391640	thrill rides where I'm going upside down and just being twisted up like a pretzel on some
2391640	2395640	of those rides, and getting fire shot in my face on a ride named after a TV show that
2395640	2397600	jumped the shark five years ago.
2397600	2398600	Okay?
2398600	2399600	F.U.
2399600	2402800	I bet you'll do the dance next time now, won't you?
2402800	2403800	Seriously.
2403800	2404800	Hi, Cheryl.
2404800	2405800	We'll teach that fucker a lesson.
2405800	2406800	Jabooroo.
2406800	2409640	I'll do the damn dance next time.
2409640	2412360	Stomp, stomp, stomp.
2412360	2414880	You know seriously what my first words were when I got off the ride?
2414880	2417080	I'm like, Jamie would like this ride because it shoots fire.
2417080	2418640	I think I would.
2418640	2422600	When you said shooting fire, I was like, hey, I like fire.
2422600	2423600	All right.
2423600	2424600	You didn't find it funny.
2424600	2425600	I found it funny as hell.
2425600	2429600	Fuego es muy bien.
2429600	2432480	Fireboma says Skye is used to things being shot in his face.
2432480	2435240	Zing, my second review of the week goes to Fireboma.
2435240	2436240	Congratulations.
2436240	2437240	You're on me.
2437240	2438240	You're on F.U.'s of the week.
2438240	2442960	F.U. to DS Wi-Fi for being so damn temperamental around my router.
2442960	2445960	I know it's not my router's fault if it wants to be so restrictive.
2445960	2447960	It must be Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.
2447960	2451240	Also, F.U. to the new patches that are coming out for WoW.
2451240	2453600	Trying to go on the public test run.
2453600	2455800	Oh my God, I'm lack-tastic.
2455800	2458800	Nothing works in my UI.
2458800	2465520	They've got some serious stuff to fix before they release that publicly.
2465520	2467160	All right.
2467160	2468680	Lots of angst in the studio tonight.
2468680	2472240	You know you're going to get a good show when there's lots of angst in the studio tonight.
2472240	2473240	Let's kill the music.
2473240	2475280	Let's get back to some gaming news.
2475280	2476280	I don't think so.
2476280	2478080	Instead, let's go have ice cream.
2478080	2479880	Ice cream sounds good.
2479880	2480920	Let's have an ice cream podcast.
2480920	2482920	I totally vote for ice cream.
2482920	2483920	Okay.
2483920	2487680	Orange Honors Radio is canceled tonight due to ice cream.
2487680	2489120	Actually, I already had ice cream today.
2489120	2490680	I can't have ice cream for two weeks.
2490680	2491840	We'll have ice cream again.
2491840	2492840	Loki, save us.
2492840	2498280	Okay, well, the only thing that can combat ice cream is T&A and there is-
2498280	2500280	Hey, that sounds great.
2500280	2501280	Winner!
2501280	2503280	I like T&A flavored ice cream.
2503280	2510600	So there's this wonderful game that's being touted as T&A Pong on Kotaku.
2510600	2514920	It's actually from a website, I guess, We Make Money Not Art.
2514920	2521280	And it's, I guess, some woman named Jennifer Choudhuries.
2521280	2526400	She has an intimate game controller and apparently, she says it's like Pong, but it's not really
2526400	2527400	like Pong.
2527400	2529040	It's more like DDR, I would say.
2529040	2536120	The whole game is basically there's, a woman has a bra controller where you, you know,
2536120	2540440	grope her and then the guy has like boxers where she grabs his ass.
2540440	2541560	And you watch the screen.
2541560	2545640	There's like, first there'll be shapes coming up so, you know, you can grab anywhere.
2545640	2549400	Then later on, as you progress through levels, there's shapes with other shapes on them,
2549400	2551480	like star with the circle and stuff.
2551480	2555500	And you have to grab certain parts and stuff and supposedly, it's supposed to make you
2555500	2560520	either, you know, piss off because you lose or go have sex.
2560520	2564400	Personally, it looked very, very, very, very awkward.
2564400	2567080	So this is a game where even when you lose, you win?
2567080	2568080	I guess.
2568080	2572500	But hey, the way I figure it, you know, if you got some chick in bra and panties already
2572500	2576080	and you're playing this game and grabbing her boobs, it can't be that bad of a game.
2576080	2580280	This reminds me of that one boob twirling game they released like two, three years ago.
2580280	2581280	Oh yeah.
2581280	2583400	We had to make them twirl in different patterns.
2583400	2584400	That was a fun game.
2584400	2587400	I'm watching the video on here even though I'm not supposed to.
2587400	2589560	It's really, really stupid.
2589560	2590560	Okay, here we go.
2590560	2592120	I'm going to give the show an explicit tag.
2592120	2593120	You ready?
2593120	2594120	Warning.
2594120	2597160	The show is intended for mature audiences.
2597160	2598160	Okay.
2598160	2602580	Like when you first started talking about this, I kind of picture that maybe the woman
2602580	2609960	like put a wiimote in her twat to navigate the game and it vibrates, right?
2609960	2610960	It's not rez.
2610960	2613480	It is so not rez.
2613480	2615800	Would that be like lesbian pong?
2615800	2621640	I don't think it's like that at all, but, um, I don't know.
2621640	2623520	It's yeah, it's a pretty dumb game.
2623520	2628440	They could really take it further though, but, um, apparently they didn't dark soccer.
2628440	2635160	Would you play lesbian pong when I need the female perspective here on the show for a
2635160	2636160	minute?
2636160	2637160	Yeah.
2637160	2638160	That's a yes.
2638160	2644520	You would score, cut, print, saved archives.
2644520	2645520	All right.
2645520	2646520	That's a wrap.
2646520	2647520	All ours over.
2647520	2648520	We're off to go play games.
2648520	2651160	We're going to, we're off to go create new games for the Wii.
2651160	2653280	Nice knowing you for the past five years.
2653280	2654640	Lesbian pong has ruined this show.
2654640	2655640	Good night.
2655640	2658000	No, but seriously though.
2658000	2661920	They could put like a, what, what they could do is like, I don't know, make some sort of
2661920	2665920	a different game, you know, where they could put more sensors on their bodies or something
2665920	2666920	here.
2666920	2667920	I don't know.
2667920	2668920	No.
2668920	2669920	What they need.
2669920	2670920	Here's what the record.
2670920	2671920	Yeah.
2671920	2676180	But now we have an audio clipper saying yes.
2676180	2677180	So it's, it's done.
2677180	2678180	Okay.
2678180	2680240	Here's what they need to do.
2680240	2684240	And this, this kind of ties in with that really crappy eye of judgment game.
2684240	2688120	They need to have something with the eye toy and the eye of judgment.
2688120	2689120	That's a sex game.
2689120	2690120	There you go.
2690120	2693720	Oh dude, the eye of judgment on a sex game.
2693720	2694720	I get it.
2694720	2697360	And the Wiimote or, or six axis, right?
2697360	2702560	Cause you know, six axis can detect how much you're rocking the boat or, but see then again
2702560	2705800	though, you, they have all the USB ports so you can just, you know, hook it up with your
2705800	2712120	usual USB powered like vibrators and shit and they'll just, you know, there you go.
2712120	2719720	Total sex package never will happen because it's a dumb idea who the fuck would set up
2719720	2721620	all this shit to have sex.
2721620	2722620	That's just retarded.
2722620	2727040	But then again though, they have all those sex board games and I don't know if that could
2727040	2728040	be fun.
2728040	2732040	Um, I wanted to say this real quick, actually, um, the talk about the brown eye of judgment
2732040	2737440	actually reminded me, um, I got a private message on my Twitter from a PK or Uno who
2737440	2742820	was telling me about another game, um, called Aquarian Age Alternative and he says this
2742820	2743960	game is actually kind of fun.
2743960	2747480	It's a Japanese arcade game that's actually kind of like the eye of judgment.
2747480	2751180	You place real cards on a playing service and you watch as the game senses them and
2751180	2752540	react accordingly.
2752540	2753880	So I just kind of sent him a message back.
2753880	2755160	I'm like, okay, but is it any fun?
2755160	2758980	And he says, yeah, it's actually kind of fun because he said, yes, I have.
2758980	2759980	It's pretty awesome.
2759980	2763120	He says there's a lot of strategy and quick thinking needed and it does sometimes get
2763120	2765080	pretty chaotic.
2765080	2766080	That's awesome.
2766080	2769600	And it proves once again, Sony didn't come up with an original idea.
2769600	2771680	Way to go copying something.
2771680	2772680	I don't know.
2772680	2777640	I don't know how old this game is, but I hope, um, I'm going to just pimp his vox because
2777640	2779560	he has pictures and stuff all over his vox.
2779560	2784720	So if you want to see this as PK or Uno dot vox.com, P K E R U N O dot vox.com and he
2784720	2786800	has this whole thing, Aquarian Age Alternative.
2786800	2787800	Obviously it's out.
2787800	2790600	Eye of judgment is not out there for this one came out first.
2790600	2798320	So they try way to go Sony thinking that we wouldn't find the thing that you copied,
2798320	2804560	but there you go proves that you're still not original and it's a still a dumb idea.
2804560	2809480	There you have it.
2809480	2811040	I'm curious to play it.
2811040	2812640	You know, I'll try anything once.
2812640	2818640	Anyway, uh, other famous Japanese arcade games, uh, may or may not be coming to the U S uh,
2818640	2824560	two DX gold beat mania two DX gold, of course, uh, was tested previously and got some great
2824560	2826560	reception from the music game community.
2826560	2830000	Now the challenge is just getting people to pick it up.
2830000	2833200	So I'll leave it to a user on Bemani style to try and get the word out.
2833200	2836680	And they are trying to, uh, have a campaign, uh, to contact.
2836680	2840080	They did a really good job of really breaking this down.
2840080	2841820	How do I contact Dave and busters?
2841820	2845880	How do I contact tilt arcade game work, six flags, and really break down that we want
2845880	2847840	to see beat mania two DX golden arcades.
2847840	2850320	I mean, it tells you what to say and everything.
2850320	2855560	So, uh, hats off to this user, Brazil, the end, uh, for, and I hope I didn't horribly
2855560	2858200	mispronounce that, but hats off to you for breaking that all down.
2858200	2861520	And I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to this program because that used
2861520	2863840	to be our forte a couple of years ago.
2863840	2871080	So definitely check out the money styles forums, check out the forums, don't let golf land
2871080	2872080	have it.
2872080	2873080	Cause they'll break it.
2873080	2874080	Absolutely.
2874080	2875080	Okay.
2875080	2877920	And for some reason, your mic's not picking up dark soccer.
2877920	2878920	Is it?
2878920	2879920	That's because it wasn't on.
2879920	2880920	All right.
2880920	2881920	There you go.
2881920	2882920	Yeah.
2882920	2884480	What I said was don't let golf and have it cause you know, they're going to fuck it up.
2884480	2887960	Uh, check out the music game discussion forums on a bimanistyle.com.
2887960	2893040	Well, speaking of information that came out on a forum, there's a rumor going on that,
2893040	2897880	um, the DDR supernova two North American field test is canceled.
2897880	2903320	Um, it was posted by ride 19 on Aaron and Japan's forums.
2903320	2905920	Oh, you said, Oh, you saying what's fake.
2905920	2906920	Oh, okay.
2906920	2908760	Now, Oh, I thought you said the post is fake.
2908760	2910760	You're talking about something else.
2910760	2911760	No, uh, sorry.
2911760	2912760	Okay.
2912760	2913760	Don't do that to me.
2913760	2914760	Uh, anyway, no.
2914760	2918160	Um, well this guy, I think somebody that he works for the arcade that they were going
2918160	2919560	to test it at or something.
2919560	2922980	So I guess this guy would know, but that kind of sucks.
2922980	2926920	You know, I honestly, myself don't put too much stock in something that I read on a forum,
2926920	2931040	um, until I see something official put out by, by the company.
2931040	2935720	So the only reason I would give a little credit to it is because they have done location tests
2935720	2938040	there before that, that same arcade.
2938040	2943640	So, you know, I'm, I, I, I was willing to believe it, but I do wonder to myself, did
2943640	2947840	Konami pull it back to maybe further tweak the game?
2947840	2951880	Maybe it wasn't ready to be tested cause you know, the internet is cruel and the game better
2951880	2954160	be damn good or the internet will tear it apart.
2954160	2960360	Well, there was also a quote on here, um, apparently a quote from maybe someone at Konami
2960360	2966960	because again, this is on a message board, um, stating that, um, in order to prevent
2966960	2972920	dissatisfaction of SN2, we have canceled the North American SN2 test site as it may result
2972920	2977320	in creating a better dance game.
2977320	2978320	That sounds fishy.
2978320	2980760	I don't know about that one.
2980760	2981760	I don't know.
2981760	2982760	I could be wrong.
2982760	2983760	All right.
2983760	2987060	Cause usually why would a company admit that, Oh, the game kind of sucks right now.
2987060	2989200	We're going to, we're going to go back and tweak it.
2989200	2990200	I don't know about that one.
2990200	2991200	I'm starting over.
2991200	2994400	See you in 10 years.
2994400	2996280	We hope you have a nice play again.
2996280	2997600	All right.
2997600	3002280	They need to have, they need to just completely make the dance pads more durable.
3002280	3004400	Ditter fans are going to have to wait a little long for their ditter.
3004400	3006400	That's that's the, that's what the story is.
3006400	3007400	You can diddle later.
3007400	3009760	I mean, didder later anyways.
3009760	3014120	So certain, um, there's a few websites out there that got, you know, all excited after
3014120	3021040	seeing an IGN mock-up of a guitar hero three controller, which I might add that is completely
3021040	3022520	fake by the way.
3022520	3026100	And it's no indication of what it's actually going to look like.
3026100	3031440	They have, you know, basically a picture of a white guitar with the Wii remote in the
3031440	3032440	neck of the guitar.
3032440	3036240	That's, you know, just like before when they mocked up what the classic controller would
3036240	3040120	look like completely mocked up.
3040120	3044100	You know why I felt that was fake when I first looked at it is because of the way the Wiimote
3044100	3045440	is strapped into that control.
3045440	3049120	I mean, because basically what they have there is they have this guitar with a hand, you
3049120	3051120	know, with the, what do they call it?
3051120	3053320	What do they call the long part of that?
3053320	3054320	The neck?
3054320	3055320	The neck.
3055320	3056320	Okay.
3056320	3057320	Like they have the Wii thing snapping into the neck.
3057320	3061720	But the thing is, is that if the Wiimote were to snap in, it'd break the infrared and the
3061720	3063320	plugs are on the bottom.
3063320	3065200	You can't, you wouldn't snap it in like that.
3065200	3068280	You'd have to snap it in either on the bottom of the guitar or something.
3068280	3070860	You can't push it in and have it just snap.
3070860	3071860	It wouldn't work.
3071860	3073240	It'd be too difficult to get in there.
3073240	3074240	Yeah.
3074240	3079120	And besides, if I remember correctly, I think they've already said that if, when they do
3079120	3084800	release this, there's actually going to be a guitar that's sold separately that'll hook
3084800	3087200	up via USB or something like that.
3087200	3090520	So sorry, but that's not what it's going to be.
3090520	3093400	It's not going to be something that you strap the Wiimote into.
3093400	3096760	It's not like you have to plug the Wiimote into everything.
3096760	3097760	Exactly.
3097760	3101600	And I mean, I don't know.
3101600	3103240	It's going to be Guitar Hero 3.
3103240	3105280	It's just going to be on another fucking console.
3105280	3106280	So woohoo.
3106280	3107280	I know.
3107280	3110480	It's like you've never played this game before.
3110480	3115720	Well, also my thought is that it wouldn't look like the Gibson guitars because the Gibson
3115720	3117020	ones were heard on the PS2.
3117020	3121960	For the Xbox 360, we have, what was it, not the Thunderbird, but what was the other Gibson
3121960	3123200	guitar that it looks like?
3123200	3124200	Flying V?
3124200	3126600	No, it doesn't look like a Flying V. But I was going to say, if they were going to do
3126600	3129680	it for a different console, wouldn't they have done another guitar like the Flying V
3129680	3131760	or maybe one in the shape of the Les Paul or something?
3131760	3132760	Good thought.
3132760	3136560	The only thing that would be cool is if this whole guitar rotated, kind of like ZZ Top,
3136560	3140300	and then they could have cues where you swing the guitar around type thing.
3140300	3143960	Is it too much to ask for one freaking guitar to work on all consoles?
3143960	3144960	No.
3144960	3145960	They're all USB.
3145960	3147420	Why can't they?
3147420	3149240	Why can't they make one universal guitar?
3149240	3150240	That's right.
3150240	3151240	That's what I wanted.
3151240	3152240	I know why.
3152240	3153240	Money.
3153240	3155160	Because they get to sell you fucking more guitars.
3155160	3156160	Alright.
3156160	3161960	Well, the Queens of the Stone Age, you might know them, they're a band, and they have basically
3161960	3166360	confirmed that they are going to be in some games.
3166360	3171120	Basically I guess there's a promo ad going around for the band and it's confirming that
3171120	3175440	they are going to be appearing in Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.
3175440	3176440	What song?
3176440	3179560	Don't know, but you know the Queens of the Stone Age are going to be in the games.
3179560	3183300	By the way, they're also going to be in Madden 08 and NASCAR 08 if you are so inclined to
3183300	3185280	play those games instead of Guitar Hero.
3185280	3186280	Yay Tracks!
3186280	3187280	That's right.
3187280	3188280	Yay Tracks!
3188280	3193080	And again, I like Junkie XL, so they always have a good Junkie XL track in there.
3193080	3194720	And who doesn't love Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend?
3194720	3196120	Oh wait, no one.
3196120	3197120	Alright.
3197120	3198120	Nellie does.
3198120	3199280	But she doesn't count.
3199280	3200280	Your wife is weird.
3200280	3201280	Alright, anyway.
3201280	3203160	She's watched that video so many fucking times.
3203160	3206120	I've never even heard it nor seen the video.
3206120	3208120	I don't know why she likes the crappy Girlfriend song.
3208120	3209120	Here it is.
3209120	3210120	Here it is.
3210120	3211760	Hey Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind.
3211760	3215040	Hey Mickey, just replace the word Mickey with Girlfriend and that's pretty much the song.
3215040	3216040	Oh.
3216040	3217040	Alright.
3217040	3221560	Uh, it's time for Jamie Tracks, or in this case, Jamie Websites, because Jamie likes
3221560	3226000	to surf the internet up and down every week and find a favorite website of hers to share
3226000	3227000	with y'all.
3227000	3233560	Here it is, Dark Soccer's website of the week.
3233560	3241080	Today's website of the week is, um, it's brought to us by the Adult Swim, which normally I'd
3241080	3243800	be like, Adult Swim, meh.
3243800	3250200	It's great, it's called Bible Fight, it's a Flash game, where it's like Street Fighter
3250200	3251200	with Jesus.
3251200	3256080	I actually played a little bit of this game last night, I should have included that in
3256080	3260040	my gaming week, and I battled Jesus vs. Satan, it was epic.
3260040	3264440	But what's great is that they have special moves, like Jesus throws his thorny crown.
3264440	3265440	It's awesome.
3265440	3269400	You have Jesus, Eve, Mary, Moses, Noah, and Satan.
3269400	3271920	Satan looks kinda hot.
3271920	3276400	Wow, get dressed with cards and letters to Jamie at Orange Laundry Radio.
3276400	3280920	Eve looks kinda naked.
3280920	3283160	How can folks get to this website?
3283160	3288680	The website is adultswim.com slash games slash biblefight, that's one word, index.html.
3288680	3290600	There you go.
3290600	3298200	So I'm gonna have Eve versus Mary, so I can see if she's naked.
3298200	3299200	She's got issues.
3299200	3305600	No, this is great, she has a snake on one arm and little leaves.
3305600	3309800	The typical depiction of Eve, where there's always, Mary looks like she's got PMS.
3309800	3313760	There's always like an animal or a fig leaf or something just conveniently placed over
3313760	3315260	their naughty bits.
3315260	3317240	So it's always kind of interesting.
3317240	3320680	She's fighting with a halo over her head and fucking baby Jesus.
3320680	3326560	She has 68 sets, and baby Jesus is a weapon, because that'd be awesome.
3326560	3327560	Wow.
3327560	3329560	We're gonna get the hate mail tonight.
3329560	3332120	GS68 says, Westboro will sue.
3332120	3333720	Hey, we didn't create it, right?
3333720	3334720	Adult Swim did.
3334720	3337000	Go take up your issues with them.
3337000	3342240	Anyways, so the NBA has just launched into Second Life.
3342240	3345120	Who cares?
3345120	3348640	Apparently a lot of people are on Second Life, like it's fucking real world or something,
3348640	3349640	you know.
3349640	3352260	Ooh, the NBA's on there now.
3352260	3354840	So I mean, they're in the real world too.
3354840	3362680	But apparently you can go there and play horse and basketball and suck it up really bad as
3362680	3364800	well.
3364800	3366480	I don't know.
3366480	3373440	I'm not surprised that more people make money off of this Second Life, but it's interesting
3373440	3374440	nonetheless.
3374440	3376360	I guess you can play horse and get pelted by penises.
3376360	3379400	Jesus, keep the First Life out of Second Life.
3379400	3381200	Damn, come on.
3381200	3382200	Pretty soon people are gonna get...
3382200	3385280	You should put that on a bumper sticker.
3385280	3386280	Pretty soon.
3386280	3391440	Seriously, that's a pretty good tagline for us, because you're a Second Life player, right?
3391440	3392760	From time to time, yeah.
3392760	3396880	I thought Second Life was just where people go to have virtual furry sex or something,
3396880	3397880	I mean.
3397880	3398880	Not like to play basketball.
3398880	3399880	Someone made the TARDIS.
3399880	3401480	I'm virtual ass, Loki.
3401480	3406640	I'm gonna go into Second Life, I'm gonna play basketball, and then your friend goes, fuck
3406640	3412040	that, I'm going outside and playing basketball there, where I don't have to worry about being
3412040	3413760	pelted with flying penises.
3413760	3417520	Jiranami, response?
3417520	3418520	What the...
3418520	3421480	Don't go play in a sandbox, then.
3421480	3424440	You don't get that shit if you play in a sandbox zone.
3424440	3433160	Okay, so don't go playing in a sandbox, because there's a virtual sandbox in Second Life.
3433160	3439960	If I had that wah wah wah wah sound effect on this program, I would have just used it.
3439960	3444800	I don't get it, I mean, what the hell do you do in Second Life?
3444800	3445960	Stop.
3445960	3447840	Try to find a life?
3447840	3449640	No, I don't know.
3449640	3452400	I imagine there's lots of people, you know, I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk.
3452400	3454440	Look at my cube I just made, it's so awesome!
3454440	3457020	Would you buy it for $1000?
3457020	3459640	I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk, okay?
3459640	3462600	But you know, I guess people play it because it's fun.
3462600	3464880	That's what games are, they're fun.
3464880	3465960	Furry sex is fun.
3465960	3470000	Well, if World of Warcraft weren't set in some sort of fictional medieval time, I'm
3470000	3473520	sure the NBA would be there, too.
3473520	3475040	Point of Second Life is simple.
3475040	3476600	Step one, fly around.
3476600	3480360	Step two, do shit.
3480360	3481840	Comments from Chatroom.
3481840	3484440	The Rob D. makes some comments.
3484440	3487380	Is Tim Hardaway there to hate you if you're gay?
3487380	3489720	In Second Life, making fun of some earlier controversy.
3489720	3493560	Rob D. says, is Dirk Nowitz, I'm totally not going to pronounce this, you're going to see
3493560	3495400	how much I totally follow sports.
3495400	3502040	The Rob D. says, and is Dirk Nowitzki there to suck in Second Life?
3502040	3505440	Kevin the Groove says, in Second Life, you waste your first life.
3505440	3506440	Duh!
3506440	3511440	There you go, responses from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
3511440	3515360	This is a little more interesting of a sports story, I think, I don't know.
3515360	3521080	Pro football players will be training with Electronic Arts Madden technology.
3521080	3524680	The same technology that's used in Electronic Arts popular Madden games is now being used
3524680	3529320	to create a training simulator for professional football players.
3529320	3534220	XOS Technologies is licensing the TDT engine from EA Sports to use in what's called the
3534220	3537440	Play Action Simulator.
3537440	3541960	The play action of family of products addresses team demands to uniquely and effectively teach
3541960	3547640	new plays and game plans, says Bob Simmons, who is the XOS Coaching Solutions President.
3547640	3551120	As the current provider of coaching analysis and game planning solutions to more than 200
3551120	3555840	NFL and NCAA football teams, XOS thoroughly understands how teams prepare weekly for an
3555840	3557160	upcoming opponent.
3557160	3561680	The simulator is built on our TDT engine, which utilizes the same technologies and gameplay
3561680	3567920	found in our popular Madden NFL game franchise, said the general manager of EA Tiburon, Steve
3567920	3568920	Chang.
3568920	3573800	That's kind of cool, if you're a Madden fan, I bet that's pretty exciting.
3573800	3579600	My response would be, what about those poor players who train and then end up with the
3579600	3581400	really low ranking in Madden?
3581400	3584820	You know Madden ranks all the real players and that's got to suck if you're the lowest
3584820	3585820	ranked one.
3585820	3590620	I seem to remember a story, either on this show or another show, when Madden 07 first
3590620	3594840	came out about the poor guy who was the lowest ranked player in the game.
3594840	3602600	I guess you didn't use this training simulator enough, who knows?
3602600	3603600	You know what?
3603600	3604600	What?
3604600	3607600	What good is an actual simulator anyway?
3607600	3612120	It didn't help me become a better driver, I just played Ridge Racer.
3612120	3617560	I was going to say, you have driving simulators, cops do cop scene simulators, I don't know,
3617560	3620200	simulators are there to simulate the real thing.
3620200	3624080	What good is that going to do versus actual real experience?
3624080	3627040	Well keep in mind there's a lot of strategy in football too.
3627040	3631520	Not just the running around and stuff, maybe it has to do with strategy and processing
3631520	3632520	it out.
3632520	3633520	Do you just play Tecmo Bowl?
3633520	3636720	Yeah I do, Tecmo Bowl, I wanted the engine built on Tecmo Bowl.
3636720	3637720	Anyway.
3637720	3638720	We can agree on that.
3638720	3640920	There is another, why am I getting all the rumors?
3640920	3647760	There's another rumor floating about that Nintendo of America is going to relocate.
3647760	3652460	It was actually posted on Kotaku that employees were told on Thursday that they had until
3652460	3659400	June 1st to choose to willingly relocate or accept a severance package and the sites for
3659400	3664400	new offices are rumored to be San Francisco and New York.
3664400	3666440	I'm hoping for San Francisco.
3666440	3671480	Me too, because I could have applied for all kinds of jobs, and in fact I actually was
3671480	3675080	going to apply for a number of Nintendo jobs when I thought I was moving to Washington,
3675080	3677440	but now I'm not gonna.
3677440	3680520	I want jobs there.
3680520	3689120	Anyways, so we have GameStop over here and of course they have Game over in the UK, and
3689120	3694800	apparently Game has bought out its competitor, GameStation, for the equivalent of $100 million
3694800	3704120	US, approximately 74 million pounds, or euros, I can't tell.
3704120	3706840	And now it will increase.
3706840	3711920	So wait, GameStop is to game as GameStation is to EB Games?
3711920	3714560	Something like that, yeah.
3714560	3724220	So now they are about over 200 storefronts and the largest chain in Europe.
3724220	3725400	So that's kind of interesting.
3725400	3729680	I guess GameStop is over there too.
3729680	3734160	There had been some speculation that GameStop had actually purchased them, but they didn't,
3734160	3739200	so you snooze you lose.
3739200	3741160	So does this make a game now a monopoly?
3741160	3744320	Because that's what a lot of people are saying is that, oh my gosh, they have a monopoly,
3744320	3748360	and even Kevin the Groove in chat says, what the hell, game is actually now a monopoly.
3748360	3752520	I wouldn't say it's a monopoly, but it's pretty much as close to a monopoly as GameStop is
3752520	3753520	over here.
3753520	3758680	But GameStop, maybe that's the same perception as in Europe, is that GameStop does compete
3758680	3765160	with Best Buy and Walmart and online and the big box stores that carry more than just games,
3765160	3767160	you know what I mean?
3767160	3768160	That's where their competition is now.
3768160	3771080	It's not like they're the only game store on the face of the earth, so I don't know.
3771080	3775960	Because when I get pissed at GameStop, I go to, either I go to GameCrazy or because that's
3775960	3779840	kind of far, I'll go to Best Buy.
3779840	3781120	But I don't know.
3781120	3784120	My friend had a real horrible experience at Best Buy last week, and now I'm thinking I
3784120	3785120	may not go there anymore.
3785120	3786120	Fries.
3786120	3787120	This is bad.
3787120	3788120	Fries, I could do.
3788120	3789120	I could do fries.
3789120	3790120	I like fries.
3790120	3791760	What are you hanging out over there, Drunami?
3791760	3793760	You have a problem with fries?
3793760	3794760	Shitty service?
3794760	3795760	Yeah, it's got shitty service.
3795760	3797360	Sorry to hear that.
3797360	3798360	Why is it shitty service?
3798360	3802120	I've had stuff that's like gone bad, went back there, and they're like, eh, whatever.
3802120	3803120	Least it's cheap.
3803120	3805120	And then they'll just give me a new one.
3805120	3806120	All right.
3806120	3810000	Well, anyhow, moving on to another story.
3810000	3811000	This is interesting.
3811000	3812720	This story somewhat struck a chord.
3812720	3817560	I don't know about you guys, but this is really big in the news this week about a Chinese
3817560	3821840	student who was attending Clements High School, and of course because he's a high school student,
3821840	3824720	they don't give us his name, but he was removed from the high school.
3824720	3828180	This is located in Texas in the town of Fort Benz.
3828180	3829180	Parents were complaining.
3829180	3834960	He recreated the school grounds in a game, which I believe was Counter Strike, and he
3834960	3837760	uploaded the map and all his friends were playing in it.
3837760	3841560	And basically, he now has to go to an alternate education school.
3841560	3844960	The police called him a terroristic threat, and so on and so on.
3844960	3848880	Of course, you can't help but think this is all partially due to the Columbines and the
3848880	3850440	Virginia Techs of the world.
3850440	3856280	But the reason why this struck a chord with me is that, okay, when I go back to 10 years
3856280	3863360	ago, 1996, right, a little more than 10 years ago, okay, my freshman year of college in
3863360	3865120	the college dorms.
3865120	3868360	The game that was all the rage was Duke Nukem 3-D.
3868360	3872720	We would play Duke Nukem 3-D all freaking night long, doing the modem thing, running
3872720	3876720	because in the dorms you're all right next to each other, but you all have separate phone
3876720	3878400	lines, because you have to do modem.
3878400	3882640	There wasn't really the internet so much back then as there was modem play.
3882640	3886920	We would run back and forth between the rooms and see who's where and who's doing what,
3886920	3887920	and it was really fun.
3887920	3892440	But the point is, map editors came out, and what was the first map we tried to make at
3892440	3893440	Duke Nukem?
3893440	3896840	We tried to recreate our dorm in Duke Nukem because we thought it would be funny.
3896840	3901680	Of course, I tried to recreate Roundtable to play Duke Nukem 3-D in Roundtable, but
3901680	3904000	it doesn't mean I'm going to go shoot up the place.
3904000	3907880	It's because it's a place you're familiar, you're like, damn, you're sitting there bored
3907880	3910320	or whatever in high school and you're like, damn, this would be fun to run around and
3910320	3913920	play paintball in or something like that, but you can't actually do that, so you create
3913920	3915680	a map that's familiar to you and you go and play.
3915680	3919500	It's just like if you recreated your mall or something like that.
3919500	3923920	The problem is these people are too fucking scared of everything that they immediately
3923920	3931480	think, oh my god, it's Counter-Strike, therefore he must be a terrorist, and I heard the rumors
3931480	3933080	also because he's Asian.
3933080	3935440	D.V. in chat says he actually went to jail.
3935440	3936680	There was an update on the story.
3936680	3937680	Thanks, D.V.
3937680	3939140	That's so stupid.
3939140	3940400	What crime did he commit?
3940400	3941960	Seriously, what crime did he commit?
3941960	3943640	Well, here's what I'm thinking.
3943640	3947600	Is there a component of this we don't know?
3947600	3950440	Why did the parents complain just about a map?
3950440	3955480	My parents thought I was doing homework, they didn't even know I was playing Duke Nukem.
3955480	3956480	You know why?
3956480	3960600	They wanted to be the fucking people that saw 9-11 coming and stopped it.
3960600	3961600	That's what they wanted to be.
3961600	3964080	They said, oh look, he's recreated a map.
3964080	3965800	It's just like that Virginia Tech shooting.
3965800	3966800	Let's get the guy.
3966800	3968200	This is what I'm curious about.
3968200	3972880	Was there something else that we don't know that the video game blogs aren't talking about?
3972880	3974880	Well, he did have a hammer.
3974880	3976680	You know what he could do with that hammer?
3976680	3977680	He could hammer shit.
3977680	3978680	Like people's skulls.
3978680	3979680	Did he make a threat?
3979680	3981800	Did he make a threat months ago?
3981800	3986520	Was there something about his demeanor?
3986520	3989580	I'm stopping to think there's got to be something else.
3989580	3991800	Are we really this trigger happy?
3991800	3992920	No pun intended.
3992920	3997080	Are we really this trigger happy to arrest people because I'm thinking like, I did this,
3997080	3998080	you did this.
3998080	4003380	I mean, I don't know, Drunami's raising his hand because they're familiar places and for
4003380	4005040	me it was just kind of funny.
4005040	4008880	Wouldn't it be funny to put stripper sprites in your dorm room?
4008880	4009880	That's funny.
4009880	4010880	I did it in Unreal.
4010880	4012180	We were playing laser tag.
4012180	4017480	I play video games and shoot people a lot in video games.
4017480	4020440	I am not actually going to shoot a real person.
4020440	4022820	I'm a smart, intelligent person who knows the difference.
4022820	4027160	And even still 99.99% of the population is like me.
4027160	4029040	Playing Counter Strike does not make you a killer.
4029040	4030960	It doesn't even teach you how to shoot a gun.
4030960	4033120	I mean, it's a video game.
4033120	4036680	It'd be as bad as saying that Pac-Man would make you do drugs.
4036680	4038040	I mean, come on.
4038040	4040040	It's so ridiculous.
4040040	4044520	And I would really like to know what the hell they arrested them on because making a map
4044520	4048600	of your school is not a crime anywhere.
4048600	4051080	So I don't know what they did.
4051080	4055360	And you know, if they found guns or, you know, a cache of weapons or something like that,
4055360	4056600	then that's a different story.
4056600	4058320	But they didn't.
4058320	4060840	So you know, what the fuck?
4060840	4065200	You know, I want to know, I hope to hell that they get their, you know, what's coming to
4065200	4066200	them.
4066200	4069680	I hope that they sue this school for a whole lot of fucking money.
4069680	4071160	Well, we'll see.
4071160	4074880	I mean, again, I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt that there may be a component
4074880	4076560	that we don't know about.
4076560	4078040	But yeah, I don't know.
4078040	4080160	Not happy so far.
4080160	4081160	We'll see.
4081160	4086400	All right, so if you have a comment, if you have something you want to share, email us.
4086400	4089960	Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com and pretty soon we'll be going into Part B of the program
4089960	4092000	and in Part B we'll get to tonight's mailbag.
4092000	4094200	But in the meantime, more gaming news.
4094200	4100240	Well, for anyone who likes their MMOs and is playing City of Heroes, Issue 9 is now
4100240	4101240	released.
4101240	4102240	It's called Breakthrough.
4102240	4108680	It has a new feature called the Invention System that lets you salvage ingredients and
4108680	4114880	recipes from your enemies and turn them into items for yourself or things that you can
4114880	4117160	sell.
4117160	4123640	You can also get different sets of equipment, things to boost your abilities.
4123640	4126160	There's also new sets of wings.
4126160	4131880	There's angel, demon, dragon, burned bone, bat, cherub, insect, tech, and fairy wings.
4131880	4136800	So different missions, different stuff going on is supposed to give you a lot more to do
4136800	4138600	instead of just fight.
4138600	4141280	All right.
4141280	4145040	City of Heroes is, again, one of those games on my big list of games I would like to play
4145040	4147320	but I just don't find the time to play them.
4147320	4148640	But I bet City of Heroes is a lot of fun.
4148640	4149640	Have you ever played that?
4149640	4150640	I know you were talking about that.
4150640	4151640	No, I want to.
4151640	4153240	I was going to try a demo.
4153240	4154240	Some point.
4154240	4155240	All right.
4155240	4160640	Well, at least I'll have this thing waiting for me whenever I finally play the damn game.
4160640	4163120	Something interesting to come out.
4163120	4164120	It's kind of neat.
4164120	4168700	It's a dance pad for DDR type games or music rhythm games.
4168700	4170360	That's using lasers.
4170360	4174920	Instead of the normal pressure sensors or push button switches and stuff, this one actually
4174920	4175920	uses lasers.
4175920	4179960	So if you cut the beam, it counts as a button press.
4179960	4184640	It's the brand new laser dance matrix, not a pad.
4184640	4187560	And what's actually kind of neat about it is it wouldn't really break down, especially
4187560	4193540	since you're not really stepping on the switches and wearing that stuff down.
4193540	4199680	Not available yet, although they're saying that they're going to be constructing them
4199680	4201460	kind of soon.
4201460	4208680	And right now you can check it out on apply-sciences.net and they've got a little bit of information
4208680	4211160	on that and they're going to be creating those very soon.
4211160	4212160	I think it's cool.
4212160	4216340	I mean, definitely they should actually kind of do this with the arcade games.
4216340	4220840	It would probably be a whole lot less teching of the pads.
4220840	4223960	I never even thought of this idea and it seems brilliant.
4223960	4226320	How can this fail unless the laser goes dead?
4226320	4235320	Seriously, there's no way for a button press to fail at all unless you just didn't step
4235320	4236320	far enough into the pad.
4236320	4237600	Or you kick a laser.
4237600	4238600	I don't understand.
4238600	4240040	How could Blu-ray fail?
4240040	4242200	Shut up.
4242200	4243200	This is different.
4243200	4244400	I can give you a couple of examples.
4244400	4246240	There's not competing laser technology.
4246240	4247840	Well, maybe there is, but you know what I mean.
4247840	4248840	I'm joking.
4248840	4253840	Laser is a laser.
4253840	4257680	Well I would definitely be interested in checking this out, but how expensive will one of these
4257680	4258680	things be?
4258680	4260280	I imagine it's got to be pretty pricey, wouldn't they?
4260280	4263320	They haven't said yet, but I mean it doesn't look like too much.
4263320	4265920	Of course the cost is really going to be coming from the laser diodes.
4265920	4269440	But then again, like pocket lasers cost like nothing.
4269440	4273560	I use a pocket because I'm a trainer during the day, so I have a pocket laser that I use
4273560	4276000	to point at the board.
4276000	4277000	That didn't cost anything.
4277000	4279080	I think you get those 99 cent stores now.
4279080	4283420	The only thing I could see that there would be a problem with is if you did happen to
4283420	4284540	bump the laser or something.
4284540	4289820	If it's not in a very protective housing, you could un-align it and then there's some
4289820	4293920	calibration issues or maybe light interference from other things.
4293920	4300520	But if it's able to detect a certain wavelength of light or something like that, then it probably
4300520	4301680	would work pretty well.
4301680	4302840	I don't know.
4302840	4306200	Hitstun in chat says, doesn't anybody else here remember the Sega Activator?
4306200	4307200	It sucked ass.
4307200	4308200	Did that run on lasers?
4308200	4309200	That's all infrared though.
4309200	4310360	That's infrared.
4310360	4311600	Infrared's different, right?
4311600	4316960	Infrared's low frequency and it's not exactly a beam, it's more of just kind of a light
4316960	4317960	source almost.
4317960	4322200	It's like the Para-Para Paradise Pack.
4322200	4323200	Or the Wii, right?
4323200	4324200	Isn't that a little Wii thing?
4324200	4325200	This is on TV?
4325200	4326200	Isn't that infrared?
4326200	4327200	Yeah, it's infrared as well.
4327200	4331560	Why the fuck they don't have a calibration thing on that is beyond me.
4331560	4333480	Come on, Nintendo.
4333480	4335200	It makes sense.
4335200	4339880	Now our chat room is full of laser cats jokes as well.
4339880	4340880	Everything from that sketch.
4340880	4344160	As you know, we've talked about laser cats the game on the program before.
4344160	4348880	The one thing that will definitively end the next gen war will be the console that can
4348880	4353760	get laser cats the game as an exclusive will be the winner of the next gen war in the OLR
4353760	4354760	book.
4354760	4358280	Frickin' laser beans on some frickin' cats, is that too hard to ask?
4358280	4361080	What if it's like the PlayStation 2?
4361080	4364880	Then the PlayStation 2 wins the next gen war.
4364880	4365880	Don't buy any of them.
4365880	4367880	Keep your PS2 and have laser cats.
4367880	4369680	Game Boy Advance.
4369680	4370680	Seriously.
4370680	4373520	Whoever gets laser cats wins.
4373520	4376520	You're a winner for listening to Orange Lounge Radio, but we are going to take a break here
4376520	4377640	on Orange Lounge Radio.
4377640	4382800	For those of you listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in
4382800	4386880	a couple days with our part B. This way we spread the OLR love throughout the week.
4386880	4389540	Those of you listening live don't have to wait quite as long.
4389540	4402720	We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
