14094	25821	Tonight, May 6, 2007, another DS game has the Bubble Bobble curse of brokenness, Microsoft locks down on region control, and an old Commodore 64 classic returns to the Nintendo Wii.
31590	35352	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35392	39975	We are that video game podcast dedicated to gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle.
40035	41136	My name is Rob Roberts.
41216	44678	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
45079	45519	Hi.
46319	48081	How are you doing, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers?
49281	49702	Hi.
50882	52704	Alright, we'll leave it at that then, I guess.
53104	55906	No, I'm goofy.
56106	56746	Did you have a good week?
57667	58067	Sort of.
58267	59788	The parts that I wasn't at work were okay.
60629	61049	That's good.
61661	66463	I will when I quit, because then I'll be working full-time as a massage therapist, which means I'll be working 13 hours a week, making $60,000.
66643	67383	Shut up, don't rub it in.
83692	91897	I love my job, I do, but, you know, that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy, like, you know, it's a very exhausting job, what I do, so, you know, I enjoy that time when I get to come home.
92217	99081	And even massage therapy, I know that's really exhausting, because I remember when you were doing your test thing on me, you were, like, breaking out in a sweat when you were done.
99101	99541	Yeah.
99561	100742	And I was just like, all you did was talk.
100802	102042	It doesn't matter how cold it is.
102283	103963	It was just because you're so hot and sexy.
104144	106985	There's Tech Master Loki with his smart-ass mouth as usual.
107045	107505	Hi, Loki.
107966	108366	Hello.
108886	110167	Look at my wrist, you see?
111248	114549	I have swelling on my wrist again.
115070	123793	I know part of it was because I was so hot and sexy, but I did not know that DarkSakura touching my butt would make her break out in a sweat.
123873	125134	I'm going to go ahead and say this.
125774	132677	Actually, giving an hour massage is an aerobic workout as well as strength training.
132977	135838	You actually burn close to 320 calories doing an hour of massage.
136901	138681	It doesn't surprise me when you stop to think about it.
138721	144322	I'm like, oh yeah, when I give other people massages, you're doing... Why do you think I was fucking eating whatever I wanted to while I was in school?
144742	150283	Because I was giving our massages at least four times a week, especially when I was doing my finals.
150463	151604	DDR not needed for you.
151984	152464	Hell no.
152524	154844	Now I'm like, I've only been doing a couple of massages.
154924	156064	I need to go play DDR.
156464	156704	All right.
157085	162645	Well, there's another smart-ass voice in studio tonight, and that could only belong to the one and only Drew Nami is back tonight.
162685	164126	Boys and girls, say hello to Drew Nami.
164146	164906	Hello.
165006	165546	How are you doing?
166258	167039	Oh, I'm all right.
167600	168001	Excellent.
168642	178836	All right, and we're here in Orange Lounge Radio's chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but I noticed my chat room hasn't updated in a few seconds, which might mean... Yep, I just got disconnected.
178897	179357	Go figure.
179377	179798	There you go.
179818	180759	Live radio.
180799	181380	Bye, guys.
181781	182682	I just pinged out a chat.
183294	184854	Live radio, boys and girls, what can you do?
184894	194017	We do tape live Sunday nights at OrangeLaunchRadio.com where we run a fully functional 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station with other awesome programming.
194537	197878	For instance, DarkSakura has a show she calls Pump Up the Volume.
198098	198659	Sometimes.
198759	199939	Sometimes I just call it crap.
200459	205141	And Travis Donovan has a cool little sci-fi show on Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live.
205641	208161	And brand new shows being piloted right now.
208282	209202	Can't say too much more.
209222	211182	Those of you that have been listening on Wednesdays know about it.
211282	212943	But those of you that don't...
213697	214598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
239409	240249	Oh, no, no, no.
240349	243590	I did play some more Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and then Dan took the game back.
243630	245350	But it's, like, fucking funny to play it with Deadpool.
245850	246770	So that's all I've been doing.
247911	256612	And I was supposed to get my Pokemans, but my husband didn't pull through for me and bring me my Pokemans.
257292	257692	Fired!
258492	258893	I know.
258953	260753	I need to trade him in for a more attentive model.
261533	263153	No, I love... What?
264594	266634	Now you make it sound like you're trading Pokemans.
267782	273224	I'm going to trade a level 32 Dan for level 69 boobs.
273905	274105	No.
275445	275966	No, no, no.
276026	279647	I'll trade in my Dan for your Drew Barrymore.
281988	282188	No.
283469	284489	No, you're David Tennant.
284529	284970	There we go.
285170	285470	But no.
286970	294814	But it's... I've been listening to other people talk about their Pokemans and I want to show you mine.
295422	297684	I don't have mine yet.
298024	302468	And I've been playing, I've been really, really fucking pissed off at Twilight Zone.
303328	304009	It's a pinball.
304509	310954	Because Twilight Zone is awesome, and I can get in the zone, and then it's like, you're in the zone, Drain!
311355	311615	What?
311715	312696	I'm supposed to have multiball!
312836	313536	No, Drain!
314497	314838	Bitch.
316159	319121	And Dan finally fixed our little problem we had on our Guns N' Roses.
321924	323325	Kyle Snyder is in chat.
323905	327146	Kyle's been listening to us for a while, and of course we know him from the DDR days.
327186	328666	He says, Pokemon is dead to me.
329326	330087	I'm wondering what happened.
331367	332948	You should let me show you my Pokemans.
333408	333588	Why?
333668	334028	I wonder why.
334528	336349	Why, Kyle, is Pokemon dead to you?
336509	338369	A lot of folks have been eating this game up.
338409	340350	It's been bringing a lot of people back into the series.
340690	342971	Maybe some longtime fans feel it's just a little too much.
342991	343611	I need a new Digimon game.
343871	346632	Why do people still play this damn game?
347192	347612	Seriously.
348012	350133	Oh, look, we added more monsters that look awesome.
350894	352215	Very similar to the other ones!
352976	353736	Buy it again!
353916	360341	To answer Tigerclaw, by the way, I've been... Buy our new Color of DS or something to go along with it.
361562	375752	Tigerclaw, I've been playing on PlayStation 3, but we've decided to purchase the Xbox 360 version so that, number one, I don't have to fuck with the stupid 6-axis, and number two, we have more controllers already, so I can actually have multiplayer in my house.
376733	379075	Kyle Snyder simply says, I got bored of Pokemon.
379980	380821	SpiceWorld was fucking funny.
380861	382022	It was a shitty game out of it too.
403832	409155	Oh my god, the Spice Girls video game is the best party game ever on the PlayStation 1.
409335	413557	If you've ever played the Spice Girls game, it is so horrible.
413697	416138	Because, oh my god, the funniest thing ever.
416618	421220	You have the girls, you choreograph dances, and all the girls can do their dance.
421520	423081	Well, we made Stupid Spice.
423141	424002	I don't know, the blonde one.
424022	425042	We call her Stupid Spice.
425342	432926	What we did is we would have her always be a count late, and then halfway through the dance, she just gives up and does the little sway back and forth.
433797	436078	and then you can have them actually lip-sync this on.
436138	437159	It's the stupidest game.
437799	440361	Hours of entertainment, especially if you're intoxicated.
440381	441021	That's all I have to say.
441041	441842	Only Rob.
442342	443062	Only Rob.
443663	446584	Anything else in your gaming week, DarkSakura?
448225	448365	No.
449526	449806	All right.
450607	451787	Loki, how was your gaming week?
452228	452588	How was it?
454909	455570	One last thing, sorry.
455750	455910	Yes.
456030	461853	Dan downloaded that pinball game, the demo of the pinball game, and it's okay, but it's very high def.
462814	463014	Done.
463034	463114	Done.
464785	465026	Pin Mame
476445	477946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
500365	501846	You're just playing it on the actual table.
501906	510871	Actually, there is, in works, using widescreen LCD monitors to do an at-home full pinball emulation.
512572	512892	Yes, exactly.
512972	513612	Using two screens.
515033	515873	Exactly as I was saying.
515893	518055	Can I say a chat real quick?
518095	524298	Chat saying, Fireboma says, Spice World is almost the worst game ever, to which Jared J says, you've obviously not played Night Trap.
524778	527320	Jvmon says, Spice World is better than Sonic was for the Wii.
527340	527440	What?
529161	529661	There you have it.
530529	531049	Sorry, Loki.
531129	531389	Go ahead.
560526	574074	But we've also been playing, I played a little bit of Boom Boom Rocket today, and that was kind of fun, and just working through some of the medium-level stuff, so I can get a little higher on the leaderboards there, and then a little bit of Crackdown.
574455	575435	Crackdown's still fun.
575695	584421	You know, I think I still have a top 100 score on Boom Boom Rocket, like, you know, for the grand leaderboards, and yet still there is someone on my friends list who outranks me.
584761	587903	PK or Uno, I am going to beat your ass at...
588553	592675	Boom Boom Rocket, mark my words, I will keep practicing until I take down your score.
614213	620619	SSJ100, Matt, the only great game on Sega CD apart from Sonic CD was not fucking Night Trap.
621339	624502	There was Popful Mail, there was Silphid, Revenge of the Ninja, Microcosm.
625643	627184	Okay, there was Sewer Shark, but that doesn't count either.
627885	629086	And all the Lunar games.
629346	630027	So, you know what?
630167	630527	Shut up.
631548	632209	Wait, he's saying...
633454	635455	Night Trap was a good game?
635475	636796	It was the only other good game.
636856	638417	I'm like, the fuck it was?
639017	641919	Night Trap wasn't even a good game.
642479	644401	It had Dana Plato in it.
644601	644981	Shit.
645982	646842	It didn't have boobies in it.
647202	648983	Yeah, because it was Dana Plato, but she didn't have very big boobies.
649003	649984	Well, there you go.
650224	653146	That's instantly in the good game section.
653506	656488	But I've got the 32X one, actually.
657418	658018	Oh, well, there you go.
658038	659698	Yeah, the Terminator game was good, too.
659739	660679	The 32X is crap.
660699	662219	Hey, Chaotix kicked ass.
662239	662899	No, it did not.
662919	663539	Yes, it did.
663599	664219	Oh, my God.
664399	665600	Chaotix was awful.
665700	666420	And Calibri.
666460	667160	Did you play Calibri?
667220	667480	Yeah.
667880	671421	And wasn't there an Echo game that was 32X compatible?
671621	673421	There was, but it wasn't very good.
673461	674642	I just mostly played Chaotix.
674662	676442	Jamie?
677142	677642	After Burner.
677722	678062	Jamie?
678482	678682	What?
678882	679323	I love you.
680183	680923	Calibri sucks.
681243	682263	Calibri was cute.
684404	686064	But no, After Burner and...
687188	688068	Uh, fuck.
688488	689209	Space Harrier.
689569	690709	For 32X.
690789	691889	And they said it was a flop.
692069	694370	And they were the actual arcade versions.
694410	695270	It was really fucking cool.
695650	695890	Anyway.
696830	697791	It was really lame.
698271	700471	I was like, why the fuck are they chained to each other?
700511	701612	And this is so awful.
701972	704712	It's just like a fucking anchor being dragged behind the guy.
704732	707193	It was just, it was a horrible, horrible game.
708293	709654	It's the Bionic Commando Factor.
710514	711514	Sonic Crackers, anyone?
713695	714655	That works, that works.
715365	719288	Of course more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories because that game never gets old.
720109	721630	Although we still get pissed off at each other.
722991	723311	A lot.
725913	728615	Me, I've been playing WoW off and on.
729056	732659	Some Neverwinter Nights 2 and some Unreal Tournament.
732879	734620	Just kind of a return to old school stuff.
735441	736702	No, I am not an addict.
736822	739504	No, I do not plan to be an addict, but I still play WoW.
742530	745073	My gaming week was somewhat very similar to Drew Nami's.
745373	747095	I played pretty much nothing but WoW all week.
748196	748876	I made it to level 49.
749477	751239	I guess there's that.
751299	752300	I know, big WoW, huh?
753621	756324	I actually have not been doing a lot of console gaming this week.
756364	757044	It's kind of sad.
757124	762089	I played the pinball game at least one more time, like twice or something, to just kind of see if I liked it.
762129	763851	I tried the demo for the mini-golf game.
764432	764832	Hated it.
765410	767911	I've just never liked mini-golf games on consoles.
767972	768552	It's just not the same.
768792	769552	It's like pinball.
770233	771774	That's my review for everything this week.
772034	773575	It's not the same as the real thing.
773915	774956	Here's the problem, though, with it.
774996	779178	They really fucked up this whole thing when they went 3D Ultra Mini-Golf Adventures.
779758	780599	It's really lame now.
780779	785001	See, 3D Ultra Mini-Golf was pretty fun because you can play against other people.
785061	788063	They even had some modes that people would create and stuff in it.
788443	793766	My favorite was if I was doing bad, I just hit someone's ball across the entire course, and that was worth it right there.
794207	794647	It was awesome.
795359	808863	I don't know, the game's okay, graphically, I mean, I like, it's very creative, a lot of the whole is very creative, it's certainly not your typical mini-golf game, but I don't know, I just, I couldn't, I wasn't feeling it, for some reason, so I didn't buy the full version.
809203	823026	I really wanted to try Catan, but the demo wasn't working, and I guess they fixed it now, so I need to go back and try it, because I've heard lots of great things about Catan, and when somebody, it was either on my Twitter or LiveJournal, somebody compared it to Civilization, and I was like, sold!
823867	825107	So I definitely want to check that out, because
825709	826530	I tried the demo.
849534	851755	Because I got a new monitor for my computer.
852035	856837	I finally got a widescreen monitor, which, by the way, is working out great for the show, because I can have, like, all the windows up at once.
857217	858858	But I was like, oh, it's really pretty.
858918	859838	I want to download movies.
859878	860899	I want to download other games.
860939	864560	I want to see how... Because, like, widescreen and WoW, oh, fap, fap, fap.
864620	865200	It's beautiful.
865300	866101	It's so awesome.
866141	866901	I can't even explain it.
867761	868982	But I wanted to try, like, other stuff.
869002	870522	So I was like, oh, I'll try a driving game.
870542	873924	So I tried to download the Need for Speed Carbon demo for the PC.
874284	874804	Crashed on me.
875585	877865	Like, I was about ready to get to where I'd actually race.
877905	878426	Crashed on me.
878926	879126	And, like,
879560	880721	I downloaded E-Duke.
905325	909808	DarkSakura, I have to ask your opinion on this, and I'm not sure who got the charm on this topic, but...
934381	951114	JV Mon is saying I would cream for a Doctor Who MMO That's not entirely possible unless they set it before the current series because there's only one Time Lord now so you couldn't go around in your own TARDIS or anything What if they did something a while back or something else?
951154	951455	Who knows?
951995	956979	If it was pre-movie it'd be possible but it wouldn't work
957815	964077	And I really, really doubt that they'd let something like that out now, given the attention to continuity.
964537	969938	Don't you get a little nervous, too, when you hear your favorite shows or whatever are going to be turned into games?
970038	975019	Like, you know, they're talking about turning Heroes into a video game now because, you know, the show's been very successful.
975319	979620	And I love me some Heroes, but I get very nervous about a Heroes video game.
979780	983681	If they said EA's making a Heroes game, that might be more confident in saying...
985308	999377	SNK is making a Heroes game, which would never happen because that's neither, you know, Metal Slug, Art of Fighting, King of Fighters, it's none of those, and it's not a game that they've already made, so obviously that wouldn't be one of their games.
999738	1004701	Oh, QY brings up a good point, 24 the game, like, okay, yeah, 24 didn't work out so well.
1004721	1013987	Well, here's the problem, they made a game that took place between seasons 2 and 3 and it came out like after season 5 or 4 or something like that, so it's like, wow, this is a little old.
1014650	1018672	All right, before we get into gaming news this week, I noticed the chat room is all stuck on Spider-Man 3.
1019052	1021313	Like, you know, here we are, like, almost 20 minutes into the show.
1021593	1026775	They're still talking about Spider-Man 3 as they were before the show started tonight, even though we're a video game show.
1026795	1030517	But I see Spider-Man 3 is not a... The game got horrible reviews.
1030537	1032138	Spider-Man 3 is a popular part of culture.
1032178	1033138	Horrible reviews.
1033678	1038180	Yeah, the game, I was reading, like, PlayStation 2 game, they said it just looked like crap.
1038641	1041522	The PlayStation 3 one, it was just getting average reviews.
1041642	1041942	It was just...
1043263	1050391	Speaking of things people love and turning them into bastardized video games.
1051152	1051372	Yeah.
1051792	1059001	Well, I mean, it had potential, but even they were showing the Wii version of it and stuff, and half of Brooklyn Bridge would be not even there.
1059341	1060462	It's just stuff like that.
1060502	1063646	None of the buildings had textures on them and stuff like that.
1064440	1069824	I feel like one of the non-cool kids because I didn't bother to see the movie this weekend, but I hate seeing movies opening weekend.
1070124	1074147	It used to be the cool thing to do, but I hate teenagers at the theater.
1074528	1076329	No offense to the teenagers that listen to this show.
1076369	1080772	I'm sure you guys know how to be respectful, but unfortunately not all teenagers of the world can be.
1081173	1082133	It just ruins it for me.
1082253	1084035	I went yesterday and I had a fairly quiet theater.
1084055	1086797	There was one child that started crying and the parent escorted him out.
1086957	1087237	Good.
1087377	1091440	And one phone that went off that everyone pretty much turned around and said, Turn that fucker off!
1091500	1092201	I can top that.
1092913	1106780	We had a work screening, and one dumb bitch at my work dropped her kids off at the screening, and one of her kids was recording the film with his camera phone, to which Nelly turned him in.
1108000	1109181	I love your wife, I really do.
1109861	1112903	And the manager came over to him and told him to turn off the phone.
1113123	1113483	That's it.
1113883	1117525	I was hoping that he'd be dragged out and parents called and stuff like that, but
1117987	1119067	Unfortunately, that didn't happen.
1119968	1123069	Because management is afraid to be mean because they'll get sued or something.
1123089	1126631	Oh, I'd punch the kid in the face and then drag him out by his hair.
1128171	1128531	You know what?
1129092	1132053	Instead of telling the manager, you should have called the RIAA or whatever.
1132133	1132453	Oh, yeah.
1132493	1132793	Sorry.
1132813	1134294	Get out of here real quick.
1134314	1135454	Sorry, the MPAA.
1136895	1137675	Sorry, boy.
1137695	1138956	I'm going to get hate mail for that mistake.
1139496	1139756	All right.
1139776	1140016	Anyway.
1140756	1140997	All right.
1141797	1141997	Sorry.
1142037	1142777	Enough about movies.
1143337	1144378	Moving on to – wait.
1144438	1145818	I'm looking at – actually, I'm looking at chat.
1146519	1146899	Let's see.
1147920	1152505	Um, Blaze says, I'm a teen and I hate a lot of teens that go to the movies.
1153186	1155749	Footy Monster says, I hate, hate, hate, hate teenagers.
1156229	1159293	And Jack Ransom responds to that saying, we hate, hate, hate you.
1159313	1162917	Uh, come join in the love.
1163077	1166901	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com live on this Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific time.
1166921	1169564	Well, I remember when I was their age and stuff going, man.
1170347	1171307	I don't act like that.
1195293	1195913	That's what I'm saying.
1195953	1205335	Probably the people listening to this show, I would hope, if you're smart enough to download this show or listen live, you're probably smart enough to not be a jackass at the theater.
1205355	1206575	So I'm not talking about you.
1206675	1206955	Wait, Rob.
1206975	1209255	I'm talking about... I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
1209295	1210296	I was never a teenager.
1211396	1212196	This is craziness.
1212936	1213616	Calling me a teen.
1213656	1213836	Are you 12?
1213916	1214876	I was never a teenager.
1214896	1215076	Are you 12?
1215116	1217317	It's all about the jocks.
1217377	1220397	It's always the jocks that are the problems of everything.
1220837	1222178	And the nerds get the rap for it.
1223278	1223898	Nerds.
1227416	1231159	Did I ever tell the Grudge story on this show when I went to go see the Grudge?
1231499	1232099	I think I was with you.
1232119	1232580	Several times.
1232680	1232940	Really?
1233300	1234881	Okay, then I'm not going to tell it again.
1234901	1235421	Tell it again, though.
1235441	1236082	I think it's great.
1236202	1236802	Jamie, you tell it.
1237183	1238443	No, I wasn't there.
1238624	1239144	I thought you were.
1240064	1240365	No.
1240705	1240985	Okay.
1241565	1243347	When we saw the Grudge, were you there, Loki?
1243527	1243887	I was there.
1244107	1244547	You tell it.
1244908	1245408	I don't remember.
1245748	1246008	Okay.
1247049	1249731	Okay, I wasn't even there and I don't remember this fucking story.
1249831	1250131	All right.
1251372	1251672	Somebody.
1252028	1253049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1276662	1278463	So it was a sold out theater, right?
1278483	1282046	It was a sold out theater and the jocks in the back.
1282306	1287989	So I, you know, I don't know if it's the Rocky Horror Picture Show goer in me or whatever, but I'm not afraid to yell in a crowded theater.
1288290	1293313	So I turned around and I yelled out with the man with the little penis in the back row, please shut the fuck up.
1294179	1300404	And the entire audience started applauding, because you know they were all sick of it, they just didn't want to say anything about it.
1300444	1303626	So I yelled that out, everybody applauded, and he shut the fuck up.
1303766	1312012	And yet, you hear these girls in the back start going, Because his girlfriend knew it was true.
1312633	1313353	So it was great.
1313714	1314434	It was a good time.
1315055	1315395	Good time.
1316700	1317441	That was poon.
1317461	1322164	Maybe I should go to the movies more often on opening weekend, because I'm not afraid to yell at people while the movie's going on.
1322184	1323905	Sometimes it is fun to yell at movies.
1324025	1329409	I remember when we went and saw work screening again, because I wouldn't pay to see this, Charlie's Angels 2.
1329670	1330970	I want to see that.
1331731	1343579	And I will never forget the one moment in the movie where it's just like, okay, you can kind of suspend disbelief for a lot of the movie and stuff, but when there's a boat exploding and they...
1345000	1360948	Grab ahold of this rope and get pulled up through the ceiling and shrapnel from the explosion causes wood to splinter into snowboard-shaped pieces of wood to which the girls land on those and then grind down the ropes from the ship to the dock.
1361209	1362809	And I was like, oh, really?
1362949	1363610	Come on.
1364370	1366411	Yeah, really.
1366952	1369513	It was almost like a transporter, but the transporter, they expect that.
1370720	1375961	You see, there are right movies to MST and there are wrong movies to MST.
1375981	1377441	MST and Charlie's Angels?
1377701	1379502	Yeah.
1379522	1380422	Snakes on a Plane?
1380602	1381082	Hell yeah.
1381102	1383563	There's some movies that you just have to see that are bad.
1383583	1385923	No, you have to give some respect to movies like 300.
1386563	1390964	Or the end of The Premonition where I started busting up laughing because it was so stupid.
1391764	1396205	Or the end of Fracture where it was just like, wow, nothing really happened in the entire movie.
1396465	1398546	So next on Movie Chat... Sorry.
1398926	1399326	You know what...
1400889	1402350	It's alright to get off topic once in a while.
1402370	1402610	I know.
1402730	1403171	Embrace it.
1403231	1404531	Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.
1404571	1405332	Remember last week?
1405932	1408654	Remember last time we tried not to give a shit and people hated it.
1408694	1413397	Oh, speaking of Mr. Santa's Year 3000, I got a new tape for, or not tape, a DVD from work.
1414277	1416518	Apparently the guys that do it are starting a new series.
1416959	1417359	Oh, yeah.
1417999	1418420	Oh, really?
1418460	1422402	I don't remember what it's called now because I don't have the disc in front of me, but there is a new series coming out.
1422862	1423262	Cool.
1423282	1424183	They have a website, but...
1424713	1425413	Does it have Mike?
1425513	1426214	Research it.
1426694	1428295	Any chat feedback real quick?
1428355	1430716	Bandit says, it might have been his mom laughing.
1431717	1433618	I fucking love chat.
1433638	1434258	Her jeans.
1434918	1438400	Tigerclaw says, Sky, and they didn't yell back at you saying, you shut the fuck up.
1438580	1440501	No, they didn't because the entire audience applauded.
1440642	1444444	So I think that kind of, if that didn't happen, maybe they would have, but yeah.
1444944	1446965	Anyway, there you go.
1447574	1449055	Game News Game News Game News
1467146	1468347	Over Memorial Day weekend.
1468507	1470388	This year we only have one panel, not two.
1470888	1472670	We're not going to do a general podcasting panel.
1472690	1474551	But that's alright because we're still going to record our show live.
1474871	1477112	And it happens at 2pm on Saturdays.
1477172	1481715	So we hope that a lot of you guys will come out and say hello and make plans to come see us at Faname.
1482956	1483696	We'll all be there.
1484197	1484797	So we're excited.
1486478	1486918	So that's it.
1486959	1487879	Let's get into some gaming news.
1490177	1492778	I have some news, and this is very interesting stuff.
1494199	1500541	Now the PlayStation 3 store is starting to stock PlayStation 1 games.
1500601	1508584	We have Two Extreme, Crash Bandicoot, Destruction Derby, Jet Moto, Jumping Flash, which I fucking love Jumping Flash.
1510245	1516987	Medieval, Rallycross, Syphon Filter, which is actually a good game, Tekken 2, and Wipeout.
1517828	1518088	So...
1520146	1530229	You will actually be able to share your PSP games between the handheld and the PS3, so you'll keep your save games with you.
1530269	1532069	You can play them at work, play them at home.
1533670	1538031	It has not yet been confirmed for Europe, however, so we've just got to wait.
1539091	1542072	However, these downloads are $5.99 apiece.
1542712	1548674	They've had them up for the PSP for a while, and it's always kind of weird how you had to have the PS3 to download the ones for the PSP,
1549974	1559656	which didn't make any sense and now with the new version 1.7 patch that they had for the firmware on the PS3 now you can actually play them on the PlayStation 3 instead of just on the PSP.
1560177	1562117	I just think it's good that your saves are going to work between the two.
1562397	1568379	Well that's kind of nice and it's also nice that there's something to actually download on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.
1568999	1577561	You know there was a system that tried to do this before not necessarily with having the handheld version but remember the Neo Geo tried to do this before with the arcade versions and with the
1578180	1578660	AVS.
1578720	1580441	Well, there's also the TurboGrafx-16.
1582341	1585062	No, the TurboGrafx didn't have an arcade compatibility.
1585342	1588883	Well, they have the TurboDuo, though, or the Turbo Express.
1588983	1593444	The Turbo Express had no way to transfer the saves between the systems.
1593664	1595205	Well, I thought it was on the cartridges, though.
1596585	1600706	Well, yeah, I mean, but that's like playing with your Super Game Boy.
1601146	1602527	Well, I guess it would be the same as a Nomad.
1602547	1604587	Yeah, it's the same as a Nomad.
1604967	1607228	But in this case, though, it was having your...
1608268	1612852	Bringing home your arcade game to play on your arcade version at home.
1613633	1614533	Two different... Hello.
1617416	1622981	Bandit in our chat room says, Great, now I can use my $600 investment to play really old PS1 games.
1623041	1623882	Great, thanks, Sony.
1624022	1625143	Dude, I love Jumping Flash.
1625183	1625543	Shut up.
1629146	1629827	All right.
1629927	1630527	That's what it was.
1630627	1631268	Okay, the...
1631718	1633399	Sorry to interject this real quick.
1633799	1636921	The Film Crew is what the new thing is called, the new series.
1637081	1642544	It stars Kevin Murphy, Bill, looks like Corbett, and Mike Nelson.
1642924	1643945	Thanks, how about some game news?
1645266	1647567	Okay now, Mr. Demanding.
1648447	1655891	Anyways, so, also tying in with the PlayStation 3, Home Beta has finally kicked off in both the US and UK.
1656111	1658213	Look, I just don't care if it doesn't have Tom Servo, okay?
1658233	1658333	Sorry.
1658373	1658593	Sorry.
1660738	1668401	Okay, so a lot of people are getting to try out the brand new free, you know, avatar system that's very similar to the Sims.
1669101	1674123	And everybody's saying, oh, it's so much better than Xbox Live.
1674183	1674984	Yay.
1677065	1679165	I thought they all had to sign an NDA to get in that.
1679646	1680426	Oh, well, they did.
1680506	1684888	But, you know, they can still say that they're part of this, you know, service and that it's awesome.
1684988	1688749	Because, you know, awesome is not covered under the NDA.
1688889	1690290	So, I don't know.
1690751	1697652	But, apparently also there's going to be some more entries into the beta coming out soon.
1697752	1707394	If you really want to get into the beta, you need to make sure that you register your PlayStation 3 with Sony, which I haven't done yet, so I need to do that.
1707854	1711034	And then it's all random from there.
1711395	1713535	So, good luck.
1713595	1716895	Hopefully you get to try out the home beta before everybody else.
1718056	1718936	Personally, I don't really care.
1718956	1720096	I'll just wait for it to be done.
1720762	1724223	It won't be working correctly when it is done anyways, because everybody likes to patch shit.
1725844	1726584	Well, it is in beta.
1726644	1727024	It's early.
1727924	1728144	True.
1728964	1735947	TheRobD, by the way, says, Kevin Murphy is Tom Servo, so he's trying to pwn me there.
1736987	1737387	Whatever.
1737747	1739247	Does he have a giant underwear collection?
1740128	1740648	I think not.
1741268	1742328	All right, moving on.
1743729	1744169	Please do.
1744568	1744949	Vib Ribbon
1763028	1768571	Matsuura was actually hinting that possibly Vib Ribbon might be on its way to the PlayStation Network.
1768992	1772394	Quote, Rhythmica is very similar in idea to Vib Ribbon.
1772674	1777977	It's about analyzing audio and creating a game from that data, but it uses MP3 audio instead of CDs.
1778317	1782820	We are discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of Vib Ribbon for Sony, but I don't know yet.
1782880	1788643	Sony only recently launched their downloadable service in Japan, so we kind of need to wait a while before releasing a title with that kind of appeal.
1789261	1790202	That would be awesome.
1790242	1792885	Vibribin, if you've never played it, is so friggin' cute.
1792985	1794847	I'm so glad I lucked into my copy.
1795328	1797590	Because I paid enough for it, too, didn't I?
1797970	1798391	I think so.
1798431	1800433	Didn't it go into best hits in Japan, though, eventually?
1800453	1801654	I can't remember.
1801754	1804617	I bought an original for like 50 bucks used.
1805578	1808922	Then again... At the time, yeah, it was absolutely worth it.
1809778	1812579	And the cool thing about it, though, is that you could use any CD with it.
1812759	1815700	And although the results were somewhat mixed, it was just kind of fun.
1815720	1816861	What did we try to do?
1816881	1817461	We tried Max 300.
1817761	1818942	It was better than Dance Factory.
1819042	1819982	That was fun.
1820062	1822543	No, we did Dropout.
1822763	1823483	That was what we used.
1824224	1825404	We tried to play it to Dropout.
1825484	1826084	Good times.
1826884	1828485	So I hope this happens.
1828505	1830486	That would be a really fun game for PlayStation Network.
1830786	1832667	Certainly better than the Duck game.
1834107	1838169	Well, there is, in process...
1839503	1841864	Excuse me for a moment while I breathe again.
1843105	1848729	They're talking about a new Dead or Alive, Mega Man, and Kingdom Hearts for PS3.
1848789	1855513	In the last issue of EGM Magazine, there were these rumors coming out.
1856593	1862417	So Team Ninja has an exclusive for a new Dead or Alive for the PS3.
1863457	1866599	And there's also the notice that Capcom is working on a new...
1868972	1875377	Actually not a new Mega Man, they were updating the original Mega Man with new graphics for a download.
1876117	1880961	And Nipponichi is working on a new Disgaea for PS3.
1883062	1889747	So it's basically Mega Man, powered up Mega Man, except without a giant head, hopefully.
1890287	1890728	Let's hope.
1893009	1895611	Because he had a giant fucking head in the game.
1895991	1898193	And we're pretty much sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be PS3.
1900878	1928449	so there is some new stuff coming out also from Square actually they're talking a little bit about Kingdom Hearts and of course the next progression for it apparently is going to be a portable spin-off and not Kingdom Hearts 3 although I'm assuming Kingdom Hearts 3 is probably in the works as well but the next game you'll see will be a portable spin-off and no word exactly what it's going to be I'm sure we'll find out a little bit more after the whole Square Enix
1930592	1932492	Press Party or whatever they have in Fan Party.
1933713	1939734	So hopefully we'll hear a little bit more about that because I know it wasn't a Chain of Memories or whatever.
1939754	1941194	Didn't that suck really bad?
1941754	1944334	Chain of Memories is a different game.
1944874	1948155	I do not recommend playing it on a DS Micro.
1948755	1949175	Not DS.
1950195	1951736	The Game Boy Advance Micro.
1952476	1954416	But it wasn't that bad.
1954456	1956456	I'm actually looking forward to the PS2 version.
1958537	1958837	I don't know.
1959097	1959397	They just
1960000	1962442	Don't fuck it up, please.
1962822	1967244	Most people play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memory for the story, not the game.
1969466	1970787	Well, I'm glad they play it for something.
1973528	1985215	Alright, well, last week somebody listened to us, apparently, or somebody had the same idea, because remember when last week we talked about the whole God of War promotional thing in the UK?
1985255	1987757	They had the goat with the head chopped off and all that stuff, remember that?
1988157	1989698	And I said somebody should email PETA.
1990131	1990931	Well, somebody did.
1991352	1994373	Somebody somehow told PETA what was going on.
1994433	1995934	I don't know if that's because of this show or what.
1996314	1997875	I'm sure somebody else had the same idea.
1998355	2002318	But PETA did post in their, I guess, official blog.
2002358	2007200	It looks like it's just one guy that runs it, but they have a blog over at blog.peta.com.
2007781	2009301	Somebody actually posted about it.
2009902	2014024	And basically what it came down to is that they sort of said...
2014963	2019964	PETA said they're kind of not going to do anything about it, that it's obviously an idiotic thing.
2020065	2024666	They would not name the game in the blog entry because they have no desire to help them promote it.
2024846	2030848	And they noticed that Sony obviously apologized for it, and Sony is recalling the magazine and everything.
2031588	2033889	But PETA was just kind of shaking their head disapprovingly.
2036121	2036561	Sorry, boys.
2066752	2066952	Hi.
2067632	2067892	Hello.
2071053	2077535	Well, you know how Taito had that big problem with Bubble Bobble?
2078075	2079395	You know, you can't get past level 30?
2080456	2081116	No, never heard of it.
2082056	2082416	Rob.
2083316	2085277	Of course, we made fun of it endlessly on this show.
2085937	2093439	Well, it's happened to SNK and Capcom Cardfighter Clash for the DS.
2093459	2093659	Yes.
2094910	2097471	Yeah, which is funny because my husband bought the game right when it came out.
2097551	2099671	So I'm just wondering if he's hit that point yet.
2099971	2100712	I'm going to laugh.
2101212	2102652	You just got bubble bobbled.
2104132	2112135	Apparently, if you go to the ninth floor of the tower through the second playthrough, the game will crash after you talk to someone named John.
2112855	2116936	You have to fight him to, of course, make it past that area.
2117456	2119076	So you're pretty much just stuck.
2120457	2120637	No...
2122179	2129365	There is a message from SNK stating that we're going to hear something soon, but nothing as of yet as far as I know.
2130306	2136892	So let's hope that, more than positive, they're going to recall it or do something for it.
2138595	2143599	Is the message going to say something along the lines of, we're really fucking sorry we didn't beta test this game?
2143920	2150985	I mean, because when things like this are announced, it makes me think that the game is so god-awful that not even their own internal QA department could play through the ninth floor.
2151286	2160373	I mean, that's seriously the impression that I get about the game, is that if the game is so broken that not even their QA department was interested in playing it that far, what else am I left to think?
2161614	2161734	Ouch.
2163210	2164071	Well, it's good enough.
2164131	2168172	I mean, hell, if the first couple levels worked, then the whole game's probably good.
2168212	2170714	I mean, after all, they're not that much different.
2170734	2171774	I mean, come on.
2172574	2174055	Do you want me to play through the whole thing?
2175196	2175616	Whatever.
2176096	2181378	Well, news about broken video games makes us a little bit angsty, and you know what that means when we get angsty.
2181659	2182539	People die.
2191963	2193444	It's time for the FUs of the week.
2193484	2194705	DarkSakura, take it away.
2197508	2208598	You know, FU goes towards certain people in management positions at my unlisted place of employment.
2209358	2216485	And it's not really, you know, again, it's not necessarily a... I'd say it was a misthought.
2216605	2217325	I'll put it that way.
2218226	2218787	Assuming that...
2219719	2222980	I don't have enough work already to do with the one thing that I was already doing.
2223420	2230602	True, I get a couple days a month where they don't, you know, open as many assignments to me to finish and I need extra things to do to keep busy.
2231322	2238423	But, um, I told them right up front, I'm like, look, I'm not going to be able to do all this.
2239243	2242064	I'm one person and I'm sure as hell not going to work overtime.
2242544	2245385	Unless you really want me to work overtime and pay me for it, sure, yeah.
2246585	2254969	and, true enough, you know, I finally said, you know what, if they're gonna do this to me, then I'm just gonna let them know when I can't get it all done in one day and we'll see what they think of that.
2255529	2259691	So, finally, the realization has dawned that, oh my god, she really is only one person.
2260611	2264933	And while her productivity is amazing, not everybody can do all of this.
2265293	2270596	So, yeah, we're gonna not let, you know, this employee go nuts and kill everybody in the company.
2272077	2273857	So, it's getting taken care of.
2274017	2275178	After we discuss the situation.
2276164	2279866	My FU of the week goes to Survivor The Ride
2305146	2309709	At Great America, where I was at yesterday, we took a trip for Extrovert Sisters.
2310129	2311750	I vote this ride out of the park.
2312370	2316792	I know, first of all, how the hell do you make a ride out of Survivor?
2316912	2318093	It's pretty cheesy, but whatever.
2318113	2319814	Is it where you have to starve yourself?
2320214	2321095	No, no.
2321815	2327438	No, okay, you start off the ride, like when you're waiting in the queue, the little line before you actually get on the ride, right?
2327698	2332861	They make you do, when it's your turn to go next, first you have to do this little tribal stomp, you have to do this stupid-ass...
2333260	2334181	Thanks for watching!
2351701	2352341	DarkSakura.com
2382233	2386697	And I scream like a little girl because, like, seriously, like, Disneyland is one thing.
2386717	2397165	When I get on the thrill rides where I'm going upside down and being, like, just being twisted up like a pretzel on some of those rides and getting fire shot in my face on a ride named after a TV show that jumped the shark five years ago.
2397586	2399387	Okay, F you.
2399827	2402289	I bet you'll do the dance next time now, won't you?
2402329	2403050	Seriously.
2404311	2407934	We'll teach that fucker a lesson.
2407954	2409395	I'll do the damn dance next time.
2409435	2410216	Stomp, stomp, stomp.
2412296	2417039	You know, seriously, when my first word to her when I got off the ride, I'm like, Jamie would like this ride because it shoots fire.
2418020	2418801	I think I would.
2419061	2421743	When you said shooting fire, I was like, hey, I like fire.
2422544	2423745	All right, you didn't find it funny.
2423785	2425046	I think I found it funny as hell.
2425106	2426527	Fuego es muy bien.
2428108	2429389	Fuego.
2429469	2432311	Fireboma says Skye is used to things being shot in his face.
2432451	2435093	Zing, my second FU of the week, goes to Fireboma.
2435153	2435854	Congratulations.
2436414	2437375	Drunami, your FU of the week.
2437885	2442428	FU to DS Wi-Fi for being so damn temperamental around my router.
2442988	2445550	I know it's not my router's fault it wants to be so restrictive.
2445890	2447791	It must be Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.
2448572	2451353	Also, FU to the new patches that are coming out for WoW.
2451753	2453194	Trying to go into the public test room.
2453675	2455716	Oh my god, Lactastic.
2455796	2457277	Nothing works in my UI.
2458738	2462120	They've got some serious stuff to fix before they release that publicly.
2465482	2465802	All right.
2466986	2468567	Lots of angst in studio tonight.
2468648	2471770	You know you're going to get a good show when there's lots of angst in studio tonight.
2471810	2472751	All right, let's kill the music.
2473712	2475093	And let's get back to some gaming news.
2475373	2476014	I don't think so.
2476074	2477195	Instead, let's go have ice cream.
2478056	2479136	Ice cream sounds good.
2479777	2480938	Let's have an ice cream podcast.
2480978	2482139	I totally vote for ice cream.
2482439	2485722	Okay.
2485782	2487644	Orange Launch Radio is canceled tonight due to ice cream.
2487664	2489005	Actually, I already had ice cream today.
2489025	2490646	You can't have ice cream for two weeks.
2490686	2491767	We'll have ice cream again.
2491807	2492448	Loki, save us.
2494335	2499178	Okay, well, the only thing in combat ice cream is TNA, and there is... Hey, that sounds great!
2499418	2499818	Winner!
2499838	2501920	I like TNA ice cream.
2501940	2503020	TNA-flavored ice cream.
2503240	2510545	So there's this wonderful game that's being touted as TNA Pong on Kotaku.
2510565	2519931	It's actually from a website, I guess, WeMakeMoneyNotArt, and it's, I guess, some woman named Jennifer Chowdhury's.
2521231	2523753	She has an intimate game controller, and apparently...
2524417	2528400	She says it's like Pong, but it's not really like Pong, it's more like DDR, I would say.
2529021	2539749	The whole game is basically, there's a woman has a bra controller where you, you know, grope her, and then the guy has, like, boxers where she grabs his ass.
2540350	2545034	And you watch the screen, there's, like, first there'll be shapes coming up, so, you know, you can grab anywhere.
2545514	2553981	Then later on, as you progress through the levels, there's shapes with other shapes on them, like star with a circle and stuff, and you have to grab certain parts and stuff, and supposedly...
2554654	2560139	It's supposed to make you either, you know, piss off because you lose or go have sex.
2560719	2563341	Personally, it looked very, very, very, very awkward.
2564362	2566664	So this is a game where even when you lose, you win?
2567184	2567584	I guess.
2568085	2575631	But hey, the way I figure it, you know, if you got some chick in bra and panties already and you're playing this game and grabbing her boobs, it can't be that bad of a game.
2576018	2580220	This reminds me of that one boob twirling game they released like two, three years ago.
2580240	2580560	Oh, yeah.
2580580	2582861	Where you had to make them twirl in different patterns.
2583281	2584241	That was a fun game.
2584461	2586542	I'm watching the video on here, even though I'm not supposed to.
2586582	2589243	It's really, really stupid.
2589683	2590464	Okay, here we go.
2590504	2592064	I'm going to give the show an explicit tag.
2592084	2592424	You ready?
2594105	2596626	Warning, the show is intended for mature audiences.
2597006	2604229	Okay, like, when you first started talking about this, I kind of pictured that maybe the woman, like, put a Wiimote in her twat.
2605624	2607466	DarkSakura, would you play Lesbian Pong?
2632965	2635547	I need the female perspective here on the show for a minute.
2636888	2638189	Yeah, that's a yes, you would?
2641191	2643893	Score, cut, print, saved archives.
2644494	2646015	All right, that's a wrap.
2646055	2646616	OLR's over.
2646916	2647977	We're off to go play games.
2648717	2650498	We're off to go create new games for the Wii.
2651039	2652600	Nice knowing you for the past five years.
2652960	2654501	Lesbian Pong has ruined this show.
2654582	2654962	Good night.
2657304	2666007	No, but seriously, though, they could put, like, what they could do is, like, I don't know, make some sort of a different game, you know, where they could put more sensors on their bodies or something.
2666587	2666947	I don't know.
2668908	2669748	Know what they need.
2670069	2676991	Here's what... Yeah, but now we have an audio clip of her saying yes, so it's done.
2678231	2679712	Okay, here's what they need to do.
2680726	2684028	This kind of ties in with that really crappy Eye of Judgment game.
2684188	2687391	They need to have something with the eye toy and the Eye of Judgment.
2687631	2688391	That's a sex game.
2688551	2688992	There you go.
2689012	2691393	It's already the brown Eye of Judgment.
2691994	2693715	Oh, dude, the Eye of Judgment on a sex game.
2693775	2694175	I get it.
2694936	2695916	And the Wiimote.
2695996	2697317	Or Six Axis, right?
2697737	2697958	Yeah.
2697998	2701620	Because Six Axis can detect how much you're rocking the boat.
2701680	2710286	But see, then again, though, they have all the USB ports, so you can just hook it up with your usual USB-powered vibrators and shit, and it'll just, you know...
2711226	2711706	There you go.
2711826	2713247	Total sex package.
2714288	2714988	Never will happen.
2717150	2718311	Because it's a dumb idea.
2718551	2721393	Who the fuck would set up all this shit to have sex?
2721433	2722393	That's just retarded.
2723434	2726836	But then again, though, they have all those sex board games, and I don't know.
2726876	2727316	That could be fun.
2728797	2729818	I wanted to say this real quick.
2729918	2733160	Actually, the talk about the brown eye of judgment actually reminded me.
2734081	2739144	I got a private message on my Twitter from a PK or Uno who was telling me about another game
2740008	2742050	Aquarian Age Alternative
2764878	2765718	That's awesome.
2765758	2769099	That proves, once again, Sony didn't come up with an original idea.
2769500	2770320	Way to go!
2770400	2771980	Copying something subscreened.
2772020	2776142	I don't know how new or old this game is, but I hope... Well, let's put it this way.
2776182	2779443	I'm going to just pimp his Vox, because he has pictures and stuff all over his Vox.
2779483	2782604	So if you want to see this, it's pkeruno.vox.com.
2782644	2784465	P-K-E-R-U-N-O dot vox dot com.
2784485	2786245	And he has this whole thing, Aquarian Age Alternative.
2786465	2787446	Obviously, it's out.
2787566	2788766	Eye of Judgment is not out.
2788806	2791067	Therefore, this one came out first, so...
2792634	2795696	They... Way to go, Sony.
2795776	2799319	Thinking that we wouldn't find the thing that you copied, but there you go.
2800040	2801681	Proves that you're still not original.
2802121	2803342	And it's still a dumb idea.
2808226	2808666	There you have it.
2809787	2810887	I'm curious to play it.
2810928	2812028	You know, I'll try anything once.
2812809	2818193	Anyway, other famous Japanese arcade games may or may not be coming to the US.
2818773	2820975	2DX Gold, Beatmania 2DX Gold, of course...
2821397	2822897	Tilt Arcade, GameWorks, Six Flags
2844704	2847966	and really break down that we want to see Beatmania 2DX Golden Arcades.
2847986	2850167	I mean, it tells you what to say and everything.
2850267	2856190	So hats off to this user, BrazoLienge, and I hope I didn't horribly mispronounce that.
2856430	2858111	But hats off to you for breaking that all down.
2858171	2863693	And I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to this program because that used to be our forte a couple years ago.
2863793	2866175	So definitely check out Bomani Style's forums.
2866495	2867335	Check out the forums.
2867775	2870077	Just don't let a golf land have it because you know they'll fuck it up.
2870117	2871878	Yeah, don't let golf land have it because they'll break it.
2871898	2872378	Absolutely.
2872398	2872798	Absolutely.
2874881	2876782	Okay, for some reason your mic's not picking up, DarkSakura, is it?
2877022	2877862	That's because it wasn't on.
2877962	2878663	Oh, that would be why.
2878683	2879823	I don't know why it wasn't on.
2879983	2880544	All right, there you go.
2880804	2883825	Yeah, what I said was don't let Golfland have it because you know they're going to fuck it up.
2884926	2888207	Check out the music game discussion forums on BamandiStyle.com.
2888407	2897732	Well, speaking of information that came out on a forum, there's a rumor going on that the DDR Supernova 2 North American Field Test is canceled.
2898772	2902534	It was posted by Rye19 on Aaron in Japan's forums.
2904195	2905136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2923155	2930879	I honestly myself don't put too much stock in something that I read on a forum until I see something official put out by the company.
2931639	2937522	The only reason I would give a little cred to it is because they have done location tests there before at that same arcade.
2937962	2945105	So I was willing to believe it, but I do wonder to myself, did Konami pull it back?
2945666	2947627	to maybe further tweak the game.
2947667	2953608	Maybe it wasn't ready to be tested because you know the internet is cruel and the game better be damn good or the internet will tear it apart.
2954389	2960190	Well, there was also a quote on here, apparently a quote from maybe Selenic Konami?
2960471	2974735	And again, this is on a message board stating that in order to prevent dissatisfaction of SN2, we have canceled the North American SN2 test site as it may result in creating a better dance game.
2977245	2977925	That sounds fishy.
2978866	2979486	I don't know about that one.
2980887	2981187	I don't know.
2981227	2981828	I could be wrong.
2983348	2983609	All right.
2984129	2986831	Why would a company admit that, oh, the game kind of sucks right now?
2986971	2988832	We're going to go back and tweak it.
2989272	2989872	I don't know about that one.
2989952	2990873	We're starting over.
2991413	2992174	See you in ten years.
2994375	2995856	We hope you have a nice play again.
2996857	2998137	All right.
2998838	3002060	They need to just completely make the dance pads more durable.
3002180	3004041	Ditter fans are going to have to wait a little long for their ditter.
3004681	3005702	That's what the story...
3006367	3007168	You can diddle later.
3007208	3007908	I mean, dinner later.
3009108	3025696	Anyways, so certain... There's a few websites out there that got all excited after seeing an IGN mock-up of a Guitar Hero 3 controller, which I might add that is completely fake, by the way, and is no indication of what it's actually going to look like.
3026057	3032280	They have basically a picture of a white guitar with the Wii remote in the neck of the guitar.
3032620	3032860	That's
3033599	3036661	Just like before when they mocked what the classic controller would look like.
3037642	3039964	Completely mocked up.
3040084	3042526	You know why I felt that was fake when I first looked at it?
3042666	3045548	It's because of the way the Wiimote is strapped into that controller.
3045708	3050312	Because basically what they have there is they have this guitar with the handle.
3051072	3053774	What do they call the long part of that?
3053894	3055135	The neck?
3055155	3056776	They have the Wii thing snapping into the neck.
3056816	3058938	But the thing is that if the Wiimote were to snap in...
3059477	3060318	It breaks the infrared.
3061198	3062780	And the plugs are on the bottom.
3063300	3065082	You wouldn't snap it in like that.
3065122	3068244	You'd have to snap it in either on the bottom of the guitar or something.
3068284	3070486	You can't push it in and have it just snap.
3070886	3071387	It wouldn't work.
3071607	3072728	It would be too difficult to get in there.
3074289	3084397	And besides, if I remember correctly, I think they've already said that if when they do release this, there's actually going to be a guitar that's sold separately.
3084458	3086980	They'll hook up via USB or something like that.
3087120	3087400	Yeah.
3088346	3110281	Sorry, but that's not what it's going to be, it's not going to be something that you strap the Wii Remote into It's not like you have to plug the Wii Remote into everything Exactly, and, I mean, I don't know, it's going to be Guitar Hero 3, it's just going to be on another fucking console, so, woohoo I know, it's like, you've never played this game before
3110916	3111637	Flyin' V Flyin' V Flyin' V
3140279	3143780	Is it too much to ask for one freaking guitar to work on all consoles?
3144240	3144380	No.
3144920	3145760	They're all USB.
3145800	3146541	Why can't they?
3147381	3149041	Why can't they make one universal guitar?
3149701	3150562	That's right.
3150762	3154743	I know why, because they get to sell you fucking more guitars.
3155503	3165566	Alright, well, the Queens of the Stone Age, you might know them, they're a band, and they have basically confirmed that they are going to be in some games.
3165966	3167106	Basically, I guess there's a
3168227	3174872	promo ad going around for the band and it's confirming that they are going to be appearing in Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.
3175292	3175953	What song?
3176373	3179435	Don't know, but you know the Queens of Stone Age are going to be in the games.
3179515	3184359	By the way, they're also going to be in Madden 08 and NASCAR 08 if you are so inclined to play those games instead.
3184379	3185199	Woo!
3185299	3186120	EA tracks!
3186540	3188121	That's right, EA tracks!
3188442	3192665	And again, I like Junkie XL, so they always have a good Junkie XL track in there.
3193045	3194786	And who doesn't love Avril Lavigne's girlfriend?
3194986	3195547	Oh wait, no one.
3196127	3196367	Alright.
3196727	3197088	Nellie does.
3198263	3204851	Hey Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind Hey Mickey, just replace the word Mickey with girlfriend and that's pretty much the song
3216744	3217745	DarkSakura.com
3244787	3245408	It's great.
3245468	3246449	It's called Bible Fight.
3246529	3247349	It's a flash game.
3249291	3250692	Where it's like Street Fighter with Jesus.
3252694	3254636	I actually played a little bit of this game last night.
3255276	3256598	I should have included that in my gaming week.
3257078	3259380	And I battled Jesus versus Satan.
3259420	3260061	It was epic.
3260321	3262183	But what's great is that they have special moves.
3262243	3264024	Like Jesus throws his thorny crown.
3264345	3264945	It's awesome.
3265345	3269189	You have Jesus, Eve, Mary, Moses, Noah, and Satan.
3270526	3273108	So I can see if she's naked.
3273148	3273208	She...
3298072	3300072	Jamie, you've got issues.
3300153	3300793	No, this is great.
3300813	3303373	She has a snake on one arm with little leaves.
3305094	3305554	It's great.
3305574	3309535	The typical depiction of Eve, where there's always... Mary looks like she's got PMS.
3309595	3314456	There's always, like, an animal or a fig leaf or something just conveniently placed over their naughty bits.
3315156	3316656	So it's always kind of interesting.
3317057	3320217	She's fighting with a halo over her head and fucking Baby Jesus.
3320577	3323578	GS68 says, Baby Jesus is a weapon?
3323598	3325779	Does that be awesome?
3325799	3326019	Wow.
3327651	3329992	Wow, we're going to get the hate mail tonight.
3330072	3332113	GS68 says, Westboro will sue.
3332173	3333034	Hey, we didn't create it.
3333554	3334154	Adult Swim did.
3334535	3335575	Go take up your issues with them.
3336996	3341438	Anyways, so the NBA has just launched into Second Life.
3343159	3343759	Who cares?
3344820	3348462	Apparently a lot of people are on Second Life like it's fucking real world or something.
3348622	3350483	Ooh, the NBA is on there now.
3352190	3354452	So, I mean, they're in the real world too.
3354772	3363059	But apparently you can go there and, you know, play horse and basketball and suck it up really bad as well.
3364941	3365301	I don't know.
3366562	3371046	I'm not surprised that, you know, people are going to make money off this second life.
3371106	3373848	But it's interesting nonetheless.
3374088	3376230	I guess you can play horse and get pelted by penises.
3376410	3379233	Jesus, keep the first life out of second life.
3379373	3380534	Damn, come on.
3381087	3383529	Pretty soon people are going to get... You should put that on a bumper sticker.
3385090	3388492	Pretty soon... Seriously, that's a pretty good tagline for us.
3388512	3389953	Because you're a Second Life player, right?
3391273	3392434	From time to time, yeah.
3392934	3396777	I thought Second Life was just where people go to have virtual furry sex or something.
3396857	3401400	I mean, not like to play basketball.
3401660	3404762	I'm going to go into Second Life, I'm going to play basketball.
3404882	3409425	And then your friend goes, fuck that, I'm going outside and play basketball there.
3410897	3413579	I don't have to worry about being pelted with flying penises.
3413799	3414740	Drew Nami, response?
3418082	3419983	Don't go play in a sandbox then.
3421404	3423605	You don't get that shit if you play in a sandbox zone.
3426427	3432691	Okay, so don't go playing in a sandbox because there's a virtual sandbox in Second Life.
3433131	3438034	If I had that sound effect on this program, I would have just used it.
3439642	3440625	I don't get it.
3440705	3443853	I mean, what the hell do you do in Second Life?
3444895	3445136	Stop!
3446860	3447780	Try to find a life?
3448220	3448761	No, I don't know.
3449721	3450862	I imagine there's lots of people.
3450902	3452643	You know, I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk.
3452663	3453663	Look at my cube I just made.
3453743	3454844	It's so awesome.
3454904	3456525	We're going to buy it for $1,000?
3457145	3459246	I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk, okay?
3459366	3462708	But, you know, I guess people play it because it's fun.
3463108	3463769	That's what games are.
3463789	3464309	They're fun.
3464829	3465870	Furry sex is fun.
3466110	3471773	Well, if World of Warcraft weren't set in some sort of fictional medieval time, I'm sure the NBA would be there, too.
3473376	3474637	Point of Second Life is simple.
3474857	3476238	Step one, fly around.
3476458	3477739	Step two, do shit.
3480040	3481241	Comments from chat room.
3481801	3483522	TheRobD makes some comments.
3484423	3487965	Is Tim Hardaway there to hate you if you're gay in Second Life?
3488025	3489486	Making fun of some earlier controversy.
3489806	3493308	RobD says, is Dirk Nowitzki there to suck in Second Life?
3493328	3493648	Let's see.
3502000	3505228	KevinTheGroove says, in second life, you waste your first life.
3505389	3505810	Duh.
3507434	3507795	There you go.
3507835	3509860	Responses from chat.orangelongeradio.com
3511109	3514251	Now this is a little more interesting of a sports story, I think.
3514311	3514651	I don't know.
3515211	3520134	Pro football players will be training with Electronic Arts Madden technology.
3521075	3528539	The same technology that's used in Electronic Arts popular Madden games is now being used to create a training simulator for professional football players.
3529280	3535884	XOS Technologies is licensing the TDT engine from EA Sports to use in what's called the Play Action Simulator.
3537418	3546903	The play action of Family of Products addresses team demands to uniquely and effectively teach new plays and game plans, says Bob Simmons, who is the XOS Coaching Solutions president.
3547623	3556748	As the current provider of coaching analysis and game planning solutions to more than 200 NFL and NCAA football teams, XOS thoroughly understands how teams prepare weekly for an upcoming opponent.
3557108	3560850	The simulator is built on our TDT engine, which utilizes the same technologies.
3561212	3568695	and gameplay found in our popular Madden NFL game franchise, said the general manager of EA Tiburon, Steve Chang.
3569535	3570335	So that's kind of cool.
3570835	3572536	If you're a Madden fan, I bet that's pretty exciting.
3572836	3581159	But my response would be, what about those poor players who train and then end up with the really low ranking in Madden?
3581179	3585501	Because you know Madden ranks all the real players, and that's got to suck if you're the lowest ranked one.
3585841	3588762	I seem to remember a story, either on this show or another show,
3589261	3590442	What good is an actual simulator anyway?
3607952	3609633	Well, you know, I don't know.
3609873	3611194	It didn't help me become a better driver.
3611334	3612074	I just played Ridge Racer.
3612094	3614235	I was going to say, you have driving simulators.
3614416	3616777	Cops do cop scene simulators.
3616817	3617117	I don't know.
3617197	3619298	Simulators are there to simulate the real thing.
3619518	3619899	I don't know.
3620099	3622640	What good is that going to do versus actual real experience?
3624001	3626022	Well, keep in mind, there's a lot of strategy in football, too.
3626562	3628383	You know, not just the running around and stuff.
3628403	3632466	Maybe, I don't know, maybe it has to do with strategy and processing.
3632486	3633226	Do you just play Tecmo Bowl?
3633926	3634287	Yeah, I do.
3634327	3634887	Tecmo Bowl.
3634907	3636188	I wanted the engine built on Tecmo Bowl.
3636328	3636888	Okay, anyway.
3638506	3640707	There is another... Why am I getting all the rumors?
3640787	3645551	There's another rumor floating about that Nintendo of America is going to relocate.
3645571	3656680	It was actually posted on Kotaku that employees were told on Thursday that they had until June 1st to choose to willingly relocate or accept a severance package.
3657781	3662204	And the sites for new offices are rumored to be San Francisco and New York.
3662925	3663065	So...
3664423	3665843	I'm hoping for San Francisco!
3666743	3670144	Me too, because I could have applied for all kinds of jobs.
3670704	3674525	And in fact, I actually was going to apply for a number of Nintendo jobs when I thought I was moving to Washington.
3674965	3676165	But now I'm not gonna.
3677205	3679426	Because I want jobs there.
3680146	3687907	Anyways, so we have GameStop over here, and of course they have Game over in the UK.
3688847	3693048	And apparently Game has bought out its competitor, GameStation, for...
3693781	3711528	The equivalent of $100 million US Approximately 74 million pounds Or euros, I can't tell And now it will increase So wait, GameStop is to game as GameStation is to EB Games?
3711568	3722733	Something like that, yeah So now they are about over 200 storefronts And the largest chain in Europe
3724076	3724916	GameStop is now a Monopoly?
3748410	3752931	I wouldn't say it's a monopoly, but it's pretty much as close to a monopoly as GameStop is over here.
3753251	3765053	Yeah, but GameStop gets, I mean, maybe that's the same perception as in Europe is that GameStop does compete with Best Buy and Walmart and online and the more, you know, the big box stores that carry more than just games.
3765113	3765533	You know what I mean?
3766973	3767873	That's where their competition is now.
3767893	3770894	It's not like they're the only game store on the face of the earth, so I don't know.
3770934	3777895	Because when I get pissed at GameStop, I go to, you know, either I go to GameCrazy or because that's kind of far, I'll go to Best Buy.
3779772	3780233	But I don't know.
3780533	3784956	My friend had a real horrible experience at Best Buy last week, and now I'm thinking I may not go there anymore.
3784976	3785256	Fries.
3785596	3785956	It was bad.
3786276	3787417	Fries, I could do.
3787557	3788178	I could do fries.
3788738	3789178	I like fries.
3789618	3791460	What are you hanging out over there, Drew Nami?
3791680	3793301	You had a problem with fries?
3793321	3793821	Shitty service?
3794121	3795182	Yeah, it's got shitty service.
3796523	3797083	Sorry to hear that.
3797323	3798224	Why is it shitty service?
3798264	3801446	I've had stuff that's, like, gone bad, went back there, and they're like, eh, whatever.
3801926	3802566	At least it's cheap.
3802626	3803787	And then they'll just give me a new one.
3804508	3804768	Alright.
3805488	3808250	Well, anyhow, moving on to another story, um,
3809853	3810733	This is interesting.
3810793	3812694	This story somewhat struck a chord.
3812734	3819977	I don't know about you guys, but this is really big in the news this week about a Chinese student who was attending Clements High School.
3820017	3822679	And of course, because he's a high school student, they don't give us his name.
3823139	3824640	But he was removed from the high school.
3824660	3827181	This is located in Texas in the town of Fort Benz.
3827921	3833864	Parents were complaining he recreated the school grounds in a game, which I believe was Counter-Strike.
3834244	3837065	And he uploaded the map and all his friends were playing in it.
3837640	3841243	and basically he now has to go to an alternate education school.
3841543	3844945	The police called him a terroristic threat and so on and so on.
3844985	3850009	Of course, you can't help but think this is all partially due to the Columbines and the Virginia Techs of the world.
3850369	3862898	But the reason why this struck a chord with me is that when I go back to 10 years ago, 1996, a little more than 10 years ago, my freshman year of college,
3863314	3865475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3888897	3893100	Map editors came out, and what was the first map we tried to make in Duke Nukem?
3893400	3896702	We tried to recreate our dorm in Duke Nukem, because we thought it would be funny.
3896822	3903906	Of course, I tried to recreate Roundtable to play Duke Nukem 3D in Roundtable, but it doesn't mean I'm going to go shoot up the place.
3903966	3905387	It's because it's a place you're familiar.
3905427	3911491	You're like, damn, you're sitting there bored or whatever in high school, and you're like, damn, this would be fun to run around and play paintball in or something like that.
3911591	3915614	But you can't actually do that, so you create a map that's familiar to you, and you go and play.
3915634	3917775	It's just like if you recreated your mall or something like that.
3919486	3928131	The problem is these people are too fucking scared of everything that they immediately think, oh my god, it's Counter-Strike, you know, therefore he must be a terrorist.
3928871	3932954	And, no, I heard the rumors also because he's Asian.
3933034	3935275	D-Vay in chat says he actually went to jail.
3935355	3936416	There was an update on the story.
3936716	3937276	Thanks, D-Vay.
3937596	3938897	That's so stupid!
3939017	3940258	What crime did he commit?
3940538	3941839	Seriously, what crime did he commit?
3941879	3943260	Well, here's what I'm thinking.
3943580	3946001	Is there a component of this we don't know?
3946582	3946822	Like,
3947523	3949703	Why did the parents complain just about a map?
3949723	3953824	Because my parents didn't know I was making... My parents thought I was doing Homeworld.
3953844	3954144	You know why?
3954164	3955505	They didn't even know I was playing Duke Nukem, okay?
3955525	3955905	You know why?
3955945	3960405	They wanted to be the fucking people that fucking saw 9-11 coming and stopped it.
3960445	3961146	That's what they wanted to be.
3961486	3963826	They said, oh, look, he's recreated a map.
3963966	3965466	It's just like that Virginia Tech community.
3965646	3966507	Let's get the guy.
3966527	3967927	This is what I'm curious about.
3968027	3972868	Was there something else that we don't know, that the video game blogs aren't talking about?
3972928	3974088	Well, he did have a hammer in...
3974788	3976250	You know what he could do with that hammer?
3976610	3977631	He could hammer shit.
3977711	3978352	Did he make a threat?
3978372	3979372	Like people's skulls.
3979453	3981174	Did he make a threat months ago?
3981334	3983156	Was there something about his demeanor?
3983656	3989341	I mean, I'm stopping to think there's got to be something else.
3989562	3991744	Are we really this trigger happy?
3991804	3992504	No pun intended.
3992905	3994306	Are we really this trigger happy to arrest people?
3994326	3996928	Because I'm thinking like, you know, I did this.
3997048	3997749	You did this.
3998049	3998910	I mean, I don't know.
3999130	4000992	Drew Nami's raising his hand, you know.
4001499	4001880	I did it in Unreal.
4001900	4003061	We were playing Laser Tag.
4014745	4017106	and shoot people a lot in video games.
4017587	4020408	I am not actually going to shoot a real person.
4020508	4022630	I'm a smart, intelligent person who knows the difference.
4022730	4026832	And even still, 99.99% of the population is like me.
4026952	4028793	Playing Counter-Strike does not make you a killer.
4029013	4030854	It doesn't even teach you how to shoot a gun.
4031014	4032915	I mean, it's a video game.
4034558	4036179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4062830	4063490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4093137	4093817	More gaming news.
4116505	4117165	All right.
4117205	4117265	Yay.
4141156	4146678	City of Heroes is, again, one of those games on my big list of games I would like to play, but I just don't find the time to play them.
4147238	4148599	But I bet City of Heroes is a lot of fun.
4148619	4149379	Have you ever played that?
4150059	4151080	No, I want to.
4151140	4152160	I was going to try a demo.
4153141	4153561	Some point.
4154681	4154941	All right.
4155401	4159743	Well, at least I'll have this thing waiting for me whenever I finally play the damn game.
4160454	4161795	Something interesting to come out.
4163056	4163576	It's kind of neat.
4163856	4169880	It's a dance pad for DDR type games or music rhythm games that's using lasers.
4170120	4175743	Instead of the normal pressure sensors or push button switches and stuff, this one actually uses lasers.
4175803	4178925	So if you cut the beam, it counts as a button press.
4179885	4182006	It's the brand new Laser Dance Matrix.
4182226	4182667	Not a pad.
4184488	4188390	And what's actually kind of neat about it is it wouldn't really break down, especially since you're not really
4189124	4189584	Thank you for watching!
4211246	4211806	I think it's cool.
4211946	4215948	I mean, definitely, they should actually kind of do this with the arcade games.
4216288	4218968	It would probably be a whole lot less teching of the pads.
4220909	4223870	I never even thought of this idea, and it seems brilliant.
4223930	4225931	How can this fail unless the laser goes dead?
4225971	4232673	There is, yeah, seriously, there's no way that this laser would, I mean, there's no way for a button to press the fail.
4232873	4236334	I mean, at all, unless you just didn't step far enough into the pad.
4236514	4237454	Or you kick a laser.
4237674	4238295	I don't understand.
4238335	4239115	How could Blu-ray fail?
4242124	4242925	This is different.
4242985	4244206	I can give you a couple examples.
4244226	4246348	There's not competing laser technology.
4246388	4247648	Well, maybe there is, but you know what I mean.
4247689	4248149	I'm joking.
4248209	4249030	Laser is a laser.
4253348	4254709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4274947	4276948	And that didn't cost anything.
4276968	4278909	I think you can get those at 99-cent stores now.
4279049	4293474	The only thing I could see that there would be a problem with is if you did happen to bump the laser or something, if it's not in a very protective housing, you could unalign it and then there's some calibration issues or maybe light interference from other things.
4293855	4301498	But if it's able to detect a certain wavelength of light or something like that, then it probably would work pretty well.
4301978	4302238	I don't know.
4302745	4306146	HitStun in chat says, doesn't anybody else here remember the Sega Activator?
4306206	4306966	It sucked ass.
4306986	4307927	Did that run on lasers?
4307967	4308927	That's all infrared, though.
4309087	4309687	That's infrared.
4310087	4311048	Infrared's different, right?
4311308	4315169	Infrared's low frequency, and it would, you know, it's not exactly a beam.
4315209	4317810	It's more of just kind of a light source, almost.
4318530	4322211	Like, isn't that like, um, because the Wii... It's like the Paraparaparadise pad.
4322231	4322951	Or the Wii, right?
4323031	4325032	Isn't that little Wii thing that's on top of your TV?
4325072	4325772	Isn't that infrared?
4325852	4326953	Yeah, it's infrared as well.
4327953	4331174	Why the fuck they don't have a calibration thing on that is beyond me.
4331980	4333161	Come on, Nintendo!
4333441	4334422	It makes sense!
4335162	4338324	Now our chatroom is full of LaserCats jokes as well.
4338984	4340685	Just, you know, everything from that sketch.
4340705	4344067	Because, you know, we've talked about LaserCats the game on the program before.
4344107	4353673	The one thing that will definitively end the next-gen war will be the console that can get LaserCats the game as an exclusive will be the winner of the next-gen war in the OLR book.
4354294	4356175	Frickin' LaserBeans on some frickin' cats.
4356255	4357155	Is that too hard to ask?
4358156	4359457	What if it's like the PlayStation 2?
4360962	4363184	Then the PlayStation 2 wins the next-gen war.
4364685	4365526	Don't buy any of them.
4365566	4366207	Keep your PS2.
4366447	4367588	It has laser cats.
4369390	4371772	Seriously, whoever gets laser cats wins.
4372352	4372633	All right.
4373333	4377477	And you're a winner for listening to Orange Lounge Radio, but we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4377957	4386385	And for those of you listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in a couple days with our Part B. This way we spread the OLR love throughout the week.
4386735	4392015	those of you listening live don't have to wait quite as long we'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio
