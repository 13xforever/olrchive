00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Fauna Bay!

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
And we're here live at Fauna Bay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
So thank you guys very much. I appreciate that.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
And Loki's Mack Heckler is back from last year, so we appreciate you coming out.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Welcome to Fauna Bay everybody.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you guys so much for coming out and we have verified Loki is recording this year, so we appreciate that, yes?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
It's not paused, I'm paused.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Alright, awesome. So we're going to get right into it.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
You know we like to start off our show talking about our gaming week and what we've been into.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off. How was your gaming week?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I've been playing with my Pokemans. Let me show you them.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Are they in your pants right now?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No, they're in my purse.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, okay. That's not as exciting.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And also he had the double dragon thing. He's been playing a lot of that.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You're so random sometimes.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, no.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Do we have any Saturn fans in the house?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
You know it's a dead system, right? They don't make games for it anymore.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It will never die.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Alright.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Knights.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Hey look, Sega's making the new knights for the Wii and Sega's track record.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm not too excited, I have to say.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Everything's been a let down since Phantasy Star Universe.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Anything else, Dark Sakura?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
No.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
No, alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because I can't stop playing the damn game.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
Now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on two gig memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So this is going to be even faster. About ten times faster actually.

02:55.000 --> 03:06.000
And then, other than that, just co-op Crackdown and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta. Not too much because I don't really care.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Is it just me or is Halo 3 just Halo 2 like a little prettier?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I thought it was just me. But I've never been a big fan of first person shooters.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
At least you can jump in it. I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
It's like jump technology. It's now. It's not later.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Perfect dark zero jumping?

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, seriously. You need to be able to jump in that game.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Alright. My gaming week. Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week. I've played about every new game they have out there.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
And Russian Attack. What was that? I never played that game back in the 80s. I don't even remember that game.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I remember. It's really hard.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past ten years.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
So it should be no surprise that the game showed up on Xbox Live. But they did a nice job with it. It's nice.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And you get punched in the face when you die. And that's kind of funny.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
And sometimes they punch you in the back. And my roommate was like, did you just get donkey punched to death?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
We don't have any kids in the audience.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive. They just hate us.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
We need Kid Dracula for life.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
They hate us. I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Like, you know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
No. If you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Like, I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s. You know, like your Gradius and your R-types of the world.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
R-type is sexy.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Exactly. All right. So that's it. How about you guys? What have you been playing this week?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Wow.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Pokemons. Wow.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Mario.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Mario. Pop and music.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
DJ Max Portable 2.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Huh?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
DJ Max Portable 2.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
DJ Max Portable 2. Oh, that's a hardcore music fan there.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Stolen copies of Oh and Don 2. All right.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Luckily, no one listens to this show, so the feds won't be after you.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So I play it like you stole it?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
BBNA 2DS. I actually did play Oh and Don 2, speaking of that.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
It's, you know, there's a, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
But, no, it's not as good. But they have a mode in it in Oh and Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And it makes the game infinitely harder. It's kind of sad. So I'm really horrible at it.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
So, anyway, some quick housekeeping. Since this is going to our podcast feed, we just wanted to say for our listeners out there,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
we're actually not going to be live on June 10th, because I'm going on vacation.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
And so everybody's going on vacation that week, so there'll be no live show June 10th.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
That's the week after this one. No Disneyland this time.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
No Disneyland.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm actually going to New York City this time.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And actually we have, straight from New York City in the back there, Rama.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
If you've ever listened to the show, he's the guy that calls in like every week.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
He's here. Come up here and say something, Rama.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Did anybody come from further than New York? I didn't think so.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So say something to the folks, Rama.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Call in first.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Ring, ring. How you doing?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm doing good. How about you guys?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Good. So we're going to hang in New York City, right? We're going to do another OLR con something.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh, yeah. Let me ask you, do you like sushi?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's all right.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I know, a couple of cool places.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Sounds good. All right. So we'll check the forums for more information on the Meetup.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Maybe.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
All right. Sounds good.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
But if it wasn't for dark soccer, I would not be here.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Thank you, Rama.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
That makes me feel happy in a special place.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Careful. This is a family event. All right.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
In my liver.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I was going to ask if there's any other website plugs in the house, because we're here pimping our website.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
We thought we'd give you a chance to pimp yours since you came out and saw us.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Anybody have a website?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Anime secrets dot org.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Anybody else?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Anime hell dot org.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Anime hell dot org. That sounds like fun.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Anime sucks dot biz.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Anime sucks dot biz. Is that even a real site?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I think so.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
All right.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It's a dot biz site. Of course it's real.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You don't just give those to anybody.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says like Viagra, Viagra now, Viagra.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
No, it lists a bunch of different various themes on it. You can buy this for your soul or something.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Google dot com.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Google, Google dot com. How about porno2?

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
I found out though that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
All right.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
All right. Enough of the website plugs.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
No beetards allowed.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Let's get into some news this week, because we don't have a whole lot of time.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
We're going to talk about some gaming news. How many of you guys excited for a Super Smash Brothers Melee on the Nintendo Wii?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
About freaking time, I agree.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Brawl.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, whoops.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Yes, thank you. Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Sorry. I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while actually.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
But of course there's a website up the Smash Brothers Dojo and they have this whole blog going on there.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi Totaka.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
What's his name? The little, his dog?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Totakeke.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
That's right.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
And you have Kenji Yamamoto who did Super Metroid, the Metroid Prime series.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Jun Fukuda who did Killer7.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Other stuff too.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
This is amazing.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
They just have this whole list here.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
You've got the guy from Kingdom Hearts, Yoko Shimomura.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You've got the guy from Fire Emblem.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Yansori Mitsuda from Chrono Trigger.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And my favorite, Yuzoku Shiro from Actraiser Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum Tune.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum Tune in the game.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You think that would be one of the hidden characters?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
If it worked for Fighters Megamix, then...

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I hope our mics are picking up some of the heckling from the audience.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
That's great.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
So, yeah, what do you guys think might be some of the...

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
Because some folks are reading into this that maybe this list is going to be revealing some of the future hidden characters that we have in the game.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Like, you know, we have, yeah, you have, well, I don't know so much about Yuzoku Shiro because he's the narrative.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
But look, what if you had Chrono in the game?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Give us the master.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I was actually looking at Iraha for Silfied.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, you think of planets that come in and...

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
From Game Arch, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You know, well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
That would be fun.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Cut up Mario.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It would be a good time.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
We've already got Snake ready to garrote, you know.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Rama wants to see the Black Mage from...

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
All right, so yeah, that's that.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So I'm definitely looking forward to this game.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
And the website's been updating a lot with character profiles and all that stuff, so good times.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Well, in other news, you know, how many people are a fan of Geometry Wars?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Woo!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Woo, okay.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You know, like four? All right, good deal.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, there is some talk going around that Geometry Wars Galaxies is aiming for the Wii and the DS.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So imagine having your...

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh, on the Wii.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, one thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It is going to be multiplayer.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Online?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Online.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Online.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
On the Wii?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yes, on the Wii.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Then why would they say that they specified single-player?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, because they're going to have like the single-player campaign, right?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
No.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Story mode for Geometry Wars?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
A square approaches.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
So, they decided to kill them all.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Wow.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
That's going to be something else.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Well, here's how they are basically.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
In the nightmare of a mathematician.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
They said, well, early tests it says with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
This is according to a new story now on Joystick.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
So, interesting.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm more excited about the fact that the Wii version is online, because what Wii online

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
games do they have?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Nothing.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, Pokemon is going to be the first one.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That's not out yet.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
No, about a month.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Anyways.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I like Trauma Center online where you can, you know, kill your patients together.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Cause trauma.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
So, if you're, you know, a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
the download games, and coming to the Virtual Console soon you're going to have some pretty

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
kind of their version of the ESRB.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So, that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Also, according to Nintendo Power, coming to the Virtual Console there.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Paper Mario, the original.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
So, you'll be able to check that out as well.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Right?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
On the GameCube?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
anniversary collection.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Okay, and this you could probably pick up for 20 bucks new, maybe even less used, right?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
And they're going to charge me five bucks for old school Mega Man Y.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, because you'll buy it.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
People are stupid.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Is it the convenience of it?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, you can get it on eBay.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm sure it's not that hard to find.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh, but that involves me buying it online.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I mean, who shops online?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
14 bucks?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Game crazy, 14 bucks, says the audience.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
Which I could just play at home on the Neo Geo.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
By the way, it's about freaking time ActRaiser's on its way over here.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
It's rumored because ESRB has a rating now.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, come on.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Japan's got it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Europe's got it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
How long do I have to wait for my ActRaiser?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Forever.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's one word.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
How long am I supposed to download it?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I know.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Don't worry.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Don't worry, Rob.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
in a box.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
It's on schedule.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
And then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Joy.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
All right.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Thank you, Jamie.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Hey, only for one game.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
This is kind of interesting.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
There's a couple.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, I don't know.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, wait, wait.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I forgot.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh, my God.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Was it you that wrote it?

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fanboy.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
They were basically saying, what are you talking about?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
They didn't list all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know if that's a game or not.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Life is a game.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
All right.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, maybe, I don't know.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I don't know.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
No.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Well, then you won't care because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now thanks to the 1.80 patch.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Why can't it do?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled too.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
So that's kind of fun if you can actually notice the difference.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Ooh.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
My Epson printer sucks.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And PSP remote play over the Internet.

16:01.000 --> 16:12.000
One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out, though, a really nice high-scale printer that will do, you know, high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
So imagine something like that, though, with the, you know, printing out your PlayStation stuff to, you know, as nice as those would come out.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Rob.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Anyway.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Rob.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
What?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Rob.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Rob.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
What?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
All right.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
All right.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Even live.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
All right.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
So that's it.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
For God's sake, I'm healed by the power of evil.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
All right.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
So, Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
News wise.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Actually, yes.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
What's that?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Which is a big, you know, what do you?

16:51.000 --> 16:59.120
back up according to a game facts forum member that I know this is why I'm like

16:59.120 --> 17:08.160
well to be fair it's from PSN magazine it's it's a guy that saw it was a forum

17:08.160 --> 17:15.640
post by a guy who had a magazine but at any rate they were saying that rumors

17:15.640 --> 17:20.600
are popping up again about the six axis having rumble feature again and actually

17:20.600 --> 17:24.920
I could see it happening because you know Sony and immersion you know said

17:24.920 --> 17:30.560
okay this is stupid and you know money was involved of course so it could

17:30.560 --> 17:34.780
happen I don't really miss it the only game that I ever thought the rumble

17:34.780 --> 17:39.760
feature was any good in was like the first Metal Gear Solid I was to say

17:39.760 --> 17:42.840
yeah Metal Gear Solid 4 coming I will move your controller with the power of

17:42.840 --> 17:51.000
my mind it had a zen of gears reference to it before the game came out yeah

17:51.000 --> 17:55.240
remember rumble is so last-gen remember that I remember when you used to have to

17:55.240 --> 18:00.480
attach things to get your rumble oh is that is are you talking about the res

18:00.480 --> 18:12.680
thingy I'm talking about the Nintendo 64 anyways something coming to the

18:12.680 --> 18:19.200
PlayStation 3 and also 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 and it's getting a limited

18:19.200 --> 18:24.400
edition as well basically you're gonna get this nice little almost looks like a

18:24.400 --> 18:29.480
lockbox or a metal safety deposit box and included in that will be an art book

18:29.480 --> 18:33.880
a soundtrack which you know their soundtracks are always awesome and key

18:33.880 --> 18:40.040
chain and of course keys to the safety deposit box yay crap I don't need I have

18:40.040 --> 18:44.600
my order already you know that sounds like a good so and a limited-edition

18:44.600 --> 18:54.720
Rockstar duffel bag $90 okay that that's that's actually a good set that would be

18:54.720 --> 18:57.840
something worth while again the the card capture Sakura box on Dreamcast was

18:57.840 --> 19:04.880
ridiculous you know I can't I think it's cool to get an art book and to get you

19:04.880 --> 19:08.120
know a CD and to get a duffel bag I don't think it's as cool to get a plate

19:08.120 --> 19:14.640
o'clock and a fork how many of you cool kids want a Rockstar duffel bag that's

19:14.640 --> 19:17.760

19:17.760 --> 19:23.240
interesting hmm interesting all right all right anyhow if you want to get

19:23.240 --> 19:26.780

Konami already out in Japan or can I also say there's a Betty Boop game

24:00.640 --> 24:05.640
coming to Nintendo DS that's that's pretty awesome Betty Boop the game what

24:05.640 --> 24:11.220
do you do you touch her and she goes whatever star soldier though has a

24:11.220 --> 24:14.160
special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever

24:14.160 --> 24:20.560
star Parodia anyone ever is a PC engine fan star Parodia is a game where you

24:20.560 --> 24:28.240
play as bomber man or a flying PC engine or the what was the or this or the the

24:28.240 --> 24:30.600
plane from star soldier and you basically play through a parody of star

24:30.600 --> 24:34.840
soldier but but I like playing as a flying PC engine oh please say those

24:34.840 --> 24:39.660
titles there's two titles coming out from another smaller company called smart

24:39.660 --> 24:45.900
boys game room and smart girls playhouse what is the smart girl keeping her play

24:45.900 --> 24:50.440
house hi I don't know Jamie what is the smart girl keeping her playhouse assault

24:50.440 --> 24:57.320

25:14.760 --> 25:18.200

25:18.200 --> 25:24.000
medias Disney Edition good times medias Disney Edition I never did pick that up

25:24.000 --> 25:27.720
over here anybody have medias Disney Edition in the house anybody it's not

25:27.720 --> 25:31.960
much this is not selling very well remember remember medias Disney Edition

25:31.960 --> 25:41.440
goes faster at night I hate you um just kidding now this this is lawsuits must

25:41.440 --> 25:43.760
go faster at night as well because there's another one that just came out

25:43.760 --> 25:48.400
this week and Sony got the smackdown about blu-ray why are you applauding

25:48.400 --> 25:54.520
that that's kind of sad actually didn't Meg Z say so right from the beginning

25:54.520 --> 26:01.920
really what I don't remember what how can it fail well you of course you know

26:01.920 --> 26:04.920
Sony's already been in court before they had to pay all those damages to

26:04.920 --> 26:09.680
immersion over it and what happened is that target technology not the store but

26:09.680 --> 26:13.440
target technology actually filed the suit earlier this month and it has to do

26:13.440 --> 26:17.000
with patent violations and they're related to Sony's blu-ray technology and

26:17.000 --> 26:23.800
basically the Sony or the suit says that Sony America Sony Pictures Sony da DC it

26:23.800 --> 26:26.660
says that all their products marketed under the blu-ray name actually

26:26.660 --> 26:30.520
infringe on a patent that target already owns for these reflective layer

26:30.520 --> 26:34.480
materials and optical discs so it's another one of those like hey we

26:34.480 --> 26:37.520
invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about

26:37.520 --> 26:43.920
it until now no it seems like doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience no

26:43.920 --> 26:49.880
because they were using it on DVDs on dual layer DVDs for a while so but I'm

26:49.880 --> 26:54.400
talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now and that's that's what

26:54.400 --> 26:59.200
I mean about these lawsuits like did did somebody just roll out of bed and see

26:59.200 --> 27:02.360
the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3 you know how long things

27:02.360 --> 27:05.000
take in the corporate world once you realize that you've got a problem how

27:05.000 --> 27:09.360
long does it take to go through meetings check with legal I don't know do we have

27:09.360 --> 27:16.560
any rocks or fans in the house that might know anybody just just teasing

27:16.560 --> 27:21.680
little DDR joke by the way for any for anything that occurs in the corporate

27:21.680 --> 27:26.000
world you can expect at least a three month delay when before they start

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
thinking about doing something all right well this is sure to cause another

27:30.000 --> 27:35.320
lawsuit but yes no one can hear you no one here you're on the he's bringing up

27:35.320 --> 27:38.800
the whole issue with blackberry hurry up hurry up come on anyway that's 20

27:38.800 --> 27:44.320
minutes so they need to ask orange lunch go go go go go go rapid fanboy power go

27:44.320 --> 27:47.520
basically same thing happened with blackberry and research in motion

27:47.520 --> 27:50.400
research in motion suit blackberry over different copyright infringements and

27:50.400 --> 27:53.760
patent technologies and stuff they settled out but if they had one they

27:53.760 --> 27:56.760
would be no longer been able to sell blackberries and all that and those who

27:56.760 --> 28:03.520
use them would have been screwed that's a pretty massive market all right well

28:03.520 --> 28:07.240
speaking of things that are likely to get sued over the dark soccer likes to

28:07.240 --> 28:10.880

something it's like a pack of smokes you know I just wanted to say though that

29:36.380 --> 29:43.760
um Fanta may is a very special place or like a special time for me because I

29:43.760 --> 29:49.160
have a little a little bit of a story I want about to tell you all right it was

29:49.160 --> 29:55.200
like I think it was about 2001 it was 2001 it was over at the yes Santa Clara

29:55.200 --> 30:00.800
Convention Center and I believe it was um it was the same year that our good

30:00.800 --> 30:05.960
friend Mel had won his DDR machine it was it was yeah he won a solo 2000

30:05.960 --> 30:13.640
it was out March of 2001 and one of those nights I got a little a little

30:13.640 --> 30:20.360
tipsy rather inebriated and it was less than I was feeling the need to play some

30:20.360 --> 30:26.480
some DDR so I go down to where the DDR machines are at they had the solo

30:26.480 --> 30:30.520
machine right behind where the fourth place was that and I got my little games

30:30.520 --> 30:34.800
on played it I was really really little tipsy to a point where I actually tried

30:34.800 --> 30:41.160
to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the on the on the pad so but the knee drop

30:41.160 --> 30:46.880
was leet yeah it was next thing you know my friend Brandon decides you know

30:46.880 --> 30:52.640
checks me up puts a bandage on my knee and as I decide to uh sit down and try

30:52.640 --> 30:58.080
to relax try to relax and just like try to sober up so I sit down over at the

30:58.080 --> 31:02.760
right by the side of the ER machine and I'm sitting right next to this woman and

31:02.760 --> 31:10.360
I look to her and I say hi how are you my name is Wendell what are you and this

31:10.360 --> 31:17.320
woman I'm the love doctor and strangely enough the woman replies to me and says

31:17.320 --> 31:23.760
hi my name is Jamie otherwise known as Dark Sakura so this was the first time

31:23.760 --> 31:27.480
that I actually first met Dark Sakura and then I was formally introduced her

31:27.480 --> 31:33.080
at the you turn sober when I was sober later on in October for a tournament

31:33.080 --> 31:38.160
though Batman is probably like a very special place where I first met the very

31:38.160 --> 31:43.640
lovely and talented Dark Sakura there's another note to that you play DDR with

31:43.640 --> 31:47.120
me when I was still trying to pass sevens and you passed and you passed

31:47.120 --> 31:52.960
your first eight that night I think I believe it was drunk drunk yes also

31:52.960 --> 31:57.280
remember that after I spoke with her I proceeded to fall asleep right next to

31:57.280 --> 32:05.800
her and then everybody came up it was Mike no no no and all of them came and

32:05.800 --> 32:13.520
fetched you I think that was the case because I deprived and he was one night

32:13.520 --> 32:23.320
drunk I don't remember the rest of that night Wendell I got one more question

32:23.320 --> 32:26.040

32:26.040 --> 32:29.280

painful experience well then we won't we won't make it maybe that panel will

33:21.920 --> 33:26.800
you can pre-write your 2008 yes do it all right all right what's up next

33:26.800 --> 33:34.160
well an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic traveled

33:34.160 --> 33:42.200
through time killed a baby anyways and that is no not the Phantom Phantom

33:42.200 --> 33:48.880
never came out but anyways that is the claim apparently of some folks that are

33:48.880 --> 33:54.400
trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart claiming that an overheated Xbox power

33:54.400 --> 34:00.840
supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade

34:00.840 --> 34:07.640
unfortunately box stole my baby they're seeking they're seeking 50,000 in

34:07.640 --> 34:14.920
damages that's all yes you know this I really I really shouldn't make cuz you

34:14.920 --> 34:21.440
know a baby did die and that's really sad but somebody's suing Microsoft over

34:21.440 --> 34:25.440
but here's the best part though this is the best part remember this took place

34:25.440 --> 34:30.960
in December 2004 however Microsoft a representative was kind to remind us

34:30.960 --> 34:35.600
that the 360 was not available in December of 2004 and in fact came out a

34:35.600 --> 34:43.080
few years later I don't know about you guys but when I hear about idiotic

34:43.080 --> 34:47.000
lawsuits involving our beloved video games I get very angsty what about you

34:47.000 --> 34:51.240
guys I'm permanently angsty so you know what that means it's high time for the

34:51.240 --> 35:12.720
FUs of the week yes I can smell the funk a fanboy a mile down the road at the

35:12.720 --> 35:18.640
pita place do yourselves a favor if you're going to go to a convention if

35:18.640 --> 35:23.080
you can pay to get in and buy crap in the dealer's room you can afford to use

35:23.080 --> 35:29.040
a bathroom and at least buy some freaking deodorant hello

35:29.040 --> 35:33.800
the breeze in your you know package every year

35:36.160 --> 35:43.480
the breeze on my package might burn a little bit actually all right my FU of

35:43.480 --> 35:48.160

35:48.160 --> 35:51.840
passed on the way here they are out in force today

35:51.840 --> 35:58.040
my FU of the week goes to Comcast and I'll explain why I'm watching a TV show

35:58.040 --> 36:02.240
it sounds like this all sudden commercial comes on and it's like that

36:02.240 --> 36:08.480
I hate the fact that the volume jumps up like 50 fucking decimals when a

36:08.480 --> 36:13.360
commercial comes on I'm just sitting there watching TV all them buy stuff no

36:13.360 --> 36:21.760
it's like okay Wow so after you the Comcast um that's it for the FUs of the

36:21.760 --> 36:25.120
week we only have about 10 minutes left and we want to get to your questions so

36:25.120 --> 36:28.520
we're really gonna jam through these last few stories we have for you guys of

36:28.520 --> 36:31.120
course there's a lot of gaming news this week we couldn't get to but if you want

36:31.120 --> 36:36.440
to hear more tune in next week at orange lounge radio.com there is an 80 gigabyte

36:36.440 --> 36:40.840
PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea if you live in South Korea

36:40.840 --> 36:44.480
maybe they can put Starcraft on it eventually I'll be a good time so yeah

36:44.480 --> 36:47.800
that's gonna be coming over to South Korea it's gonna cost you five hundred

36:47.800 --> 36:52.400
and fifty six dollars and it lands on June 16th could it be coming to the US

36:52.400 --> 36:56.960
but what's 20 gigs gonna do I mean what exactly can you put on that drive right

36:56.960 --> 37:02.280

37:02.280 --> 37:05.640
Korea is actually gonna be coming out with a video on demand service as well

37:05.640 --> 37:12.520
so you know that's probably what they're gonna put on that drive unless it's

37:12.520 --> 37:17.360
Korean schoolgirl hentai I don't think most people are really gonna care well

37:17.360 --> 37:28.720
