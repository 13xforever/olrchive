00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Fauna Bay!

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And we're here live at Fauna Bay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So thank you guys very much. I appreciate that.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And Loki's Mack Heckler is back from last year, so we appreciate you coming out.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to Fauna Bay everybody.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you guys so much for coming out and we have verified Loki is recording this year, so we appreciate that, yes?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's not paused, I'm paused.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright, awesome. So we're going to get right into it.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know we like to start off our show talking about our gaming week and what we've been into.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off. How was your gaming week?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been playing with my Pokemans. Let me show you them.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are they in your pants right now?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, they're in my purse.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, okay. That's not as exciting.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, yeah.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And also he had the double dragon thing. He's been playing a lot of that.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're so random sometimes.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, no.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do we have any Saturn fans in the house?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You know it's a dead system, right? They don't make games for it anymore.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It will never die.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Knights.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey look, Sega's making the new knights for the Wii and Sega's track record.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not too excited, I have to say.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Everything's been a let down since Phantasy Star Universe.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Anything else, Dark Sakura?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I played more Earth Defense Force 2017 because I can't stop playing the damn game.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on two gig memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So this is going to be even faster. About ten times faster actually.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then, other than that, just co-op Crackdown and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta. Not too much because I don't really care.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is it just me or is Halo 3 just Halo 2 like a little prettier?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I thought it was just me. But I've never been a big fan of first person shooters.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
At least you can jump in it. I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's like jump technology. It's now. It's not later.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Perfect dark zero jumping?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, seriously. You need to be able to jump in that game.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alright. My gaming week. Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week. I've played about every new game they have out there.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And Russian Attack. What was that? I never played that game back in the 80s. I don't even remember that game.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I remember. It's really hard.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past ten years.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So it should be no surprise that the game showed up on Xbox Live. But they did a nice job with it. It's nice.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And you get punched in the face when you die. And that's kind of funny.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And sometimes they punch you in the back. And my roommate was like, did you just get donkey punched to death?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We don't have any kids in the audience.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive. They just hate us.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We need Kid Dracula for life.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They hate us. I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Like, you know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No. If you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Like, I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s. You know, like your Gradius and your R-types of the world.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
R-type is sexy.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Exactly. All right. So that's it. How about you guys? What have you been playing this week?

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wow.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Pokemons. Wow.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mario.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mario. Pop and music.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
DJ Max Portable 2.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Huh?

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
DJ Max Portable 2.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
DJ Max Portable 2. Oh, that's a hardcore music fan there.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Stolen copies of Oh and Don 2. All right.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Luckily, no one listens to this show, so the feds won't be after you.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I play it like you stole it?

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
BBNA 2DS. I actually did play Oh and Don 2, speaking of that.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's, you know, there's a, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But, no, it's not as good. But they have a mode in it in Oh and Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And it makes the game infinitely harder. It's kind of sad. So I'm really horrible at it.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So, anyway, some quick housekeeping. Since this is going to our podcast feed, we just wanted to say for our listeners out there,

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we're actually not going to be live on June 10th, because I'm going on vacation.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And so everybody's going on vacation that week, so there'll be no live show June 10th.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's the week after this one. No Disneyland this time.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No Disneyland.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm actually going to New York City this time.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And actually we have, straight from New York City in the back there, Rama.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you've ever listened to the show, he's the guy that calls in like every week.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He's here. Come up here and say something, Rama.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did anybody come from further than New York? I didn't think so.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So say something to the folks, Rama.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Call in first.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ring, ring. How you doing?

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm doing good. How about you guys?

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Good. So we're going to hang in New York City, right? We're going to do another OLR con something.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, yeah. Let me ask you, do you like sushi?

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's all right.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I know, a couple of cool places.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sounds good. All right. So we'll check the forums for more information on the Meetup.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Maybe.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right. Sounds good.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But if it wasn't for dark soccer, I would not be here.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Thank you, Rama.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That makes me feel happy in a special place.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Careful. This is a family event. All right.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In my liver.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was going to ask if there's any other website plugs in the house, because we're here pimping our website.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We thought we'd give you a chance to pimp yours since you came out and saw us.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Anybody have a website?

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Anime secrets dot org.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Anybody else?

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Anime hell dot org.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Anime hell dot org. That sounds like fun.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anime sucks dot biz.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Anime sucks dot biz. Is that even a real site?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think so.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a dot biz site. Of course it's real.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You don't just give those to anybody.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says like Viagra, Viagra now, Viagra.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, it lists a bunch of different various themes on it. You can buy this for your soul or something.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Google dot com.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Google, Google dot com. How about porno2?

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I found out though that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All right. Enough of the website plugs.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No beetards allowed.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's get into some news this week, because we don't have a whole lot of time.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We're going to talk about some gaming news. How many of you guys excited for a Super Smash Brothers Melee on the Nintendo Wii?

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
About freaking time, I agree.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brawl.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, whoops.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, thank you. Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sorry. I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while actually.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But of course there's a website up the Smash Brothers Dojo and they have this whole blog going on there.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi Totaka.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's his name? The little, his dog?

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Totakeke.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's right.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And you have Kenji Yamamoto who did Super Metroid, the Metroid Prime series.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Jun Fukuda who did Killer7.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Other stuff too.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is amazing.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They just have this whole list here.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You've got the guy from Kingdom Hearts, Yoko Shimomura.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You've got the guy from Fire Emblem.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yansori Mitsuda from Chrono Trigger.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And my favorite, Yuzoku Shiro from Actraiser Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum Tune.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum Tune in the game.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You think that would be one of the hidden characters?

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If it worked for Fighters Megamix, then...

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I hope our mics are picking up some of the heckling from the audience.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's great.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, yeah, what do you guys think might be some of the...

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because some folks are reading into this that maybe this list is going to be revealing some of the future hidden characters that we have in the game.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like, you know, we have, yeah, you have, well, I don't know so much about Yuzoku Shiro because he's the narrative.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But look, what if you had Chrono in the game?

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Give us the master.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was actually looking at Iraha for Silfied.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, you think of planets that come in and...

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
From Game Arch, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know, well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That would be fun.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Cut up Mario.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It would be a good time.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We've already got Snake ready to garrote, you know.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Rama wants to see the Black Mage from...

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right, so yeah, that's that.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I'm definitely looking forward to this game.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the website's been updating a lot with character profiles and all that stuff, so good times.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, in other news, you know, how many people are a fan of Geometry Wars?

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Woo!

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Woo, okay.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, like four? All right, good deal.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, there is some talk going around that Geometry Wars Galaxies is aiming for the Wii and the DS.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So imagine having your...

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, on the Wii.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around,

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, one thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It is going to be multiplayer.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Online?

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Online.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Online.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
On the Wii?

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, on the Wii.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then why would they say that they specified single-player?

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well, because they're going to have like the single-player campaign, right?

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Story mode for Geometry Wars?

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A square approaches.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, they decided to kill them all.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wow.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's going to be something else.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, here's how they are basically.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
In the nightmare of a mathematician.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They said, well, early tests it says with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising,

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is according to a new story now on Joystick.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So, interesting.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm more excited about the fact that the Wii version is online, because what Wii online

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
games do they have?

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Nothing.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, Pokemon is going to be the first one.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's not out yet.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, about a month.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Anyways.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I like Trauma Center online where you can, you know, kill your patients together.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Cause trauma.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So, if you're, you know, a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
the download games, and coming to the Virtual Console soon you're going to have some pretty

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there,

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
kind of their version of the ESRB.

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Also, according to Nintendo Power, coming to the Virtual Console there.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Paper Mario, the original.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, you'll be able to check that out as well.

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Right?

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
On the GameCube?

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
anniversary collection.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, and this you could probably pick up for 20 bucks new, maybe even less used, right?

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And they're going to charge me five bucks for old school Mega Man Y.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, because you'll buy it.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
People are stupid.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is it the convenience of it?

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, you can get it on eBay.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sure it's not that hard to find.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, but that involves me buying it online.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I mean, who shops online?

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
14 bucks?

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Game crazy, 14 bucks, says the audience.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Which I could just play at home on the Neo Geo.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
By the way, it's about freaking time ActRaiser's on its way over here.

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's rumored because ESRB has a rating now.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, come on.

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Japan's got it.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Europe's got it.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
How long do I have to wait for my ActRaiser?

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Forever.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's one word.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How long am I supposed to download it?

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I know.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't worry.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't worry, Rob.

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
in a box.

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's on schedule.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Joy.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All right.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you, Jamie.

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey, only for one game.

289
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is kind of interesting.

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There's a couple.

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.

292
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, I don't know.

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, wait, wait.

295
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I forgot.

296
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, my God.

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Was it you that wrote it?

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fanboy.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They were basically saying, what are you talking about?

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They didn't list all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know if that's a game or not.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Life is a game.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft,

308
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
All right.

310
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, maybe, I don't know.

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No.

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, then you won't care because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now thanks to the 1.80 patch.

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why can't it do?

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled too.

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So that's kind of fun if you can actually notice the difference.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ooh.

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My Epson printer sucks.

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And PSP remote play over the Internet.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:12,000
One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out, though, a really nice high-scale printer that will do, you know, high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So imagine something like that, though, with the, you know, printing out your PlayStation stuff to, you know, as nice as those would come out.

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Rob.

331
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Anyway.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Rob.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What?

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Rob.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Rob.

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What?

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All right.

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
All right.

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Even live.

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.

341
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
All right.

342
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So that's it.

343
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
For God's sake, I'm healed by the power of evil.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
All right.

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So, Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3?

346
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
News wise.

347
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Actually, yes.

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's that?

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Which is a big, you know, what do you?

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,120
back up according to a game facts forum member that I know this is why I'm like

351
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:08,160
well to be fair it's from PSN magazine it's it's a guy that saw it was a forum

352
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,640
post by a guy who had a magazine but at any rate they were saying that rumors

353
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,600
are popping up again about the six axis having rumble feature again and actually

354
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,920
I could see it happening because you know Sony and immersion you know said

355
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,560
okay this is stupid and you know money was involved of course so it could

356
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,780
happen I don't really miss it the only game that I ever thought the rumble

357
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,760
feature was any good in was like the first Metal Gear Solid I was to say

358
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,840
yeah Metal Gear Solid 4 coming I will move your controller with the power of

359
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,000
my mind it had a zen of gears reference to it before the game came out yeah

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,240
remember rumble is so last-gen remember that I remember when you used to have to

361
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,480
attach things to get your rumble oh is that is are you talking about the res

362
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:12,680
thingy I'm talking about the Nintendo 64 anyways something coming to the

363
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,200
PlayStation 3 and also 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 and it's getting a limited

364
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,400
edition as well basically you're gonna get this nice little almost looks like a

365
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,480
lockbox or a metal safety deposit box and included in that will be an art book

366
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,880
a soundtrack which you know their soundtracks are always awesome and key

367
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,040
chain and of course keys to the safety deposit box yay crap I don't need I have

368
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,600
my order already you know that sounds like a good so and a limited-edition

369
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:54,720
Rockstar duffel bag $90 okay that that's that's actually a good set that would be

370
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,840
something worth while again the the card capture Sakura box on Dreamcast was

371
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,880
ridiculous you know I can't I think it's cool to get an art book and to get you

372
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,120
know a CD and to get a duffel bag I don't think it's as cool to get a plate

373
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,640
o'clock and a fork how many of you cool kids want a Rockstar duffel bag that's

374
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
what I thought one two three all the girls raised their hand first that was

375
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,240

424
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,320
believe that they go trying anyways we're gonna see not a good bomber man

425
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,000

coming to Nintendo DS that's that's pretty awesome Betty Boop the game what

430
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,220
do you do you touch her and she goes whatever star soldier though has a

431
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,160
special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever

432
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,560
star Parodia anyone ever is a PC engine fan star Parodia is a game where you

433
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:28,240
play as bomber man or a flying PC engine or the what was the or this or the the

434
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,600
plane from star soldier and you basically play through a parody of star

435
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,840
soldier but but I like playing as a flying PC engine oh please say those

436
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,660

medias Disney Edition good times medias Disney Edition I never did pick that up

445
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,720
over here anybody have medias Disney Edition in the house anybody it's not

446
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,960
much this is not selling very well remember remember medias Disney Edition

447
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:41,440
goes faster at night I hate you um just kidding now this this is lawsuits must

448
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
go faster at night as well because there's another one that just came out

449
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,400
this week and Sony got the smackdown about blu-ray why are you applauding

450
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,520
that that's kind of sad actually didn't Meg Z say so right from the beginning

451
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,920
really what I don't remember what how can it fail well you of course you know

452
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Sony's already been in court before they had to pay all those damages to

453
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,680
immersion over it and what happened is that target technology not the store but

454
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,440
target technology actually filed the suit earlier this month and it has to do

455
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,000
with patent violations and they're related to Sony's blu-ray technology and

456
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,800
basically the Sony or the suit says that Sony America Sony Pictures Sony da DC it

457
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,660
says that all their products marketed under the blu-ray name actually

458
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,520
infringe on a patent that target already owns for these reflective layer

459
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,480
materials and optical discs so it's another one of those like hey we

460
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,520
invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about

461
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,920
it until now no it seems like doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience no

462
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,880
because they were using it on DVDs on dual layer DVDs for a while so but I'm

463
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,400
talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now and that's that's what

464
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,200
I mean about these lawsuits like did did somebody just roll out of bed and see

465
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,360
the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3 you know how long things

466
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,000
take in the corporate world once you realize that you've got a problem how

467
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,360
long does it take to go through meetings check with legal I don't know do we have

468
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,560
any rocks or fans in the house that might know anybody just just teasing

469
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,680
little DDR joke by the way for any for anything that occurs in the corporate

470
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,000
world you can expect at least a three month delay when before they start

471
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
thinking about doing something all right well this is sure to cause another

472
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,320
lawsuit but yes no one can hear you no one here you're on the he's bringing up

473
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,800
the whole issue with blackberry hurry up hurry up come on anyway that's 20

474
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,320
minutes so they need to ask orange lunch go go go go go go rapid fanboy power go

475
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,520
basically same thing happened with blackberry and research in motion

476
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,400
research in motion suit blackberry over different copyright infringements and

477
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,760
patent technologies and stuff they settled out but if they had one they

478
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,760
would be no longer been able to sell blackberries and all that and those who

479
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,520
use them would have been screwed that's a pretty massive market all right well

480
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,240
speaking of things that are likely to get sued over the dark soccer likes to

500
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,760
um Fanta may is a very special place or like a special time for me because I

501
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,160
have a little a little bit of a story I want about to tell you all right it was

502
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,200
like I think it was about 2001 it was 2001 it was over at the yes Santa Clara

503
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,800
Convention Center and I believe it was um it was the same year that our good

504
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,960
friend Mel had won his DDR machine it was it was yeah he won a solo 2000

505
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:13,640
it was out March of 2001 and one of those nights I got a little a little

506
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:20,360
tipsy rather inebriated and it was less than I was feeling the need to play some

507
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,480
some DDR so I go down to where the DDR machines are at they had the solo

508
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,520
machine right behind where the fourth place was that and I got my little games

509
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,800
on played it I was really really little tipsy to a point where I actually tried

510
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,160
to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the on the on the pad so but the knee drop

511
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,880
was leet yeah it was next thing you know my friend Brandon decides you know

512
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,640
checks me up puts a bandage on my knee and as I decide to uh sit down and try

513
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
to relax try to relax and just like try to sober up so I sit down over at the

514
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,760
right by the side of the ER machine and I'm sitting right next to this woman and

515
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,360
I look to her and I say hi how are you my name is Wendell what are you and this

516
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:17,320
woman I'm the love doctor and strangely enough the woman replies to me and says

517
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,760
hi my name is Jamie otherwise known as Dark Sakura so this was the first time

518
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,480
that I actually first met Dark Sakura and then I was formally introduced her

519
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,080
at the you turn sober when I was sober later on in October for a tournament

520
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,160
though Batman is probably like a very special place where I first met the very

521
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,640
lovely and talented Dark Sakura there's another note to that you play DDR with

522
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,120
me when I was still trying to pass sevens and you passed and you passed

523
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,960
your first eight that night I think I believe it was drunk drunk yes also

524
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,280
remember that after I spoke with her I proceeded to fall asleep right next to

525
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:05,800
her and then everybody came up it was Mike no no no and all of them came and

526
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:13,520
fetched you I think that was the case because I deprived and he was one night

527
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:23,320
drunk I don't remember the rest of that night Wendell I got one more question

528
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,040

541
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,920
about stories here so all right so the website of the week is Fonda me calm and

542
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,800
you can pre-write your 2008 yes do it all right all right what's up next

543
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,160
well an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic traveled

544
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:42,200
through time killed a baby anyways and that is no not the Phantom Phantom

545
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,880
never came out but anyways that is the claim apparently of some folks that are

546
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart claiming that an overheated Xbox power

547
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,840
supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade

548
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,640
unfortunately box stole my baby they're seeking they're seeking 50,000 in

549
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:14,920
damages that's all yes you know this I really I really shouldn't make cuz you

550
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:21,440
know a baby did die and that's really sad but somebody's suing Microsoft over

551
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,440
but here's the best part though this is the best part remember this took place

552
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,960
in December 2004 however Microsoft a representative was kind to remind us

553
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,600
that the 360 was not available in December of 2004 and in fact came out a

554
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:43,080
few years later I don't know about you guys but when I hear about idiotic

555
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,000
lawsuits involving our beloved video games I get very angsty what about you

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,240

557

my FU of the week goes to Comcast and I'll explain why I'm watching a TV show

566
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,240
it sounds like this all sudden commercial comes on and it's like that

567
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,480
I hate the fact that the volume jumps up like 50 fucking decimals when a

568
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,360
commercial comes on I'm just sitting there watching TV all them buy stuff no

569
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:21,760

week we only have about 10 minutes left and we want to get to your questions so

571
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,520
we're really gonna jam through these last few stories we have for you guys of

572
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,120
course there's a lot of gaming news this week we couldn't get to but if you want

573
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,440
to hear more tune in next week at orange lounge radio.com there is an 80 gigabyte

574
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,840
PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea if you live in South Korea

575
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,480
maybe they can put Starcraft on it eventually I'll be a good time so yeah

576
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,800
that's gonna be coming over to South Korea it's gonna cost you five hundred

577
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,400
and fifty six dollars and it lands on June 16th could it be coming to the US

578
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,960
but what's 20 gigs gonna do I mean what exactly can you put on that drive right

579
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,280
now well you have to remember though that the 80 gig ps3 that's coming out in

Korea is actually gonna be coming out with a video on demand service as well

581
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,520

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,360
Korean schoolgirl hentai I don't think most people are really gonna care well
