00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:20,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Funabay!

2
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:41,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:46,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here live at Fonamay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys very much.

6
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

7
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:51,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's Mac Heckler is back.

8
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

9
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing with my Pokemans.

10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me show you them.

11
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:58,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they in your pants right now?

12
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:20,993
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're in my purse.

13
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:21,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

14
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:22,374
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not as exciting.

15
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:33,741
[SPEAKER_08]: After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it, interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

16
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.

17
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:41,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.

18
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.

19
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?

20
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:52,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.

21
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And also he had the Double Dragon thing.

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,270
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been playing a lot of that.

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.

24
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:05,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so random sometimes.

25
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:07,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We have any Saturn fans in the house?

26
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,194
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's a dead system, right?

27
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make games for you anymore.

28
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:11,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It will never die.

29
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:13,515
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

30
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:17,676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

31
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:36,566
[SPEAKER_03]: because I can't stop playing the damn game.

32
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:42,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.

33
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:51,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on 2GB memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.

34
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be even faster, about 10 times faster, actually.

35
00:02:55,323 --> 00:02:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, other than that, just co-op...

36
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackdown, and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much, because I don't really care.

38
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:09,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me, or is Halo 3 just Halo 2, like a little prettier?

39
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:10,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I thought it was just me.

41
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:13,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never been a big fan of first-person shooters.

42
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:14,764
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you can jump in it.

43
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.

44
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:20,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like jump technology.

45
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now, it's not later.

46
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect Dark Zero jumping?

47
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously, you need to be able to jump in that game.

48
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:27,314
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

49
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:28,915
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week.

50
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.

51
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

52
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:38,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played about every new game they have out there.

53
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And Russian Attack.

54
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,119
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

55
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played that game back in the 80s.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember that game.

57
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

58
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.

59
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:50,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past 10 years.

60
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:50,988
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

61
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any kids in the audience.

62
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:10,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?

63
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive.

64
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:13,966
[SPEAKER_02]: They just hate us.

65
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,006
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Kid Dracula for life.

66
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:16,346
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate us.

67
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:20,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.

68
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:24,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?

69
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:31,088
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious, which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.

70
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s.

71
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:37,435
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Max Portable 2 DJ Max Portable 2

72
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,330
[SPEAKER_02]: BBNA 2DS.

73
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did play Owen Don 2, speaking of that.

74
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:12,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.

75
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:14,793
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not as good.

76
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:19,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have a mode in it, in Owen Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.

77
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:20,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes the game...

78
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,549
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

79
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:52,005
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy that calls in like every week.

80
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:52,826
[SPEAKER_02]: He's here.

81
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up here and say something, Ranma.

82
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anybody come from further than New York?

83
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think so.

84
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:01,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So say something to the folks, Ranma.

85
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:04,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Ring, ring.

86
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:05,269
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

87
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:06,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good.

88
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,169
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you guys?

89
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hang in New York City, right?

91
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do another OLR con something.

92
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask you, do you like sushi?

94
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

95
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a couple of cool places.

96
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:16,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

97
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,649
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we'll check the forums for more information on the meetup.

98
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

99
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:23,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

100
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:24,611
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sounds good.

101
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,773
[SPEAKER_10]: If it wasn't for DarkSakura, I would not be here.

102
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ranma.

103
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,236
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me feel happy in a special place.

104
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Careful, this is a family event.

105
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

106
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:40,298
[SPEAKER_08]: In my liver.

107
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: AnimeSecrets.org AnimeHell.org AnimeSucks.biz

108
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't just give those to anybody.

109
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says, like, Viagra, Viagra Now, Viagra... Anyway.

110
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,720
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it lists a bunch of different various, you know, themes on it.

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,902
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy this for your soul or something.

112
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, google.com.

113
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:35,770
[SPEAKER_08]: How about... However, I found out... I found out, though, that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.

114
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,210
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

115
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough of the...

116
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,121
[SPEAKER_08]: No B-tards allowed.

117
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some news this week because we don't have a whole lot of time.

118
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some gaming news.

119
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,667
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you guys are excited for Super Smash Bros.

120
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee on the Nintendo Wii?

121
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: About freaking time, I agree.

122
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:58,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.

123
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Super Smash Bros.

124
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:00,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while, actually.

126
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, there's a website up, the Smash Bros.

127
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Dojo, and they have this whole blog going on there.

128
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:12,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.

129
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:17,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.

130
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:22,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi, Totaka.

131
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:24,288
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name, the little...

132
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

133
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:50,258
[SPEAKER_02]: and my favorite, Yuzo Koshiro from Actraiser, Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum 2.

134
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.

135
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,206
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum 2 in the game.

136
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that would be one of the hidden characters?

137
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:01,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If it works for Fighters Megamix, then...

138
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually looking at Iraha for Sylphid.

139
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You think a plane's going to come in and shoot?

140
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:35,965
[SPEAKER_08]: From Game Arts, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.

141
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:39,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.

142
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.

143
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.

144
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?

145
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:46,234
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

146
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:47,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut up Mario.

147
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:48,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a good time.

148
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,618
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already got Snake ready to garrot.

149
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:54,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma wants to see the Black Mage.

150
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.

152
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.

153
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:38,381
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.

154
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?

155
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.

156
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:53,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.

157
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:59,388
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.

158
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.

159
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be multiplayer.

160
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:05,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the Wii?

161
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:06,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Online.

162
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,390
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Wii?

163
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, on the Wii.

164
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,011
[SPEAKER_08]: About freaking time.

165
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:11,632
[SPEAKER_08]: They specified single player.

166
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're going to have the single player campaign, right?

167
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:15,414
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

168
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Story mode for Geometry Wars?

169
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:20,777
[SPEAKER_02]: A square approaches.

170
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:26,079
[SPEAKER_07]: On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.

171
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So they decided to kill them all.

172
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:30,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

173
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,300
[SPEAKER_02]: How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?

174
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be something else.

175
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's how they're basically... In the nightmare of a mathematician.

176
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:46,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, well, early tests, it says, with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising, and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.

177
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:51,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Trauma Center Online, where you can, you know, kill your patients together.

178
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause trauma.

179
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:18,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of the download games.

180
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:28,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming to the Virtual Console soon, you're going to have some pretty good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there, kind of their version of the ESRB.

181
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.

182
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:39,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, according to Nintendo Power coming to the Virtual Console there, Paper Mario, the original.

183
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be able to check that out as well.

184
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:41,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

185
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:51,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?

186
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:52,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

187
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:52,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

188
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:52,883
[SPEAKER_02]: On the GameCube?

189
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,004
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

190
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and this you could probably pick up for $20 new, maybe even less used, right?

191
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

192
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.

193
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:02,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

194
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to charge me $5 for old school Mega Man Y. Yeah.

195
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:08,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you'll buy it.

196
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:09,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

197
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:11,065
[SPEAKER_03]: People are stupid.

198
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:12,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the convenience of it?

199
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.

200
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:16,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can get it on eBay.

201
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:17,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's not that hard to find.

202
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but that involves me buying it online.

203
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who shops online?

204
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:22,047
$14?

205
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,388
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCrazy, $14, says the audience.

206
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:35,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon, ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.

207
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.

208
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I can just play at home on the Neo Geo.

209
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,121
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, it's about freaking time.

210
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Actraiser's on its way over here.

211
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rumored, because ESRB has a rating now.

212
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on!

213
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan's got it, Europe's got it.

214
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,910
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do I have to wait for my Actraiser?

215
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever.

216
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, Rob.

217
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:06,058
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere.

218
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on schedule.

219
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

220
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,342
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel, and then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.

221
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy.

222
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

223
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:20,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?

224
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:21,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

225
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:23,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jamie.

226
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, only for one game.

227
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:27,948
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

228
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:30,321
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple.

229
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.

230
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:34,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

231
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:37,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.

232
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:37,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, wait.

233
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:38,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

234
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.

235
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

236
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?

237
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it you that wrote it?

238
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fan.

239
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.

240
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They were basically saying, what are you talking about?

241
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.

242
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:03,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it lists all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

243
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a game or not.

244
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:06,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Life is a game.

245
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:16,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft, and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.

246
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,907
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, maybe, I don't know, maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.

247
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:22,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

248
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:24,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?

249
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:24,709
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

250
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:29,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then you won't care, because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now, thanks to the 1.80 patch.

251
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.

252
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled, too.

253
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of fun, if you can actually notice the difference.

254
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.

255
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:46,012
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.

256
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:48,433
[SPEAKER_02]: My Epson printer sucks.

257
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:54,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.

258
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:58,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.

259
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:00,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And PSP remote play over the internet.

260
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:10,785
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out a really nice high-scale printer that will do high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.

261
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:20,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So imagine something like that, though, with printing out your PlayStation stuff as nice as those would come out.

262
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?

263
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

264
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:25,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

265
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:26,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

266
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:26,777
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

267
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

268
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:27,598
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

269
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:28,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

270
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,600
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

271
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.

272
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:35,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's it.

273
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fueled by the power of evil.

274
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3, news-wise?

275
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:43,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yes.

276
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

277
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a big, you know, whoop-de-hoo.

278
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:56,034
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, there's rumors coming back up, according to a GameFAQs forum member that... GameFAQs?

279
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, this is why I'm like, who?

280
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:03,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to be fair, it's... The guy from PSN Magazine.

281
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a guy that saw, it was a forum post by a guy who had a magazine.

282
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, who?

283
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:14,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

284
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:50,305
[SPEAKER_08]: and it had a Zetagears reference to it before the game came out.

285
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:53,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, remember, Rumble is so last gen.

286
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

287
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when you used to have to attach things to get your Rumble.

288
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are you talking about the Rez thingy?

289
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:07,521
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm talking about the... I'm talking about the Nintendo 64... Anyways...

290
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:20,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Something coming to the PlayStation 3 and also the 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, and it's getting a limited edition as well.

291
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:32,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you're going to get this nice little, almost looks like a lockbox or a metal safety deposit box, and included in that will be an art book, a soundtrack, which, you know, their soundtracks are always awesome.

292
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,133
[SPEAKER_03]: and Keychain and of course keys to the safety deposit box.

293
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:37,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

294
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:38,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap I don't need!

295
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I have mine on order already.

296
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:43,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a good set.

297
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And a limited edition Rockstar duffel bag.

298
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,344
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the price point on that?

299
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:50,344
$90.

300
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's actually a good set.

301
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,748
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be something worthwhile to get.

302
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,270
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cardcaptor Sakura box on Dreamcastle is ridiculous.

303
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:06,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cool to get an art book and to get a CD and to get a duffel bag.

304
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's as cool to get a plate, a clock, and a fork.

305
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,331
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you cool kids want a rock star duffel bag?

306
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:14,992
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.

307
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:15,612
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three.

308
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,513
[SPEAKER_02]: All the girls raised their hand first.

309
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:18,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting.

310
00:19:19,655 --> 00:19:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

311
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:20,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

312
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:26,297
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, if you want to get something a little more sooner than that, there's some release dates.

313
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:32,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the best part of the show, by the way, especially for you guys here, because I know a lot of you guys are into your anime and all that stuff.

314
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:36,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to hear me horribly mispronounce Japanese release dates.

315
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

316
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,745
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to horribly hear me pronounce this stuff.

317
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:44,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have coming out in Japan, we have Foza Force.

318
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even pronounce the English ones right.

319
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,630
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

320
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:47,710
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

321
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so nervous.

322
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel naked because everybody's looking at us.

323
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:52,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God you're not really.

324
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out in the Asian regions anyway because it's coming to the U.S.

325
00:19:58,014 --> 00:19:58,454
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.

326
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Any Forza fans in the house?

327
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:01,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I see one hand.

328
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming to the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard 4, which you know is Resident Evil 4, on May 31st.

329
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little more than a week out, but it's almost coming.

330
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:23,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And also coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot, over on the PlayStation 2, you get Guilty Gear XX Accent Core is coming out in Japan on May 31st.

331
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilty Gear fans in the house.

332
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally going to be getting that.

333
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:33,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And hooray, another Pachinko game, Aladdin Destiny from Sega.

334
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega cranks out these Pachinko games every week over there.

335
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like brain training.

336
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:43,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's my favorite title of the week, Love Drops.

337
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan from Dimple Entertainment.

338
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:49,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this one seems cute.

339
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing you some love drops.

340
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:55,245
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny because that's Sasa's old nickname, the Kirito.

341
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Love drops?

342
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:57,726
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the Kirito one.

343
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:58,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I want love drops.

344
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:02,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Panic Palette is another game coming out over in Japan as well.

345
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I say Galaxy Angel?

346
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:09,451
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, New Zealand Story DS, another update of an old-ass game.

347
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure on May 31st.

348
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,253
[SPEAKER_02]: New Zealand Story, that's an old-ass game.

349
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Boring, I know.

350
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to the New Zealanders who may be listening.

351
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, coming out in the U.S., a whole lot of, I don't know.

352
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Surf Supps coming out on almost everything, although you probably won't be playing it.

353
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Forza Motorsports 2 on the 360.

354
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Forza!

355
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadowrun on the 360 and for Vista.

356
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:43,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, are we sure it won't get delayed due to partial nudity?

357
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

358
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,638
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have an advanced release with extra partial nudity.

359
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:54,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is coming out on 360, so that should be pretty cool.

360
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:55,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

361
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:57,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a small little title.

362
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Party 8 is going to be coming out as well.

363
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Tamagotchi Party On for the Wii.

364
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,251
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Tamagotchi fan in the house.

365
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:05,812
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

366
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:07,993
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

367
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got the first one at home.

368
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the DS, Pony Friends.

369
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake Me Up When It's My Little Pony Friends.

370
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tank Beat, which is actually kind of neat.

371
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Pony Friends, Jamie.

372
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:21,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

373
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:25,117
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP also has Crush coming out.

374
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be pretty cool.

375
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on PC, you've always got a bunch of weird name titles, including...

376
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:38,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream Day Wedding, and Circus Empire.

377
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like one of those roller coaster tycoon type games, Circus Empire?

378
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:44,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

379
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:47,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have an attraction where clowns kill each other.

380
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty fun.

381
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:50,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Clown Survivor.

382
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

383
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:53,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I still like Clown Quake.

384
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:55,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The old Quake mod.

385
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:56,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is there like an old mod?

386
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:56,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

387
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:56,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

388
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:57,752
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

389
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:00,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Why doesn't Xbox 360 put mods for like Doom and stuff?

390
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:01,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's downloadable.

391
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:04,415
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they totally need to start doing the old Quake mods up.

392
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,556
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but like legit mods, you know?

393
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that Microsoft approves.

394
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, this can be downloadable content.

395
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, change all the Doom sprites to... You know what I want on Xbox Live?

396
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:13,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I want ASCII Quake.

397
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:25,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also going to mention, real quick, this is kind of an exclusive, no one's heard about this yet, but... Uh-oh, here we go again, we're going to get busted.

398
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:26,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a Namco game, is it?

399
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:28,520
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay, I have my cyanide pill ready.

400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.

401
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No, coming out to the U.S.

402
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:37,089
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be remakes of old Hudson titles, and these are not being released by Konami, it's being released by yet another company.

403
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that they go... I'm trying to...

404
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, we're going to see, not a good Bomberman, but we're going to see remakes of Adventure Island, Bonk, and Star Soldier coming out over here in the fall.

405
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are going to be starting in August and kind of running through the rest of the year.

406
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,333
[SPEAKER_03]: But those will not be coming from Konami.

407
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,074
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already out in Japan already.

408
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I also say there's a Betty Boop game coming to Nintendo DS?

409
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

410
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Betty Boop the game.

411
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you touch her and she goes, boop, boop, boop?

412
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:08,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope not.

413
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:15,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Soldier, though, has a special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever, Star Parodia.

414
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone ever a PC Engine fan?

415
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:30,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Parodia is a game where you play as Bomberman or a flying PC Engine or the plane from Star Soldier and you basically play through a parody of Star Soldier.

416
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,799
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like playing as a flying PC Engine.

417
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, please say those titles.

418
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:42,179
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two titles coming out from another smaller company called Smart Boys Game Room and Smart Girls Playhouse.

419
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,200
[SPEAKER_02]: What does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?

420
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

421
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, what does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?

422
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:50,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Assault weapons.

423
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:52,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

424
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, your turn.

425
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, coming out in the UK, a few things.

426
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:59,306
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 31st, we have the Marvel Trading Card Game.

427
00:24:59,606 --> 00:25:00,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

428
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

429
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: On the first, we have Capcom Puzzle World, Legend of the Dragon, SBK07 Super Bike World Championship, Shadowrun for PC, and a History Channel game, Great Battles of Rome.

430
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, and Tomb Raider, but who cares?

431
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and Wario Master of Disguise.

432
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And Meteus Disney Edition.

433
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

434
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteos Disney Edition.

435
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:24,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did pick that up over here.

436
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have Meteos Disney Edition in the house?

437
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:27,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

438
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not much different.

439
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not selling very well.

440
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:32,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, Meteos Disney Edition goes faster at night.

441
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:36,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

442
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

443
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, Sony's already been in court before.

444
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:05,929
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to pay all those damages to Immersion over it.

445
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:12,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened is that Target Technology, not the store, but Target Technology actually filed a suit earlier this month.

446
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do with patent violations, and they're related to Sony's Blu-ray technology.

447
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:32,145
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically the suit says that Sony America, Sony Pictures, Sony DADC, it says that all their products marketed under the Blu-ray name actually infringe on a patent that Target already owns for these reflective layer materials and optical discs.

448
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:38,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's another one of those like, hey, we invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about it until now.

449
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:41,888
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they've been using it.

450
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:43,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience.

451
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:48,190
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they were using it on DVDs, on dual-layer DVDs for a while.

452
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now?

453
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:55,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what always puzzles me about these lawsuits.

454
00:26:56,172 --> 00:27:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, did somebody just roll out of bed and see the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3?

455
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:03,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, you know how long things take in the corporate world.

456
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:06,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you realize that you've got a problem, how long does it take to go through meetings, check with legal...

457
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, do we have any Rockstar fans in the house that might know?

458
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

459
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teasing.

460
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Little DDR joke, by the way.

461
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:23,806
[SPEAKER_08]: For anything that occurs in the corporate world, you can expect at least a three-month delay.

462
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:27,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Before they start thinking about doing something.

463
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:28,729
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

464
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is sure to cause another lawsuit.

465
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:31,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

466
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:33,592
[SPEAKER_02]: No one can hear you.

467
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no one can hear you, Ranma.

468
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,734
[SPEAKER_08]: He's bringing up the whole issue with BlackBerry.

469
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:37,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry up, hurry up.

470
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:37,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

471
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 20 minutes.

472
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, go, go, go, go.

473
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:44,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid fanboy power, go.

474
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, same thing happened with BlackBerry and Research in Motion.

475
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:51,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Research in Motion sued BlackBerry over different copyright infringements and patent technologies and stuff.

476
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:57,839
[SPEAKER_10]: They settled out, but if they had won, they would have no longer been able to sell BlackBerrys and all that, and those who use them would have been screwed.

477
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty massive market.

478
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:03,141
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

479
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:15,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of things that are likely to get sued over, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down and all over every week and find her favorite website to share with you guys, and we call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

480
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wrong music, by the way.

481
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have.

482
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, boys and girls.

483
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:22,711
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

484
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,032
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just go with it.

485
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:24,552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

486
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:30,735
[SPEAKER_08]: My Website of the Week is fairly simple, one that you've all been to if you're here at faname.com.

487
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for the staff.

488
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Fonamay.com, let's hear it for the Fonamay staff.

489
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell from Stage Zero's in the house.

490
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: My hero.

491
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:42,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell, did you hear me yelling at you earlier to take it off?

492
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:51,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, before we came up to the room, I said something a lot nicer.

493
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:53,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, here he comes.

494
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell's coming towards the front of the room.

495
00:28:56,865 --> 00:29:00,807
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we do want to say a big thanks to the Fonamay staff, though, for having us here a second year in a row, suckers.

496
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we appreciate you coming over.

497
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

498
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of my voice that's been kind of... What the fuck happened to your voice?

499
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:08,503
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

500
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:11,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily that I've been working all day.

501
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that I've had really bad allergies over the last two weeks.

502
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the county that I'm living in, it's just horrible.

503
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming down to San Jose, I've been breathing a little better.

504
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:25,570
[SPEAKER_04]: My voice is being a little better, but I know by the end of the convention I'll be all right.

505
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, DarkSakura.

506
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:28,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Tic Tacs?

507
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,068
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got me some... It's like a pack of smokes from right here.

508
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:33,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I ain't gonna help.

509
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,631
[SPEAKER_08]: They're lozenges from Ikea.

510
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:47,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, though, that Fatima is a very special place, or like a special time for me, because I have a little bit of a story that I'm about to tell you.

511
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:47,962
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

512
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:53,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I think it was about 2001.

513
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:53,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 2001.

514
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It was over at the Santa Clara Convention Center.

515
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:56,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

516
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:03,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was the same year that our good friend Mel had won his DDR machine.

517
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:03,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

518
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:06,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he won his solo 2000 machine.

519
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about March of 2001.

520
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those nights I got a little tipsy, rather inebriated, and I was feeling the need to play some DDR.

521
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:25,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go down to where the DDR machines are at.

522
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the solo machine.

523
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Right behind where the fourth plus was at.

524
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:31,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got my little games on, played it.

525
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really, really, a little tipsy to a point where I actually tried to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the pad.

526
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: But the knee drop was late.

527
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.

528
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:48,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing you know, my friend Brandon decides, you know, checks me up, puts a bandage on my knee.

529
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:55,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I decide to sit down and try to relax, try to relax and just like try to sober up.

530
00:30:56,021 --> 00:31:06,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I sit down over at the, right by the side of the ER machine, and I'm sitting right next to this woman, and I look to her and I say, Hi, how are you?

531
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:08,569
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Wendell.

532
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,750
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you?

533
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And this woman... And I'm the love doctor.

534
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:21,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And strangely enough, the woman replies to me and says, Hi, my name is Jamie, otherwise known as DarkSakura.

535
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:24,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this was the first time that I actually first met

536
00:31:25,472 --> 00:31:28,634
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, and then I was formally introduced to her at the tournament.

537
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:29,275
[SPEAKER_06]: When you were sober.

538
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,997
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was sober, later on in October for a tournament.

539
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:41,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anime is probably like a very special place where I first met the very lovely and talented DarkSakura.

540
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:42,403
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another note to that.

541
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:48,668
[SPEAKER_08]: You played DDR with me when I was still trying to pass sevens, and you passed your first eight that night, I think.

542
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was.

543
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:50,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunk.

544
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:51,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunk, yes.

545
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

546
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:57,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I also remember that after I spoke with her, I proceeded to fall asleep right next to her.

547
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And then everybody came up.

548
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:03,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Mike Noe and Mel.

549
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,406
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of them came and fetched you.

550
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the case because I don't remember the rest of it.

551
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I was two days sleep deprived and he was one night drunk.

552
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the rest of that night.

553
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, bye Wendell, nice to meet you.

554
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:20,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sit here.

555
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:26,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell, I got one more question for you before we get back to the game news because we've only got 15 minutes left.

556
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, thank you since you're here and you're on Fanime staff for having us, of course, again this year.

557
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:33,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanime is very thankful that you came by once again.

558
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:34,855
[SPEAKER_02]: No problemo.

559
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good times, good times.

560
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:39,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to see people play dress-up except on Halloween usually, so this is a good time.

561
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you have to do to get those beats?

562
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,147
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I wanted to ask.

563
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:51,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a painful experience.

564
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:51,863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

565
00:32:51,884 --> 00:32:53,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then we won't make it.

566
00:32:53,024 --> 00:32:55,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that panel will happen actually later on tonight.

567
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

568
00:32:55,825 --> 00:33:00,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically had to pay for it online with like $10 worth of shipping and handling.

569
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:01,466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

570
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:05,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Wendell from Stage Zero, everybody, thank you for reminiscing.

571
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to head back to Stage Zero myself, so I got to do it.

572
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

573
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love to Jamie.

574
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love to Rob.

575
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,509
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Loki?

576
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:12,609
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

577
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, sir.

578
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get random celebrity drop-ins from the Faname staff.

579
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

580
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,493
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, to reminisce about stories here.

581
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, so the website of the week is Fonamay.com, and you can pre-reg for 2008.

582
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:24,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can.

583
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:24,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

584
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:25,035
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

585
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:26,656
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's up next?

586
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:36,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic, traveled through time, killed a baby.

587
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:41,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, and that is, no, not the Phantom.

588
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:42,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantom never came out.

589
00:33:43,906 --> 00:34:00,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, that is the claim, apparently, of some folks that are trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart, claiming that an overheated Xbox power supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade.

590
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately... The Xbox stole my baby!

591
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:05,779
[SPEAKER_03]: They are seeking $50,000 in damages.

592
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:06,139
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all?

593
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

594
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:16,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I really shouldn't make, because a baby did die, and that's really sad.

595
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:23,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody's suing Microsoft over... But here's the best part, though.

596
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:24,225
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best part.

597
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, this took place in December 2004.

598
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:36,509
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Microsoft, a representative, was kind to remind us that the 360 was not available in December of 2004, and in fact came out a few years later.

599
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and it is.

600
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,122
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week is addressed to the people who are not bathing at this convention.

601
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:13,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I can smell the funk of fanboy a mile down the road at the pita place.

602
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:16,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Do yourselves a favor.

603
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are going to go to a convention, if you can pay to get in and buy crap in the dealer's room, you can afford to use a bathroom and at least buy some freaking deodorant.

604
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:26,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

605
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:31,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They should put Febreze in your package every year.

606
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:34,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Use it, babe, please.

607
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Fanboy Funk is not sexy.

608
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:39,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Febreze on my package might burn a little bit, actually.

609
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:48,976
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my FU of the week would go to traffic on the way down here and the five CHP officers I passed on the way here.

610
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They are out in force today.

611
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

612
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:56,498
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to Comcast, and I'll explain why.

613
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching a TV show, it sounds like this.

614
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:02,021
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, commercial comes on, and it's like that.

615
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,244
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

616
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:39,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea.

617
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:40,902
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in South Korea.

618
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they can put StarCraft on it eventually.

619
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:43,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a good time.

620
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, that's going to be coming over to South Korea.

621
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:50,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to cost you $556 and it lands on June 16th.

622
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be coming to the U.S.?

623
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's 20 gigs going to do?

624
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:57,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what exactly can you put on that drive right now?

625
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:05,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have to remember, though, that the 80-gig PS3 that's coming out in Korea is actually going to be coming out with a video-on-demand service as well.

626
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:11,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's probably what they're going to put on that drive.

627
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's Korean schoolgirl hentai, I don't think most people are really going to care.

628
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:19,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I could import them.

629
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:21,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

630
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:22,588
[SPEAKER_08]: No, really.

631
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

632
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:25,618
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

633
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:35,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Famitsu is talking about, well, it's an ad out for a new R-Type that's an R-Type Tactics, and all I have to say to that is, what the hell?

634
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:40,486
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just give me more R-Type, regular old R-Type with shooting things.

635
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:43,167
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly is R-Type Tactics?

636
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:44,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you have to move your ship around?

637
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:45,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

638
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so stupid.

639
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to make every game into a Tactics game.

640
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S.

641
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: anytime soon.

642
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:59,060
[SPEAKER_08]: There was only one really good tactics game, and that's none of them.

643
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

644
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Tactics, good times.

645
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, uh, Vandal Hearts?

646
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, oops, sorry.

647
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:09,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, um, Fire, the Fire Emblem.

648
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:09,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Disgaea.

649
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:11,303
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

650
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:11,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire Emblem.

651
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: One more, then we'll get Task Force Launch.

652
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:20,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some genius out there decided to purchase the rights for The Sims to make it into a movie.

653
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And that genius company would be

654
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,333
[SPEAKER_03]: No, 20th Century Fox.

655
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: They have just picked up the movie rights to The Sims.

656
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

657
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:42,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Because don't you want to see it in a movie where you have a house full of eight... Actually, I think a Sims reality show would be awesome where you'll put eight people in a house and then forget to build a toilet and watch what happens.

658
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:44,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's all I ever did in The Sims.

659
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure none of them know how to cook.

660
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there was the house that my friend made once.

661
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:59,695
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Billy, who is a huge homosexual, made this house that had seven guys and one girl.

662
00:38:59,995 --> 00:39:02,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the guys would just make out with each other all day.

663
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:06,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And the girl had to cook and clean and wipe up their pee because he forgot to build a toilet.

664
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:07,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.

665
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:08,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the Sims.

666
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping Spore is just as fun.

667
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,580
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

668
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

669
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,502
[SPEAKER_02]: We want your feedback and questions.

670
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a whole lot of time, so we've got to make it quick.

671
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

672
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:24,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's enough of Rob's singing.

673
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:26,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, who's got a question?

674
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:26,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on down.

675
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You, sir.

676
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:28,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down.

677
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down, because otherwise we can't hear you.

678
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,862
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name and where are you from?

679
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:33,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray, GS68.

680
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:34,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray, GS68!

681
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:35,043
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

682
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:38,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have a question.

683
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you watched any anime here?

684
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got here like an hour and a half ago, so no.

685
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I did in the hotel.

686
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, what we watched last night in the hotel room was Shaun of the Dead and Hard Gay.

687
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:59,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I may watch some Yowie later if I can find it.

688
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be late.

689
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:01,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

690
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:05,533
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

691
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:05,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

692
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

693
00:40:06,894 --> 00:40:07,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get smacked later.

694
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:08,335
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

695
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:10,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're going to go down there to get the questions?

696
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as this mic cord will take me.

697
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

698
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

699
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:14,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

700
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:15,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is about this far.

701
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

702
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here's our heckler.

703
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:20,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down, sir.

704
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name?

705
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:22,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you from?

706
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob, and I'm from the interweb.

707
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Jacob from the interweb.

708
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your question?

709
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:33,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, Loki was quite the edit maker for DDR.

710
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was your favorite edit you made?

711
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:42,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what they're called now, but there was the one on, what was it, Ecstasy that was pretty fun.

712
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:43,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It stopped.

713
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember one now.

714
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,240
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one that was on Exotic Ethnic that was a double.

715
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like...

716
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

717
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:21,245
[SPEAKER_08]: that I won the Hell Edit contest with.

718
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember.

719
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:24,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the Step Edit contest?

720
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was DXY called another.

721
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the classic Make Edit Get Porn contest.

722
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:32,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a whole lot of hentai things to... Good times.

723
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:34,717
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any other questions, folks?

724
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:34,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down.

725
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, you in the back.

726
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down.

727
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't she cute?

728
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a loli.

729
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:42,964
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name, sweetie?

730
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:43,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you from?

731
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:45,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Cassie from Marina.

732
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:47,028
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's on your mind?

733
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:50,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a really obscure question, but it's for her.

734
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:50,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

735
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:52,690
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your starter Pokemon in Pearl?

736
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:54,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I used Chimchar.

737
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:55,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Chimchar.

738
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:58,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she just made a face.

739
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take you out in the parking lot.

740
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:02,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I'm obsessed with fire.

741
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:04,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the water Pokemon.

742
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:13,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever since, well, my first video game Pokemon that I played was Blue version, and I started out with Squirtle, and from that, the obsession began.

743
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I started off with Charmander.

744
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I picked... It starts from the very beginning.

745
00:42:17,424 --> 00:42:23,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody in Pokemans is picking that penguin, I decided to pick the grass Pokemon so I could kill them all very quickly.

746
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,292
[SPEAKER_08]: See, for me, if I can't burn it, what good is it?

747
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:27,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

748
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:33,837
[SPEAKER_02]: However, for those of you guys that know Miklatov, who listens to the show, he also has a chimchar and he has the best name ever for it.

749
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's HoMonkey.

750
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:40,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I accidentally skipped past where I was going to name it, but I was going to name it Firebutt.

751
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Homoki, whatever you want to say.

752
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:42,398
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

753
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:48,660
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question, then we've got to get out of here because I see more people coming in, which means people more popular than us must be waiting to start a panel.

754
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.

755
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: You already went.

756
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,840
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.

757
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

758
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:51,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

759
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:53,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Go.

760
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Question.

761
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:59,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Five, four, three, two, one.

762
00:42:59,483 --> 00:42:59,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go home.

763
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

764
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:01,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

765
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

766
00:43:01,464 --> 00:43:02,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on up real quick.

767
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

768
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:08,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys remember the PTS movie?

769
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Our little panel?

770
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Lack thereof, I should say.

771
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:15,837
[SPEAKER_11]: We made a big, big, big plug on it a long time ago.

772
00:43:15,937 --> 00:43:16,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Never finished.

773
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:19,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the group, people that suck or something?

774
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,040
[SPEAKER_11]: People talking shit.

775
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,461
[SPEAKER_11]: People talking shit.

776
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:24,962
[SPEAKER_11]: We were banned.

777
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:25,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, I screwed up.

778
00:43:25,942 --> 00:43:28,183
[SPEAKER_11]: We were banned from like every forum ever.

779
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:30,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

780
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:31,505
[SPEAKER_11]: That's quite an accomplishment.

781
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:31,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

782
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're here, we haven't banned you from the room, so... Not yet.

783
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, hey, I didn't start it.

784
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't shoot the messenger.

785
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:39,647
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

786
00:43:41,128 --> 00:43:41,468
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

787
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're here, and you got on our show, so there you go.

788
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,050
[SPEAKER_08]: We will help grant your voice.

789
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we'd like to thank all you guys very much for coming out and seeing our show live.

790
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:52,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

791
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you guys, of course, for supporting independent podcasting.

792
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important thing.

793
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:04,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you think our show sucks, please support other independent podcasts because there's a lot of great ones out there.

794
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:06,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That Orange Lens Radio is just crap.

795
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:06,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

796
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:07,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially that Rob guy.

797
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:09,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go listen to the PTS show.

798
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:10,499
[SPEAKER_02]: They sound more fun than us.

799
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:11,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

800
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,620
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

801
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go listen to G4 Radio.

802
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:15,523
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 Radio.

803
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have the ending music?

804
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course I was 100% lying.

805
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:23,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick, play the ending music.

806
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:26,644
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting out the torches and going to take us outside and beat us up.

807
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:27,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Rabble, rabble.

808
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

809
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,072
