00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, May 6, 2007, another DS game has the bubble bubble curse of brokenness,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Microsoft locks down on region control,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and an old Commodore 64 classic returns to the Nintendo Wii.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to gamer culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hi.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
How are you doing Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Alright, we'll leave it at that then I guess.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
No, I'm goofy.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Did you have a good week?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Sort of. The parts that I wasn't at work were okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
That's good, I guess. Work is always good.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Is there anybody who really, truly just says like,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
oh, I love every single minute at work, I just want to live there if I could?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I will when I quit.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Because then I'll be working full time as a massage therapist,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
which means I'll be working 13 hours a week.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I mean, don't get me wrong-

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Making $60,000.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Shut, don't rub it in.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I love my job, I do, but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
it's a very exhausting job, what I do, so I enjoy that time when I get to come home.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
And even massage therapy, I know that's really exhausting

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
because I remember when you were doing your test thing on me,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
you were like breaking out in a sweat when you were done.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
And it was just like, all you did was-

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It doesn't matter how cold it is, come on.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
It was just because you're so hot and sexy.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
There's Tech Master Loki with a smart-ass mouth as usual.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Hi, Loki.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Hello.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Look at my wrist, you see I have swelling on my wrist again.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm doing massage therapy.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I know part of it was because I was so hot and sexy,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
but I was like, I did not know that dark Sakura touching my butt

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
would make her break out in a sweat.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm going to go ahead and say this.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Actually, giving an hour of massage is an actual anaerobic workout,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
as well as strength training.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
You actually burn close to 320 calories doing an hour of massage.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, it doesn't surprise me when you stop to think about it.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm like, oh yeah, like when I give other people massages,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
like you're doing-

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Why do you think I was fucking eating whatever I wanted to

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
while I was in school?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Because I was giving hour massages at least four times a week,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
especially when I was doing my finals.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
DDR not needed for you.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Hell no, now I'm like, I've only been doing a couple of this.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I need to go play DDR.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
All right.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, there's another smart-ass voice in studio tonight,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
and that could only belong to the one and only Drew Nami is back tonight.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Boys and girls, say hello to Drew Nami.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Hello.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
How are you doing?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, I'm all right.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Excellent.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
All right, and we're here in Orange Lounge Radio's chat room,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
but I noticed my chat room hasn't updated in a few seconds,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
which might mean, yep, I just got disconnected.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Go figure.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
There you go.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Live radio.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Bye, guys.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I just pinged out of chat.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Live radio, boys and girls, what can you do?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
We do tape live Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com,

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
where we run a fully functional 24-hour a day, seven-day a week station

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
with other awesome programming.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
For instance, Dark Sakura has a show.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
She calls Pump Up the Volume.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Sometimes.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Sometimes I just call it crap.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And Travis Donovan has a cool little sci-fi show on Saturday nights,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Travis Donovan Live, and brand new shows being piloted right now.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Can't say too much more.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Those of you that have been listening on Wednesdays know about it,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
but those of you that don't,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
you're just in the dark for a little while longer while we get the kinks worked out.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
So tune in.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
That's right.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Some people like it kinky, though.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Some people like their kinks, and there's nothing wrong with that,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
nothing wrong with a little kink.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
All right, there's also nothing wrong with starting off a podcast

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
talking about your gaming week.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
As we've been doing ever since we started podcasting back in like January of 2005,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
it's always been how was your gaming week?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It was kind of dead.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Oh, no, no, no.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I did play some more Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
and then Dan took the game back,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
but it's like fucking funny to play it with Deadpool.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
So that's all I've been doing.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And I was supposed to get my Pokemans,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
but my husband didn't pull through for me and bring me my Pokemans.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Fired!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I know.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I need to trade him in for a more attentive model.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
No, I love...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Now you make it sound like you're trading Pokemans.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm going to trade a level 32 Dan for...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No, he's level 31.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Level 69 boobs.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
No.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No, no, no.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
I'll trade in my Dan for your Drew Barrymore.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
No.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
No, you're David Tennant.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
There you go.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
But no.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
But it's...

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
I've been listening to other people talk about their Pokemans,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and I want to show you mine.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I don't have mine yet.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
All right.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
And I've been playing...

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I've been really, really fucking pissed off at Twilight Zone.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It's a pinball.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Because Twilight Zone is awesome, and I can get in the zone,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
and then it's like, you're in the zone, train.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I'm so sad.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Multiball.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
No, drain.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Bitch.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
And Dan finally fixed our little problem we had on our Guns N' Roses.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Kyle Snyder is in chat.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Kyle's been listening to us for a while, and of course we know him from the DDR days.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
He says, Pokemon is dead to me.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm wondering what happened.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
You should let me show you my Pokemans.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I wonder why...

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Why, Kyle, is Pokemon dead to you?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
A lot of folks have been eating this game up.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
It's been bringing a lot of people back into the series.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Maybe some long-time fans feel it's just a little too much.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I need a new Digimon game.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Why do people still play this damn game?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Seriously.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, look, we added more monsters that look very similar to the other ones.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Buy it again.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
To answer Tigerclaw, by the way, I've been...

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And in fact, buy our new color of DS or something to go along with it.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Tigerclaw, I've been playing on PlayStation 3,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
but we've decided to purchase the Xbox 360 version so that, number one,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I don't have to fuck with the stupid 6-axis.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And number two, we have more controllers already,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
so I can actually have multiplayer in my house.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Kyle Snyder simply says, I got bored of Pokemon.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Maybe to support Loki's theory.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't know.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Loki, I can't explain the allure of Pokemon.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
It's kind of like when everybody bought Spice Girls albums, you know, 10 years ago.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It's like you don't know why you're buying such crap.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Everybody didn't.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Everybody didn't buy those.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Look, 7 million people beg to differ.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
What?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Spice World was fucking funny, though.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
It was.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Meatloaf is the bus driver.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
See, it was really funny.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But anyway, this is a shitty game out of it, too.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Oh, my God, the Spice Girls video game is the best party game ever on the PlayStation 1.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
If you've ever played the Spice Girls game, it is so horrible because, oh, my God,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
like the funniest thing ever.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
You have the girls, you like choreograph dances,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and all the girls can like do their dance.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, we made Stupid Spice, I don't know, the blonde one.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
We call her Stupid Spice.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
What we did is we would have her always be a count late,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
and then halfway through the dance, she just gives up and does the little sway back and forth.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And then you can have them actually lip sync the song.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's the stupidest game.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Hours of entertainment, especially if you're intoxicated.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
That's all I have to say.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Only Rob.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Only Rob.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Hi.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Anything else in your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
All right.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
How was it?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
One last thing, sorry.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yes.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Dan downloaded that pinball game, the demo of the pinball game,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
and it's okay, but it's very high def.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Done.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Is it just me, or is like nothing ever going to be a substitute for real pinball?

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I think that's the game's biggest flaw, is like, yeah, it gets really, really close

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
to emulating real pinball, but it's not real pinball.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Pinmame?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Even pinmame.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I can't play pinmame like I can a real pinball machine.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
It's just not the same.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm sorry.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean, it's nothing against the game's ball physics or anything like that,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
which are all done fine, and the graphics are great, but it's not the same.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I can't explain it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That's why you have to have a couple thousand dollars on hand

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
to buy yourself a pinball machine.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, well.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What they need to do, they need to make a full-size pinball table

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
that has like a really huge LCD or plasma screen in there,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
and then you're just playing it on the actual table.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Actually, there is, in works, using widescreen LCD monitors

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
to do an at-home full pinball emulation.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yes, exactly.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Using two screens.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Exactly as I was saying.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Anyways.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Can I say chat real quick?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Chat's saying Fireboma says Spice World is almost the worst game ever,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
to which Jared Jay says you've obviously not played Night Trap.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Jbmon says Spice World is better than Sonic was for the Wii.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
What?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
There you have it.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Sorry, Loki.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Go ahead.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
That's sad.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
So this week, I played, of course, More Earth Defense Force 2017.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
A lot less of it, though, because I've been trying to set up

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
a network at our work with both my 360 and my friend Sean's 360,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
but for some reason, it just does not want to work.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It's defying all logic and everything.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
We're hooking it up correctly, and it's just like, no.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
One of them wants to see the network,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
and the other one doesn't.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
It doesn't make any sense.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
So whatever.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
We'll have to fix that later.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
But we've also been playing.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I played a little bit of Boom Boom Rocket today,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
and that was kind of fun,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and just working through some of the medium-leveled stuff

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
so I can get a little higher on the leaderboards there.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And then a little bit of Crackdown.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Crackdown's still fun.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
You know, I think I still have a top 100 score on Boom Boom Rocket

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
for the grand leaderboards,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
and yet still there is someone on my friends list who outranks me.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
PK or Uno, I am going to beat your ass at Boom Boom Rocket.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Mark my words.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I will keep practicing until I take down your score.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
But now we're looking at maybe picking up a copy of Saints Row

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
so we can do some Saints Row multiplayer on the two consoles as well.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't know how much fun two-player multiplayer will be,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
but it sounds fun.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I don't know.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So that'll tide us over until Grand Theft Auto IV comes out.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Oh, that game will be awesome.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Okay.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm pissed off now.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Why?

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
SSG 100 Matt, the only great game on Sega CD apart from Sonic CD

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
was not fucking Night Trap.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
There was Popful Mail.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
There was Silfied, Revenge of the Ninja, Microcosm.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Okay, there was Sewer Shark, but that doesn't count either.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
And all the Lunar games.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
So you know what?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Shut up.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Wait.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
He's saying there were no good.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Then Night Trap.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Was a good game?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Was the only other good game.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm like, the fuck it was.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I've got the same.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Night Trap wasn't even a good game.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It had Dana Play-Doh in it.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Shit.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It didn't have boobies in it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, because it was Dana Play-Doh,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
but she didn't have very big boobies.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, there you go.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I mean, that's instantly in the good game section.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But I've got the 32X one, actually.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, well, there you go.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, the Terminator game was good, too.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
The 32X is crap.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Hey, Chaotix kidnapped you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
No, it did not.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yes, it did.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh, my God.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Chaotix was awful.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
And Calibri.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Did you play Calibri?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Wasn't there an Echo game that was 32X compatible?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
There was, but it wasn't very good.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I just mostly played Chaotix.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Jamie?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Afterburner.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Jamie?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
What?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I love you.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Calibri sucks.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Calibri was cute.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
But, no, Afterburner and, uh, fuck, Space Harrier for 32X.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And they said it was a flop.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And they were the actual arcade versions.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It was really fucking cool.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Anyway.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It was really lame.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I was like, why the fuck are they chained to each other?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And this is so awful.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
It's just like a fucking anchor being dragged behind the guy.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
It was a horrible, horrible game.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It's the Bionic Commando Factor.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Sonic Crackers, anyone?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That works.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
That works.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Anyway.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Of course, more Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories because that game never gets old.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Although, we still get pissed off at each other.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
A lot.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Me, I've been playing WoW off and on.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Some Neverwinter Nights 2 and some Unreal Tournament.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Just kind of a return to old school stuff.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
No, I am not an addict.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
No, I do not plan to be an addict, but I still play WoW.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
My gaming week was somewhat very similar to Jiranami's.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I played pretty much nothing but WoW all week.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm hit to level 49.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I guess there's that.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I know.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Big WoW, huh?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I actually have not been doing a lot of console gaming this week.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
It's kind of sad.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Like, I played the pinball game at least one more time.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Like, twice or something.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
To just kind of see if I liked it.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I tried the demo for the mini golf game.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Hated it.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I've just never liked mini golf games on consoles.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
It's just not the same.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
It's like pinball.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That's my review for everything this week.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's not the same as the real thing.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Here's the problem though with it.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
They really fucked up this whole thing when they went 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It's really lame now.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
See, 3D Ultra Mini Golf was pretty fun.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Because you can play against other people.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
They even had some modes that people would create and stuff in it.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
My favorite was if I was doing bad, I just hit someone's ball across the entire course.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And that was worth it right there.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
It was awesome.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
The game's okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Graphically.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
It's very creative.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
A lot of the holes are very creative.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
It's certainly not your typical mini golf game.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
But, I don't know.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I wasn't feeling it for some reason.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
So, I didn't buy the full version.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
I really wanted to try Catan, but the demo wasn't working and I guess they fixed it now.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
So, I need to go back and try it.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Because I've heard lots of great things about Catan.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
It was either on my Twitter or live journal.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Somebody compared it to Civilization.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
And I was like, sold!

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
So, I definitely want to check that out.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Because Civilization is my favorite PC game ever.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Ever.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
You know what?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
The other game is exactly like Civilization.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Civ 1.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Civ 1 for life.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
You know what?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Other games exactly like Civilization.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
What?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Spice World.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Totally like Civilization.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Go fuck yourself, monkey.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
You gotta go buy it now.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Just go fuck yourself.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I guess that's it.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I haven't really been playing a whole lot else.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm trying to think.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Oh, I tried the demo.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Because I got a new monitor for my computer.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I finally got a widescreen monitor.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Which, by the way, is working out great for the show.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Because I can have all the windows up at once.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
But I was like, oh, it's really pretty.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I want to download movies.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I want to download other games.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I want to see how.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Because widescreen and wow.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Fap, fap, fap.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
It's beautiful.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It's so awesome.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I can't even explain it.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
But I wanted to try other stuff.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
So, I was like, I'll try a driving game.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
So, I tried to download the Need for Speed Carbon demo for the PC.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Crashed on me.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Like, I was about ready to get to where I'd actually race.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Crashed on me.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
And, like, I'm sorry.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But I'm not going to sit here and troubleshoot a demo.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So, I just deleted it.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Which is sad because I had a Ladytron track in it.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
And I like Ladytron a lot.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
That's exactly what I did with that Dance Online.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Crash sent me away.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Ah, fuck it.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I ain't going to play.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Dance Online I was able to play.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
It's just something corrupted wanting to download.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm like, I'm not downloading this thing yet.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
All right.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Get the Command and Conquer 3 demo.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
It works with widescreen.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
No, it did download, though.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
I downloaded eDuke, which is a modified version of Duke Nukem 3D that works on Windows XP.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That I want to check out.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
That might be pretty fun.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
That might be very fun.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Can you play it over the internet or something?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I think so.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh my god.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Loki, we need to play this game.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And they also have, like, a high-res pack that you can do where all the monsters are

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
made into, like, 3D and stuff.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
They kind of, like, Quake-ified it.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, Dark Soccer, I have to ask your opinion on this.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.520
I'm not sure who got the job on this topic, but JVMon is saying, I would cream for a Doctor

15:36.520 --> 15:39.320
Who MMO.

15:39.320 --> 15:44.040
That's not entirely possible unless they set it before the current series, because there's

15:44.040 --> 15:46.140
only one Time Lord now.

15:46.140 --> 15:49.160
So you couldn't, like, go around in your own TARDIS or anything.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.200
What if they did something a while back or something else?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
Who knows?

15:52.200 --> 15:57.880
If it was pre-movie, it'd be possible, but it wouldn't work.

15:57.880 --> 16:03.520
And I really, really doubt that they'd let something like that out now, given the attention

16:03.520 --> 16:04.680
to continuity.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.680
Don't you get a little nervous, too, when you hear, like, your favorite shows or whatever

16:08.680 --> 16:09.880
are going to be turned into games?

16:09.880 --> 16:13.680
Like, you know, they're talking about turning Heroes into a video game now, because, you

16:13.680 --> 16:18.440
know, the show's been very successful, and I love me some Heroes, but I get very nervous

16:18.440 --> 16:19.800
about a Heroes video game.

16:19.800 --> 16:25.240
If they said EA's making a Heroes game, that might be a little more confident in saying

16:25.240 --> 16:31.040
SNK's making a Heroes game, which would never happen, because that's neither, you know,

16:31.040 --> 16:36.440
Metal Slug, Art of Fighting, King of Fighters, it's none of those, and it's not a game that

16:36.440 --> 16:39.640
they've already made, so obviously that wouldn't be one of their games.

16:39.640 --> 16:44.620
Oh, cue what brings up a good point, 24 the game, like, okay, yeah, 24 didn't work out

16:44.620 --> 16:45.620
so well.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.720
Well, here's the problem, they made a game that took place between Seasons 2 and 3, and

16:47.720 --> 16:53.040
it came out, like, after Season 5 or 4 or something like that, so it's like, wow, this

16:53.040 --> 16:54.040
is a little old.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.640
All right, before we get into gaming news this week, I noticed the chat room is all

16:57.640 --> 17:01.680
stuck on Spider-Man 3, like, you know, here we are, like, almost 20 minutes into the show,

17:01.680 --> 17:05.600
they're still talking about Spider-Man 3 as they were before the show started tonight,

17:05.600 --> 17:09.960
even though we're a video game show, but I see, Spider-Man 3 is not a game, it's a horrible

17:09.960 --> 17:10.960
review.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.640
Spider-Man 3 is a popular part of culture.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Horrible reviews.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
Really?

17:14.640 --> 17:18.680
Yeah, the game I was reading, like, PlayStation 2 game, they said it just looked like crap,

17:18.680 --> 17:23.520
the PlayStation 3 one was just getting average reviews, it was just horrible, usually the

17:23.520 --> 17:27.040
Spider-Man games, it was just like, everyone, you know.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.800
Speaking of things people love and turning them into bastardized video games.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
Yeah.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.120
Well, I mean, it had potential, but, like, even they were showing, like, the Wii version

17:35.120 --> 17:39.560
of it and stuff, and, you know, half of Brooklyn Bridge would be not even there, it's just,

17:39.560 --> 17:44.340
you know, stuff like that, none of the buildings had textures on them and stuff like that.

17:44.340 --> 17:48.160
I feel like one of the non-cool kids, because I didn't bother to see the movie this weekend,

17:48.160 --> 17:49.760
but I hate seeing movies opening weekend.

17:49.760 --> 17:54.560
Like, it used to be the cool thing to do, but I just, I hate teenagers at the theater.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.360
No offense to the teenagers that listen to this show, I'm sure you guys know how to be

17:57.360 --> 18:02.040
respectful, but unfortunately, not all teenagers of the world can be, it just ruins it for

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
me.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.960
I went yesterday and I had a fairly quiet theater, there was one child that started

18:04.960 --> 18:07.000
crying and the parent escorted him out.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Good.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.480
And one phone that went off there, everyone pretty much, you know, turned around and said,

18:10.480 --> 18:11.480
turn that fucker off!

18:11.480 --> 18:12.960
I can top that.

18:12.960 --> 18:20.880
We had a work screening and one dumb bitch at my work dropped her kids off at the screening

18:20.880 --> 18:26.360
and one of her kids was recording the film with his camera phone, to which Nellie turned

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
him in.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.000
I love your wife, I really do.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.280
And the manager came over to him and told him to turn off the phone, that's it.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.400
I was hoping that he'd be dragged out and parents called and stuff like that, but unfortunately

18:38.400 --> 18:40.200
that didn't happen.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.160
Because management is afraid to be mean because they'll get sued or something.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
Oh, I punched the fuck.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.240
I punched the kid in the face and then dragged him out by his hair.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.240
You know what?

18:49.240 --> 18:52.320
Instead of telling the manager, you should have called the RIAA or whatever, or not,

18:52.320 --> 18:53.320
not, sorry.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
Not the MPAA.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
Not down here real quick!

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
Sorry, the MPAA.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.240
Sorry, boy, I'm going to get hate mail for that mistake.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.520
All right, anyway, all right, sorry, enough about movies.

19:03.520 --> 19:10.000
Moving on to, wait, I'm looking at, actually I'm looking at Chet, let's see, Blaze says,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.120
I'm a teen and I hate a lot of teens that go to the movies.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.280
Footy Monster says, I hate, hate, hate, hate teenagers.

19:16.280 --> 19:21.920
And Jack Ransom responds to that saying, we hate, hate, hate you.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.320
Come join in the love.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.800
Chat.orangesontrader.com, live on this Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.440
Well, I remember when I was their age and stuff going, man, I don't act like that.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.000
And now I go, man, I never acted like that, I just don't understand it.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.160
Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just say when I was your age?

19:38.160 --> 19:39.160
Yes.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.520
Because that was like almost 10 years ago.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
You're old.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
We're all old.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
All right, anyhow.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
No, I know.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.760
We were, and Jared Jay says, well, we were all teenagers at one point.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.440
Yeah, but I wasn't a jackass, exactly.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.440
That's what I'm saying.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.760
Probably the people listening to this show, I would hope, if you're smart enough to download

20:00.760 --> 20:05.420
this show or listen live, you're probably smart enough to not be a jackass at the theater.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.420
So I'm not talking about you.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.420
Wait, Rob.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.420
I'm talking about.

20:08.420 --> 20:09.420
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
I was never a teenager.

20:10.420 --> 20:11.420
This is craziness.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.420
Calling me a teenager.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.420
What?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.420
Are you 12?

20:14.420 --> 20:15.420
I was never a teenager.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.420
Are you 12?

20:16.420 --> 20:17.420
Only if you're 12.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.420
It's all about the jocks.

20:18.420 --> 20:22.160
It's always the jocks that are the problems of everything, and the nerds get the rap for

20:22.160 --> 20:23.160
it.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.160
Nerds.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.160
Sorry.

20:25.160 --> 20:30.600
Did I ever tell you, did I ever tell the Grudge story on this show when I went to go

20:30.600 --> 20:31.600
see the Grudge?

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
I think I was with you.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
Several times.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.600
Really?

20:34.600 --> 20:35.600
Okay, then I'm not going to tell it again.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
Yeah, I was with you.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
Tell it again, though.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Tell it better.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
I wasn't there.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
I thought you were.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
No.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
Okay.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
When we saw the Grudge, were you there, Loki?

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
I was there.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
You tell it.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
I don't remember.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
Okay.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
Okay.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
I wasn't even there, and I remember this fucking story.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
All right.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.840
Some people were in the back, what, talking and hooting at the movie and being assholes.

20:55.840 --> 21:02.880
They were doing that thing that jocks do, yeah, they're going, oh my god, I'm so scared.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.700
Like through the whole end of the movie, through the scary parts, like they're trying to impress

21:06.700 --> 21:07.700
their girlfriends.

21:07.700 --> 21:12.360
Like, you know how jocks talk to each other?

21:12.360 --> 21:16.720
Any girl that's impressed by that, by the way, needs to fucking get shot.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.480
So it was a sold out theater, right?

21:18.480 --> 21:24.580
It was a sold out theater, and the jocks in the back, so I don't know if it's the Rocky

21:24.580 --> 21:28.340
Horror Picture Show goer in me or whatever, but I'm not afraid to yell in a crowded theater.

21:28.340 --> 21:31.700
So I turned around and I yelled out, would the man with the little penis in the back

21:31.700 --> 21:34.280
row please shut the fuck up?

21:34.280 --> 21:39.000
And the entire audience started applauding, because you know they were all sick of it,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.500
they just didn't want to say anything about it.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.840
So I yelled that out, everybody applauded, and he shut the fuck up.

21:43.840 --> 21:50.680
And yet you hear these girls in the back start going, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, because

21:50.680 --> 21:52.680
his girlfriend knew it was true.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.680
So it was great.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.480
It was a good time, good time.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.600
So maybe I should go to the movies more often on opening weekend, because I'm not afraid

22:00.600 --> 22:02.240
to yell at people while the movie's going on.

22:02.240 --> 22:07.160
Sometimes it is fun to yell at movies, like I remember when we went and saw, work screening

22:07.160 --> 22:12.880
again because I wouldn't pay to see this, Charlie's Angels 2, and I will never forget

22:12.880 --> 22:18.200
the one moment in the movie where it's just like, okay, you can kind of suspend disbelief

22:18.200 --> 22:23.280
for a lot of the movie and stuff, but when the fucking, there's a boat exploding and

22:23.280 --> 22:28.900
they grab ahold of this rope and get pulled up through the ceiling and shrapnel from the

22:28.900 --> 22:36.480
explosion causes wood to splinter into snowboard-shaped pieces of wood to which the girls land on

22:36.480 --> 22:43.160
those and then grind down the ropes from the ship to the dock, and I was like, oh, really?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
Come on.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
Yeah.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.160
Yeah, really.

22:46.160 --> 22:50.760
It was almost like The Transporter, but The Transporter, though, you expect that.

22:50.760 --> 22:55.320
You see, there are right movies to MST and there are wrong movies to MST.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.880
MST and Charlie's Angels, yeah.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.240
Or Snakes on a Plane, hell yeah.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.600
There's some movies that you just have to see that are bad.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.600
No, you have to give some respect to movies like 300.

23:06.600 --> 23:11.800
Or the end of the Premonition where I started busting up laughing because it was so stupid,

23:11.800 --> 23:16.360
or the end of Fracture where it was just like, wow, nothing really happened in the entire

23:16.360 --> 23:17.360
movie.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.360
So next on Movie Chat.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.360
Sorry.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.960
You know what?

23:20.960 --> 23:22.720
It's all right to get off topic once in a while.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
I know.

23:23.720 --> 23:24.720
Embrace it.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.720
Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.

23:25.720 --> 23:26.720
Remember last week?

23:26.720 --> 23:28.960
We tried not to give a shit and people hated it.

23:28.960 --> 23:33.760
Oh, speaking of Mr. Sandstorm 3000, I got a new tape, or not tape, a DVD from work.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.840
Apparently the guys that do it are starting a new series.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
Oh, yeah.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.840
Oh, really?

23:38.840 --> 23:41.160
I don't remember what it's called now because I don't have the disc in front of me, but

23:41.160 --> 23:42.680
there is a new series coming out.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
Cool.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.680
They have a website, but I don't know.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.680
Does it have mics?

23:45.680 --> 23:46.680
Research it.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.680
Yeah.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
Chat feedback real quick.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.520
Bandit says, it might have been his mom laughing.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.680
I fucking love Chat.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.960
Her jeans.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.440
Tigerclaw says, Sky, and they didn't yell back at you saying, you shut the fuck up.

23:58.440 --> 24:02.320
No, they didn't because the entire audience applauded.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.000
If that didn't happen, maybe they would have, but yeah.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Anyway.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
There you go.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
All right.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
How about game news?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
No.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
How about housekeeping?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Real quick.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Some housekeeping.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.080
We announced it at the end of last week's show, but we wanted to say upfront, or at

24:16.080 --> 24:20.640
least 25 minutes once Movie Chat's done, we wanted to say that we are going to be live

24:20.640 --> 24:22.240
at Fauna Mae again this year.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.600
We're really excited about that.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.280
Fauna Mae Convention happens in San Jose, California at their convention center over

24:27.280 --> 24:28.600
Memorial Day weekend.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.480
This year we only have one panel, not two.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.320
We're not going to do a general podcasting panel, but that's all right because we're

24:33.320 --> 24:37.600
still going to record our show live, and it happens at 2 p.m. on Saturday, so we hope

24:37.600 --> 24:41.520
that a lot of you guys will come out and say hello and make plans to come see us at Fauna

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
Mae.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.560
We'll all be there, so we're excited.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
So that's it.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.960
Let's get into some gaming news.

24:48.960 --> 24:54.240
Well, I have some news, and this is very interesting stuff.

24:54.240 --> 25:00.640
Now the PlayStation 3 store is starting to stock PlayStation 1 games.

25:00.640 --> 25:07.640
We have Two Extreme, Crash Bandicoot, Destruction Derby, Jet Moto, Jumping Flash, which I fucking

25:07.640 --> 25:15.760
love Jumping Flash, Medieval, Rally Cross, Siphon Filter, which is actually a good game,

25:15.760 --> 25:26.520
Back in 2, and Wipeout, so you will actually be able to share your PSP games between the

25:26.520 --> 25:30.280
handheld and the PS3, so you'll keep your save games with you.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.680
You can play them at work, play them at home.

25:33.680 --> 25:39.440
It has not yet been confirmed for Europe, however, so we just got to wait.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.800
However, these downloads are $5.99 a piece.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.640
They've had them up for the PSP for a while, and it's always kind of weird how you had

25:46.640 --> 25:51.080
to have the PS3 to download the ones for the PSP, which didn't make any sense, and now

25:51.080 --> 25:56.040
with the new version 1.7 patch that they had for the firmware on the PS3, now you can actually

25:56.040 --> 26:00.120
play them on the PlayStation 3 instead of just on the PSP.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.280
I just think it's good that your saves are going to work between the two.

26:02.280 --> 26:06.400
Well, that's kind of nice, and it's also nice that there's something to actually download

26:06.400 --> 26:08.640
on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.

26:08.640 --> 26:12.120
You know, there was a system that tried to do this before, not necessarily with having

26:12.120 --> 26:16.660
the handheld version, but remember the Neo Geo tried to do this before with the arcade

26:16.660 --> 26:18.120
versions and with the AVS.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.120
Well, there's also the TurboGrafx-16.

26:20.120 --> 26:24.880
No, the TurboGrafx didn't have arcade compatibility.

26:24.880 --> 26:29.720
Well, they had the Turbo Duo, though, or the Turbo Express.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.520
The Turbo Express had no way to transfer the saves between the systems.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.800
Well, I thought it was on the cartridges, though.

26:35.800 --> 26:40.680
Well, yeah, I mean, but that's like playing with your Super Game Boy.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.320
Well, I guess it would be the same as the Nomad in Genesis.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.800
Yeah, it's the same as the Nomad.

26:45.800 --> 26:50.840
In this case, though, it was having your, you know, bringing home your arcade game to

26:50.840 --> 26:53.720
play on your arcade version at home.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.720
Too different.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.720
Hello.

26:55.720 --> 27:02.000
Bandit in our chat room says, great, now I can use my $600 investment to play really

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
old PS1 games.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Great, thanks, Sony.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.840
Dude, I love Jumping Flash, shut up.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.840
That's what it was.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.840
Okay, sorry to interject this real quick.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.120
The Film Crew is what the new thing is called, the new series.

27:17.120 --> 27:22.640
It stars Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett, and Mike Nelson.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.640
Thanks.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.640
How about some game news?

27:24.640 --> 27:32.920
Okay, now, Mr. Demanding, anyways, so, also tying in with the PlayStation 3, home beta

27:32.920 --> 27:35.680
has finally kicked off in both the US and UK.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.080
Look, I just don't care if it doesn't have Tom Servo, okay?

27:39.080 --> 27:46.520
Okay, so, a lot of people are getting to try out the brand new free, you know, Avatar system

27:46.520 --> 27:53.520
that's very similar to The Sims, and everybody's saying, oh, it's so much better than Xbox

27:53.520 --> 27:57.000
Live, yay.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.400
I thought they all had to sign an NDA to get in that.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.880
Oh, well, they did, but, you know, they can still say that they're part of this, you know,

28:03.880 --> 28:09.240
this and that, it's awesome, because, you know, awesome is not covered under the NDA,

28:09.240 --> 28:17.160
so, I don't know, but, apparently, also, there's gonna be some more entries into the beta coming

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
out soon.

28:18.160 --> 28:23.200
If you really wanna get into the beta, you need to make sure that you register your PlayStation

28:23.200 --> 28:30.640
3 with Sony, which I haven't done yet, so, I need to do that, and then, it's all random

28:30.640 --> 28:33.640
from there, so, good luck.

28:33.640 --> 28:38.320
Hopefully you get to try out the home beta before everybody else, not that I, personally,

28:38.320 --> 28:41.800
I don't really care, I'll just wait for it to be done, and it won't be working correctly

28:41.800 --> 28:44.480
when it is done anyways, because everybody likes to patch shit.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.840
Well, it is in beta, it's early.

28:47.840 --> 28:48.840
True.

28:48.840 --> 28:56.400
The Rob D., by the way, says, Kevin Murphy is Tom Servo, so he's trying to pwn me there,

28:56.400 --> 28:57.400
but, whatever.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.040
Does he have a giant underwear collection?

29:00.040 --> 29:01.040
I think not.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.760
Alright, moving on.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.760
Please do.

29:04.760 --> 29:12.640
Speaking of playing old PlayStation 1 games on the PlayStation 3, I think it's very interesting

29:12.640 --> 29:18.240
because Masaya Matsura created, of course, Parappa the Rappa, he also created a little

29:18.240 --> 29:23.040
game we love called Vib-Ribbon, which is awesome, I'm very excited.

29:23.040 --> 29:28.120
Matsura was actually hinting that, possibly, Vib-Ribbon might be on its way to the PlayStation

29:28.120 --> 29:29.120
network.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.120
Hey!

29:30.120 --> 29:32.760
Parappa the Rappa is very similar in idea to Vib-Ribbon.

29:32.760 --> 29:36.960
It's about analyzing audio and creating a game from that data, but it uses MP3 audio

29:36.960 --> 29:38.360
instead of CDs.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.200
We are discussing the possibility of making a downloadable version of Vib-Ribbon for Sony,

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
but I don't know yet.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.440
Sony only recently launched their downloadable service in Japan, so we kind of need to wait

29:46.440 --> 29:49.360
a while before releasing a title with that kind of appeal.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
That would be awesome.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.880
Vib-Ribbon, if you've never played it, is so friggin' cute.

29:52.880 --> 29:57.880
I'm so glad I lucked into my copy, because I paid enough for it too, didn't I?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.600
I think so, didn't it go into Best Hits in Japan, though, eventually?

30:00.600 --> 30:01.600
I can't remember.

30:01.600 --> 30:06.880
Well, I bought an original for like 50 bucks used, but then again, this is fucking cool.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.160
At the time, yeah, it was absolutely worth it.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.640
The cool thing about it, though, is that you could use any CD with it, and although the

30:13.640 --> 30:15.640
results were somewhat mixed, it was just kind of fun.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.640
What did we try to do?

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
We tried Max 300.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.200
Yeah, it was better than Dance Factory.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.200
That was fun.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.200
Picture-writing stuff.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.840
No, we did Dropout.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.240
That was what we used.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.560
We tried to play it to Dropout.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.560
Good times.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
Good times.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.560
So I hope this happens.

30:28.560 --> 30:34.320
That would be a really fun game for PlayStation Network, certainly better than the Duck game.

30:34.320 --> 30:43.600
Well, there is in process, excuse me for a moment while I breathe again, they're talking

30:43.600 --> 30:50.360
about a new Dead or Alive, a Mega Man, and Kingdom Hearts for PS3.

30:50.360 --> 30:56.660
In the last issue of EGM Magazine, there were these rumors coming out.

30:56.660 --> 31:04.880
So Team Ninja has an exclusive for a new Dead or Alive for the PS3, and there's also the

31:04.880 --> 31:12.400
notice that Capcom is working on a new, actually not a new Mega Man, they were updating the

31:12.400 --> 31:16.320
original Mega Man with new graphics for a download.

31:16.320 --> 31:23.120
And Nippon Ichi is working on a new Disgaea for PS3.

31:23.120 --> 31:30.440
So it's basically Mega Man, powered up Mega Man, except without a giant head, hopefully.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.200
Let's hope.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.040
Because he had a giant fucking head in the game.

31:36.040 --> 31:40.000
And we're pretty much sure, you know, Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be PS3.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.600
Anyways, so there is some new stuff coming out, also from Square, actually.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.520
They're talking a little bit about Kingdom Hearts, and of course the next progression

31:50.520 --> 31:55.120
for it, apparently, is going to be a portable spin-off and not Kingdom Hearts 3, although

31:55.120 --> 31:58.920
I'm assuming Kingdom Hearts 3 is probably in the works as well, but the next game you'll

31:58.920 --> 32:01.320
see will be a portable spin-off.

32:01.320 --> 32:06.280
And no word exactly what it's going to be, I'm sure we'll find out a little bit more

32:06.280 --> 32:13.780
after the whole Square Enix press party or whatever they have in Fan Party.

32:13.780 --> 32:18.880
So hopefully we'll hear a little bit more about that, because I know it wasn't a chain

32:18.880 --> 32:22.000
of memories or whatever, didn't that suck really bad?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.800
Chain of Memories is a different game.

32:24.800 --> 32:33.800
I do not recommend playing it on a DS Micro, not DS, the Game Boy Advance Micro, but it

32:33.800 --> 32:38.520
wasn't that bad, I'm actually looking forward to the PS2 version.

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
I don't know.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.040
They just, don't fuck it up, please.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.880
Most people play Kingdom Hearts for the, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memory for the story, not

32:46.880 --> 32:49.600
the game.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.040
I'm glad they played it for something.

32:52.040 --> 32:59.520
Alright, well, last week somebody listened to us, apparently, or somebody had the same

32:59.520 --> 33:04.620
idea, because remember when last week we talked about the whole God of War promotional thing

33:04.620 --> 33:08.220
in the UK, they had the goat with the head chopped off and all that stuff, remember that?

33:08.220 --> 33:10.200
And I said, somebody should email PETA?

33:10.200 --> 33:12.320
Well somebody did!

33:12.320 --> 33:15.360
Somebody somehow told PETA what was going on, I don't know if that's because of this

33:15.360 --> 33:18.640
show or what, I'm sure somebody else had the same idea.

33:18.640 --> 33:23.480
But PETA did post in their, I guess, official blog, it looks like it's just one guy that

33:23.480 --> 33:31.260
runs it, but they have a blog over at blog.peta.com, somebody actually posted about it, and basically

33:31.260 --> 33:36.040
what it came down to is that they sort of said, PETA said they're kind of not going

33:36.040 --> 33:40.900
to do anything about it, that it's obviously an idiotic thing, they would not name the

33:40.900 --> 33:46.800
game in the blog entry because they have no desire to help them promote it, and they noticed

33:46.800 --> 33:51.660
that Sony obviously apologized for it and Sony is recalling the magazine and everything,

33:51.660 --> 33:56.520
but PETA was just kind of going, just kind of like shaking their head disapprovingly.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.440
But what was interesting is they took a squeak at Jack Thompson in the little blog post,

33:59.440 --> 34:03.320
which was kind of cool, because in the blog post the author said, quote, always sided

34:03.320 --> 34:06.420
with the video game industry against the Jack Thompsons of the world who are out to make

34:06.420 --> 34:10.080
a name for themselves by blaming gamers for all of society's problems.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.760
So that was kind of interesting.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.860
But unfortunately no big pickets out front of Sony headquarters with topless women saying

34:16.860 --> 34:22.880
I'd rather be naked than, you know, look at decapitated goats and all that stuff.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.880
Sorry boys.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.560
Hi.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.160
Hello.

34:28.160 --> 34:38.280
Well, you know how Taito had that big problem with Bubble Bobble?

34:38.280 --> 34:40.120
You can't get past level 30?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.000
No, never heard of it.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Rob.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Of course.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.600
We made fun of it endlessly on this show.

34:45.600 --> 34:55.600
Well, it's happened to SNK and Capcom Card Fighter Clash for the DS, yeah, which is funny

34:55.600 --> 34:57.600
because my husband bought the game right when it came out.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.300
So I'm just wondering if you've hit that point yet, and I'm going to laugh.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.200
You just got Bubble Bobbled.

35:03.200 --> 35:09.800
Apparently, if you go to the ninth floor of the tower through the second playthrough,

35:09.800 --> 35:12.880
the game will crash after you talk to someone named John.

35:12.880 --> 35:18.000
You have to fight him to, you know, of course make it past that area so you're pretty much

35:18.000 --> 35:19.960
just stuck.

35:19.960 --> 35:27.780
No, there is a message from SNK stating that we're going to hear something soon, but nothing

35:27.780 --> 35:30.380
as of yet as far as I know.

35:30.380 --> 35:38.620
So let's hope that, more than positive, they're going to recall it or do something for it.

35:38.620 --> 35:42.360
Is the message going to say something along the lines of, we're really fucking sorry we

35:42.360 --> 35:43.800
didn't beta test this game?

35:43.800 --> 35:46.840
I mean, because when things like this are announced, it makes me think that the game

35:46.840 --> 35:50.640
is so god awful that not even their own internal QA department could play through the ninth

35:50.640 --> 35:51.640
floor.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.680
I mean, that's seriously the impression that I get about the game, is that if the game

35:54.680 --> 35:59.440
is so broken that not even their QA department was interested in playing it that far, what

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
else am I left to think?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.440
Oh?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.080
Well, it's good enough.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.200
I mean, hell, if the first couple levels worked in them, the whole game's probably good.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.760
I mean, after all, they're not that much different.

36:10.760 --> 36:11.760
I mean, come on.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.720
You want me to play through the whole thing?

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
Whatever.

36:15.720 --> 36:20.080
Well, news about broken video games makes us a little bit angsty, and you know what

36:20.080 --> 36:21.920
that means when we get angsty?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
People die.

36:23.920 --> 36:33.640
It's time for the FUs of the week.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.200
Dark Sakura, take it away.

36:36.200 --> 36:47.800
You know, FU goes towards certain people in management positions at my unlisted place

36:47.800 --> 36:55.560
of employment, and it's not really, you know, again, it's not necessarily a, I'd say it

36:55.560 --> 36:56.560
was a misthought.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.560
I'll put it that way.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.600
Assuming that I don't have enough work already to do with the one thing that I was already

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
doing.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.680
True, I get a couple days a month where they don't, you know, open as many assignments

37:07.680 --> 37:15.600
to me to finish, and I need extra things to do to keep busy, but I told them right up

37:15.600 --> 37:19.160
front, I was like, look, I'm not going to be able to do all this.

37:19.160 --> 37:23.120
I'm one person, and I'm sure as hell I'm not going to work overtime, unless you really

37:23.120 --> 37:26.680
want me to work overtime and pay me for it, sure, yeah.

37:26.680 --> 37:31.180
And true enough, you know, I finally said, you know what, if you're going to do this

37:31.180 --> 37:34.040
to me, then I'm just going to let them know when I can't get it all done in one day, and

37:34.040 --> 37:35.600
we'll see what they think of that.

37:35.600 --> 37:40.680
So finally the realization has dawned, and oh my God, she really is only one person.

37:40.680 --> 37:45.320
And while her productivity is amazing, not everybody can do all of this.

37:45.320 --> 37:50.280
So yeah, we're going to not let, you know, this employee go nuts and kill everybody in

37:50.280 --> 37:51.280
the company.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
So it's going to take a while.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.280
But the FV just goes to the situation.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.280
Loki.

37:57.280 --> 38:04.920
Uh, FV goes to, I think, my router, because I can't get it to fucking put two 360s together.

38:04.920 --> 38:09.440
It's just, one of them wants to work, the other one doesn't, and there's no rhyme or

38:09.440 --> 38:10.440
reason to it.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.440
It's just, uh-uh, I don't want to work.

38:13.440 --> 38:21.840
So I guess I've got to buy a Switch instead of purchasing shit.

38:21.840 --> 38:27.440
My FV of the week goes to Survivor, the ride at Great America, where I was at yesterday.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.960
We took a trip for Extraverse Sisters.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.280
I booked this ride out of the park.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.280
I know.

38:33.280 --> 38:37.000
First of all, how the hell do you make a ride out of Survivor?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
It's pretty cheesy, but whatever.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.400
Is it where you have to starve yourself and make it?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
No, no.

38:41.400 --> 38:46.040
Okay, you start off the ride, like when you're waiting in the queue, the little line before

38:46.040 --> 38:47.760
you actually get on the ride, right?

38:47.760 --> 38:51.120
They make you do, when it's your turn to go next, first you have to do this little tribal

38:51.120 --> 38:52.120
stomp.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.360
You have to do this stupid ass dance.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.120
Nobody ever does it, but they say you have to do it, right?

38:57.120 --> 39:00.040
And sometimes the little kids will get into it, but that's about it.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.520
And if you don't do it, then you're going to get sprayed in the face with water on the

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
ride.

39:04.520 --> 39:08.200
Okay, and you get on the ride, and basically what it is, it's this big disc thing with

39:08.200 --> 39:10.440
a big tribal mask in the middle, right?

39:10.440 --> 39:14.640
It's this big disc thing that goes around like a W-shaped track back and forth, and

39:14.640 --> 39:15.640
it spins.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.640
So it's kind of fun.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.640
I mean, Neil, it's really-

39:17.640 --> 39:19.200
It's not something I would hate, is it?

39:19.200 --> 39:20.200
I don't think you'd hate it.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.200
It's just different.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.200
It's certainly not like anything at Disneyland.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.000
It's a different type of ride, but it doesn't go upside down or anything.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.520
But here's the thing.

39:26.520 --> 39:31.080
Sometimes the ride will spray water at you, but at the very end of the ride, I was just

39:31.080 --> 39:32.080
in the right spot.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.160
There were these huge tiki torches right at the end of the coaster.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.280
The thing shot fire in my face.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.600
So F.U. is a survivor of the ride for shooting fire at me.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.280
That was not funny.

39:42.280 --> 39:47.240
And I scream like a little girl, because seriously, Disneyland is one thing when I get on the

39:47.240 --> 39:51.640
thrill rides where I'm going upside down and just being twisted up like a pretzel on some

39:51.640 --> 39:55.640
of those rides, and getting fire shot in my face on a ride named after a TV show that

39:55.640 --> 39:57.600
jumped the shark five years ago.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
Okay?

39:58.600 --> 39:59.600
F.U.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.800
I bet you'll do the dance next time now, won't you?

40:02.800 --> 40:03.800
Seriously.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
Hi, Cheryl.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.800
We'll teach that fucker a lesson.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.800
Jabooroo.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.640
I'll do the damn dance next time.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.360
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.880
You know seriously what my first words were when I got off the ride?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.080
I'm like, Jamie would like this ride because it shoots fire.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.640
I think I would.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.600
When you said shooting fire, I was like, hey, I like fire.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.600
All right.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.600
You didn't find it funny.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.600
I found it funny as hell.

40:25.600 --> 40:29.600
Fuego es muy bien.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.480
Fireboma says Skye is used to things being shot in his face.

40:32.480 --> 40:35.240
Zing, my second review of the week goes to Fireboma.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Congratulations.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
You're on me.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
You're on F.U.'s of the week.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.960
F.U. to DS Wi-Fi for being so damn temperamental around my router.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.960
I know it's not my router's fault if it wants to be so restrictive.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.960
It must be Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.240
Also, F.U. to the new patches that are coming out for WoW.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.600
Trying to go on the public test run.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.800
Oh my God, I'm lack-tastic.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.800
Nothing works in my UI.

40:58.800 --> 41:05.520
They've got some serious stuff to fix before they release that publicly.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.160
All right.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.680
Lots of angst in the studio tonight.

41:08.680 --> 41:12.240
You know you're going to get a good show when there's lots of angst in the studio tonight.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.240
Let's kill the music.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.280
Let's get back to some gaming news.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.280
I don't think so.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.080
Instead, let's go have ice cream.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.880
Ice cream sounds good.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.920
Let's have an ice cream podcast.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.920
I totally vote for ice cream.

41:22.920 --> 41:23.920
Okay.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.680
Orange Honors Radio is canceled tonight due to ice cream.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.120
Actually, I already had ice cream today.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.680
I can't have ice cream for two weeks.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.840
We'll have ice cream again.

41:31.840 --> 41:32.840
Loki, save us.

41:32.840 --> 41:38.280
Okay, well, the only thing that can combat ice cream is T&A and there is-

41:38.280 --> 41:40.280
Hey, that sounds great.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.280
Winner!

41:41.280 --> 41:43.280
I like T&A flavored ice cream.

41:43.280 --> 41:50.600
So there's this wonderful game that's being touted as T&A Pong on Kotaku.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.920
It's actually from a website, I guess, We Make Money Not Art.

41:54.920 --> 42:01.280
And it's, I guess, some woman named Jennifer Choudhuries.

42:01.280 --> 42:06.400
She has an intimate game controller and apparently, she says it's like Pong, but it's not really

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
like Pong.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.040
It's more like DDR, I would say.

42:09.040 --> 42:16.120
The whole game is basically there's, a woman has a bra controller where you, you know,

42:16.120 --> 42:20.440
grope her and then the guy has like boxers where she grabs his ass.

42:20.440 --> 42:21.560
And you watch the screen.

42:21.560 --> 42:25.640
There's like, first there'll be shapes coming up so, you know, you can grab anywhere.

42:25.640 --> 42:29.400
Then later on, as you progress through levels, there's shapes with other shapes on them,

42:29.400 --> 42:31.480
like star with the circle and stuff.

42:31.480 --> 42:35.500
And you have to grab certain parts and stuff and supposedly, it's supposed to make you

42:35.500 --> 42:40.520
either, you know, piss off because you lose or go have sex.

42:40.520 --> 42:44.400
Personally, it looked very, very, very, very awkward.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.080
So this is a game where even when you lose, you win?

42:47.080 --> 42:48.080
I guess.

42:48.080 --> 42:52.500
But hey, the way I figure it, you know, if you got some chick in bra and panties already

42:52.500 --> 42:56.080
and you're playing this game and grabbing her boobs, it can't be that bad of a game.

42:56.080 --> 43:00.280
This reminds me of that one boob twirling game they released like two, three years ago.

43:00.280 --> 43:01.280
Oh yeah.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.400
We had to make them twirl in different patterns.

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
That was a fun game.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.400
I'm watching the video on here even though I'm not supposed to.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.560
It's really, really stupid.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
Okay, here we go.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.120
I'm going to give the show an explicit tag.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.120
You ready?

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
Warning.

43:14.120 --> 43:17.160
The show is intended for mature audiences.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.160
Okay.

43:18.160 --> 43:22.580
Like when you first started talking about this, I kind of picture that maybe the woman

43:22.580 --> 43:29.960
like put a wiimote in her twat to navigate the game and it vibrates, right?

43:29.960 --> 43:30.960
It's not rez.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.480
It is so not rez.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.800
Would that be like lesbian pong?

43:35.800 --> 43:41.640
I don't think it's like that at all, but, um, I don't know.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.520
It's yeah, it's a pretty dumb game.

43:43.520 --> 43:48.440
They could really take it further though, but, um, apparently they didn't dark soccer.

43:48.440 --> 43:55.160
Would you play lesbian pong when I need the female perspective here on the show for a

43:55.160 --> 43:56.160
minute?

43:56.160 --> 43:57.160
Yeah.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.160
That's a yes.

43:58.160 --> 44:04.520
You would score, cut, print, saved archives.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.520
All right.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.520
That's a wrap.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.520
All ours over.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.520
We're off to go play games.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.160
We're going to, we're off to go create new games for the Wii.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.280
Nice knowing you for the past five years.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.640
Lesbian pong has ruined this show.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.640
Good night.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.000
No, but seriously though.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.920
They could put like a, what, what they could do is like, I don't know, make some sort of

44:21.920 --> 44:25.920
a different game, you know, where they could put more sensors on their bodies or something

44:25.920 --> 44:26.920
here.

44:26.920 --> 44:27.920
I don't know.

44:27.920 --> 44:28.920
No.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.920
What they need.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.920
Here's what the record.

44:30.920 --> 44:31.920
Yeah.

44:31.920 --> 44:36.180
But now we have an audio clipper saying yes.

44:36.180 --> 44:37.180
So it's, it's done.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.180
Okay.

44:38.180 --> 44:40.240
Here's what they need to do.

44:40.240 --> 44:44.240
And this, this kind of ties in with that really crappy eye of judgment game.

44:44.240 --> 44:48.120
They need to have something with the eye toy and the eye of judgment.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
That's a sex game.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
There you go.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.720
Oh dude, the eye of judgment on a sex game.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
I get it.

44:54.720 --> 44:57.360
And the Wiimote or, or six axis, right?

44:57.360 --> 45:02.560
Cause you know, six axis can detect how much you're rocking the boat or, but see then again

45:02.560 --> 45:05.800
though, you, they have all the USB ports so you can just, you know, hook it up with your

45:05.800 --> 45:12.120
usual USB powered like vibrators and shit and they'll just, you know, there you go.

45:12.120 --> 45:19.720
Total sex package never will happen because it's a dumb idea who the fuck would set up

45:19.720 --> 45:21.620
all this shit to have sex.

45:21.620 --> 45:22.620
That's just retarded.

45:22.620 --> 45:27.040
But then again though, they have all those sex board games and I don't know if that could

45:27.040 --> 45:28.040
be fun.

45:28.040 --> 45:32.040
Um, I wanted to say this real quick, actually, um, the talk about the brown eye of judgment

45:32.040 --> 45:37.440
actually reminded me, um, I got a private message on my Twitter from a PK or Uno who

45:37.440 --> 45:42.820
was telling me about another game, um, called Aquarian Age Alternative and he says this

45:42.820 --> 45:43.960
game is actually kind of fun.

45:43.960 --> 45:47.480
It's a Japanese arcade game that's actually kind of like the eye of judgment.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.180
You place real cards on a playing service and you watch as the game senses them and

45:51.180 --> 45:52.540
react accordingly.

45:52.540 --> 45:53.880
So I just kind of sent him a message back.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.160
I'm like, okay, but is it any fun?

45:55.160 --> 45:58.980
And he says, yeah, it's actually kind of fun because he said, yes, I have.

45:58.980 --> 45:59.980
It's pretty awesome.

45:59.980 --> 46:03.120
He says there's a lot of strategy and quick thinking needed and it does sometimes get

46:03.120 --> 46:05.080
pretty chaotic.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.080
That's awesome.

46:06.080 --> 46:09.600
And it proves once again, Sony didn't come up with an original idea.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.680
Way to go copying something.

46:11.680 --> 46:12.680
I don't know.

46:12.680 --> 46:17.640
I don't know how old this game is, but I hope, um, I'm going to just pimp his vox because

46:17.640 --> 46:19.560
he has pictures and stuff all over his vox.

46:19.560 --> 46:24.720
So if you want to see this as PK or Uno dot vox.com, P K E R U N O dot vox.com and he

46:24.720 --> 46:26.800
has this whole thing, Aquarian Age Alternative.

46:26.800 --> 46:27.800
Obviously it's out.

46:27.800 --> 46:30.600
Eye of judgment is not out there for this one came out first.

46:30.600 --> 46:38.320
So they try way to go Sony thinking that we wouldn't find the thing that you copied,

46:38.320 --> 46:44.560
but there you go proves that you're still not original and it's a still a dumb idea.

46:44.560 --> 46:49.480
There you have it.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.040
I'm curious to play it.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.640
You know, I'll try anything once.

46:52.640 --> 46:58.640
Anyway, uh, other famous Japanese arcade games, uh, may or may not be coming to the U S uh,

46:58.640 --> 47:04.560
two DX gold beat mania two DX gold, of course, uh, was tested previously and got some great

47:04.560 --> 47:06.560
reception from the music game community.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.000
Now the challenge is just getting people to pick it up.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.200
So I'll leave it to a user on Bemani style to try and get the word out.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.680
And they are trying to, uh, have a campaign, uh, to contact.

47:16.680 --> 47:20.080
They did a really good job of really breaking this down.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.820
How do I contact Dave and busters?

47:21.820 --> 47:25.880
How do I contact tilt arcade game work, six flags, and really break down that we want

47:25.880 --> 47:27.840
to see beat mania two DX golden arcades.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.320
I mean, it tells you what to say and everything.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.560
So, uh, hats off to this user, Brazil, the end, uh, for, and I hope I didn't horribly

47:35.560 --> 47:38.200
mispronounce that, but hats off to you for breaking that all down.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.520
And I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to this program because that used

47:41.520 --> 47:43.840
to be our forte a couple of years ago.

47:43.840 --> 47:51.080
So definitely check out the money styles forums, check out the forums, don't let golf land

47:51.080 --> 47:52.080
have it.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.080
Cause they'll break it.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.080
Absolutely.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.080
Okay.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.920
And for some reason, your mic's not picking up dark soccer.

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
Is it?

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
That's because it wasn't on.

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
All right.

48:00.920 --> 48:01.920
There you go.

48:01.920 --> 48:02.920
Yeah.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.480
What I said was don't let golf and have it cause you know, they're going to fuck it up.

48:04.480 --> 48:07.960
Uh, check out the music game discussion forums on a bimanistyle.com.

48:07.960 --> 48:13.040
Well, speaking of information that came out on a forum, there's a rumor going on that,

48:13.040 --> 48:17.880
um, the DDR supernova two North American field test is canceled.

48:17.880 --> 48:23.320
Um, it was posted by ride 19 on Aaron and Japan's forums.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.920
Oh, you said, Oh, you saying what's fake.

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
Oh, okay.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.760
Now, Oh, I thought you said the post is fake.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.760
You're talking about something else.

48:30.760 --> 48:31.760
No, uh, sorry.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.760
Okay.

48:32.760 --> 48:33.760
Don't do that to me.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.760
Uh, anyway, no.

48:34.760 --> 48:38.160
Um, well this guy, I think somebody that he works for the arcade that they were going

48:38.160 --> 48:39.560
to test it at or something.

48:39.560 --> 48:42.980
So I guess this guy would know, but that kind of sucks.

48:42.980 --> 48:46.920
You know, I honestly, myself don't put too much stock in something that I read on a forum,

48:46.920 --> 48:51.040
um, until I see something official put out by, by the company.

48:51.040 --> 48:55.720
So the only reason I would give a little credit to it is because they have done location tests

48:55.720 --> 48:58.040
there before that, that same arcade.

48:58.040 --> 49:03.640
So, you know, I'm, I, I, I was willing to believe it, but I do wonder to myself, did

49:03.640 --> 49:07.840
Konami pull it back to maybe further tweak the game?

49:07.840 --> 49:11.880
Maybe it wasn't ready to be tested cause you know, the internet is cruel and the game better

49:11.880 --> 49:14.160
be damn good or the internet will tear it apart.

49:14.160 --> 49:20.360
Well, there was also a quote on here, um, apparently a quote from maybe someone at Konami

49:20.360 --> 49:26.960
because again, this is on a message board, um, stating that, um, in order to prevent

49:26.960 --> 49:32.920
dissatisfaction of SN2, we have canceled the North American SN2 test site as it may result

49:32.920 --> 49:37.320
in creating a better dance game.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.320
That sounds fishy.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.760
I don't know about that one.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
I don't know.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
I could be wrong.

49:42.760 --> 49:43.760
All right.

49:43.760 --> 49:47.060
Cause usually why would a company admit that, Oh, the game kind of sucks right now.

49:47.060 --> 49:49.200
We're going to, we're going to go back and tweak it.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.200
I don't know about that one.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.200
I'm starting over.

49:51.200 --> 49:54.400
See you in 10 years.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.280
We hope you have a nice play again.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.600
All right.

49:57.600 --> 50:02.280
They need to have, they need to just completely make the dance pads more durable.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.400
Ditter fans are going to have to wait a little long for their ditter.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.400
That's that's the, that's what the story is.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.400
You can diddle later.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.760
I mean, didder later anyways.

50:09.760 --> 50:14.120
So certain, um, there's a few websites out there that got, you know, all excited after

50:14.120 --> 50:21.040
seeing an IGN mock-up of a guitar hero three controller, which I might add that is completely

50:21.040 --> 50:22.520
fake by the way.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.100
And it's no indication of what it's actually going to look like.

50:26.100 --> 50:31.440
They have, you know, basically a picture of a white guitar with the Wii remote in the

50:31.440 --> 50:32.440
neck of the guitar.

50:32.440 --> 50:36.240
That's, you know, just like before when they mocked up what the classic controller would

50:36.240 --> 50:40.120
look like completely mocked up.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.100
You know why I felt that was fake when I first looked at it is because of the way the Wiimote

50:44.100 --> 50:45.440
is strapped into that control.

50:45.440 --> 50:49.120
I mean, because basically what they have there is they have this guitar with a hand, you

50:49.120 --> 50:51.120
know, with the, what do they call it?

50:51.120 --> 50:53.320
What do they call the long part of that?

50:53.320 --> 50:54.320
The neck?

50:54.320 --> 50:55.320
The neck.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
Okay.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.320
Like they have the Wii thing snapping into the neck.

50:57.320 --> 51:01.720
But the thing is, is that if the Wiimote were to snap in, it'd break the infrared and the

51:01.720 --> 51:03.320
plugs are on the bottom.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.200
You can't, you wouldn't snap it in like that.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.280
You'd have to snap it in either on the bottom of the guitar or something.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.860
You can't push it in and have it just snap.

51:10.860 --> 51:11.860
It wouldn't work.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.240
It'd be too difficult to get in there.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.240
Yeah.

51:14.240 --> 51:19.120
And besides, if I remember correctly, I think they've already said that if, when they do

51:19.120 --> 51:24.800
release this, there's actually going to be a guitar that's sold separately that'll hook

51:24.800 --> 51:27.200
up via USB or something like that.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.520
So sorry, but that's not what it's going to be.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.400
It's not going to be something that you strap the Wiimote into.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.760
It's not like you have to plug the Wiimote into everything.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.760
Exactly.

51:37.760 --> 51:41.600
And I mean, I don't know.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.240
It's going to be Guitar Hero 3.

51:43.240 --> 51:45.280
It's just going to be on another fucking console.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
So woohoo.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
I know.

51:47.280 --> 51:50.480
It's like you've never played this game before.

51:50.480 --> 51:55.720
Well, also my thought is that it wouldn't look like the Gibson guitars because the Gibson

51:55.720 --> 51:57.020
ones were heard on the PS2.

51:57.020 --> 52:01.960
For the Xbox 360, we have, what was it, not the Thunderbird, but what was the other Gibson

52:01.960 --> 52:03.200
guitar that it looks like?

52:03.200 --> 52:04.200
Flying V?

52:04.200 --> 52:06.600
No, it doesn't look like a Flying V. But I was going to say, if they were going to do

52:06.600 --> 52:09.680
it for a different console, wouldn't they have done another guitar like the Flying V

52:09.680 --> 52:11.760
or maybe one in the shape of the Les Paul or something?

52:11.760 --> 52:12.760
Good thought.

52:12.760 --> 52:16.560
The only thing that would be cool is if this whole guitar rotated, kind of like ZZ Top,

52:16.560 --> 52:20.300
and then they could have cues where you swing the guitar around type thing.

52:20.300 --> 52:23.960
Is it too much to ask for one freaking guitar to work on all consoles?

52:23.960 --> 52:24.960
No.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.960
They're all USB.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.420
Why can't they?

52:27.420 --> 52:29.240
Why can't they make one universal guitar?

52:29.240 --> 52:30.240
That's right.

52:30.240 --> 52:31.240
That's what I wanted.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.240
I know why.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
Money.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.160
Because they get to sell you fucking more guitars.

52:35.160 --> 52:36.160
Alright.

52:36.160 --> 52:41.960
Well, the Queens of the Stone Age, you might know them, they're a band, and they have basically

52:41.960 --> 52:46.360
confirmed that they are going to be in some games.

52:46.360 --> 52:51.120
Basically I guess there's a promo ad going around for the band and it's confirming that

52:51.120 --> 52:55.440
they are going to be appearing in Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.440
What song?

52:56.440 --> 52:59.560
Don't know, but you know the Queens of the Stone Age are going to be in the games.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.300
By the way, they're also going to be in Madden 08 and NASCAR 08 if you are so inclined to

53:03.300 --> 53:05.280
play those games instead of Guitar Hero.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.280
Yay Tracks!

53:06.280 --> 53:07.280
That's right.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.280
Yay Tracks!

53:08.280 --> 53:13.080
And again, I like Junkie XL, so they always have a good Junkie XL track in there.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.720
And who doesn't love Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend?

53:14.720 --> 53:16.120
Oh wait, no one.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.120
Alright.

53:17.120 --> 53:18.120
Nellie does.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.280
But she doesn't count.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Your wife is weird.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
Alright, anyway.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.160
She's watched that video so many fucking times.

53:23.160 --> 53:26.120
I've never even heard it nor seen the video.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.120
I don't know why she likes the crappy Girlfriend song.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
Here it is.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.120
Here it is.

53:30.120 --> 53:31.760
Hey Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind.

53:31.760 --> 53:35.040
Hey Mickey, just replace the word Mickey with Girlfriend and that's pretty much the song.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.040
Oh.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.040
Alright.

53:37.040 --> 53:41.560
Uh, it's time for Jamie Tracks, or in this case, Jamie Websites, because Jamie likes

53:41.560 --> 53:46.000
to surf the internet up and down every week and find a favorite website of hers to share

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
with y'all.

53:47.000 --> 53:53.560
Here it is, Dark Soccer's website of the week.

53:53.560 --> 54:01.080
Today's website of the week is, um, it's brought to us by the Adult Swim, which normally I'd

54:01.080 --> 54:03.800
be like, Adult Swim, meh.

54:03.800 --> 54:10.200
It's great, it's called Bible Fight, it's a Flash game, where it's like Street Fighter

54:10.200 --> 54:11.200
with Jesus.

54:11.200 --> 54:16.080
I actually played a little bit of this game last night, I should have included that in

54:16.080 --> 54:20.040
my gaming week, and I battled Jesus vs. Satan, it was epic.

54:20.040 --> 54:24.440
But what's great is that they have special moves, like Jesus throws his thorny crown.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
It's awesome.

54:25.440 --> 54:29.400
You have Jesus, Eve, Mary, Moses, Noah, and Satan.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.920
Satan looks kinda hot.

54:31.920 --> 54:36.400
Wow, get dressed with cards and letters to Jamie at Orange Laundry Radio.

54:36.400 --> 54:40.920
Eve looks kinda naked.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.160
How can folks get to this website?

54:43.160 --> 54:48.680
The website is adultswim.com slash games slash biblefight, that's one word, index.html.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.600
There you go.

54:50.600 --> 54:58.200
So I'm gonna have Eve versus Mary, so I can see if she's naked.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.200
She's got issues.

54:59.200 --> 55:05.600
No, this is great, she has a snake on one arm and little leaves.

55:05.600 --> 55:09.800
The typical depiction of Eve, where there's always, Mary looks like she's got PMS.

55:09.800 --> 55:13.760
There's always like an animal or a fig leaf or something just conveniently placed over

55:13.760 --> 55:15.260
their naughty bits.

55:15.260 --> 55:17.240
So it's always kind of interesting.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.680
She's fighting with a halo over her head and fucking baby Jesus.

55:20.680 --> 55:26.560
She has 68 sets, and baby Jesus is a weapon, because that'd be awesome.

55:26.560 --> 55:27.560
Wow.

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
We're gonna get the hate mail tonight.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.120
GS68 says, Westboro will sue.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.720
Hey, we didn't create it, right?

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
Adult Swim did.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.000
Go take up your issues with them.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.240
Anyways, so the NBA has just launched into Second Life.

55:42.240 --> 55:45.120
Who cares?

55:45.120 --> 55:48.640
Apparently a lot of people are on Second Life, like it's fucking real world or something,

55:48.640 --> 55:49.640
you know.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.260
Ooh, the NBA's on there now.

55:52.260 --> 55:54.840
So I mean, they're in the real world too.

55:54.840 --> 56:02.680
But apparently you can go there and play horse and basketball and suck it up really bad as

56:02.680 --> 56:04.800
well.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.480
I don't know.

56:06.480 --> 56:13.440
I'm not surprised that more people make money off of this Second Life, but it's interesting

56:13.440 --> 56:14.440
nonetheless.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.360
I guess you can play horse and get pelted by penises.

56:16.360 --> 56:19.400
Jesus, keep the First Life out of Second Life.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.200
Damn, come on.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
Pretty soon people are gonna get...

56:22.200 --> 56:25.280
You should put that on a bumper sticker.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.280
Pretty soon.

56:26.280 --> 56:31.440
Seriously, that's a pretty good tagline for us, because you're a Second Life player, right?

56:31.440 --> 56:32.760
From time to time, yeah.

56:32.760 --> 56:36.880
I thought Second Life was just where people go to have virtual furry sex or something,

56:36.880 --> 56:37.880
I mean.

56:37.880 --> 56:38.880
Not like to play basketball.

56:38.880 --> 56:39.880
Someone made the TARDIS.

56:39.880 --> 56:41.480
I'm virtual ass, Loki.

56:41.480 --> 56:46.640
I'm gonna go into Second Life, I'm gonna play basketball, and then your friend goes, fuck

56:46.640 --> 56:52.040
that, I'm going outside and playing basketball there, where I don't have to worry about being

56:52.040 --> 56:53.760
pelted with flying penises.

56:53.760 --> 56:57.520
Jiranami, response?

56:57.520 --> 56:58.520
What the...

56:58.520 --> 57:01.480
Don't go play in a sandbox, then.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.440
You don't get that shit if you play in a sandbox zone.

57:04.440 --> 57:13.160
Okay, so don't go playing in a sandbox, because there's a virtual sandbox in Second Life.

57:13.160 --> 57:19.960
If I had that wah wah wah wah sound effect on this program, I would have just used it.

57:19.960 --> 57:24.800
I don't get it, I mean, what the hell do you do in Second Life?

57:24.800 --> 57:25.960
Stop.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.840
Try to find a life?

57:27.840 --> 57:29.640
No, I don't know.

57:29.640 --> 57:32.400
I imagine there's lots of people, you know, I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.440
Look at my cube I just made, it's so awesome!

57:34.440 --> 57:37.020
Would you buy it for $1000?

57:37.020 --> 57:39.640
I play World of Warcraft, so I can't talk, okay?

57:39.640 --> 57:42.600
But you know, I guess people play it because it's fun.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.880
That's what games are, they're fun.

57:44.880 --> 57:45.960
Furry sex is fun.

57:45.960 --> 57:50.000
Well, if World of Warcraft weren't set in some sort of fictional medieval time, I'm

57:50.000 --> 57:53.520
sure the NBA would be there, too.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.040
Point of Second Life is simple.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.600
Step one, fly around.

57:56.600 --> 58:00.360
Step two, do shit.

58:00.360 --> 58:01.840
Comments from Chatroom.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.440
The Rob D. makes some comments.

58:04.440 --> 58:07.380
Is Tim Hardaway there to hate you if you're gay?

58:07.380 --> 58:09.720
In Second Life, making fun of some earlier controversy.

58:09.720 --> 58:13.560
Rob D. says, is Dirk Nowitz, I'm totally not going to pronounce this, you're going to see

58:13.560 --> 58:15.400
how much I totally follow sports.

58:15.400 --> 58:22.040
The Rob D. says, and is Dirk Nowitzki there to suck in Second Life?

58:22.040 --> 58:25.440
Kevin the Groove says, in Second Life, you waste your first life.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
Duh!

58:26.440 --> 58:31.440
There you go, responses from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

58:31.440 --> 58:35.360
This is a little more interesting of a sports story, I think, I don't know.

58:35.360 --> 58:41.080
Pro football players will be training with Electronic Arts Madden technology.

58:41.080 --> 58:44.680
The same technology that's used in Electronic Arts popular Madden games is now being used

58:44.680 --> 58:49.320
to create a training simulator for professional football players.

58:49.320 --> 58:54.220
XOS Technologies is licensing the TDT engine from EA Sports to use in what's called the

58:54.220 --> 58:57.440
Play Action Simulator.

58:57.440 --> 59:01.960
The play action of family of products addresses team demands to uniquely and effectively teach

59:01.960 --> 59:07.640
new plays and game plans, says Bob Simmons, who is the XOS Coaching Solutions President.

59:07.640 --> 59:11.120
As the current provider of coaching analysis and game planning solutions to more than 200

59:11.120 --> 59:15.840
NFL and NCAA football teams, XOS thoroughly understands how teams prepare weekly for an

59:15.840 --> 59:17.160
upcoming opponent.

59:17.160 --> 59:21.680
The simulator is built on our TDT engine, which utilizes the same technologies and gameplay

59:21.680 --> 59:27.920
found in our popular Madden NFL game franchise, said the general manager of EA Tiburon, Steve

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
Chang.

59:28.920 --> 59:33.800
That's kind of cool, if you're a Madden fan, I bet that's pretty exciting.

59:33.800 --> 59:39.600
My response would be, what about those poor players who train and then end up with the

59:39.600 --> 59:41.400
really low ranking in Madden?

59:41.400 --> 59:44.820
You know Madden ranks all the real players and that's got to suck if you're the lowest

59:44.820 --> 59:45.820
ranked one.

59:45.820 --> 59:50.620
I seem to remember a story, either on this show or another show, when Madden 07 first

59:50.620 --> 59:54.840
came out about the poor guy who was the lowest ranked player in the game.

59:54.840 --> 01:00:02.600
I guess you didn't use this training simulator enough, who knows?

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
You know what?

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
What?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.600
What good is an actual simulator anyway?

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.120
It didn't help me become a better driver, I just played Ridge Racer.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.560
I was going to say, you have driving simulators, cops do cop scene simulators, I don't know,

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.200
simulators are there to simulate the real thing.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.080
What good is that going to do versus actual real experience?

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.040
Well keep in mind there's a lot of strategy in football too.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.520
Not just the running around and stuff, maybe it has to do with strategy and processing

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.520
it out.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.520
Do you just play Tecmo Bowl?

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.720
Yeah I do, Tecmo Bowl, I wanted the engine built on Tecmo Bowl.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720
Anyway.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720
We can agree on that.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.920
There is another, why am I getting all the rumors?

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:47.760
There's another rumor floating about that Nintendo of America is going to relocate.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.460
It was actually posted on Kotaku that employees were told on Thursday that they had until

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:59.400
June 1st to choose to willingly relocate or accept a severance package and the sites for

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.400
new offices are rumored to be San Francisco and New York.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.440
I'm hoping for San Francisco.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.480
Me too, because I could have applied for all kinds of jobs, and in fact I actually was

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.080
going to apply for a number of Nintendo jobs when I thought I was moving to Washington,

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.440
but now I'm not gonna.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.520
I want jobs there.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:29.120
Anyways, so we have GameStop over here and of course they have Game over in the UK, and

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.800
apparently Game has bought out its competitor, GameStation, for the equivalent of $100 million

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:44.120
US, approximately 74 million pounds, or euros, I can't tell.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.840
And now it will increase.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.920
So wait, GameStop is to game as GameStation is to EB Games?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.560
Something like that, yeah.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:04.220
So now they are about over 200 storefronts and the largest chain in Europe.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.400
So that's kind of interesting.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.680
I guess GameStop is over there too.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.160
There had been some speculation that GameStop had actually purchased them, but they didn't,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.200
so you snooze you lose.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.160
So does this make a game now a monopoly?

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.320
Because that's what a lot of people are saying is that, oh my gosh, they have a monopoly,

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.360
and even Kevin the Groove in chat says, what the hell, game is actually now a monopoly.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.520
I wouldn't say it's a monopoly, but it's pretty much as close to a monopoly as GameStop is

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520
over here.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.680
But GameStop, maybe that's the same perception as in Europe, is that GameStop does compete

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:45.160
with Best Buy and Walmart and online and the big box stores that carry more than just games,

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160
you know what I mean?

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160
That's where their competition is now.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.080
It's not like they're the only game store on the face of the earth, so I don't know.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.960
Because when I get pissed at GameStop, I go to, either I go to GameCrazy or because that's

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.840
kind of far, I'll go to Best Buy.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.120
But I don't know.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.120
My friend had a real horrible experience at Best Buy last week, and now I'm thinking I

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120
may not go there anymore.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120
Fries.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120
This is bad.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120
Fries, I could do.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120
I could do fries.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
I like fries.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.760
What are you hanging out over there, Drunami?

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760
You have a problem with fries?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760
Shitty service?

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760
Yeah, it's got shitty service.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.360
Sorry to hear that.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.360
Why is it shitty service?

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.120
I've had stuff that's like gone bad, went back there, and they're like, eh, whatever.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Least it's cheap.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120
And then they'll just give me a new one.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
All right.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.000
Well, anyhow, moving on to another story.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
This is interesting.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.720
This story somewhat struck a chord.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.560
I don't know about you guys, but this is really big in the news this week about a Chinese

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.840
student who was attending Clements High School, and of course because he's a high school student,

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.720
they don't give us his name, but he was removed from the high school.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.180
This is located in Texas in the town of Fort Benz.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.180
Parents were complaining.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.960
He recreated the school grounds in a game, which I believe was Counter Strike, and he

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.760
uploaded the map and all his friends were playing in it.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.560
And basically, he now has to go to an alternate education school.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.960
The police called him a terroristic threat, and so on and so on.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.880
Of course, you can't help but think this is all partially due to the Columbines and the

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.440
Virginia Techs of the world.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:16.280
But the reason why this struck a chord with me is that, okay, when I go back to 10 years

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:23.360
ago, 1996, right, a little more than 10 years ago, okay, my freshman year of college in

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.120
the college dorms.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.360
The game that was all the rage was Duke Nukem 3-D.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.720
We would play Duke Nukem 3-D all freaking night long, doing the modem thing, running

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.720
because in the dorms you're all right next to each other, but you all have separate phone

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.400
lines, because you have to do modem.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.640
There wasn't really the internet so much back then as there was modem play.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.920
We would run back and forth between the rooms and see who's where and who's doing what,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920
and it was really fun.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.440
But the point is, map editors came out, and what was the first map we tried to make at

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440
Duke Nukem?

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.840
We tried to recreate our dorm in Duke Nukem because we thought it would be funny.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.680
Of course, I tried to recreate Roundtable to play Duke Nukem 3-D in Roundtable, but

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.000
it doesn't mean I'm going to go shoot up the place.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.880
It's because it's a place you're familiar, you're like, damn, you're sitting there bored

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.320
or whatever in high school and you're like, damn, this would be fun to run around and

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.920
play paintball in or something like that, but you can't actually do that, so you create

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.680
a map that's familiar to you and you go and play.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.500
It's just like if you recreated your mall or something like that.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.920
The problem is these people are too fucking scared of everything that they immediately

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:31.480
think, oh my god, it's Counter-Strike, therefore he must be a terrorist, and I heard the rumors

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.080
also because he's Asian.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.440
D.V. in chat says he actually went to jail.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.680
There was an update on the story.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.680
Thanks, D.V.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.140
That's so stupid.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.400
What crime did he commit?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.960
Seriously, what crime did he commit?

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.640
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.600
Is there a component of this we don't know?

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.440
Why did the parents complain just about a map?

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:55.480
My parents thought I was doing homework, they didn't even know I was playing Duke Nukem.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.480
You know why?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.600
They wanted to be the fucking people that saw 9-11 coming and stopped it.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
That's what they wanted to be.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.080
They said, oh look, he's recreated a map.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.800
It's just like that Virginia Tech shooting.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
Let's get the guy.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.200
This is what I'm curious about.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.880
Was there something else that we don't know that the video game blogs aren't talking about?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.880
Well, he did have a hammer.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.680
You know what he could do with that hammer?

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.680
He could hammer shit.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680
Like people's skulls.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680
Did he make a threat?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.800
Did he make a threat months ago?

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.520
Was there something about his demeanor?

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.580
I'm stopping to think there's got to be something else.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.800
Are we really this trigger happy?

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.920
No pun intended.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.080
Are we really this trigger happy to arrest people because I'm thinking like, I did this,

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080
you did this.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.380
I mean, I don't know, Drunami's raising his hand because they're familiar places and for

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.040
me it was just kind of funny.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.880
Wouldn't it be funny to put stripper sprites in your dorm room?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880
That's funny.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880
I did it in Unreal.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.180
We were playing laser tag.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:57.480
I play video games and shoot people a lot in video games.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.440
I am not actually going to shoot a real person.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.820
I'm a smart, intelligent person who knows the difference.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:07.160
And even still 99.99% of the population is like me.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.040
Playing Counter Strike does not make you a killer.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.960
It doesn't even teach you how to shoot a gun.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.120
I mean, it's a video game.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.680
It'd be as bad as saying that Pac-Man would make you do drugs.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.040
I mean, come on.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.040
It's so ridiculous.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.520
And I would really like to know what the hell they arrested them on because making a map

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.600
of your school is not a crime anywhere.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.080
So I don't know what they did.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.360
And you know, if they found guns or, you know, a cache of weapons or something like that,

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.600
then that's a different story.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.320
But they didn't.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.840
So you know, what the fuck?

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.200
You know, I want to know, I hope to hell that they get their, you know, what's coming to

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200
them.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.680
I hope that they sue this school for a whole lot of fucking money.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.160
Well, we'll see.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.880
I mean, again, I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt that there may be a component

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.560
that we don't know about.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.040
But yeah, I don't know.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.160
Not happy so far.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160
We'll see.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.400
All right, so if you have a comment, if you have something you want to share, email us.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.960
Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com and pretty soon we'll be going into Part B of the program

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.000
and in Part B we'll get to tonight's mailbag.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.200
But in the meantime, more gaming news.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:20.240
Well, for anyone who likes their MMOs and is playing City of Heroes, Issue 9 is now

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240
released.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240
It's called Breakthrough.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.680
It has a new feature called the Invention System that lets you salvage ingredients and

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:34.880
recipes from your enemies and turn them into items for yourself or things that you can

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.160
sell.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:43.640
You can also get different sets of equipment, things to boost your abilities.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.160
There's also new sets of wings.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.880
There's angel, demon, dragon, burned bone, bat, cherub, insect, tech, and fairy wings.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.800
So different missions, different stuff going on is supposed to give you a lot more to do

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.600
instead of just fight.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.280
All right.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.040
City of Heroes is, again, one of those games on my big list of games I would like to play

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.320
but I just don't find the time to play them.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.640
But I bet City of Heroes is a lot of fun.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.640
Have you ever played that?

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
I know you were talking about that.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.640
No, I want to.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.240
I was going to try a demo.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240
Some point.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.240
All right.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.640
Well, at least I'll have this thing waiting for me whenever I finally play the damn game.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.120
Something interesting to come out.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120
It's kind of neat.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.700
It's a dance pad for DDR type games or music rhythm games.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.360
That's using lasers.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.920
Instead of the normal pressure sensors or push button switches and stuff, this one actually

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.920
uses lasers.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.960
So if you cut the beam, it counts as a button press.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.640
It's the brand new laser dance matrix, not a pad.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.560
And what's actually kind of neat about it is it wouldn't really break down, especially

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:53.540
since you're not really stepping on the switches and wearing that stuff down.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:59.680
Not available yet, although they're saying that they're going to be constructing them

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.460
kind of soon.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:08.680
And right now you can check it out on apply-sciences.net and they've got a little bit of information

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.160
on that and they're going to be creating those very soon.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.160
I think it's cool.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.340
I mean, definitely they should actually kind of do this with the arcade games.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.840
It would probably be a whole lot less teching of the pads.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.960
I never even thought of this idea and it seems brilliant.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.320
How can this fail unless the laser goes dead?

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:35.320
Seriously, there's no way for a button press to fail at all unless you just didn't step

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320
far enough into the pad.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.600
Or you kick a laser.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600
I don't understand.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.040
How could Blu-ray fail?

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.200
Shut up.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200
This is different.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.400
I can give you a couple of examples.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.240
There's not competing laser technology.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.840
Well, maybe there is, but you know what I mean.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840
I'm joking.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.840
Laser is a laser.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.680
Well I would definitely be interested in checking this out, but how expensive will one of these

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.680
things be?

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.280
I imagine it's got to be pretty pricey, wouldn't they?

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.320
They haven't said yet, but I mean it doesn't look like too much.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.920
Of course the cost is really going to be coming from the laser diodes.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.440
But then again, like pocket lasers cost like nothing.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.560
I use a pocket because I'm a trainer during the day, so I have a pocket laser that I use

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.000
to point at the board.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
That didn't cost anything.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.080
I think you get those 99 cent stores now.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.420
The only thing I could see that there would be a problem with is if you did happen to

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.540
bump the laser or something.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:29.820
If it's not in a very protective housing, you could un-align it and then there's some

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.920
calibration issues or maybe light interference from other things.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.520
But if it's able to detect a certain wavelength of light or something like that, then it probably

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.680
would work pretty well.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.840
I don't know.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.200
Hitstun in chat says, doesn't anybody else here remember the Sega Activator?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.200
It sucked ass.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.200
Did that run on lasers?

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200
That's all infrared though.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.360
That's infrared.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.600
Infrared's different, right?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.960
Infrared's low frequency and it's not exactly a beam, it's more of just kind of a light

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.960
source almost.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.200
It's like the Para-Para Paradise Pack.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.200
Or the Wii, right?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.200
Isn't that a little Wii thing?

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.200
This is on TV?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200
Isn't that infrared?

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200
Yeah, it's infrared as well.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.560
Why the fuck they don't have a calibration thing on that is beyond me.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.480
Come on, Nintendo.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.200
It makes sense.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.880
Now our chat room is full of laser cats jokes as well.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880
Everything from that sketch.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.160
As you know, we've talked about laser cats the game on the program before.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.880
The one thing that will definitively end the next gen war will be the console that can

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.760
get laser cats the game as an exclusive will be the winner of the next gen war in the OLR

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.760
book.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.280
Frickin' laser beans on some frickin' cats, is that too hard to ask?

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.080
What if it's like the PlayStation 2?

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.880
Then the PlayStation 2 wins the next gen war.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880
Don't buy any of them.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.880
Keep your PS2 and have laser cats.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.680
Game Boy Advance.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
Seriously.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.520
Whoever gets laser cats wins.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.520
You're a winner for listening to Orange Lounge Radio, but we are going to take a break here

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.640
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.800
For those of you listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.880
a couple days with our part B. This way we spread the OLR love throughout the week.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.540
Those of you listening live don't have to wait quite as long.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:22.720
We'll be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
