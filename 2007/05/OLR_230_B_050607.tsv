12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	19840	Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19840	21460	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21460	23680	It is Sunday, May the 6th of 2007.
23680	25160	Hey, itís 567.
25160	26160	Get it?
26160	28440	Weíre here for part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
28440	32640	You know, that would only happen once every few years if we get the consecutive numbers
32640	33640	like that.
33640	35400	Anyway, this is part B of our podcast.
35400	39080	If you missed the first half of this episode, please go back over to www.orangeloungeradio.com
39080	41400	and check out the first half of tonightís show.
41400	43400	We are taping live on Sunday night here.
43400	45920	Letís get back into some video game news.
45920	47440	Loki, start us off.
47440	52680	So the bastards over at Microsoft decided that itís time to ruin more fun for you,
52680	57200	including downloading stuff that you shouldnít be downloading, like demos and stuff from
57200	59020	other regions.
59020	66760	So apparently now theyíre going to be enforcing their Xbox Live demo download region lockouts,
66760	70360	and theyíre going to make it impossible for you to download content from other regions.
70360	73600	However, if youíve already downloaded stuff, good for you.
73600	74720	You get to keep it still.
74720	78440	But anything else, you can fuck yourself.
78440	79720	You can see it.
79720	80840	They wonít delete your accounts.
80840	83800	You can see what content is on there, but you canít do shit.
83800	86760	So you can look in the store window, but you canít buy.
86760	91720	And I noticed you came out swinging on this story, second word out of your mouth was ìbastards.î
91720	96960	So Iím curious if you feel personally affected by this, because you donít have a Japanese
96960	98840	account or anything that you were using, right?
98840	99840	No, not at all.
99840	100840	Itís all right.
100840	104560	And we only got demos for Armored Core 4.
104560	107840	I had a demo for Tenchu Z last year.
107840	111800	If Iím not mistaken, arenít they controlling this by IP address lookup, basically, that
111800	114480	theyíre making sure your IP address is in the country you say youíre from?
114480	117120	Oh, if thatís the case, thatís going to be fucking easy.
117120	120880	So whatís to stop them from IP spoofing?
120880	126400	Or port forwarding, or basically bouncing yourself off a different DNS server.
126400	128080	Here come the hacks pretty soon.
128080	130080	Thatíll be easy.
130080	134800	All right, well, Iím sure youíll get right on that in hacking.
134800	136760	Iím sure I will.
136760	137760	All right.
137760	143880	Anyhow, letís talk about whatís coming out to Xbox Live Arcade, in America at least.
143880	146720	I donít know about all regions, but I know weíre getting it here, and usually the arcade
146720	149280	releases are pretty much universal.
149280	154280	But whatís coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade, Double Dragon is coming out, and that
154280	159320	was rumored earlier in the week to be coming out, but this got confirmed by a press release
159320	162040	coming out of Empire Interactive.
162040	166240	Also Speedball is going to be released as well, Speedball 2.
166240	170680	This was a sports game featuring, like, robots or something.
170680	173000	There it is.
173000	176600	Although it says, actually, Iím going to correct myself, it says Speedball 2 is coming
176600	180620	within the coming weeks, but Double Dragon is coming out this week.
180620	183640	So we donít know if Speedball 2 is necessarily this week or not, but we do know Double Dragon
183640	184640	is for sure.
184640	187960	And I had not even heard of Speedball 2 before, I know they call it a classic, but somehow
187960	188960	I missed that one.
188960	191680	It wasnít like the Amiga, I think, and stuff like that.
191680	192680	Oh, well thatís why.
192680	196640	I still was on a Commodore 64 by the time everybody was talking about Commodore Amiga.
196640	201120	Well there is actually another game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and thatís Puzzle Quest
201120	207400	Challenge of the Warlords, which is already on PSP and Nintendo DS, and itís supposed
207400	209240	to come out later this year.
209240	217400	Itís also going to be coming out with Mad Tracks, which is like a Penny Racer the game
217400	221480	or something, and a Rocket Bowl thatís mini-golf but bowling.
221480	223640	Now Penny Racers really sucked.
223640	224640	This looks like a lot better.
224640	226460	I had Penny Racers when I was little, though.
226460	230080	This looks like, well, they had a game called Penny Racer on the Nintendo 64 and it blew
230080	231080	up.
231080	232080	I donít know what Iím talking about.
232080	235000	Oh, wasnít that, you know, that was Uniracer Iím thinking of.
235000	238880	No, this actually, no, this kind of reminds me of, except without any old, like the Micro
238880	240520	Machines games, almost.
240520	241520	Hm.
241520	243280	That could be kind of.
243280	245160	I mean, it has potential to be fun, but...
245160	246160	Like R.C.
246160	247160	Pro-Am?
247160	252960	But, quite honestly, Iím just, uh, Iíll just keep playing, you know, Uno and Symphony
252960	255480	of the Night.
255480	261000	But um, yeah, Puzzle Quest is going to be so awesome, I canít wait.
261000	265720	Anyways, we have other things coming out, of course, in all the regions of the world.
265720	269360	This week, lots of good stuff, well, not a lot of good stuff, but some pretty good stuff
269360	272120	coming to the US.
272120	275720	Starting off with, of course, on the Xbox 360, we have Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium
275720	280280	Wars finally making its way out, so thatís going to be pretty awesome.
280280	285360	On Playstation 2, we have Tidal Legends 2, which will be making its way out, and Tidal
285360	290920	Legends Powered Up on the PSP, so thatís kind of neat.
290920	295640	Driver 76 will be making its way out on the PSP as well, of course being the prequel to
295640	297960	Driver Parallel Lines.
297960	303120	Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing, and Heat Seeker on PSP.
303120	309320	Then of course, on, letís see, the PC, not a whole lot coming out, weíve got Locomania,
309320	316160	which sounds like a pretty interesting train simulator, and Circus Empire, which also equally
316160	318040	probably boring.
318040	324040	On Playstation 3, youíve got Big Fat Nada, and of course, the Wii, nothing to look at
324040	325520	there either.
325520	332640	And finally, the DS, nothing to see there either, so a whole lot of nothing.
332640	337180	I know actually, I think on Playstation 2 also,.hack//G.U Volume 2 is making its way
337180	343360	out, so thatís it for the week, pretty light week, but itís going to start picking up.
343360	344960	What about Japan, Rob?
344960	352280	Well over in Japan, we will have Command & Conquer 3 as well, at least hitting the Asia regions,
352280	355520	which I imagine a lot of folks who import games if they want to pick up the Asian version
355520	360360	can get that, as well as Spiderman 3 this week, on the Xbox 360 those games are coming
360360	361820	out on.
361820	367520	On the Nintendo Wii, not a lot, you pretty much have to wait until May 17th for the next
367520	370600	big game to come out on the Nintendo Wii.
370600	374320	It seems to be another really slow week in Japan actually, I remember last week was pretty
374320	376920	slow as well.
376920	383000	On May 10th on the Playstation 2, youíre getting Wrestle Kingdom 2 Pro Wrestling Sekai
383000	391080	Taisen as well as Simple 2000 Series Volume 117.
391080	392080	What the hell is this?
392080	395120	Iíve never even heard of Volumes 1 through 116.
395120	398440	You havenít heard of the Simple 2000 Series, man, I go on about these all the fucking time.
398440	401080	Theyíre budget games for like 2,000 yen.
401080	405200	Oh, okay, so itís just games going into this, okay, never mind.
405200	409960	Well, theyíre budget games that get released by like D3, like Earth Defense Force for example.
409960	411520	Okay, I get it.
411520	412520	Or Zombies vs Ambulance.
412520	413840	I didnít put two and two together.
413840	416560	Well, they have the Zero Sen, then youíll be happy to know here it is, the Zero Sen
416560	418400	is coming out on Playstation 2.
418400	420640	I can only download all of them.
420640	426520	It looks like planes blowing shit up, old planes, like it looks like 1941 all over again.
426520	427520	Awesome.
427520	430640	They really need to bring the Simple series over to the US.
430640	434600	I mean, can you imagine just all the like really cheap ass games coming out?
434600	436400	Thatíd be cool.
436400	442880	On the Nintendo DS this week, you get a game called Saikou Todai Shogi is coming out this
442880	443880	week.
443880	444880	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
444880	447880	Itís a board game for the DS.
447880	451560	Saikou Todai Shogi.
451560	455040	Yeah, Saikou 2, lady.
455040	456040	Okay.
456040	458040	Itís a board game simulator.
458040	460040	Yeah, itís Shogi.
460040	464640	And, yeah, isnít part of the fun about this segment getting to hear me butcher Japanese
464640	466240	pronunciation?
466240	468040	By the way, the big, big, big release this weekÖ
468040	469400	That means greatest something.
469400	472480	I think this might be why you donít see much coming out this week, because finally when
472480	476640	I got to the bottom of the page and saw the PSP releases, Final Fantasy Tactics coming
476640	481680	out in Japan this week, the PSP version there, so Iím sure thatís what youíll all be playing
481680	482680	and importing this week.
482680	485920	So the rest of the games just kind of donít matter anymore.
485920	487720	How about the Europe release dates, Jamie?
487720	488720	Why donít?
488720	491040	Iíll tell you about them, Rob.
491040	495280	On the 9th, we have Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.
495280	501680	The 11th brings us 32nd Americaís Cup of the Game on PC, Bus to Move Bash on Wii, Driver
501680	508160	76 on PSP, GoPuzzle, PlayStation 3, Hard Rock Casino on PS2 and PSP, and for the DS, we
508160	511160	also have Picross DS and Turn It Around.
511160	514640	Iíd like to bash the Bus to Move series after this many years.
514640	515640	Go away.
515640	516720	Donít come back.
516720	520760	I want a new actual Bus to Move, not a puzzle bobble.
520760	526000	Remember Bus to Move on the PlayStation 2 with the artwork that had the baby on it,
526000	528600	and it was like, ìWhat in the fuck shit is this game?î
528600	531880	Well, didnít they have Bus to Move on the PlayStation 1?
531880	535280	Bus to Move was on the PlayStation 1, right, and it started on PlayStation 2, if I remember
535280	536280	correctly.
536280	537280	Right.
537280	538280	Well, theyíve been on every platform.
538280	539400	Iím talking about the US Bus to Move puzzle bobble.
539400	540400	I know.
540400	541400	Thatís why Iím here.
541400	548720	The Japanese one, you know, you could emulate that on your PSP, because, you know, thereís
548720	549720	the workarounds.
549720	550720	Yippee!
550720	555880	Iím hooping and hollering and screaming out of pure joy, because Iíve never played puzzle
555880	558720	bobble in my entire life out of the 50 times itís come out on the console.
558720	561720	I play Puzzle de Pons, which is almost the same thing.
561720	564920	You should play Puzzle in Deserts, fun.
564920	565920	Anyway.
565920	566920	Anyways.
566920	572920	So, Warhawk, about that game thatís supposed to be coming out, I still donít know much
572920	575680	about it, other than the fact that itís going to be multiplayer only.
575680	580960	We do know that thereís going to be a beta and a demo, because this game needs all the
580960	584200	exposure possible.
584200	590600	So those should be coming soon, I know the gameís due out in June, and, yeah, should
590600	592600	be pretty exciting.
592600	599640	Alright, whatís also exciting is people getting to take their own pictures on their camera.
599640	602160	Itís the PSP camera.
602160	607140	It came out in Japan already, but itís still not come out in the US, but if youíre in
607140	609800	Europe or Australia, you do get the cam.
609800	612920	Itís called the Go Cam, and itís coming out May 16th.
612920	618000	It comes with a little program called Go Edit that allows you to edit sound and video all
618000	619960	from this little camera.
619960	622200	So check that out if youíre in Europe or Australia.
622200	624760	If youíre in the US, you donít get a camera.
624760	628440	Yes, in which case youíll get the free program called Go Fuck Yourself.
628440	631920	Oh, youíre so funny, Loki.
631920	634680	Iím so glad we have you on this program.
634680	635680	Or Go Fuck Yourself A.
635680	647240	Well, for anybody who likes their nifty looking skins or versions of their DS, as I point
647240	654720	to Andrew with his old school ñ His Wal-Mart bot cover for his DS.
654720	660880	Anyway, I have one thatís signed by Miyamoto.
660880	664000	I have one thatís signed by me, and thatís more awesomer.
664000	675220	Thereís a Golden DS Lite that has a backlit diecast sword and shield crest, and it has
675220	683320	a custom charge stand, and two painted styli in silver and black.
683320	689520	The only way that anyoneís going to be able to get one is to get it on eBay, according
689520	697240	to this, and itís going to be going to the Childís Play charity.
697240	699040	Good cause, stupid DS Lite.
699040	700040	Or DS.
700040	701040	I donít know.
701040	702040	I think it sounds kind of cool.
702040	703040	It looks kind of nice.
703040	708520	I kind of wish they put that out officially.
708520	712480	I know, Iím kind of waiting for Nintendo to copy this idea and put it out, but not
712480	713480	for charity.
713480	718680	Donít get me wrong, I think itís a great cause and everything, but Iím just waiting
718680	720080	for Nintendo to steal the idea.
720080	724120	No, Sony will release another PSP, which will have the Zelda shield on it with the sword.
724120	726880	It wonít make any sense, but they copied it, so thatís all that matters.
726880	730480	Theyíll just call it Dark ñ what was that game?
730480	731480	The Soul Calibur.
731480	733480	No, what the hell was that game?
733480	734480	Dark Cloud.
734480	735480	Dark Cloud, thank you.
735480	736480	Theyíll call it the Dark Cloud cover.
736480	738480	They need a new Dark Cloud game.
738480	747480	Anyways, so there was an interview with Iwata, and he was talking a little bit about the
747480	752840	state of Nintendo and a little bit about the releases, basically saying that theyíre going
752840	759560	to see a brand new Mario, Metroid, and Smash Brothers game in í07, so all three of those
759560	761640	games are probably coming around around Christmas.
761640	766040	Theyíll make their big splash, but they are coming this year.
766040	773520	At least thatís whatís planned so far, so donít be surprised if they move to next year.
773520	778640	I know, dates under consideration, or dates subject to change, or whatever that crap is
778640	780280	they always get away with doing to us.
780280	781280	Soon.
781280	782280	Theyíll be coming out soon.
782280	783280	Soon.
783280	786680	To be honest, whoís really surprised that Metroid Prime 3 or whatever is coming out
786680	787680	in the fall?
787680	788680	They gotta have something for this Christmas.
788680	792840	Whoa, I never thought that would be coming around Christmas.
792840	796800	Tell me I can play it on the internet, and Iíll get tons more excited, seriously.
796800	800120	Tell me I donít have to use friend codes anymore, and Iíll blow a load.
800120	802680	Iíll be very excited.
802680	807480	Anyway, this news made me about that excited.
807480	813500	It really did, because this is one of my favorite, all-time favorite 80ís Commodore 64 games
813500	814500	ever.
814500	816260	Itís Impossible Mission.
816260	820120	This game is incredibly great for the Commodore 64.
820120	823560	Iím sure itís one of those games that my memories of it are way fonder than the way
823560	826760	the game actually is, so donít try to tell me any different.
826760	830280	However, the important thing about Impossible Mission is that it is coming out on the Virtual
830280	831280	Console.
831280	832280	Hereís the trick.
832280	840760	Youíll notice itís a Commodore 64 game, or was a Commodore 64 game, but the rumors
840760	842840	were that Commodore 64 was coming to Virtual Console.
842840	845280	It is not simply a rehashed Impossible Mission.
845280	846280	No, no.
846280	854880	It is Impossible Mission with now updated mode with new graphics and all that stuff,
854880	858840	so a new version of Impossible Mission with the retro one included.
858840	862680	You can think a lot of those Xbox Live titles are kind of like this, but the interesting
862680	868480	thing about this is that would make Impossible Mission the first Wii download title that
868480	873400	is not simply some Nintendo game just copied over and resold.
873400	874840	So thatís very exciting news.
874840	878360	Iím almost more excited about this than I am ActRaiser finally freaking coming out here
878360	879760	at some point.
879760	882960	So Impossible Mission coming out soon.
882960	887420	They havenít said when, but they are saying itís going to be the first.
887420	891560	By the way, Impossible Mission also is coming to other regular platforms.
891560	895440	Itís coming out to the PlayStation 2, the PSP, and the DS.
895440	898240	Well, thatís pretty cool.
898240	900600	Yeah, Iím so excited.
900600	904440	Well guess whoís coming out to the UK Virtual Console?
904440	905440	Virtua Fighter 2!
905440	910200	Sadly, however, it is the Mega Drive version.
910200	916120	Yeah, which over here I do believe the Mega Drive was the Genesis.
916120	918600	I know, itís going to be the crap version.
918600	923480	And you know, I am not a fan of Virtua Fighter, you know, my husbandís a big Virtua Fighter
923480	924480	fan.
924480	929040	Iím the Tekken girl of the house, but Virtua Fighter 2 made me cry, except that I did try
929040	932560	the trick where you could hit Kage over and over and over again and knock off his mask.
932560	936000	Fuck them both, Soul Calibur.
936000	942440	Also though, right now thatís coming out this week for Virtual Console in the UK, now
942440	947360	this makes me happy, is Wonder Boy and Monster World, which I would really love, because
947360	949640	I actually do own that game.
949640	950640	Very, very fun.
950640	957500	Itís too bad that we donít have Master System games for Virtual Console, because I would
957500	959800	love to have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
959800	960800	Yet.
960800	961800	Yet.
961800	964640	I want a new Daytona game.
964640	967360	Is that so much to ask?
967360	968360	Just for the theme song.
968360	971440	I want any new Sega game to not suck.
971440	973120	Is that too much to ask?
973120	975260	So if I may continue.
975260	980000	Also out is Shock Man, which was a PC Engine game.
980000	986860	It was actually in the, let me start over.
986860	991960	G-Bean Man series is called Shock Man, which is basically like, weíre going to be Mega
991960	992960	Man, but not really.
992960	996200	There were a lot of PC Engine games that were like that.
996200	1002800	And then we have Atlas Kid and the Enchanted Castle, also a Genesis slash Mega Drive game,
1002800	1008640	and like I said, Virtua Crap 2.
1008640	1010200	I like Virtua Crap.
1010200	1012760	Itís why I take in my Virtua toilet.
1012760	1016320	Itís taking a shit in Second Life.
1016320	1018240	Or PlayStation Home.
1018240	1022400	Chat.org is not a strategy.com comments, Act Deft is cheering you on, Daytona on VC, Dark
1022400	1025960	Tetsuya says, ìOh shit, yes Loki.î Completely pop-up?
1025960	1030800	Well not on VC, Iím talking about a fucking brand new game, you know, like a redoing Sega
1030800	1031800	Rally.
1031800	1032800	Who wants Daytona 2?
1032800	1039040	I want a newer game, Daytona 3,000 million.
1039040	1040320	Death Race Daytona edition.
1040320	1042240	And PS, it doesnít suck.
1042240	1044840	Yeah, and it doesnít suck.
1044840	1050240	Anyways, so whatís actually pretty cool, and thank god that someoneís doing it, theyíre
1050240	1058320	going to be giving out brand spanking real trophies for the leaderboards on Alien Hominid
1058320	1060880	HD on Live Arcade.
1060880	1061880	And these are so awesome.
1061880	1064920	I mean that right there is an excuse to play the game.
1064920	1070840	You get these nice shiny trophies and theyíre going to be doing that I guess every so often.
1070840	1072800	Alien Hominid is awesome.
1072800	1073800	I like the trophies.
1073800	1078120	I think they should do that, or do something like the old Activision patches and stuff
1078120	1079120	like that.
1079120	1081680	Dude, the old Activision patches were so awesome.
1081680	1085000	Why canít Microsoft mail achievements to me in jacket patch form?
1085000	1086000	Seriously.
1086000	1091200	Well I think they should do that for completing a game, like getting all 1,000 achievement
1091200	1092280	points or something like that.
1092280	1093280	They should do that.
1093280	1095120	I mean how expensive can this be to put out?
1095120	1099040	They are charging me $60 for a goddamn video game, right?
1099040	1102880	But maybe they, I guess because of rentals and stuff, maybe they want to make sure people
1102880	1104120	actually own the game or something.
1104120	1105120	I donít know.
1105120	1107120	Maybe a little something special for actually owning the game.
1107120	1110280	Because back in the 2600 days they didnít rent video games.
1110280	1111800	I donít know.
1111800	1113800	I miss that.
1113800	1118240	One way that you might want to train for winning those trophies is playing other video games
1118240	1120600	because video games are good for you.
1120600	1125200	At least thatís according to Yahoo who this week ran a story about five ways that video
1125200	1128600	games can make you better, stronger, and faster and I thought Iíd share those with you again
1128600	1130320	coming from Yahoo.
1130320	1133680	They can improve your eyesight is one.
1133680	1139800	That was from a March 2007 study at the University of Rochester because it tested college folks
1139800	1145200	and apparently after 30 hours of game plays the ones who played the games outperformed
1145200	1149200	the ones who didnít play the games and their ability to accurately pick out objects in
1149200	1153080	a cluttered space so they can play Whereís Waldo better.
1153080	1157600	So if I sit close to a TV thatís supposed to ruin my eyesight, this will actually help
1157600	1158600	me as well.
1158600	1164680	If I play a game on the TV and sit too close, itíll kind of wash.
1164680	1165680	I donít know.
1165680	1169160	Youíll have to run a separate study on that.
1169160	1176680	Number two, they can help you focus and theyíre relating this to folks that have ADHD, they
1176680	1180760	donít have the ability to focus and stuff and playing a video game forces you to focus
1180760	1184040	but I beg to differ because I have gaming ADD.
1184040	1186280	I never beat video games anymore.
1186280	1187280	Seriously.
1187280	1188840	I beat them for five hours and then get sick of them.
1188840	1189840	Itís sick.
1189840	1191360	I think they mean not necessarily over long term.
1191360	1195760	I think they mean for periods of time, not for long term.
1195760	1198400	Thatís not gaming ADD.
1198400	1200520	Thatís just called, this game is fucking boring.
1200520	1203000	Iím sorry, what were you talking about?
1203000	1206600	Oh, look a bird.
1206600	1207600	To get the reference.
1207600	1213640	They focus so much that they play and forget about their families and get divorces.
1213640	1216440	Step number three, they can help you lose weight.
1216440	1219320	And of course, DDR, Itoy Kinetic, Wii Sports.
1219320	1223120	Or gain a lot of weight depending on which game it is.
1223120	1229000	Number four, they can help you understand classic literature.
1229000	1238000	For instance, Halo is being used by Roger Travis who is an associate professor of modern
1238000	1241120	and classical languages at the University of Connecticut.
1241120	1250760	And he uses the Halo story as some type of comparison to the Homeric epic, to his stories,
1250760	1251760	the Homer epics.
1251760	1254680	So, thereís a story to Halo?
1254680	1257240	How does Halo sound like the Odyssey or the Iliad?
1257240	1259560	Actually, specifically, I think heís citing Aenid.
1259560	1261200	That was Virgil.
1261200	1262200	That wasnít Homer.
1262200	1265600	It was Virgil taking the inspirationÖ
1265600	1266600	What theÖ
1266600	1267600	Yeah.
1267600	1268600	Were there head shots in the Aenid?
1268600	1269600	Wait, hold on.
1269600	1271360	Iím going to read through this story here.
1271360	1273960	The Aenid was by Virgil.
1273960	1275360	What the hell is thatÖ
1275360	1276360	Anyway.
1276360	1277960	No, the story does say that.
1277960	1280240	Well, then why did they sayÖ up here they say Homeric epicÖ
1280240	1281720	Because it was inspired by Homer.
1281720	1282720	Okay, I get it.
1282720	1284880	You want literature, you play Zenasaga.
1284880	1288360	You want literature, you fucking read a book.
1288360	1289600	How about that?
1289600	1293960	And step five, they can literally save your life.
1293960	1294960	And they are sayingÖ
1294960	1295960	Trauma Center!
1295960	1298720	Yeah, well, not just Trauma Center.
1298720	1304720	The doctor, Dr. James Rosser of New Yorkís Beth Israel Medical Center says to his patients
1304720	1310240	that heís awesome at Super Monkey Ball because his hand-eye coordination helps in surgeries.
1310240	1311240	I donít want him to be a doctor.
1311240	1312240	He co-authored a study.
1312240	1313240	I know.
1313240	1314240	Seriously, Iím moving to New York.
1314240	1316280	There you go.
1316280	1318720	Five ways that video games are good for you.
1318720	1321440	Letís see, Iím looking into the chat room there.
1321440	1325480	So would that be like, you know, ìHey, Iím a great proctologist.
1325480	1330680	I practice a lot of Oonga Boonga.î I mean, come on.
1330680	1333440	James Patrick defending Halo a little bit, Loki.
1333440	1334520	Halo has a lot of story.
1334520	1335880	A lot of it is just not in the game.
1335880	1336880	I know.
1336880	1337880	Itís called sarcasm.
1337880	1342960	All right, then I wonít read the rest of his comment.
1342960	1346480	Vandalous is making a Shakespeare reference saying, ìDo you bite your thumb at me, sir?î
1346480	1350080	And I know why he did that because remember when we went miniature golfing with Vandalous
1350080	1351080	the other night?
1351080	1352560	We actually went to Golfland and golfed.
1352560	1355480	Drunami was there, too, and I was out there quoting Shakespeare.
1355480	1358800	I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.
1358800	1365000	And like I think I actually impressedÖ I think I actually impressed William because
1365000	1373600	he kind of looked over at me and he was kind of like, ìYou actually know Shakespeare?î
1373600	1377520	And I also want to point out, you might want to turn your mic on once in a while.
1377520	1378520	Fuck.
1378520	1379520	Okay.
1379520	1382120	I pointed out the best, though, Shakespeare fact of all in the play Hamlet.
1382120	1386040	The word ìbungholeî isnít it?
1386040	1390320	You were the type of girl that stayed after class to look up shit in the dictionary, werenít
1390320	1391320	you?
1391320	1392320	No, I was not.
1392320	1394320	Because thatís what we did.
1394320	1398160	I would stay behind to look up the entomology behind it.
1398160	1400680	Disgusting.
1400680	1406520	Originating from the Latin word ìscheitnau.î No, ìscheitî is the British deviation.
1406520	1413560	And this is why Dark Sakura is in charge of the mailbag, because sheís very familiar
1413560	1414560	with shit.
1414560	1415560	Yeah, thatís right.
1415560	1418920	Sheís very familiar with shit, therefore sheís perfect for reading your emails.
1418920	1420080	No, just kidding.
1420080	1421080	We love getting emails.
1421080	1425720	Itís part of what makes this show so special is that we have the interaction with our listeners,
1425720	1427980	be it the Skype line, the chat room, or emails.
1427980	1431920	So if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
1431920	1440240	Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, and pull out some shitty email to read.
1440240	1446600	Well the first email of the evening is sent to us by ion671, ìDear OLR guys and girls,
1446600	1451600	I was looking at the screens for Eye of Judgment and while Iím not going to buy a PS3 for
1451600	1456480	it some aspects,î anyway, ìthe fact that you can see your animated monsters in your
1456480	1459560	hand on screen to me seems like a cool idea.
1459560	1462720	Now developers just have to use it, maybe Iíll follow, too bad Nintendo doesnít have
1462720	1463720	the camera.
1463720	1467120	Seeing your Pokémon next to you on screen, think about it.î
1467120	1468960	A good idea, yes.
1468960	1474260	I admit when I first saw it at E3 I was kind of like, ìHuh, well thatís kind of neat.
1474260	1476560	Is it a next gen system seller?
1476560	1480800	No effing way.î Because seriously, I donít see why they couldnít have done this last
1480800	1481800	gen.
1481800	1484640	Whatís so special about the Eye of Judgment, really?
1484640	1485640	Nothing.
1485640	1486640	Anyway.
1486640	1487640	But I do like the idea of Pokémon.
1487640	1488640	Pokémon Stadium!
1488640	1491200	Do you know where that would be cool?
1491200	1492200	Internet play!
1492200	1495280	Wouldnít that be kind of cute to play on the internet and like you could actually have
1495280	1496280	your Pokémon?
1496280	1497280	Oh no, look at my Pokémans!
1497280	1498280	Look at my Pokémans, Jamie!
1498280	1499280	Let me show you them!
1499280	1504720	My Pokémans brings all the boys to the yard and theyíre like, ìI got Charizard!î Anyway,
1504720	1505720	whatever.
1505720	1508040	Sorry, I totally fucked up that one parody.
1508040	1509680	But yeah, fail.
1509680	1514640	But the problem is Nintendo will never embrace internet gaming so that will never, ever happen.
1514640	1517120	But nevertheless, itís a cool theory.
1517120	1524640	Anyway, the next email comes from our friend overseas that wrote us last week, from Matt.
1524640	1525640	ìHey, Orange Dones Radio.
1525640	1530560	Iím writing you this week to answer the question posed in Part B of your podcast last week
1530560	1532960	about the European and Bemani community.
1532960	1536660	I can say that where I am, it is alive and well, although I wouldnít describe it as
1536660	1538440	thriving like California.
1538440	1542180	Finding a machine here in Italy is pretty difficult unless you go to a bigger city like
1542180	1543400	Milan or Torino.
1543400	1548960	The arcade culture that is so fragile and dying where we come from kind of never existed
1548960	1552560	here, as cultural phenomenon video games are really frowned upon.
1552560	1557140	Unless you were playing Winning Eleven, then you were automatically labeled as ìSfigato,î
1557140	1559480	the Italian equivalent of a nerd.
1559480	1564600	That being said, where you do find machines, theyíre always in immaculate condition and
1564600	1566480	have a sizable community around them.
1566480	1571280	The vibe I get from the European scene is like it was for me in 2002 in Tennessee.
1571280	1575880	Websites like DDR Freak are communities of that nature, but everyone by name who plays
1575880	1577280	regularly and thatís pretty cool.
1577280	1581320	By the way, DDR Freak was around in 2002 because I was a moderator in 2002 when it was NorCal
1581320	1583960	only on the green board.
1583960	1588680	He said that itís not like it is in California, right?
1588680	1589960	Where the machines are all torn up and dirty?
1589960	1594600	I was going to say, I guess the perception of what the Bemani scene is like here must
1594600	1599000	be different over there because Iíll tell you, go look at the DDR Freak like NorCal
1599000	1600000	SoCal forums.
1600000	1604000	Itís a lot of retrospective posts about how the community used to be.
1604000	1608640	What was the last great DDR tournament you went to, DarkSakura?
1608640	1609640	B3.
1609640	1611360	Then how many years ago was that?
1611360	1612360	Actually, the one I ran.
1612360	1614520	And how many years ago was all this though?
1614520	1615520	Couple years.
1615520	1617040	It was within Orange Arms Radioís history.
1617040	1618040	I think it was in 2003?
1618040	1619040	2003.
1619040	1621040	Yeah, it was ë03 is when B3 happened.
1621040	1623120	That was a long time ago.
1623120	1626200	Itís just not what it used to be.
1626200	1627400	I donít know how else to phrase it.
1627400	1633080	Either I got old or the game got old, I donít know, or both.
1633080	1639520	So I would say itís not thriving in California, although I donít know.
1639520	1643120	You do see folks playing the game, like when we were at Golf Land, I saw some kid playing
1643120	1646860	the game and he looked pretty good and he had a little nickname that he put in the machine
1646860	1650400	and everything and he probably posts on some of those DDR communities, but I donít know.
1650400	1652440	I donít see the community like we used to.
1652440	1658160	Remember, we would go to Golf Land, we would literally pitch a tent behind those machines,
1658160	1661520	having the birthday cake or whatever was going on that night, sitting around.
1661520	1662960	It was a real community.
1662960	1664720	I donít see that like I used to.
1664720	1665720	I donít know.
1665720	1668680	Well, thereís a P.S. to this.
1668680	1672920	My terrible typo in the last email should have read as ìIt never fails to please.î
1672920	1675920	As Iím in Italy, my English is obviously not in the best of use.
1675920	1678920	Somewhere in that dark place between ìnever fails to pleaseî and ìnever disappointsî
1678920	1680840	the abortion of a sentence was formed.
1680840	1685120	Thankfully, your proud line of judgement caught it and you guys made a funny joke out of it
1685120	1686280	too.
1686280	1687280	We knew it was.
1687280	1688920	I always play with everybody.
1688920	1693360	Yeah, Dark Sakura is an equal opportunity bitch, actually.
1693360	1694360	Iím not.
1694360	1695360	Hearts.
1695360	1699120	No, Iím just, whenever the opportunity hits me.
1699120	1702480	Just especially to foreigners because she hates British people, right?
1702480	1705040	No, I want to move there.
1705040	1709000	Dear British listeners, send me a ticket, please, and Iíll rub you.
1709000	1712280	Well, she just wants to stalk David Tennant, but anyway, next email.
1712280	1714120	No, I donít want to stalk David Tennant.
1714120	1717800	I want to go drinking, anyway.
1717800	1720120	With Billy Piper and then hope something happens.
1720120	1724200	No, sheís pretty, but not my type, anyway.
1724200	1729960	Next email comes from Necky, speaking of one of our listeners from the UK.
1729960	1731940	Dear OLR, howís you?
1731940	1734440	Last weekís ìDonít give a shitî episode was amazing.
1734440	1737480	Be sure to get Warrior Bob back on as he is really cool.
1737480	1741920	Also after hearing the whole Sony God of War goat fiasco, I was left feeling a little horse
1741920	1742920	giggle.
1742920	1755880	Jamie, Dead and Furious, Iíve heard of this game about two months ago, my home site dscommunity.co.uk,
1755880	1757720	and it really doesnít look like that great.
1757720	1758720	Have you seen the screenshots?
1758720	1761480	Personally, I donít like, but youíre open to your opinion, though.
1761480	1763920	On the theme of dead, touch the dead.
1763920	1768120	That guy works in a fucking plug for his website every time he sends us an email, and Jamie
1768120	1770520	falls for it every time, I just like to point out.
1770520	1772360	No, I donít fall for it, I actuallyÖ
1772360	1776320	No, itís cool, Iím all for promoting the indie website, so Iím just giving this guy
1776320	1779040	a hard time, because he works it into every email.
1779040	1780920	Itís cute.
1780920	1781920	Okay.
1781920	1784200	Oh, Lord of the Rings Online is a bitch.
1784200	1788240	My mate has been trying to install it on his Vista since the day it was released.
1788240	1791240	With Rob saying the game sucks kind of influences my decision.
1791240	1797320	Worth it or not, nothing left to say except the new Guitar Hero 2 song packs kick ass.
1797320	1799200	Oh hell yeah, they do.
1799200	1800280	Why bye, Nicky.
1800280	1802920	Oblivion is so my game at the moment, played at loads.
1802920	1804560	Oh, Oblivion is incredible.
1804560	1808320	Anyway, I just wanted to say, if you want to try Lord of the Rings, itís actually really
1808320	1809320	easy.
1809320	1813000	All you have to do is you can go to any computer store and you can get a trial disc for like
1813000	1817940	two dollars, except the only problem is itís labeled ìWorld of Warcraftî, because the
1817940	1820600	game rips it off in every single way.
1820600	1826680	Rob, first of all, UK, second of all, theyíre trying to install it on Vista and itís not
1826680	1827680	working.
1827680	1830040	Well, you can play World of Warcraft on Vista and Iím pretty sure they have the same trial
1830040	1832480	thing in the UK, because you can download them now.
1832480	1835800	But I mean, itís different than World of the Rings.
1835800	1840160	Iím just trying to say, Lord of the Rings is not fun and I already played it when it
1840160	1841160	was called World of Warcraft.
1841160	1842160	Let them judge for themselves.
1842160	1843160	Fine.
1843160	1845280	And when you, why are you listening to this show?
1845280	1846560	You want me to judge it for you.
1846560	1847560	It sucks.
1847560	1850280	If you beg to differ, email nasty things to us.
1850280	1851280	Just email.
1851280	1855640	This comes from Ospher, looks like somebody new.
1855640	1857400	I wasnít a drunk, Ospher.
1857400	1858400	I promise.
1858400	1859400	Thatís Ospher, not Ospher.
1859400	1860400	Iím sorry.
1860400	1861400	Yo, this is Ospher.
1861400	1863440	I just wanted to say that I love this show.
1863440	1866960	You guys are sort of like a radio version of Attack from the Show, Attack of the Show
1866960	1870520	from G4TV.
1870520	1873440	We know you meant it as a compliment, so weíll take it that way.
1873440	1874440	Okay.
1874440	1875940	Actually, you know what?
1875940	1878080	When I met Kevin Pereira, he was really cool.
1878080	1882120	I canít say anything negative about the people on that show because they are really talented
1882120	1883120	and all that jazz.
1883120	1887440	Itís just what that entire network has become that is sad.
1887440	1892520	I watched G4 the other day because I was watching Cheaters at like 2 in the morning.
1892520	1893520	So email, huh?
1893520	1894520	Sorry.
1894520	1898320	Anyway, I just wanted to know, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky, how good are all of you at DDR and
1898320	1899320	BeatMania?
1899320	1901560	Personally, I suck at BeatMania, but I still love the game.
1901560	1902920	As for DDR, Iím fairly decent.
1902920	1907920	When it comes to difficulty, Iím able to do 10 furtors, footers like Max Unlimited
1907920	1912480	getting a grade of B, and Zephyr Oni getting an A. As for my perfect attack, it needs work,
1912480	1916760	but Iím not able to AAA anything in the arcade, yet Iíve triple Aíd lots of songs on Heavy
1916760	1918640	at home.
1918640	1925080	For me, I actually was pretty far up there, and then if youíve been listening for a while,
1925080	1931080	I developed chronic fatigue syndrome after having pneumonia for three months, and since
1931080	1935160	then Iíve fallen out of practice with DDR, so Iím building it back up now.
1935160	1938920	Iím actually back up to seven furtors, sort of.
1938920	1942960	I just get really, really, really exhausted really easily.
1942960	1946480	I used to be pretty good at DDR, especially when we started this show.
1946480	1948240	I was beating nines regularly.
1948240	1952080	I didnít ever quite have the stamina to clear a lot of tens.
1952080	1956240	I could clear bag, but I couldnít really do the max 300, so thereís just too much
1956240	1957240	stamina.
1957240	1958240	I think I got bag once.
1958240	1959800	But my perfect attack was good.
1959800	1963240	I actually triple Aíd quite a few seven and eight furtors in the arcades, and I actually
1963240	1967120	would participate in tournaments, and I came in fourth place in a couple of them.
1967120	1970800	Thatís as high as I ever got is fourth place, but to me thatís still a pretty decent showing
1970800	1971800	for me.
1971800	1973040	I was very proud of myself.
1973040	1975920	But I suck now, but I donít have a good excuse like Jamie.
1975920	1981320	My excuse is I got fat, and that makes me not so good at DDR anymore.
1981320	1983680	Yeah, I lost all my stamina.
1983680	1984680	I used to be good.
1984680	1990000	I used to be able to do hard catas and even my wonderful edits on doubles all the time,
1990000	1995440	and now I can do, you know, sevens and eights and stuff, but it really kicks the crap out
1995440	1996440	of me.
1996440	1998740	Itís just I donít have the stamina for it anymore.
1998740	2003600	If I played all the time, you know, maybe, you know, just had a DDR machine in my house
2003600	2005300	or something, thatíd be different, but.
2005300	2009120	I got really lazy with Beatmania, though, after not having a reliable machine to play
2009120	2013680	on because we were playing 2DX7 style for a long time when we had it at Scandia.
2013680	2014680	Eight.
2014680	2015680	Eight.
2015680	2018360	In Beatmania, I went from crappy to really crappy.
2018360	2024600	But I was, I had actually just started beating seven stars because you were there when I
2024600	2028920	beat Nine Oí Clocks and what was the Eurobeat one?
2028920	2029920	Monkey Dance.
2029920	2030920	See, but hereís the thing.
2030920	2031920	Hereís the thing.
2031920	2032920	Seven stars isnít as hard as they come anymore.
2032920	2035600	So, weíre like dating ourselves in bimani terms, you know.
2035600	2039000	Yeah, but I used to keep a list of all the seven stars Iíd beaten and stuff, but now
2039000	2040000	itís.
2040000	2043640	You remember when I used to have memorized my list of nine footers back in the day?
2043640	2044640	I know.
2044640	2045640	I know.
2045640	2046640	Again, weíre all talking back in the day.
2046640	2049920	I love Beatmania 2DX, itíll always be one of my favorite games ever and itís one of
2049920	2053240	my favorite music games ever even to this day, but the series has just gotten old for
2053240	2054240	me.
2054240	2058360	Itís what, in its 14th version now and how much has the game changed?
2058360	2059360	Not at all.
2059360	2060360	And Iím just kind of bored of it.
2060360	2061360	I donít care about 2DX anymore.
2061360	2062360	Iím sorry.
2062360	2065140	Well, there is another bit more to this email.
2065140	2068480	Also when it comes to DDR Supernova 2, where the hell is the info?
2068480	2073720	By this time last year, we practically knew most of Supernova 1ís song list.
2073720	2075960	Why do you think Konami is keeping this under wraps?
2075960	2077720	Thanks for reading, Oscar.
2077720	2082760	And yeah, they actually tried to keep it under wraps last year, as far as I was aware.
2082760	2084120	I hope they do keep it under wraps.
2084120	2088160	I hope itís like Max 2, where we didnít see that shit coming until it was there.
2088160	2089160	That made it exciting.
2089160	2090160	I want a surprise.
2090160	2096200	And extreme, or not extreme, but you know, Supernova is like, hereís everything, and
2096200	2097380	itís just not exciting.
2097380	2103160	I would totally love, though, to have like an unlock system the way that Max did.
2103160	2107000	You know, to have stuff come out over time, which encourages people.
2107000	2110360	The more that you play, the sooner youíre going to get stuff coming out.
2110360	2112120	I think that that would be really fun.
2112120	2117440	You know, do you remember how we would congregate around the machine and say, okay, we have
2117440	2120800	to do this many more until we get our next song?
2120800	2128280	Iím telling you, DDR needs a card system in the US, and it needs something more battle-y.
2128280	2129880	It needs to become a more competitive game.
2129880	2132360	Thatís how the game could evolve, but no oneís listening to me.
2132360	2135920	And battle mode, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is not enough, because itís
2135920	2136920	not the focus of the game.
2136920	2141120	Thereís a PS of this, it says, ìI donít consider myself to be that great at DDR yet.
2141120	2142120	Why?
2142120	2148720	Iíve met Mega Man X, and he lives pretty close by here in Northeast Ohio.
2148720	2149720	You know what?
2149720	2154800	I donít really think, this is my opinion on gaming, especially in a competitive sense.
2154800	2156880	Why make a competition of it?
2156880	2158440	Why just not have fun?î I agree.
2158440	2160480	Why not just have fun with it?
2160480	2164160	You know, I remember reading, actually, you know Foxtrot, right?
2164160	2173280	The Sunday comic in the paper, and how the little girl was trying to make a paper airplane
2173280	2175480	or something, and her dadís like, ìOh, let me show you!
2175480	2176480	Donít you want to have the best?
2176480	2180840	Donít you want to be this?î Sheís like, ìNo, I just want to have fun.î
2180840	2186640	And no offense to this guy or his ego, but I have no idea who that guy is, he just said.
2186640	2187640	I donít know who that is.
2187640	2188640	Neither do I.
2188640	2189640	I have no idea.
2189640	2194440	Iím not sure heís nice, but Iím good at DDR, apparently, but I donít, you know, heís
2194440	2195440	not that famous.
2195440	2197440	Of course, neither are we.
2197440	2200160	Of course, Iíve got to open up the usual can of worms.
2200160	2201160	Guess what?
2201160	2205920	The other game had a battle system that was actually pretty decent in the groove.
2205920	2209320	Guess who saw that up?
2209320	2210320	I disagree.
2210320	2212520	I think In the Groove was the same damn game as DDR.
2212520	2214520	Itís just a different wrapping.
2214520	2216600	Guess what game had a battle system?
2216600	2219680	That mania, guess which one, you know, became In the Groove.
2219680	2222680	I do not want to have this debate again.
2222680	2223680	Fuck.
2223680	2226680	ìHey Jamie, just made a quick email to say pump up the volume rocks.
2226680	2228480	Whatís your favorite class in Ragnarok Online?
2228480	2229480	I like acolytes.
2229480	2232080	I did have a super acolyte, but I played assassins.
2232080	2237840	I actually managed to get an assassin cross on one of my free servers.
2237840	2242400	Still youngest listener who wants to blow shit up and hopes you get eaten by a group.î
2242400	2247880	When I played Ragnarok Online, I played an acolyte who had a bow in his hair because
2247880	2249880	he was cute and pretty.
2249880	2252080	That was my wallpaper on my phone for a long time.
2252080	2253080	Thatís great.
2253080	2255080	I played a battle acolyte.
2255080	2256320	I donít know how much they suck.
2256320	2259080	Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
2259080	2264760	We look forward to hearing from you.
2264760	2266120	Back into some game news now.
2266120	2272040	Anyways, so, you know, this isnít a big surprise I think because video games live usually performs
2272040	2279400	at most of these big industry events, but, anyways, video games live will be performing
2279400	2285920	around the same time as the E4ALL convention in October and, of course, will feature a
2285920	2292800	wonderful mix of music from a bunch of different games and should be performing at the Nokia
2292800	2299320	Theater around October 19th, so thatís actually pretty cool.
2299320	2300320	I donít know why.
2300320	2304720	I actually really want to go to E4ALL even though Iíve heard the talk about itís nothing
2304720	2306960	more than a glorified EB Games, but I donít know.
2306960	2311880	I just kind of want to go to that atmosphere and, obviously, the opportunist in me sees
2311880	2316680	it as a great promotion opportunity for our show, but I just kind of want to go and check
2316680	2317680	it out.
2317680	2318680	I think it would be fun.
2318680	2325380	The other thing too, to be honest, it sounds a lot more exciting than the E3 this year.
2325380	2331000	Even looking at E3ís show for plans, stuff like that, itís like, ìWow, yeah, thatís
2331000	2332000	awesome.î
2332000	2335000	Well, you know, the E3 wasnít supposed to have the glitziness this year, and Iím sure
2335000	2339880	weíre just a little bitter for not getting invited, which is true, but I donít know.
2339880	2341840	Iím kind of excited about E4ALL.
2341840	2343640	I think I definitely want to go.
2343640	2345320	I hope we all can go.
2345320	2348480	That would be fun, but weíll see.
2348480	2350000	Weíll see.
2350000	2356120	Anyhow, some controversy going on this week with Blizzard, of course, itís earlier been
2356120	2361120	said that they are going to be announcing a new game on May 19th, and, oh my God, is
2361120	2362120	this blown up.
2362120	2366320	Honestly, I donít know who to believe, because folks are saying, ìOh, leaked, itís StarCraft,
2366320	2370080	the MMO, itís the StarCraft MMO thatís coming out, itís World of StarCraft,î even though
2370080	2372560	that name would make no sense at all, because itís more than just a world.
2372560	2373560	Drew, why are you twitching?
2373560	2375300	And I donít think they would do that.
2375300	2376300	You know why?
2376300	2377300	Why?
2377300	2378300	Compete with World of Warcraft.
2378300	2379300	Drewís twitching.
2379300	2383880	Number one, we donít need another MMO from Blizzard.
2383880	2390040	Number two, I know competing with yourself is actually good for business sometimes, but
2390040	2392520	I donít think it would be such a good idea here.
2392520	2399040	And, of course, just adding fire to this rumor, Vivendi was giving a presentation to Wall
2399040	2404800	Street and said, ìAll Blizzard franchises will become MMOs,î which strikes me as hilarious,
2404800	2408940	because to me, and I know Blizzard fans are going to get pissed, but honestly, to me,
2408940	2414280	World of Warcraft does already feel like World of Diablo to me, honestly, like the game plays
2414280	2418400	very similar to me, so I donít know what the big deal is, but whatever.
2418400	2422820	But then Blizzard quickly responded to that, ìThe rumor is not true in regards to Blizzard.
2422820	2425960	We believe the rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of
2425960	2430840	information provided to industry analysts.î Bottom line, you donít know shit until May
2430840	2431840	19th.
2431840	2432840	Period.
2432840	2438000	Youíre going to hear every rumor under the sun, you wonít know for sure until May 19th.
2438000	2441320	Personally, personally, I think itís Starcraft 2.
2441320	2446540	And thatís not an MMO, not an MMO, I think itís just Starcraft 2, the way the Starcraft
2446540	2448840	fans want their sequel to Starcraft.
2448840	2452460	It damn well better be Starcraft 2.
2452460	2454000	I would be happy with that.
2454000	2458840	All right, so there you have it, weíll see what happens when the big announcement is
2458840	2459840	made.
2459840	2465140	Well, speaking of big announcements, and this is actually a very, very big announcement
2465140	2472320	to me personally, is that one of our gaming legends, well, I should say legends in game
2472320	2479480	making, Don Bluth, who brought us, you know, Dragonís Lair, is working on a Dragonís
2479480	2486840	Lair movie thatís a prequel to Dirk the Daringís whole ordeal outside of the Dragonís Lair.
2486840	2494120	So hopefully it actually will legitimately have a tie-in and be, you know, a little bit
2494120	2497760	better than, you know, Dragonís Lair 2 was.
2497760	2503680	Dragonís Lair 2 was the acid trip game, Iím so sorry.
2503680	2507760	But there better be like gruesome, gory, skeleton deaths in it, thatíd be really awesome.
2507760	2509760	Awesome.
2509760	2513560	I donít know how I feel about the Dragonís Lair franchise being milked to death 20 years
2513560	2514560	past its prime.
2514560	2517080	At least itís not, I hope itís not going to be as awful as the old cartoon was.
2517080	2519520	Yeah, I donít know, I donít know how I feel about this.
2519520	2523260	I mean, in the end, I will judge based on the product thatís delivered, but, you know,
2523260	2527600	I donít know, I only have so much love for Dragonís Lair in my heart.
2527600	2532600	And believe me, I do have a lot of love, I completely loved the Commodore 64 version
2532600	2535600	of the game, if for nothing else, but I thought the music was some of the best soundtracks
2535600	2539240	like ever in an 80s game, but yeah, I donít know.
2539240	2544680	Speaking of 80s cartoons, you probably heard this week that they put up the first episode
2544680	2548960	of the 1980s version of the Pac-Man cartoon on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2548960	2549960	Really?
2549960	2550960	Yeah.
2550960	2551960	I did not hear that.
2551960	2552960	Itís for a free download too.
2552960	2553960	Yeah.
2553960	2554960	Already?
2554960	2555960	Already.
2555960	2556960	Holy shit, I missed that.
2556960	2557960	I want to check that out.
2557960	2558960	Itís kind of cool.
2558960	2559960	I thought that was funny.
2559960	2563720	The Rob Dean chat says, ìDragonís Lair franchise.î It wasnít a franchise, it was one arcade
2563720	2564720	game that was innovative.
2564720	2565720	WellÖ
2565720	2566720	Two arcade games.
2566720	2570920	Yeah, there was a sequel, because they had the sequel at Golf Land, and there was a sequel
2570920	2574800	on the Commodore 64 too, and then there was Space Ace, which some people kind of consider
2574800	2576400	a part of that series, even though itís not.
2576400	2577400	Brain Dead 13?
2577400	2578400	You know what I mean?
2578400	2579400	So anyway.
2579400	2580400	What about Brain Dead 13?
2580400	2581400	What about it?
2581400	2582400	It was an awesome game.
2582400	2583400	It was an awesome game.
2583400	2584400	Okay, if you say so.
2584400	2585400	Anyways.
2585400	2587720	So, no else is an awesome game.
2587720	2588720	Resident Evil 4.
2588720	2592960	And of course, itís coming to the Wii in a port of sense.
2592960	2598840	Itís going to be coming out though for a low, low price of $29.95.
2598840	2605320	And pretty much, you know, the GameCube or PlayStation 2 version with tacked on Wii controls,
2605320	2608760	and going to have the bonus content that was also available on the PlayStation 2 version
2608760	2609760	as well.
2609760	2617640	So, if you think thatís worth $30, then definitely worth picking up.
2617640	2618640	I donít know.
2618640	2619640	Well, I donít know.
2619640	2622200	I mean, like, maybe Iím the only person on the planet that didnít buy this game for
2622200	2625480	the GameCube or PlayStation 2, because I played my friendís copy.
2625480	2626480	So I donít know.
2626480	2628760	Iím actually kind of interested, because it was a fun game, and I think with the Wii
2628760	2631360	controls it would be, you know, really fun.
2631360	2633480	So for $30, itís not a bad deal.
2633480	2636480	Itís a good game.
2636480	2637480	Are you going to get it?
2637480	2638480	Anybody else?
2638480	2639480	Iím not buying it.
2639480	2640480	I donít know.
2640480	2641480	All right.
2641480	2642480	Letís see.
2642480	2650280	One more story for you guys, and then weíre going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2650280	2657520	GamePro ran a story this week called, ìThe 10 Worst Selling Game Consoles of All Time.î
2657520	2664960	I donít think this was done by actual sales figures, but it says, ìHere are the 10 worst
2664960	2671320	selling consoles of all time in terms of high-profile systems that stood a viable chance.î
2671320	2672560	The Fairchild Channel F.
2672560	2675000	Well, Iím actually going to name the 10 systems.
2675000	2677840	I want to know how many of these you actually own, Dark Sakura.
2677840	2681960	First off, those of youóokay, Iím assuming none of you have read this story yet.
2681960	2685720	If you havenít read the story yet, what would you guess is number one, the number one worst
2685720	2687040	selling console of all time?
2687040	2688120	The Fairchild Channel F.
2688120	2689120	The Fairchild Channel F.
2689120	2690120	I donít know.
2690120	2691120	What would you say, Drew?
2691120	2692120	The Jaguar.
2692120	2693120	The Jaguar.
2693120	2694120	Loki?
2694120	2698040	I would actually say the Neo Geo.
2698040	2699040	Okay.
2699040	2700040	All right.
2700040	2701040	Jaguar, Jaguar, Neo Geo.
2701040	2702600	I already know, so I canít answer.
2702600	2704920	Virtual Boy says Frisbee in chat.
2704920	2706600	Master Systems says GS68.
2706600	2707600	All right.
2707600	2708600	Letís see.
2708600	2710840	Number 10, the Dreamcast.
2710840	2712520	I own two of them.
2712520	2717080	The Dreamcast sold only 10.6 million units during its short three-layer lifespan only.
2717080	2718080	Yeah.
2718080	2721520	I want to know how many of these systems Jamieís owns, by the way, in their house.
2721520	2722520	All right.
2722520	2723520	What do you want to say, Loki?
2723520	2729480	Oh, I was just going to say, hopefully, Sony can beat 10.6 million units in three years.
2729480	2731760	Letís see.
2731760	2733880	Number nine, the TurboGrafx-16.
2733880	2736520	I have a Turbo Duo and a PC Engine.
2736520	2737720	Number eight, the Saturn.
2737720	2738720	I have two of those.
2738720	2740160	I have three.
2740160	2741560	You guys are nerds.
2741560	2743120	Number seven, the Sega CD.
2743120	2744420	I have three.
2744420	2746980	No love for Sega on this list.
2746980	2748720	How do you have three Sega CDs?
2748720	2749780	Isnít one enough?
2749780	2751440	I have a drawer loader and two side loaders.
2751440	2754000	Actually, no, I think one of our side loaders was broken.
2754000	2755480	Fucking nerd.
2755480	2757320	Number six, the 3DO.
2757320	2760000	Hell no, I have taste.
2760000	2761000	I played a 3DO.
2761000	2762000	I know.
2762000	2763000	I played one once in the Sears.
2763000	2765440	I havenít bought a CDI.
2765440	2768440	Number five, I believe, was the Virtua Boy.
2768440	2769520	Number five was the Virtua Boy.
2769520	2772640	I have one in one of those hard cases.
2772640	2774440	Drew says it never had a chance.
2774440	2776480	It never had a chance, and believe me, I own one.
2776480	2778480	It never had a chance.
2778480	2781840	I actually do own one, and they call them the great red migraine machine.
2781840	2787000	The amazing red seizure machine of death with a horrible controller.
2787000	2788000	Oh my God.
2788000	2789000	It was a decent controller.
2789000	2790240	No, it was a horrible controller.
2790240	2791800	Number four, the CDI.
2791800	2792800	No.
2792800	2793800	You donít have that?
2793800	2797400	No, because it had those shitty not-Zelda games on them.
2797400	2798400	But it had Myst, too.
2798400	2800000	I could play that on PC.
2800000	2803080	Five hundred and seventy thousand units sold to the CDI.
2803080	2805000	Number three, the Atari Jaguar.
2805000	2806000	No.
2806000	2808840	The only reason I would ever want one, though, is for Tempest.
2808840	2810120	And thatís exactly what the story says.
2810120	2813480	The system had Tempest 2000, but every other game was garbage.
2813480	2816120	Sold 250,000 units.
2816120	2819160	Number two, the 32X from Sega.
2819160	2820160	You do have that?
2820160	2821160	I have two 32Xs.
2821160	2824760	And you agree with it being the number two worst-selling console of all time?
2824760	2825760	Selling has nothing to do with that.
2825760	2827920	Itís more of an add-on than a console.
2827920	2833520	Okay, by their terms, sold versus hype is a fair entry on the list.
2833520	2836540	Iím surprised that Picoís not on here.
2836540	2838960	Here it is, the number one.
2838960	2842160	It is not the Neo Geo, although that was a good guess.
2842160	2843360	I canít believe that wasnít on here.
2843360	2844360	Itís one of the ten.
2844360	2846400	The number one, the Apple Pippin.
2846400	2847800	I do not have a Pippin.
2847800	2852120	The Pippin was made between Apple and Bandai, which is funny, because thereís a lot of
2852120	2854560	people who have always said, ìApple should get into gaming.
2854560	2858500	Apple should get into gaming.î But Apple did get into gaming in í95 with Bandai.
2858500	2862280	They launched their system for six hundred bucks, and this is in í95.
2862280	2866160	See, I figured that the Neo Geo for sure would be up there, because it wasnít their game.
2866160	2868880	I donít remember how much the system was, but the games were like a couple hundred bucks,
2868880	2869880	werenít they?
2869880	2871200	Yeah, but you get arcade perfect games.
2871200	2872200	Woo-hoo!
2872200	2874280	Hey, you know what, itís been worth it.
2874280	2875600	Iíll buy an arcade cabinet then.
2875600	2876600	I mean, seriously.
2876600	2877600	You know what, itís been worth it to me.
2877600	2881920	I actually, you know, I can sit down and play my Samurai Showdown 2, and on top of that,
2881920	2884040	with no region lockout, you have no problem.
2884040	2886440	After a while, some of the games go down in price.
2886440	2892480	You know, we can pick up some of the classics, you know, Magician Lord and, you know, all
2892480	2893480	kinds of games.
2893480	2894480	I have GameTap.
2894480	2895480	Magician Lord and GameTap.
2895480	2899760	Yeah, but keep in mind, I had this, you know, five years ago.
2899760	2901400	I know.
2901400	2905840	Forty-two thousand units sold of the Apple Pippin, and always makes PC Worldís worst
2905840	2908920	tech products of all time lists.
2908920	2910640	Good job, Apple.
2910640	2911640	We salute you.
2911640	2914160	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.
2914160	2917720	If you want to feed back on the worst console youíve ever played, or really anything in
2917720	2923240	general, weíll take your calls right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype,
2923240	2928360	if you want to call us that way, because our 800 number is only toll free in the U.S. and
2928360	2929360	Canada.
2929360	2930400	You can also call us on Skype.
2930400	2933080	The username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
2933080	2935240	Letís go to the phones and take some calls.

2938920	2939920	Hi, Dark Tetsuya.
2939920	2942920	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
2942920	2947120	Oh, I just got an announcement I had to make.
2947120	2952600	Announcements, announcements, announcements, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die,
2952600	2955560	a horrible way to talk to death, a horrible way to die.
2955560	2957040	Who never sang that at campfire, huh?
2957040	2958040	I never sang that.
2958040	2960040	I never went to camp.
2960040	2961360	All right, never mind.
2961360	2963240	Iím hoping somebody in chat knows that song.
2963240	2965240	All right, DT, whatís the announcement?
2965240	2971100	Well, okay, what would you say would be your two biggest fans?
2971100	2982720	Our two biggest fans, you know, before you were on staff, I would have said you, but
2982720	2987000	you write for the site now, so I canít say you, Dark Tetsuya.
2987000	2990360	Definitely Misty.
2990360	2991360	Probably well.
2991360	2992360	Apparently.
2992360	2995800	Oh, do I, maybe Misty and, well, letís see, Ramaís an op.
2995800	2997320	Well, Mistyís an op, too.
2997320	2998320	Maybe Misty.
2998320	2999320	Well.
2999320	3000320	All right, well.
3000320	3001320	Anything.
3001320	3002320	Youíre doing it wrong.
3002320	3003320	All right, why?
3003320	3004320	Give me your goddamn announcement.
3004320	3005320	Iím getting to the point.
3005320	3006320	All right.
3006320	3015320	Well, as of about two weeks ago, during guys on my show, she asked me out.
3015320	3019480	Ooh, like asked you out on a date or what?
3019480	3020480	Whatís going on?
3020480	3021480	Yeah.
3021480	3022480	Sweet.
3022480	3027760	So, wait, so youíre saying that some of the biggest fanboys and girls know all our history
3027760	3029200	are hooking up?
3029200	3030200	Yeah.
3030200	3032680	This is a scary day in Orange Lawnís radio history.
3032680	3036680	This is a very scary day, and this radio station might have that effect on people.
3036680	3042480	Weíre going to crash Guys on a Show, and weíre planning on it in November.
3042480	3045400	Wait, youíre not going to crash the real show?
3045400	3046400	This show?
3046400	3047400	Yeah.
3047400	3051480	Guys on the Show is just kind of the, you know, Guys on a Show might be canceled by
3051480	3052480	November.
3052480	3054200	I donít know if you can crash a show like that.
3054200	3056200	Itís kind of like beating a dead horse.
3056200	3060320	You should come back to Guys on a Show so we can play what weíll be having for dinner.
3060320	3065240	No, no, no, crashing Guys on a Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.
3065240	3067240	All right.
3067240	3072960	That is like the worst and the best analogy at the same time.
3072960	3074960	I really donít know what to think of that.
3074960	3077920	It would be like pissing in an ocean of denwiser.
3077920	3078920	Oh, God.
3078920	3079920	All right.
3079920	3083880	Well, congratulations, and keep in mind, Artisia, if you should start having relationship troubles,
3083880	3089280	thereíll be a new advice show coming to the station soon to help you out.
3089280	3091880	So put Rice Princessís number on speed dial.
3091880	3096240	And congratulations, and I hope things work out for you guys.
3096240	3099960	I hope she makes you some of her arts and crafts because sheís so funny because she
3099960	3102120	finds OLR inspiration.
3102120	3105680	And like Iíve got these random messages from her like, ìI was at the 99 cent store and
3105680	3112200	I saw these orange things and they made me think of the station.î Sheís cute.
3112200	3113960	Get some OLR beats from her.
3113960	3114960	Oh, yeah.
3114960	3115960	All right.
3115960	3118400	Well, DarkTit Show, yeah, anything you want to comment on the news going on this week
3118400	3119400	in gaming?
3119400	3120400	Oh, man.
3120400	3121400	I donít know.
3121400	3122400	Not really.
3122400	3123400	I just had that.
3123400	3124400	Yeah.
3124400	3128400	Itís kind of a slow news week, isnít it?
3128400	3129400	All right.
3129400	3132520	Thanks so much for your call and, you know, good luck and everything.
3132520	3133520	Yeah.
3133520	3134520	Okay.
3134520	3135520	Have a good night.
3135520	3136520	All right.
3136520	3137520	You too.
3137520	3138520	Bye.
3138520	3139520	I like that he calls it.
3139520	3143280	Itís really not a lot of what I say about gaming.
3143280	3147440	TheRobD says, ìGuys on the show, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î Can somebody
3147440	3153400	put that as an iTunes review actually for this show since Guys on the Show isnít a
3153400	3154400	podcast?
3154400	3158600	Because like when we make that request for people to make five-star reviews in iTunes
3158600	3162360	with these stupid little things we come up with, people have actually been doing it.
3162360	3163360	Itís great.
3163360	3167200	Weíre up to like 41 reviews in the store and we love each and every one of them.
3167200	3168200	You guys are awesome.
3168200	3171320	Well, you just got up to go pee.
3171320	3172320	Weirdo.
3172320	3175800	Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.
3175800	3176800	Look at this.
3176800	3177800	Legend of Zaku.
3177800	3178800	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
3178800	3179800	Have youÖ
3179800	3180800	Using his pimp voice.
3180800	3183960	Have youÖ Hey, have you gotten with any OLR women recently?
3183960	3184960	No.
3184960	3187520	Actually, I think Zaku is one of our biggest fans too.
3187520	3190200	Youíve been listening to us a long time, havenít you?
3190200	3191840	I think over three years now.
3191840	3192840	Three years now.
3192840	3193840	Jesus, go outside.
3193840	3194840	Iím just kidding.
3194840	3195840	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
3195840	3196840	Outside today.
3196840	3202840	Yeah, justÖ just drinking on Saturday, Cinco de Mayo, playing drunk TDR.
3202840	3203840	Thatís whatÖ
3203840	3205840	Drinking beers, beers, beers.
3205840	3213680	In these three years, I used to sometimes go, ìOh, boy, here comes a Zaku call.î But
3213680	3218040	now I kind of look forward to the Zaku calls because, man, Zaku just tells it like it is,
3218040	3219040	you know.
3219040	3220040	Yeah, Cinco de Mayo is going to get fucked up.
3220040	3222560	Youíre going to be having Dave and Busters in your city.
3222560	3224840	Do you know why we celebrate Cinco de Mayo?
3224840	3227840	Mexican independence, even though Iím not Mexican.
3227840	3228840	Beer.
3228840	3229840	I know.
3229840	3230840	Beer.
3230840	3231840	And drinking and lots ofÖ
3231840	3232840	Beer thatís not called Corona, please.
3232840	3236480	Werenít you likeÖ please donít be offended if I get this wrong.
3236480	3237480	Werenít you like Peruvian?
3237480	3238480	Yes.
3238480	3239480	Oh, I got it right.
3239480	3240480	Yeah, Iím awesome.
3240480	3241480	Okay.
3241480	3242480	Sorry.
3242480	3243480	Anyway.
3243480	3244480	All right.
3244480	3245480	Go ahead.
3245480	3246480	Yeah, justÖ just chilling that day.
3246480	3249840	Just, you know, just gettingÖ trying to get a buzz off of, you know, Corona with a shot
3249840	3250840	of rum inside there.
3250840	3252840	Thereís a video game story in here somewhere, right?
3252840	3258160	Yeah, and justÖ and just trying to, likeÖ just trying to play DDR after two drinks
3258160	3259160	after Margarita.
3259160	3262320	But, yeah, and then just today, just watching Spiderman 3.
3262320	3263320	Nothing much.
3263320	3267120	I mean, everyÖ really had thatÖ really didnít have that much of a weekend.
3267120	3269960	So youíre calling into the show tonight just to tell us this or what?
3269960	3270960	What do youÖ
3270960	3271960	No, thatÖ
3271960	3272960	Okay.
3272960	3276360	That and basically Supernova 2 location test getting canceled, but thatís no big deal.
3276360	3279560	Thatís what I wanted to ask you about, because you called into the show last week to talk
3279560	3280560	about this.
3280560	3281560	I know.
3281560	3285720	One week I say itís actuallyÖ itís on and the other week itís not on.
3285720	3286720	All right, soÖ
3286720	3288680	Yeah, Iím notÖ itís not going to botherÖ itís not bothering me.
3288680	3293440	I can understand Konami just taking a look at the, you know, look at themselves as developers
3293440	3297880	and realizing that, you know, they really want toÖ they probably, you know, for all
3297880	3301760	we know, they probably might be spending the time just making it better.
3301760	3305320	Because youíre making another Frogger game.
3305320	3308760	Because you realize you and the rest of the internet will tear this game a new butthole
3308760	3309760	if it sucks.
3309760	3310760	Well, theyíve already did.
3310760	3312920	I mean, theyíre already prejudging as we speak.
3312920	3315600	Theyíre already saying that, ìOh, LoL is not going to get released.î
3315600	3316600	I understand as a developerÖ
3316600	3317600	In the groove is better.
3317600	3320440	Why the fuck did you get rid of in the groove?
3320440	3321440	I meanÖ
3321440	3326080	As a developer, I understand that if you release a piss-poor product, youíre just going to
3326080	3327200	piss people off further.
3327200	3332000	So you want to prevent that by spending more time trying, you know, trying to make something
3332000	3334000	really presentable to the masses.
3334000	3335800	I keep forgetting youíre a developer now.
3335800	3337720	And you developed for cell phone games, huh?
3337720	3338720	Yeah.
3338720	3340960	Itís the toughest job in the industry, my friend.
3340960	3346520	And we go through a lot of, you know, we had a lot of features during the development process.
3346520	3350320	Even though weíre close to shipping, thereís always like one or two big features that we
3350320	3356880	usually try to get on before, you know, they try to make the application better.
3356880	3364120	Well, you know, yeah, I mean, itís got to be internally tested to hell before theyíre
3364120	3365440	going to do an open test.
3365440	3369520	So theyíre probably going to, for all we know, they could be implementing new features,
3369520	3373600	adding more songs to make it a worthy location test.
3373600	3375600	We donít want this game to get bubble bobbled.
3375600	3376600	Right.
3376600	3377600	Yeah.
3377600	3378600	All right.
3378600	3382400	Anything else, Zaku, before we go to another call?
3382400	3385440	Just make sure to tell your arcade to get 2DX Gold.
3385440	3388760	We really, because if you donít, in the next few weeksÖ
3388760	3392400	Zaku, my local arcade is a golf land.
3392400	3396800	Yeah, the chances of, you know, of actually being released in this country are getting
3396800	3398800	slim at this point.
3398800	3404280	So I urge all my Bimani brethren to please get out there, get your arcade to pick up
3404280	3405280	Gold.
3405280	3408360	Zaku, I would love to, but my local arcade is Roseau Golf Land, where video games go
3408360	3409360	to die.
3409360	3410360	I will, howeverÖ
3410360	3411360	Yeah.
3411360	3412360	Get Dave and Busters to do it.
3412360	3413360	Iíll get the bowling alleyÖ
3413360	3414920	Get Dave and Busters to do it.
3414920	3420960	They have the biggest purse, so if they buy for all their locations, thatíll be pretty
3420960	3421960	big.
3421960	3423960	But that should make some sort of impact.
3423960	3424960	All right.
3424960	3427200	All right, Zaku, thanks so much for the call.
3427200	3428200	Good luck.
3428200	3429200	All right.
3429200	3430200	Later.
3430200	3431200	I hope the 2DX campaign works.
3431200	3436520	Rob D. in chat says, ìOkay, my iTunes review has officially been changed from ìOLR, your
3436520	3441960	source for the gamer lifestyle,î to ìOLR, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î
3441960	3442960	Beautiful.
3442960	3446560	Because I want people to look at the iTunes reviews and go, ìWhat the fuck is this show?
3446560	3449720	What the fuck is this show?î I better download this show and check it out.
3449720	3450720	See?
3450720	3451720	Reverse psychology works every time.
3451720	3454840	And then they realize that youíre just scamming them and they stop it.
3454840	3455840	Exactly.
3455840	3458400	Well, hey, you guys said it.
3458400	3460400	Hi, youíre on Orange Song Radio.
3460400	3461400	Whoís this?
3461400	3462400	Hey, whatís up, guys?
3462400	3463400	Itís Totion.
3463400	3464400	Hi, Totion.
3464400	3465400	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
3465400	3469120	To just have another reference to another Wednesday-related show, I went shopping this
3469120	3470120	weekend for games.
3470120	3471880	I had quite a couple.
3471880	3473480	You went shopping this weekend for games.
3473480	3475200	What did you buy?
3475200	3480960	I went to a big chain store and they had a sale, so I picked up both Phoenix Wright games.
3480960	3484240	I got Card Fighters DS, unfortunately.
3484240	3485240	Sucker.
3485240	3486240	Shut up!
3486240	3490240	Itís a good game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
3490240	3493520	Except for the fact tható Itís true, but none of us knew about the
3493520	3495440	bug until somebody found it.
3495440	3496440	Is it still in the wrapping?
3496440	3497440	You can take it back.
3497440	3498440	Donít worry.
3498440	3501240	Theyíre probably going to offer a return program where you can send it back to SNKs.
3501240	3503920	Theyíll wait six weeks for a replacement copy.
3503920	3504920	Yeah, I know.
3504920	3508280	Theyíll probably get another free copy of Metal Slug something.
3508280	3509280	Whoop-de-doo!
3509280	3512840	Speaking of which, the Game Boy Advance in Metal Slug still hasnít come out yet and itís
3512840	3515360	been in development for like months, almost a year now.
3515360	3516360	Metal Slug forever?
3516360	3517360	Yes, almost.
3517360	3518360	All right, sorry, Toshin.
3518360	3519360	Go on.
3519360	3522760	Well, I picked up Metal Slug Anthology, so thatísó
3522760	3523760	For the Wii?
3523760	3524760	No, for the PS2.
3524760	3525760	Thatís all right.
3525760	3526760	Do you have a Wii?
3526760	3527760	You donít have a Wii, do you?
3527760	3528760	No, I donít.
3528760	3529760	I was about to sayó
3529760	3530760	Knock it off!
3530760	3532400	Drew, I meant the system.
3532400	3533400	Grow up.
3533400	3534400	God.
3534400	3535400	This is a Wednesday, man.
3535400	3536400	Jeez.
3536400	3540920	I know, I know, this isnít Wednesday, but Drewís in the pee-pee-poo-poo mentality of
3540920	3541920	those jokes.
3541920	3543920	See me for the afterbirth.
3543920	3544920	For real.
3544920	3550120	Anyway, I wasnít going to say, okay, so you donít have a Nintendo Wii, but you have a
3550120	3551120	PS2.
3551120	3552560	What of these games have you played so far?
3552560	3554120	Have you played them all?
3554120	3556520	Iím working on Phoenix Royale 1 right now.
3556520	3557520	Itís pretty good.
3557520	3558520	All right.
3558520	3559520	Itís pretty good?
3559520	3563120	Yeah, I mean, it took me a year and a half to get a copy, for crying out loud.
3563120	3564760	I didnít find a copy anywhere.
3564760	3565760	All right.
3565760	3566760	Any other games?
3566760	3568880	I like Metal Slug a lot.
3568880	3569880	I love Metal Slug anyway.
3569880	3571200	Itís just a fun game.
3571200	3575480	Please explain the draw of Metal Slug, because I know Jamie tries very hard, but Matt and
3575480	3579560	I still tease her, so youíve got to tellóyouíve got to stick up for Jamie here a little bit.
3579560	3581800	Whatís the draw of Metal Slug?
3581800	3586960	Itís just old-school, run-aroundóitís likeóyou like Contra, donít you, Rob?
3586960	3587960	You like 8-bit stuff.
3587960	3588960	Yeah, I like Contra.
3588960	3595960	I think itís just like Neo Geoís version of Contra, with better sprites andó
3595960	3599080	Itís not that I donít understand the draw of Metal Slug.
3599080	3603800	I donít understand why itís got to be on PlayStation 2, on the Xbox, on the 360, on
3603800	3604800	the Wiió
3604800	3605800	Yeah, I donít understand that.
3605800	3608880	Why do they have to re-release it 7 billion times?
3608880	3609880	Yeah.
3609880	3613800	Why, hello there, Bust-A-Move, which we were talking about earlier in the program.
3613800	3614800	Exactly.
3614800	3616320	Oh, God, yeah.
3616320	3619280	You know, now that I think about it, SNK kind of sucks.
3619280	3622960	I mean, like, sometimes they really, really suck.
3622960	3623960	I mean, likeó
3623960	3624960	Does it all suck?
3624960	3627960	The N in SNK stands for suck, or you see, I donít know.
3627960	3628960	Itísóugh.
3628960	3629960	What?
3629960	3630960	Sorry.
3630960	3632960	The N stands for suck?
3632960	3633960	Yes.
3633960	3638120	Hooked on phonics, worked for me.
3638120	3640320	Yeah, no.
3640320	3646440	O-L-R, the L stands for suck.
3646440	3647440	S-M-R-T.
3647440	3648440	No, yeah, that would be it.
3648440	3650920	O-L-R, the L stands for smart.
3650920	3651920	God.
3651920	3658160	Sorry, I just drooled everywhere and laughing.
3658160	3661640	Send those blocks of Crayolas care of Rob.
3661640	3665120	Sorry, I had a secret meeting with Ken Kutaragi this week.
3665120	3667120	What can I say?
3667120	3669560	You jumped ship again?
3669560	3673240	Even the entire chat room was like, ìWhat?î
3673240	3675240	Train wreck.
3675240	3678400	All right, anyway, sorry.
3678400	3680880	Yeah, your callís derailing this show, Toshin.
3680880	3681880	We need to wrap it up.
3681880	3682880	Any other thoughts?
3682880	3686960	If Iím derailing the show, get back on the train.
3686960	3687960	All right.
3687960	3693920	Itís like, you know, Toshinís call is the microwave waves to Robís pacemaker, is basically
3693920	3694920	what it is.
3694920	3696920	Hey, at least Iím doing something right.
3696920	3697920	What?
3697920	3698920	I think.
3698920	3699920	What did you say?
3699920	3701760	At least Iím doing something right, I think.
3701760	3702760	You think?
3702760	3703760	Yeah, youíre derailing this show.
3703760	3704760	Itís the right thing to do.
3704760	3705760	No.
3705760	3706760	Remember, we donít give a shit anymore.
3706760	3707760	All right, Toshin.
3707760	3708760	Oh, yeah, that.
3708760	3710400	Yeah, thanks so much for calling, Toshin.
3710400	3711400	Have fun with the games.
3711400	3712400	All right, later.
3712400	3713400	Thanks.
3713400	3716960	You know whatís funny about that phone call is he really wasnít calling to comment on
3716960	3718120	any news or anything going on.
3718120	3722240	He was just kind of like, ìHey, guys, I bought some games this week.î But we love those
3722240	3723240	types of calls.
3723240	3725120	I forgot to mention, I played Super Paper Mario this week.
3725120	3726120	Oh, what did you think?
3726120	3727120	Well, itís pretty fun.
3727120	3729120	Iím just going through the games slowly.
3729120	3730520	Itís too fucking easy, though.
3730520	3732040	Like, the puzzles arenít that hard.
3732040	3733040	For now.
3733040	3736280	I think the difficulty ramps up a lot later on.
3736280	3737280	More calls!
3737280	3738280	Hi, youíre on Orange Lawnís Radio.
3738280	3739280	Whoís this?
3739280	3740280	Hey, whatís up?
3740280	3742920	Itís the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. Whatís on your mind?
3742920	3743920	Not too much.
3743920	3745920	Youíre really quiet tonight for some reason.
3745920	3746920	I donít know.
3746920	3747920	The D doesnít stand for suck.
3747920	3748920	The D does.
3748920	3749920	Wait, what?
3749920	3750920	Youíre really, really quiet tonight for some reason.
3750920	3751920	Can you turn up your mic or anything?
3751920	3752920	How about now?
3752920	3753920	Is that better?
3753920	3754920	A little better.
3754920	3755920	Whatís on your mind?
3755920	3757640	I donít have a mic on my podcast, the G does.
3757640	3763480	But either way, I just had a quick question for you guys about gaming.
3763480	3764520	Alright, whatís up?
3764520	3768320	By the way, that podcast youíre referencing, of course, this day in gaming, right?
3768320	3769320	Yeah, definitely.
3769320	3772000	Good, great podcast over on all games.
3772000	3773000	Check it out.
3773000	3775000	Alright, whatís the question?
3775000	3779680	Well, you know, the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console both had a lot of time to
3779680	3781840	develop so far.
3781840	3783680	Which would you prefer at this moment?
3783680	3789360	I was having this discussion with one of my friends earlier in the week and I sided with
3789360	3793040	the Virtual Console just because I like the idea of having a lot of classic games that
3793040	3797720	are in their original form and are guaranteed to be good as opposed to the Xbox Live Arcade
3797720	3802120	where you do have a few good games on there and itís nice to have these extra features
3802120	3806120	but some of the remakes arenít that great and some of the games themselves arenít that
3806120	3807120	great.
3807120	3812760	But, but, and this is the big but here, the Xbox Live Arcade you can download free demos
3812760	3816480	and you can check out the game and see if it sucks before you actually have to buy it.
3816480	3821640	The Nintendo system or the Virtual Console or whatever, the Nintendo games, Genesis games,
3821640	3825260	you may remember them, ìOh my God, those are so awesomeî and you download them, spend
3825260	3828120	your five bucks, whatever, and ìWow, that really sucked.
3828120	3833000	Now itís just going to sit on my drive forever.î Also, I hate the way the shop is set up.
3833000	3837360	Fucking running off of web pages with JavaScript is retarded and it should have been built
3837360	3839000	into the console anyways.
3839000	3843160	And besides, I think the Xbox Live Arcade has a better selection right now and my God,
3843160	3848560	PlayStation Network put out something because one release a month isÖ
3848560	3850880	Notice how Rob D. didnít even mention them.
3850880	3852880	Thereís a reason for that.
3852880	3853880	As far as XboxÖ
3853880	3855440	Well, I play Lemmings on the PC.
3855440	3856440	Iím sorry.
3856440	3857440	Exactly.
3857440	3860760	I played Lemmings on the PC like 15 years ago and itís just now coming out on PlayStation
3860760	3861760	Network.
3861760	3865440	Anyhow, you know, I kind of have to side with Loki.
3865440	3871680	I think Xbox Live, just the technology itself is superior because here it is.
3871680	3873840	Nintendo wonít go online.
3873840	3878560	Virtual console, I would give the trophy to in a heartbeat if I could play like Ice Climber
3878560	3880040	online with my friends.
3880040	3881960	I know the technology is there.
3881960	3882960	Itís possible.
3882960	3883960	You can do it.
3883960	3888040	Lag is not an issue in this day of DSL and all this type of gaming, especially when you
3888040	3890400	can play Xbox Live games online.
3890400	3892760	Why wonít Nintendo let me do this?
3892760	3899320	Thatís why I kind of hesitate in siding with Virtual Console because I love the fact that
3899320	3901680	on Xbox Live I can see what my friends are playing.
3901680	3903640	I can compare scores.
3903640	3908040	Go listen to Part A when I got mad at PK or Uno because he has a slightly bigger Boom
3908040	3909520	Boom Rocket score than I do.
3909520	3912400	You donít get that on Virtual Console.
3912400	3916440	Although Virtual Console in the terms of the games they offer, yeah, you know youíre getting
3916440	3921680	good shit because these games for the most part were quality games that came out many
3921680	3922880	years ago.
3922880	3928720	I could go to Jamieís house and play that shit because she still has them all, right?
3928720	3934160	But all kidding aside, the only reason I pretty much download these is just something about
3934160	3935160	having them.
3935160	3936600	They pretty much equate to impulse buys.
3936600	3937600	I donít know.
3937600	3940040	Yeah, I got to agree with you on most of those points.
3940040	3943600	They are legitimate points that I would like to be able to play a timed demo or something
3943600	3944600	on the Virtual Console.
3944600	3946800	I donít see why Nintendo didnít do that.
3946800	3951500	But to me, in my opinion, and this is why I do side with Virtual Console, the quality
3951500	3955520	of the average Virtual Console title, again, in my opinion, is much higher than the quality
3955520	3957520	of the average Xbox Live Arcade title.
3957520	3963320	What Iíd really like to see Nintendo do though is bring over some of those games like Battle
3963320	3966480	of the Lagoon and some of those other games that didnít make it over here.
3966480	3970240	Iíd like to see them translate those, localize those, and actually release them on the Virtual
3970240	3971240	Console.
3971240	3972240	Second Densetsu 3?
3972240	3973240	Please?
3973240	3974240	Yeah, exactly.
3974240	3975240	Exactly.
3975240	3976640	Case point.
3976640	3977640	There it is.
3977640	3979640	If that does it, I think itís game set and mapped.
3979640	3980640	Exactly, yeah.
3980640	3986640	Second Densetsu 3 could single-handedly change my mind in all of this, but I donít know.
3986640	3993440	I get irritated when I canít imagine the technology that Microsoft has developed is
3993440	3994440	that complicated.
3994440	3996520	Itís merely ideas.
3996520	4001520	Those ideas were out on the table a year ago, and yet, well, Sony, I donít know, theyíre
4001520	4002520	just crazy.
4002520	4006200	I donít know why they havenít adopted this stuff, but Nintendo literally seems to be
4006200	4009060	saying, ìWeíre just better than that.
4009060	4013520	We just donít want to do that because we want to do this whole other thing.î Although
4013520	4018760	I applaud some of the decisions they made with the Wii, I feel like theyíre living
4018760	4021240	in the 2600 era when it comes to online right now.
4021240	4024560	Yeah, theyíve definitely got to do something with that for sure.
4024560	4025560	Itís horrible.
4025560	4027240	Well, thatís all I got for you guys.
4027240	4028240	Well, Rob D., thanks for the discussion.
4028240	4031200	It was definitely an interesting discussion and a good thing to talk about, so I appreciate
4031200	4032200	it.
4032200	4033200	Not a problem.
4033200	4034200	Have fun with your show.
4034200	4035200	You guys have a great show.
4035200	4036200	See you later.
4036200	4037200	Will do.
4037200	4038200	Take care, buddy.
4038200	4039200	Thanks for the chat room.
4039200	4042920	PK or Uno says, ìMy copy of iTunes is only giving me one review for the OLR podcast.î
4042920	4044080	Thatís a great point.
4044080	4049160	I forgot to mention that only the US store actually has 41 reviews because the reviews
4049160	4050960	are separated by region.
4050960	4054840	Last time I checked, there was one review in the Canadian store.
4054840	4059560	I didnít see any in the British store or the Japanese store, but that might have changed.
4059560	4063160	The reviews are based by region, so if you go to your iTunes store, hey, if youíre in
4063160	4066680	a foreign country, that just means we need your help even more, so if youíre in a foreign
4066680	4071080	country using their iTunes stores, please hype us up a little bit.
4071080	4072080	Weíd appreciate it.
4072080	4074080	Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.
4074080	4075080	Whoís this?
4075080	4080160	Hi, this is DMN, and no, Iím not living in San Francisco or New York.
4080160	4086120	Wow, thatís a pretty blunt statement there because I thought we didnít talk about what
4086120	4087760	you did.
4087760	4095360	Well, I figure this time I can since itís not really anything specific to the company.
4095360	4099840	I havenít heard anything about this period up until a couple of people said, ìHey, are
4099840	4102000	you aware your companyís moving?î Iím like, ìHuh?î
4102000	4107280	Well, the way I read the story, it sounded like the sales department was moving, and
4107280	4110640	people are ñ I donít know if theyíre jumping to conclusions or if thereís just some evidence
4110640	4114960	I missed, but it seems like people are just kind of saying, ìOh, all of Nintendoís moving
4114960	4116520	because the sales department is moving.î
4116520	4125760	I think thereís some jag off in the gaming media whoís just trying to spawn a story.
4125760	4126760	Itís a total rumor.
4126760	4133800	I think that certain companies should decide to move to Sacramento instead of San Francisco.
4133800	4138880	Real estate is a lot cheaper, and I need another job, a better job.
4138880	4141320	You just want to stalk me, Loki.
4141320	4143480	I just want a better job.
4143480	4147880	Okay, so thank you for clarifying that.
4147880	4152080	You havenít booked travel to San Francisco or New York any time soon?
4152080	4153080	Not for business.
4153080	4157600	For prostitution, on the other hand, thatís a different story.
4157600	4161160	I know what this is about, but we canít talk about this on the air.
4161160	4163560	DMN, anything else you want to share with us then?
4163560	4165880	Completely taking this card in another direction.
4165880	4166880	God damn it.
4166880	4170280	Spider-Man 3 sucked.
4170280	4171680	Did Spider-Man 3 suck, Dark Soccer?
4171680	4173320	I didnít get that opinion from any of you.
4173320	4176680	Most of it did, but all the parts with Mary Jane in it sucked.
4176680	4177680	I didnít see it.
4177680	4178680	I canít say it.
4178680	4179680	I donít want spoilers either.
4179680	4180680	No, I will agree with you.
4180680	4185880	Kirsten Dunst was about as good as acting to let them move to the song.
4185880	4187680	I loved Kirsten Dunst.
4187680	4188680	Shut your mouth.
4188680	4192640	I kept wishing so hard that Mary Jane would die, and then why was Gwen in the movie at
4192640	4193640	all?
4193640	4194960	Sheís heard no point.
4194960	4198400	She was there to piss off Mary Jane, and I personally like seeing Mary Jane pissed off.
4198400	4201040	That movie made me hate Toby Maguire even more.
4201040	4202880	Emo Boy.
4202880	4204080	I love Kirsten Dunst.
4204080	4209280	Did you never see Drop Dead Gorgeous or The Virgin Suicides or The Interview with the
4209280	4210280	Vampire?
4210280	4211280	Hello.
4211280	4214800	Granted, things changed obviously in the movie and stuff, but I laughed because I never really
4214800	4217400	was into the comics for Spider-Man.
4217400	4222320	But I laughed when they were talkingónow, this is how nerdy I amóI was watching a science
4222320	4227320	of Spider-Man 3 like these people were debating on how this actually could happen.
4227320	4231240	But they were talking about how Gwen Stacy died in the comics or whatever, how her neck
4231240	4232240	snapped.
4232240	4236440	And in the first movie, it was actually MJ and stuff, and he caught her and saved the
4236440	4237920	gondola and stuff.
4237920	4242880	But I was really hoping they would kill MJ that way.
4242880	4243880	Spoilers!
4243880	4247480	Yeah, please, spoiler-free.
4247480	4249160	Itís been out for years now.
4249160	4250160	Screw you.
4250160	4251160	Oh, no.
4251160	4252160	Sorry.
4252160	4253160	I thought you guys were talking about the third movie.
4253160	4254160	No, I was talking about the first movie.
4254160	4255160	Okay, my bad.
4255160	4258280	No, I was just saying I was hoping that her neck would snap in this movie.
4258280	4259960	Iíll see it at some point.
4259960	4265240	Again, Iím waiting for the teenagers to go away.
4265240	4267160	Anything else, DMN?
4267160	4268160	Did you play any gamesó
4268160	4273320	MCSU 20 is this week, and we have our third guestóor, our third host, as we do every
4273320	4277920	10 episodes, Kevin the Groove, will be our third host this week, so donít miss it.
4277920	4278920	Good times.
4278920	4281120	Hey, any actual games youíve been playing this week?
4281120	4286560	No, itís been a rough week, so I havenít really gotten a chance to play any games.
4286560	4290080	All right, well, then I expect a phone call next week with a full report.
4290080	4291400	Weíll see what happens.
4291400	4292400	All right, sounds good.
4292400	4293400	Take care, DMN.
4293400	4294400	Later.
4294400	4295400	Later.
4295400	4296400	Bye.
4296400	4297560	And you donít want to move to San Francisco anyway.
4297560	4298560	The traffic sucks.
4298560	4300000	All right, thatís it foró
4300000	4303640	Especially with all those freaking tanker trucks exploding on the freeways.
4303640	4305120	Oh, God, that whole mess.
4305120	4307640	I havenít even tried to drive to San Francisco since that happened.
4307640	4311560	Iíve heard that thereís just a big chunk of the freeway missing now, like theyíve
4311560	4313800	cleaned it up and stuff, but thatís going to take months to fix.
4313800	4314800	Yeah.
4314800	4319800	I mean, I drive by there all the time, and Iíve used that 80 to 880 interchange quite
4319800	4322440	a few times, because Iíve gone to South Bay, you know, like Hayward and stuff.
4322440	4324680	I have friends in Hayward, but thatís about it.
4324680	4328280	Iíve never used that one that actually collapsed, because thatís how you get from SF to Oakland.
4328280	4332280	This is where Super Mario Kart technology would come in handy, because all you have
4332280	4337240	to do is put one of those boost panel downs and a little, you know, a little jump there
4337240	4339560	and boom, youíre done.
4339560	4341440	You can clear that gap no problem.
4341440	4343760	Oh, Loki, you kill me.
4343760	4347120	Alright, well thatís about going to do it here for another episode of Orange Lounge
4347120	4351440	Radio, but not before I ask for any last minute stories.
4351440	4352440	But of course!
4352440	4357480	Thereís some interesting stuff coming out of San Francisco today actually.
4357480	4363320	The Play First Person Shooter has premiered tonight, and itís kind of going into a story
4363320	4369040	we talked about a little bit earlier about how people are blaming video games for school
4369040	4373280	shootings and stuff like that, and itís kind of their commentary on that.
4373280	4374720	So it should be pretty cool.
4374720	4378800	Itís like I want to see that play, because itís really not that far away, but at the
4378800	4379800	same time I donít.
4379800	4380800	Does that make sense?
4380800	4384440	I mean, I feel like itís like, you know, so what, itís a play about video games, big
4384440	4385440	deal.
4385440	4386440	Exactly.
4386440	4387860	Itís just something for the bloggers to write about.
4387860	4391400	And talk about in the realm of ridiculous, but you know, the way things are going, who
4391400	4393400	knows.
4393400	4395580	Apparently thereís been some investigation.
4395580	4402520	Two Belgium papers were reporting that police were investigating a virtual rape that happened
4402520	4405000	in Second Life.
4405000	4414160	So where else, I mean, basically, insert joke here, do I even have to try tonight?
4414160	4418640	I mean, goddamn you Second Life fans are getting shit on tonightís show.
4418640	4419640	Iím so sorry.
4419640	4420640	What?
4420640	4423080	Obviously you canít get any in his first life.
4423080	4429520	But it begs the point, Regina Lynn over at Wired said, ìPsychologically, the upheaval
4429520	4435320	of virtual rape isnít anywhere near the trauma of real rape, and I canít see us making virtual
4435320	4438280	rape a matter for the real-life police.î
4438280	4444400	If personally, if it were me and someone said, ìYeah, this guy just raped me in my video
4444400	4445960	game,î Iíd probably hang up on them.
4445960	4448880	Theyíd be like, ìI donít give a shit.
4448880	4450280	Why are you wasting my time?
4450280	4457840	Weíre coming down their rescue.î ìI just got raped in a video game!î No, if they start
4457840	4461520	treating this shit as real, itís just like the whole taxing people on virtual commerce.
4461520	4464800	Or that kid who got taken away from making the map of his school.
4464800	4466680	Itís just people.
4466680	4468360	Itís not real.
4468360	4469720	Itís not real.
4469720	4471480	Itís a fucking video game.
4471480	4473180	They make money in the video game.
4473180	4474720	You canít tax them on that.
4474720	4478920	Or if youíre going to tax them, it has to be on game money, not real money.
4478920	4481680	And no, you shouldnít be able to tax them on it.
4481680	4486480	Anyways, moving on a little bit here, DDR.
4486480	4488400	Counting the schools in Scotland.
4488400	4493640	So that should be pretty cool, seeing that itís catching on in other places.
4493640	4499360	For the Simpsons video game, they have a counter now, counting down the video gameís release
4499360	4502160	or release info on the launch.
4502160	4506240	They have a mock site thatís making fun of Grand Theft Auto IV.
4506240	4507240	So thatís pretty cool.
4507240	4511200	It says 22 on there.
4511200	4514480	And letís see, what else weíve got here.
4514480	4520920	The people behind the wonderful game Puzzle Quest are actually making a new space-themed
4520920	4526880	game called Galactrix, and Iím talking a little bit about that.
4526880	4528080	But it looks pretty cool.
4528080	4533240	Theyíre trying to make sure that itís not just a Puzzle Quest clone.
4533240	4536800	And thatís it, pretty much.
4536800	4541000	Alright, anything from you, Miss Dark Sakura?
4541000	4545160	One time, I fed my snakes some beer.
4545160	4547080	It cleared this way and that.
4547080	4548800	It was all fucked up!
4548800	4552200	Thank you for taking the IQ level of our show down a couple notches.
4552200	4554000	Itís always good to be humbled like that.
4554000	4557840	Oh, thereís, I was going to talk about some stupid rumors that I read.
4557840	4559160	Actually, this was funny though.
4559160	4563640	Remember they banned some sort of theme on Xbox Live?
4563640	4566880	The sexy girl theme or something like that?
4566880	4567880	Sexy girl theme.
4567880	4571720	I donít know if itís sexy girl, but yeah, itís some girl weird.
4571720	4572840	Girls youíll never have theme.
4572840	4574080	Itís something like that.
4574080	4575720	I thought that was funny.
4575720	4580680	That and how people are saying that the next PlayStation model is coming out in 18 months.
4580680	4582600	Yeah, never going to happen.
4582600	4583600	Thatís all.
4583600	4587160	Alright, letís go around and get everybodyís final thoughts.
4587160	4590000	Drew, Nami, thanks so much for being here again.
4590000	4591000	We appreciate you.
4591000	4592000	Youíve been missing a little while.
4592000	4595120	Uh, yeah, Iíve been doing some entertaining in the chat room.
4595120	4596600	Alright, I apologize.
4596600	4599040	We were actually originally, we were thinking about doing a match game tonight.
4599040	4602400	Miklotov was trying to, he said heíd stay for the show if he could, we would do a match
4602400	4603440	game tonight.
4603440	4607520	But then we just did a match game like three episodes ago, so weíre holding off on match
4607520	4608520	game.
4608520	4610920	Will you come back for maybe the next match game or next dumb little game we play here
4610920	4611920	in studio?
4611920	4612920	Sure.
4612920	4613920	Alright, sounds good.
4613920	4617400	Um, Loki, your final, oh wait, did I give you your final thought?
4617400	4618400	Iím sorry.
4618400	4619400	I want pie.
4619400	4620400	Thank you.
4620400	4621400	Loki, your final thought.
4621400	4625720	Uh, Super Mario, or Super Paper Mario, I was going to say Super Mario RPG.
4625720	4626720	Itís actually pretty cool.
4626720	4630640	A little easy right now, but Iím only on the third level, so.
4630640	4631640	But I like it.
4631640	4633400	It, itís, itís growing on me.
4633400	4636800	I like, there is, there is a funny part, and itís kind of a spoiler a little bit, but
4636800	4640920	in one of the third levels, um, thereís a power-up you can get that turns you into a
4640920	4645240	giant version of 8-bit Mario, or whatever, and so you can go smash through stuff.
4645240	4649840	Well, you go through this warp pipe, and a turtle sees you, or Koopa Troopa, and grabs
4649840	4653240	the same power-up and turns into a giant turtle, and starts chasing after you.
4653240	4654240	Oh, thatís cool.
4654240	4656600	And you have the power-up and then stomp on it, and itís kind of funny.
4656600	4659320	I just thought a little stuff like that is pretty cool.
4659320	4660320	Yeah, that gameís cute.
4660320	4662120	I need to play more of that game.
4662120	4675440	Uh, my final thought is, um, Jamboreau, Boran, donít shoot fire in my face anymore, please,
4675440	4678200	fucking ride, Dark Sakura.
4678200	4679520	Tired.
