15450	19131	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19771	21391	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21451	23092	It is Sunday, May the 6th of 2007.
23312	24832	Hey, it's 5-6-7.
25052	25312	Get it?
25972	28313	We're here for part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
28353	28693	Hey, you know...
29772	32954	That would only happen once every few years where you get the consecutive numbers like that.
32994	35315	Anyway, this is part B of our podcast.
35356	40979	If you missed the first half of this episode, please go back over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and check out the first half of tonight's show.
41359	43160	We are taping live on Sunday night here.
43500	45962	Let's get back into some video game news.
46322	47202	Loki, start us off.
47403	58349	So the bastards over at Microsoft decided that it's time to ruin more fun for you, including downloading stuff that you shouldn't be downloading, like demos and stuff from other regions.
58962	70210	So apparently now they're going to be enforcing their Xbox Live demo download region lockouts, and they're going to make it impossible for you to download content from other regions.
70610	73392	However, if you've already downloaded stuff, good for you.
73552	74413	You get to keep it still.
74573	78115	But anything else, fuck yourself.
78415	79096	You can see it.
79676	80777	They won't delete your accounts.
80817	82938	You can see what content's on there, but you can't do shit.
83759	85940	So you can look in the store window, but you can't buy.
85961	86201	Exactly.
86221	86621	Exactly.
87268	89469	and I noticed you came out swinging on this story.
89489	91270	The second word out of your mouth was bastards.
91650	98552	So I'm curious if you feel personally affected by this because you don't have a Japanese account or anything that you were using, right?
98792	99513	No, not at all.
101453	101853	It's alright.
102013	103954	We only got demos for Armored Core 4.
104014	107415	I had a demo for Tenchu Z last year.
107816	111557	If I'm not mistaking, aren't they controlling this by IP address lookup, basically?
111597	114158	That they're making sure your IP address is in the country you say you're from?
114861	116703	Oh, if that's the case, that's going to be fucking easy.
117023	120026	So what's to stop them, yeah, what's to stop them from IP spoofing?
120827	125871	Or port forwarding, or like, yeah, basically bouncing yourself off a different DNS server.
126292	127633	Here come the hacks pretty soon.
128554	129034	That'll be easy.
131016	131296	All right.
132137	134299	Well, I'm sure you'll get right on that in hacking.
135420	136121	I'm sure I will.
136281	136521	All right.
137440	143822	Anyhow, let's talk about what's coming out to Xbox Live Arcade, in America at least.
143862	145802	I don't know about all regions, but I know we're getting it here.
145842	148363	And usually the arcade releases are pretty much universal.
149183	154004	But what's coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade, Double Dragon is coming out.
154064	156205	And that was rumored earlier in the week to be coming out.
156885	160546	But this got confirmed by a press release coming out of Empire Interactive.
161836	165038	Also, Speedball is going to be released as well.
165198	166079	Speedball 2.
166179	169602	This was a sports game featuring robots or something.
170583	170963	There it is.
172965	175086	Although it says, actually, I'm going to correct myself.
175106	180130	It says Speedball 2 is coming within the coming weeks, but Double Dragon is coming out this week.
180591	184213	So we don't know if Speedball 2 is necessarily this week or not, but we do know Double Dragon is for sure.
184294	186595	And I had not even heard of Speedball 2 before.
186635	188617	I know they call it a classic, but somehow I missed that one.
189279	191480	It was on the Amiga, I think, and stuff like that.
191761	192441	Oh, well, that's why.
192741	195923	I still was on the Commodore 64 by the time everybody was talking about Commodore Amiga.
196523	208810	Well, there is actually another game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and that's Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords, which is already on PSP and Nintendo DS, and it's supposed to come out later this year.
208830	217895	It's also going to be coming out with Mad Trax, which is like a Penny Racer the game or something.
218476	221398	and a Rocket Bowl that's mini-golf, but bowling.
221738	223279	Now, Penny Racers really sucked.
223539	224719	This looks a lot better.
224739	226300	I had Penny Racers when I was little, though.
226380	230282	This looks like, well, they had a game called Penny Racer on the Nintendo 64 and it blew up.
230302	234684	Oh, I'm actually just talking about... Oh, no, wasn't that... No, that was Uniracer I'm thinking of.
235005	240307	No, this actually... No, this kind of reminds me of it, except without the old... Like the Micro Machines games, almost.
241428	241668	Hmm.
242469	245250	That could be kind of... I mean, it has potential to be fun, but...
247442	253403	But quite honestly, I'll just keep playing Uno and Symphony of the Night.
255364	259505	But yeah, Puzzle Quest is going to be so awesome.
259845	260305	I can't wait.
261205	265146	By the way, we have other things coming out, of course, in all the regions of the world.
265626	266986	This week, lots of good stuff.
267006	269707	Well, not a lot of good stuff, but some pretty good stuff coming out.
270151	271852	Driver 76 Driver Parallel Lines
297915	302016	Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing, and Heat Seeker on PSP.
303016	307817	Then of course on, let's see, the PC, not a whole lot coming out.
307837	316879	We've got Locomania, which sounds like a pretty interesting train simulator, and Circus Empire, which also equally probably boring.
317999	324621	On PlayStation 3, you've got Big Fat Nada, and of course the Wii, nothing to look at there either.
325421	325881	And finally,
327422	330663	The DS, nothing to see there either.
331003	332423	So a whole lot of nothing.
332783	335904	I know actually I think on PlayStation 2 also .hack//G.U.
335964	337525	Volume 2 is making its way up.
337665	340285	So that's it for the week.
340425	341265	Pretty light week.
342086	342946	But it's going to start picking up.
343266	344146	What about Japan, Rob?
344806	346147	Well, thank you.
346187	355969	Well, over in Japan we will have Command & Conquer 3 as well, at least hitting the Asia regions, which I imagine a lot of folks who import games, if they want to pick up the Asian version, can get that.
356351	357172	Spider-Man 3
384122	384963	Simple 2000 Series Volume 117
402103	404205	Oh, okay, so it's just games going into this.
404445	405206	Okay, never mind.
405226	407668	Well, they're budget games that get released by, like, D3.
407969	410011	Like, Earth Defense Force, for example.
410331	410951	Okay, I get it.
411212	412713	Or Zombies vs. Ambulance.
412813	413814	I didn't put two and two together.
413834	415976	Well, they have the ZeroSend, and you'll be happy to know here it is.
416036	417938	The ZeroSend is coming out on PlayStation 2.
418078	420100	Oh, if I can only download all of them.
420640	422402	It looks like planes blowing shit up.
422422	423783	Like, it looks like 1941 all over again.
423803	424003	Awesome.
427130	428171	Psycho 2, Lady It's... Okay
456755	458056	It's a board game simulator.
458116	460777	Yeah, it's Shogi.
461137	465459	And, yeah, isn't part of the fun about this segment getting to hear me butcher Japanese pronunciation?
466180	467861	By the way, the big, big, big release this week.
467881	469021	That means greatest something.
469461	479806	I think this might be why you don't see much coming out this week, because finally when I got to the bottom of the page and saw the PSP releases, Final Fantasy Tactics coming out in Japan this week, the PSP version there.
480207	482548	So I'm sure that's what you'll all be playing and importing this week.
482608	484769	So the rest of the games just kind of don't matter anymore.
485839	487560	How about the Europe release dates, Jamie?
488021	489742	Why don't I tell you about them, Rob?
491003	494145	On the 9th, we have Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.
495225	510656	The 11th brings us 32nd America's Cup of the Game on PC, Busted Move Bash on Wii, Driver 76 on PSP, Go Puzzle, PlayStation 3, Hard Rock Casino on PS2 and PSP, and for the DS, we also have Picross DS and Turn It Around.
511724	514246	I'd like to bash the Bust a Move series after this many years.
514546	515107	Go away.
515327	515927	Don't come back.
516768	520091	I want, like, a new actual Bust a Move, not a Puzzle Bobble.
520411	525575	Remember Bust a Move on the PlayStation 2 with the artwork that had the baby on it?
525895	528497	And it was like, what in the fuck shit is this game?
528518	531460	Well, didn't they have Bust a Move on the PlayStation 1?
531740	533041	Bust a Move was on the PlayStation 1, right?
533141	535263	It didn't start on the PlayStation 2, if I remember correctly.
535603	535843	Right.
536004	537285	Well, they've been on every platform.
537305	538285	I'm talking about the U.S.
538365	539466	Bust a Move, Puzzle Bobble.
539506	539787	I know.
539827	540267	That's what I meant.
540287	540367	Yeah.
541259	545882	The Japanese one, you know, you could emulate that on your PSP.
547163	547403	Huh.
547683	549264	Because, you know, there's the workarounds.
549804	550365	Yippee!
551145	553787	I'm hooping and hollering and screaming out of pure joy.
553807	558611	Because I've never played Puzzle Bobble in my entire life out of the 50 times it's come out on the console.
558631	561753	I've played Puzzle de Pon, which is almost the same thing.
561773	563654	You should play Puzzle in Desert, it's fun.
565275	565555	Anyway.
566036	566356	Anyways.
566376	568057	So, Warhawk.
568518	568998	Warhawk.
569721	570861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
599520	600020	DarkSakura.com
629712	633334	Oh, you're so funny, Loki.
633374	634635	I'm so glad we have you on this program.
634655	635395	Or go fuck yourself.
636996	637356	Anyway.
639017	651763	Well, for anybody who likes their, you know, nifty looking skins for, you know, or versions of their DS, as I point to Andrew with his old school Nintendo.
651783	654264	His Walmart bot cover for his DS.
656065	656425	Anyway.
656445	657245	I just got the finger.
657325	658666	Hey, I have one that's sent by Miyamoto.
659880	663621	I have one that's signed by me and that's more awesomer.
664661	672423	There's a Golden DS Lite that has a backlit die-cast sword and shield crest.
674363	680925	And it has a custom charge stand and two painted styli in silver and black.
682185	687846	And the only way that anyone's going to be able to get one is to get it on eBay.
687866	687946	Okay.
689189	689909	I have to have custom stuff.
691070	691570	I need custom stuff.
692290	692690	It's okay.
692710	692951	It's okay.
715376	720020	Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great cause and everything, but I'm just waiting for Nintendo to steal the ideas.
720200	724103	No, Sony will release another PSP which will have the Zelda shield on it with the sword.
724123	726625	It won't make any sense, but they copied it, so that's all that matters.
726826	729708	They'll just call it Dark... What was that game?
729728	731569	The Soul Calibur.
731690	733291	No, what the hell was that game?
733331	733791	Dark Cloud.
733871	734652	Dark Cloud, thank you.
734672	735833	They'll call it the Dark Cloud cover.
736153	737254	They need a new Dark Cloud game.
737815	744100	Anyways, so there was an interview with Iwata...
745094	750879	He was talking a little bit about the state of Nintendo and a little bit about the releases.
751600	756624	Basically saying that they're going to see a brand new Mario, Metroid, and Smash Bros.
756664	757945	game in 07.
758225	761488	So all three of those games are probably coming out around Christmas.
761508	763370	They're going to make their big splash.
764931	765872	But they are coming this year.
766612	768414	At least that's what's planned so far.
768554	771797	So don't be surprised if they move to next year.
773615	779958	I know, dates under consideration, or dates subject to change, or whatever that crap is they always get away with doing to us.
780018	780338	Soon.
780478	781698	They'll be coming out soon.
781918	787321	I mean, to be honest, who's really surprised that, like, Metroid Prime 3 or whatever is coming out in the fall?
787381	788561	They gotta have something for this Christmas.
788581	789822	I mean, it's like, woohoo!
789982	792603	I never thought that would be coming around Christmas.
792723	795384	Tell me I can play it on the internet and I'll get tons more excited.
795644	796104	Seriously.
796684	800006	Tell me I don't have to use friend codes anymore and I'll blow a load.
800406	801406	I'll be very excited.
802987	803247	Anyway.
804564	807307	Actually, this news made me about that excited.
807427	814132	It really did, because this is one of my favorite, all-time favorite 80s Commodore 64 games ever.
814653	816174	It's Impossible Mission.
816214	819557	This game is incredible, incredibly great for the Commodore 64.
819637	825842	I'm sure it's one of those games that my memories of it are way fonder than the way the game actually is, so don't try to tell me any difference.
826684	830810	But however, the important thing about Impossible Mission is that it is coming out on the Virtual Console.
830830	831491	But here's the trick.
832052	836519	It's not... You'll notice it's a Commodore 64 game, or was a Commodore 64 game.
836879	837781	But it is not...
839097	842779	A, like, you know, the rumors were that Commodore 64 was coming to Virtual Console.
842839	845260	It is not simply a rehashed Impossible Mission.
845640	854784	No, no, it is Impossible Mission with now, like, updated, also they're going to do updated mode with, you know, new graphics and all that stuff.
854824	858285	So, like, a new version of Impossible Mission with the retro one included.
858605	861866	You know, you can think, like, a lot of those Xbox Live titles are kind of like this, right?
862207	867909	But the interesting thing about this is that would make Impossible Mission the first Wii download title
868336	869056	Actraiser, PSP, DS
898773	900374	I'm so excited.
900514	902594	Well, guess what's coming out to the UK Virtual Console?
904255	904735	Virtua Fighter 2!
906136	909557	Sadly, however, it is the Mega Drive version.
910917	913978	Yeah, which over here, I do believe the Mega Drive was the Genesis.
916239	918080	I know, it's going to be the crap version.
918500	921041	And, you know, I am not a fan of Virtua Fighter.
922161	923701	My husband's a big Virtua Fighter fan.
923741	925222	I'm the Tekken girl of the house, but
926464	932086	Virtua Fighter 2 made me cry, except that I did try the trick where you could hit Kage over and over and over again and knock off his mask.
932567	934167	Fuck them both, Soul Calibur.
935788	941850	Also, the right now that's out on the, that's coming out this week for a virtual console in the UK.
942291	948773	Now, this makes me happy, is Wonder Boy and Monster World, which I would really love, because I actually do own that game.
949473	951514	Very, very fun.
952955	955636	It's too bad we don't have Master System games.
956243	959324	for Virtual Console because I would love to have Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
959444	959704	Yet.
960504	960704	Yet.
961524	963604	I want a new Daytona game.
964624	966065	Is that so much to ask?
966445	968145	Just for the theme song.
968425	970845	I want any new Sega game to not suck.
971426	972586	Is that too much to ask?
972786	972986	Yes.
973066	974226	So if I may continue.
975046	979567	Also out is Shockman, which was a PC Engine game.
979987	985528	It was actually in the Shibing... Let me start over.
986764	991946	SheBeanMan series is called Shockman, which is basically like, you know, we're going to be Mega Man, but not really.
992846	995026	There were a lot of PC Engine games that were like that.
996147	1001928	And then we have Atlas Kid and the Enchanted Castle, also a Genesis slash Mega Drive game.
1002669	1004929	And like I said, Virtua Crap 2.
1004989	1005049	So.
1008760	1010041	I like Virtua crap.
1010101	1012483	It's why I take in my Virtua toilet.
1014224	1015665	Taking a shit in Second Life.
1015925	1017186	Or PlayStation Home.
1018026	1021008	Chat.Horizontalradio.com comments, Actdeft is cheering you on.
1021028	1022169	Daytona on VC.
1022249	1024751	DarkTetsuya says, oh shit, yes, Loki.
1024931	1025772	Completely pop-up?
1025872	1027393	Well, not on VC.
1027433	1029354	I'm talking about a fucking brand new game.
1029474	1031115	You know, like a redoing Sigarelli.
1031135	1031896	I want Daytona 2.
1032536	1033877	I want a newer game.
1034277	1034738	Daytona 3.
1034858	1035458	Thousand.
1036459	1037039	Million.
1037760	1038120	Million.
1038922	1040203	Death Race Daytona Edition
1060751	1061812	Alien Hominid is awesome.
1086218	1086578	Seriously.
1086598	1088780	Well, I think they should do that for, like, completing a game.
1088800	1092103	Like, getting, like, all 1,000, you know, achievement points or something like that.
1092223	1092923	They should do that.
1093263	1095005	I mean, how expensive can this be to put out?
1095045	1097787	They are charging me $60 for a goddamn video game, right?
1098187	1098407	Mm-hmm.
1098908	1104052	But maybe they, I guess, well, because of rentals and stuff, maybe they want to make sure people actually own the game or something.
1104092	1104412	I don't know.
1104992	1106894	Maybe a little something special for actually owning the game.
1107294	1109576	Because back in the 2600 days, they didn't rent video games.
1110316	1110617	I don't know.
1111898	1112338	I miss that.
1113690	1120414	One way that you might want to train for winning those trophies is playing other video games because video games are good for you.
1120814	1127177	At least that's according to Yahoo, who this week ran a story about five ways that video games can make you better, stronger, and faster.
1127197	1129399	And I thought I'd share those with you again coming from Yahoo.
1130259	1133040	They can improve your eyesight is one.
1133200	1139824	And that was from a March 2007 study at the University of Rochester because it tested college folks.
1140004	1141925	And apparently after 30 hours of gameplays,
1142986	1150311	The ones who played the games outperformed the ones who didn't play the games in their ability to accurately pick out objects in a cluttered space.
1151131	1152572	So they can play Where's Waldo better.
1152992	1155754	So if I sit close to a TV, that's supposed to ruin my eyesight.
1155794	1158015	This will actually help me as well.
1158035	1163078	So if I play a game on the TV and sit too close, it'll kind of wash.
1164919	1165299	I don't know.
1165820	1167281	You'll have to run a separate study on that.
1169062	1171043	Number two, they can help you focus.
1173082	1180565	And they're relating this to, you know, folks that have like ADHD, you know, they don't have the ability to focus and stuff and like playing a video game forces you to focus.
1180885	1184026	But I beg to differ because I have gaming ADD.
1184206	1186067	I never beat video games anymore.
1186127	1188667	Seriously, I play them for five hours and then get sick of them.
1188727	1189008	It's sick.
1189028	1191368	I think they mean not necessarily over long term.
1191408	1193669	I think they mean for periods of time.
1193969	1195450	Yeah, well, it's not for long term.
1195630	1197630	That's not gaming ADD.
1198251	1200371	That's just called, this game is fucking boring.
1201132	1202232	I'm sorry, what were you talking about?
1203737	1204517	Ooh, look, a bird!
1205377	1207318	If you get the reference.
1207618	1211479	They focus so much that they play and forget about their families and get divorces.
1213419	1215860	Step number three, they can help you lose weight.
1216380	1219441	And of course, you know, DDR, iToy Kinetic, Wii Sports.
1219461	1221922	Or gain a lot of weight, depending on which game it is.
1222922	1227343	Number four, they can help you understand classic literature.
1229620	1230660	You spoony bard!
1231801	1240788	For instance, Halo is being used by Roger Travis, who is an associate professor of modern and classical languages at the University of Connecticut.
1241128	1251396	He uses the Halo story as some type of comparison to his stories, the Homer epics.
1251536	1253718	So, there's a story to Halo?
1254578	1256820	How does Halo sound like the Odyssey or the Iliad?
1257396	1259617	Actually, specifically, I think he's citing Aenid.
1260417	1261058	That was Virgil.
1261078	1261738	That wasn't Homer.
1261758	1265780	It was Virgil taking inspiration.
1265820	1266480	Yeah.
1266860	1268521	Were there headshots in the Aenid?
1268721	1269141	Wait, hold on.
1269201	1270402	I'm trying to read through this story here.
1270782	1273783	The Aenid was by Virgil.
1273863	1274704	What the hell is that?
1275424	1275764	Anyway.
1276605	1277905	No, the story does say that.
1278085	1280046	Well, then why did they say, up here, they say Homer.
1280066	1281707	Because it was inspired by Homer.
1281947	1284168	You want literature, you play Zenisaga.
1284828	1286629	You want literature, you fucking read a book.
1288308	1288828	How about that?
1289509	1292851	And step five, they can literally save your life.
1293872	1296354	And they are saying... Trauma center!
1296394	1308982	Yeah, well, not just trauma center, but Dr. James Rosser of New York's Beth Israel Medical Center says to his patients that he's awesome at Super Monkey Ball because his hand-eye coordination helps in surgeries.
1310403	1311044	I don't want him in the doctor.
1311084	1311664	He co-authored a study.
1311764	1313025	I know, seriously, I'm moving to New York.
1313045	1314006	There you go.
1316058	1318259	Five ways that video games are good for you.
1319879	1321459	Let's see, I'm looking into the chat room there.
1321479	1325341	So would that be like, you know, hey, I'm a great proctologist.
1325541	1327161	I practice a lot on Oonga Boonga.
1329642	1330382	I mean, come on.
1330762	1333183	James Patrick defending Halo a little bit, Loki.
1333403	1334523	Halo has a lot of story.
1334563	1335723	A lot of it is just not in the game.
1335743	1337864	I know, it's called sarcasm.
1337884	1340845	All right, then I won't read the rest of his comment.
1342952	1346455	Vandalus is making a Shakespeare reference saying, do you bite your thumb at me, sir?
1346475	1348916	And I know why he did that, because remember when we went miniature golf?
1348936	1350557	We went miniature golfing with Vandalus the other night.
1350838	1352219	We actually went to Golfland and golfed.
1352579	1353380	Drew Nami was there, too.
1353720	1355441	And I was out there quoting Shakespeare.
1355521	1358843	I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.
1358863	1369371	And, like, I think I actually impressed... I think I actually impressed William, because he kind of looked over at me and he was kind of like, you actually know Shakespeare?
1369391	1371833	Yeah, but I pointed at Miss Oscar.
1373562	1376463	I also want to point out, you might want to turn your mic on once in a while.
1376804	1377084	Fuck.
1377504	1377764	Okay.
1378124	1380525	I pointed out the best, though, Shakespeare fact of all.
1381286	1383327	In the play Hamlet, the word bunghole is in it.
1385988	1389969	You were the type of girl that stayed after class to look up shit in the dictionary, weren't you?
1390670	1392311	No, I was not.
1392671	1393571	Because that's what we did.
1394432	1396512	I would stay behind to look up the entomology behind it.
1399194	1399794	Disgusting.
1400743	1403445	Originated from the Latin word shite.
1404306	1405807	No shite's the British deviation.
1406408	1410851	And this is why DarkSakura is in charge of the mailbag.
1411492	1414174	She's very familiar with shit.
1414534	1415075	That's right.
1415115	1416436	She's very familiar with shit.
1416776	1418798	Therefore, she's perfect for reading your emails.
1418878	1419658	No, just kidding.
1420039	1421100	We love getting emails.
1421160	1425623	It's part of what makes this show so special is that we have the interaction with our listeners.
1425703	1427645	Be it the Skype line, the chat room, or emails.
1427932	1438454	So if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura, open up the mailbag and pull out some shitty email to read.
1440114	1444575	Well, the first email of the evening is sent to us by Ion671.
1445115	1457377	Dear OLR guys and girls, I was looking at the screens for Eye of Judgment and while I'm not going to buy a PS3 for some aspects, the fact that you can see your animated monsters in your hand on screen
1457867	1459308	To me, seems like a cool idea.
1459528	1461470	Now developers just have to use it, maybe I'll follow.
1461530	1463192	Too bad Nintendo doesn't have the camera.
1463672	1465794	Seeing your Pokemon next to you on screen, think about it.
1467215	1468156	A good idea?
1468516	1468776	Yes.
1469077	1473601	I admit when I first saw it at E3, I was kind of like, huh, well that's kind of neat.
1474241	1476363	Is it a next-gen system seller?
1476543	1477524	No effing way.
1477584	1480887	Because seriously, I don't see why they couldn't have done this last gen.
1481547	1483629	What's so special about the Eye of Judgment, really?
1484850	1485111	Nothing.
1485451	1485651	Anyway.
1486398	1488079	Pokemon Stadium Pokemon Stadium
1517889	1524513	Anyway, next email comes from our friend overseas that wrote us last week, from Matt.
1524993	1532397	Hey, Orange Jones Radio, I'm writing you this week to answer the question posed in Part B of your podcast last week about the European Bimani community.
1533097	1538560	I can say that where I am, it is alive and well, although I wouldn't describe it as thriving like California.
1538900	1543062	Finding a machine here in Italy is pretty difficult unless you go to a bigger city like Milan or Torino.
1544244	1551949	The arcade culture that is so fragile and dying where we come from kind of never existed here, as culture phenomenon video games are really frowned upon.
1552350	1558774	Unless you were playing Winning Eleven, then you were automatically labeled as Sfigato, the Italian equivalent of a nerd.
1559375	1566120	That being said, where you do find machines, they're always in immaculate condition and have a sizable community around them.
1566460	1570823	The vibe I get from the European scene is like it was for me in 2002 in Tennessee.
1571263	1573725	No websites like DDR Freak or communities of that nature exist,
1574196	1577197	But, you know, everyone by name who plays regularly, and that's pretty cool.
1577257	1583278	By the way, DDR Freak was around in 2002 because I was a moderator in 2002 when it was NorCal only on the green board.
1584339	1587639	And he said that it's not like it is in California, right?
1588540	1590100	Where the machines are all torn up and dirty?
1590120	1593961	I was going to say, I guess the perception of what the Mamani scene is like here...
1594437	1599700	Must be different over there, because I'll tell you, it's, you know what, go look at the DDR freak like NorCal, SoCalForums.
1600100	1603502	It's a lot of retrospective posts about how the community used to be.
1603882	1607764	What was the last great DDR tournament you went to, DarkSakura?
1609124	1609264	B3.
1609304	1611325	Then how many years ago was that?
1611345	1612226	Actually, the one I ran.
1612906	1614227	And how many years ago was all this, though?
1614247	1614567	A couple years.
1614887	1617068	Like, you know, it was within Orange Lounge Radio's history.
1617088	1617669	I think it was in, what, 2003?
1617709	1617669	2003?
1617729	1619289	Yeah, it was 03 is when B3 happened.
1620270	1621050	That was a long time ago.
1623035	1623655	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1652967	1653948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1672861	1674361	DarkSakura is an equal opportunity bitch, actually.
1695453	1697915	No, I'm just whenever the opportunity hits me.
1698976	1702178	Just especially to foreigners because she hates British people, right?
1702298	1704060	No, I want to move there.
1705020	1708483	Dear British listeners, send me a ticket, please, and I'll rub you.
1709143	1711345	Well, she just wants to stalk David Tennant.
1711365	1712226	But anyway, next email.
1712486	1714107	No, I don't want to stalk David Tennant.
1714147	1715708	I want to go drinking.
1716189	1716469	Anyway.
1717750	1719471	With Billy Piper and then hope something happens.
1719832	1719892	No.
1719972	1720132	No.
1721303	1722584	She's pretty, but not my type.
1722684	1722964	Anyway.
1723305	1723625	Anyway.
1723925	1725346	Next email comes from Necky.
1725787	1728809	Speaking of one of our listeners from the UK.
1729950	1731151	Dear OLR, how's you?
1731751	1734013	Last week's Don't Give a Shit episode was amazing.
1734414	1736876	Be sure to get Warrior Bob back on as he is really cool.
1737316	1742060	Also, after hearing the whole Sony God of War goat fiasco, I was left feeling a little hoarse.
1742200	1742520	Giggle.
1743241	1744402	Jamie, Dead and Furious.
1746843	1749886	I've heard of... Let me finish with email people.
1750529	1757612	I've heard of this game about two months ago, my home site, dscommunity.co.uk, and it really doesn't look like that great.
1757652	1758712	Have you seen the screenshots?
1758772	1760973	Personally, I don't like, but you're open to your opinion, though.
1761453	1763034	On the theme of dead, touch the dead.
1763714	1769417	That guy works in a fucking plug for his website every time he sends us an email and Jamie falls for it every time.
1769517	1770577	I just like to point out.
1770717	1771497	I don't fall for it.
1771537	1773558	I actually... No, it's cool.
1773918	1775639	I'm all for promoting the indie websites.
1775659	1778800	I'm just giving this guy a hard time because he works it into every email.
1779981	1780341	It's cute.
1782519	1783679	Lord of the Rings Online is a bitch.
1785040	1788221	My mate has been trying to install it on his Vista since the day it was released.
1788501	1791103	With Rob saying the game sucks, kind of influences my decision.
1791383	1792183	Hmm, worth it or not?
1794164	1797266	Nothing left to say except the new Guitar Hero 2 song packs kick ass.
1797326	1798266	Oh, hell yeah, they do.
1799166	1799927	Wah, bye, Nikki.
1800287	1801848	Oblivion is so my game at the moment.
1801868	1802408	Played it loads.
1803439	1804600	Oblivion is incredible.
1804700	1808762	Anyway, I just wanted to say, if you want to try Lord of the Rings, it's actually really easy.
1808902	1820087	All you have to do is you can go to any computer store and you can get a trial disc for like $2, except the only problem is it's labeled World of Warcraft because the game rips it off in every single way.
1820868	1822589	Rob, first of all, UK.
1823689	1826551	Second of all, they're trying to install it on Vista and it's not working.
1826911	1832073	Well, you can play World of Warcraft on Vista and I'm pretty sure they have the same trial thing in the UK because you can download them now.
1832614	1833054	But I mean...
1835057	1836038	It's different than World of Warcraft.
1836058	1841142	I'm just trying to say Lord of the Rings is not fun, and I already played it when it was called World of Warcraft.
1841182	1843083	Let them judge for themselves.
1843404	1843604	Fine.
1844104	1845185	Why are you listening to this show?
1845225	1846406	You want me to judge it for you.
1846526	1847007	It sucks.
1847127	1849909	If you beg to differ, email nasty things to us.
1850069	1850810	Next email.
1851110	1853852	This comes from Osfer.
1854653	1855473	Looks like somebody new.
1855734	1857175	I wasn't drunk, Osfer.
1857415	1858015	I promise.
1858035	1859316	That's Osfer, not Osfer.
1859336	1859537	I'm sorry.
1859557	1859937	I'm sorry.
1860416	1861557	Yo, this is Osfer.
1861797	1863299	I just wanted to say that I love the show.
1863339	1868683	You guys are sort of like a radio version of Attack of the Show from G4 TV.
1870465	1872827	We know you meant it as a compliment, so we'll take it that way.
1873887	1874568	Actually, you know what?
1875809	1877991	When I met Kevin Pereira, he was really cool.
1878131	1882835	I can't say anything negative about the people on that show because they are really talented and all that jazz.
1883208	1884130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1893979	1898821	Anyway, I just wanted to know, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky, how good are all of you at DDR and Beatmania?
1899161	1901361	Personally, I suck at Beatmania, but I still love the game.
1901481	1902882	As for DDR, I'm fairly decent.
1903202	1917326	When it comes to difficulty, I'm able to do 10 footers like Max Unlimited, getting a grade of B, and Zephyr Oni, getting an A. As for my perfect attack, it needs work, but I'm not able to AAA anything in the arcade, yet I've AAA'd lots of songs on Heavy at home.
1918587	1921628	For me, I actually was pretty far up there, and then...
1922640	1924583	I just get really, really, really exhausted really easily, so.
1943101	1946364	I used to be pretty good at DDR, especially when we started this show.
1946424	1948145	I was beating nines regularly.
1948345	1952089	I didn't ever quite have the stamina to clear a lot of tens.
1952129	1956332	I could clear bag, but I couldn't really do the max 300s because there's just too much stamina.
1956432	1957953	I think I got bag once.
1958053	1959795	But my perfect attack was good.
1959855	1964479	I actually AAA'd quite a few seven and eight footers in the arcades, and I actually would participate in tournaments.
1964959	1967281	And I came in fourth place in a couple of them.
1967301	1968762	That's the highest I ever got is fourth place.
1968782	1971184	But to me, that's still a pretty decent showing for me.
1971224	1972105	I was very proud of myself.
1972900	1975861	But I suck now, but I don't have a good excuse like Jamie.
1975921	1980663	My excuse is I got fat, and that makes me not so good at DDR anymore.
1981403	1983764	Yeah, I lost all my stamina.
1983784	1984324	I used to be good.
1984364	1989545	I used to be able to do hard kata's and even my wonderful edits on doubles all the time.
1989925	1995687	And now I can do sevens and eights and stuff, but it really kicks the crap out of me.
1995727	1998128	It's just I don't have the stamina for it anymore.
1998748	2000349	If I played all the time, maybe...
2002033	2004895	Just had a DDR machine in my house or something, that'd be different.
2005436	2009458	I got really lazy with Beatmania, though, after not having a reliable machine to play on.
2009839	2013321	Because we were playing 2DX7 style for a long time when we had it at Scandia.
2014902	2017504	And Beatmania, I went from crappy to really crappy.
2018224	2026650	But I had actually just started beating Seven Stars, because you were there when I beat Nine O'Clocks and...
2027782	2028743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2058240	2058661	Not at all.
2059041	2060221	And I'm just kind of bored of it.
2060241	2061462	I don't care about 2DX anymore.
2061482	2061902	I'm sorry.
2062343	2064264	Well, there is another bit more to this email.
2064964	2068106	Also, when it comes to DDR Supernova 2, where the hell is the info?
2068406	2073269	But this time last year, we practically knew most of Supernova 1's song list.
2073689	2075710	Why do you think Konami is keeping this under wraps?
2075790	2076770	Thanks for reading, Ossifer.
2077651	2081413	And yeah, they actually tried to keep it under wraps last year, as far as I was aware.
2082899	2084099	I hope they do keep it under wraps.
2084139	2087540	I hope it's like Max 2, where we didn't see that shit coming until it was there.
2087960	2089420	That made it exciting.
2089660	2090561	I want a surprise.
2090821	2095602	In Extreme, or not Extreme, but Supernova, it was like, here's everything.
2096162	2097262	It's just not exciting.
2097502	2101883	I would totally love, though, to have an unlock system the way that Max did.
2103103	2106924	You know, to have stuff come out over time, which encourages people.
2106984	2109985	The more that you play, the sooner you're going to get stuff coming out.
2110545	2111945	I think that that would be really fun.
2114095	2116436	You remember how we would congregate around the machine?
2116616	2116816	I remember.
2116836	2120519	And say, okay, we have to do this many more until we get our next song.
2121420	2127504	I'm telling you, DDR needs a card system in the US, and it needs something more battle-y.
2128264	2129785	It needs to become a more competitive game.
2129825	2132027	That's how the game could evolve, but no one's listening to me.
2132247	2136790	And battle mode, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is not enough, because it's not the focus of the game.
2137650	2138411	There's a PS to this.
2138431	2141013	It says, I don't consider myself to be that great at DDR yet.
2141073	2141293	Why?
2141313	2141373	Why?
2141843	2146504	I've met MegaManX and he lives pretty close by here in Northeast Ohio.
2148665	2149205	You know what?
2149485	2153606	I don't really think... This is my opinion on gaming, especially in a competitive sense.
2154746	2156647	Why make a competition of it?
2156687	2158667	Why just not have fun?
2158927	2159247	I agree.
2159267	2160168	Why not just have fun with it?
2160428	2163488	You know, I remember reading... Actually, you know Foxtrot, right?
2164128	2166249	The Sunday comic in the paper.
2166789	2170070	I like how the little girl was trying to make...
2171306	2173747	Like a paper airplane or something.
2173987	2175448	And her dad's like, oh, let me show you.
2175488	2176608	Don't you want to have the best?
2176648	2177228	Don't you want to be this?
2177248	2179349	She's like, no, I just want to have fun.
2180750	2185612	And no offense to this guy or his ego, but I have no idea who that guy is, he just said.
2186912	2187552	I don't know who that is.
2187632	2189213	Neither do I. I have no idea.
2189353	2195075	I'm sure he's nice, but I'm good at DDR apparently, but I don't, you know, he's not that famous.
2196136	2196916	Of course, neither are we.
2197808	2199929	Of course, I've got to open up the usual can of worms.
2200009	2204092	Guess what other game had a battle system that was actually pretty decent?
2204332	2204953	In the Groove.
2205793	2206914	Guess who swallowed that up?
2209415	2210036	I disagree.
2210056	2212357	I think In the Groove was the same damn game as DDR.
2212497	2214218	It's just a different wrapping.
2214379	2216240	Guess what game had a battle system?
2216380	2217160	Step Mania.
2217280	2219242	Guess which one became In the Groove?
2219302	2221283	I do not want to have this debate again.
2221303	2222704	Rob from Sakura Maxx.
2224033	2226635	Hey Jamie, just made a quick email to say pump up the volume rocks.
2226735	2228436	What's your favorite class in Ragnarok Online?
2228516	2229257	I liked Acolytes.
2229597	2232019	I did have a super Acolyte, but I played Assassins.
2232720	2237163	I actually managed to get an Assassin Cross on one of my free servers.
2237643	2241146	Still youngest listener who wants to blow shit up and hopes you get eaten by a Gru.
2242187	2249793	When I played Ragnarok Online, I played an Acolyte who had a bow in his hair because he was cute and pretty.
2249813	2251574	That was my wallpaper on my phone for a long time.
2251594	2252174	That's great.
2252194	2252895	I played a bad Acolyte.
2255256	2256077	How much they suck.
2283687	2296617	and of course we'll feature a wonderful mix of music from a bunch of different games and should be performing at the Nokia Theater around October 19th.
2296737	2297698	So that's actually pretty cool.
2299545	2306488	I don't know why, I actually really want to go to E4ALL, even though I've heard the talk about it's nothing more than a glorified EB Games.
2306628	2308568	I don't know, I just kind of want to go to that atmosphere.
2309008	2313950	And obviously the opportunist in me sees that it's a great promotion opportunity for our show.
2314450	2316951	But I just kind of want to go and check it out.
2316971	2317972	I think it would be fun.
2318472	2324814	And the other thing too, to be honest, it sounds a lot more exciting than the E3 this year.
2325214	2327775	Even looking at E3's show four plans, stuff like that, it's like,
2328697	2329097	Wow.
2329498	2330738	Yeah, that's awesome.
2331879	2334441	Well, you know, but E3 wasn't supposed to have the glitziness this year.
2334641	2337403	And I'm sure we're just a little bitter for not getting invited, which is true.
2338644	2339204	But I don't know.
2339304	2341846	Yeah, I'm kind of excited about E4ALL.
2341886	2342787	I think I definitely want to go.
2343707	2345209	I hope we all can go.
2345569	2346089	That would be fun.
2346930	2347330	But we'll see.
2348631	2348971	We'll see.
2349712	2349972	All right.
2351233	2351493	Anyhow.
2352185	2355247	Some controversy going on this week with Blizzard, of course.
2355288	2359331	You know, it's earlier been said that they are going to be announcing a new game on May 19th.
2360031	2361853	And, oh my God, is this blown up.
2361893	2363354	And honestly, I don't know who to believe.
2363434	2366816	Because folks are saying, oh, leaked, it's StarCraft, the MMO.
2366876	2368358	It's a StarCraft MMO that's coming out.
2368398	2372481	It's World of StarCraft, even though that name would make no sense at all because it's more than just a world.
2372521	2373602	Drew, why are you twitching?
2373722	2374642	And I don't think they would do that.
2375283	2375683	You know why?
2375923	2376084	Why?
2376284	2377685	Compete with World of Warcraft.
2377825	2378465	Drew's twitching.
2378485	2379266	I want to know why he's twitching.
2380305	2383066	Number one, we don't need another MMO from Blizzard.
2383086	2392090	Number two, I know competing with yourself is actually good for business sometimes, but I don't think it would be such a good idea here.
2393330	2405335	And of course, just adding fire to this rumor, Vivendi was giving a presentation to Wall Street and said, quote, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, which strikes me as hilarious because to me,
2405942	2433327	and I know Blizzard fans are going to get pissed but honestly to me World of Warcraft does already feel like World of Diablo to me honestly like the game plays very similar to me so I don't know what the big deal is but whatever but then Blizzard quickly responded to that quote the rumor is not true in regards to Blizzard we believe the rumors circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts bottom line you don't know shit until May 19th period
2433942	2435663	You're going to hear every rumor under the sun.
2435723	2438165	You won't know for sure until May 19th.
2438765	2440607	Personally, I think it's StarCraft 2.
2441267	2443709	And that's not an MMO.
2444269	2447811	I think it's just StarCraft 2 the way the StarCraft fans want their sequel to StarCraft.
2448812	2450753	It damn well better be StarCraft 2.
2452575	2453595	I would be happy with that.
2454896	2455997	Alright, so there you have it.
2456017	2458959	We'll see what happens when the big announcement is made.
2460963	2486302	Well, speaking of big announcements, and this is actually a very, very big announcement to me personally, is that one of our gaming legends, well, I should say legends in game making, Don Bluth, who brought us, you know, Dragon's Lair, is working on a Dragon's Lair movie that's a prequel to Dirk the Daring's whole ordeal outside of the Dragon's Lair.
2486803	2487003	So...
2488994	2497538	Hopefully it actually will legitimately have a tie-in and be a little bit better than Dragon's Lair 2 was.
2498199	2500860	Dragon's Lair 2 was the acid trip game, I'm so sorry.
2503601	2506023	But there better be gruesome, gory skeleton deaths in it.
2506063	2506783	That'd be really awesome.
2509344	2509724	Awesome.
2509864	2514707	I don't know how I feel about the Dragon's Lair franchise being milked to death 20 years past its prime.
2514867	2516828	I hope it's not going to be as awful as the old cartoon was.
2517648	2518289	Yeah, I don't know.
2518389	2519410	I don't know how I feel about this.
2519570	2523713	I mean, in the end, I will judge based on the product that's delivered, but, you know, I don't know.
2524574	2528918	I only have so much love for Dragon's Lair in my heart, and believe me, I do have a lot of love.
2529118	2537225	I completely loved the Commodore 64 version of the game, if for nothing else, but I thought the music was some of the best soundtracks, like, ever in an 80s game.
2537685	2538145	But, um, yeah.
2538506	2538666	Yeah.
2539245	2549073	Speaking of 80s cartoons, you probably heard this week that they put up the first episode of the 1980s version of the Pac-Man cartoon on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2549533	2549933	Really?
2550133	2550374	Yeah.
2550614	2551274	I did not hear that.
2551294	2552355	It's for free download, too.
2552535	2552915	Really?
2553396	2553736	Already?
2553976	2554276	Already.
2554897	2556058	Holy shit, I missed that.
2556118	2556918	I want to check that out.
2557319	2557939	That's kind of cool.
2559100	2559740	I thought that was funny.
2559881	2562062	TheRobD in chat says, Dragon's Lair franchise.
2562122	2563023	It wasn't a franchise.
2563063	2564604	It was one arcade game that was innovative.
2564764	2566866	Well, there was a sequel because they had the sequel.
2569042	2570322	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2593894	2597596	It's going to be coming out, though, for a low, low price of $29.95.
2598616	2609221	And pretty much, you know, the GameCube or PlayStation 2 version with tacked on Wii controls and going to have the bonus content that was also available on the PlayStation 2 version as well.
2609541	2614883	So, if you think that's worth $30, then definitely worth picking up.
2617714	2618034	I don't know.
2618074	2618854	Well, I don't know.
2618954	2624956	I mean, like, maybe I'm the only person on the planet that didn't buy this game for the GameCube or PlayStation 2 because I played my friend's copy.
2625416	2626157	So, I don't know.
2626177	2628217	I'm actually kind of interested because it was a fun game.
2628237	2630818	And I think with the Wii controls, it would be, you know, really fun.
2631298	2633199	So, for $30, it's not a bad deal.
2633439	2633919	It's a good game.
2636460	2637020	Are you going to get it?
2637200	2637640	Anybody else?
2637880	2638420	I'm not buying it.
2639040	2639320	All right.
2640161	2641401	I don't know.
2642201	2643622	All right.
2643702	2644082	Let's see.
2645793	2649936	One more story for you guys, and we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2650076	2656741	GamePro ran a story this week called the 10 worst-selling game consoles of all time.
2657621	2670910	I don't think this was done by actual sales figures, but it says, okay, quote, here are the 10 worst-selling consoles of all time in terms of high-profile systems that stood a viable chance.
2671290	2672451	The Fairchild Channel left.
2673055	2674816	Well, I'm actually going to name the ten systems.
2675197	2677538	I want to know how many of these you actually own, DarkSakura.
2677598	2681301	First off, those of you, okay, I'm assuming none of you have read this story yet.
2681381	2684404	What would you, if you haven't read the story yet, what would you guess is number one?
2684464	2686705	The number one worst selling console of all time.
2687006	2689508	The Fairchild Channel F. Fairchild Channel F. I don't know.
2689528	2690288	What would you say, Drew?
2690789	2691349	The Jaguar.
2692150	2692730	The Jaguar.
2693931	2694251	Loki?
2696513	2698214	I would actually say the Neo Geo.
2698675	2698955	Okay.
2699195	2699435	All right.
2699475	2700496	Jaguar, Jaguar, Neo Geo.
2700716	2701877	I already know, so I can't answer.
2702589	2706250	Virtual Boy says Frisbee and Chat, Master Systems says GS68.
2706290	2707750	All right, let's see.
2708370	2710611	Number 10, the Dreamcast.
2710931	2711631	I own two of them.
2712491	2716632	The Dreamcast sold only 10.6 million units during its short three-year lifespan.
2716792	2717032	Only?
2717912	2721193	Yeah, I want to know how many of these systems Jamie owns, by the way, in her house.
2722153	2723694	All right, what do you want to say, Loki?
2723814	2729035	Oh, I was just going to say, hopefully Sony can beat 10.6 million units in three years.
2730602	2731342	Uh, let's see.
2731623	2732923	Number nine, the TurboGrafx-16.
2733063	2735744	I have a Turbo Duo and a PC Engine.
2736285	2737665	Number eight, the Saturn.
2737745	2738325	I have two of those.
2738365	2739726	I have three.
2740086	2741007	You guys are nerds.
2741387	2742947	Number seven, the Sega CD.
2743127	2743588	I have three.
2744368	2746329	No love for Sega on this list.
2746909	2748910	How do you have three Sega CDs?
2748970	2749590	Isn't one enough?
2749830	2751391	I have a drawer loader and two side loaders.
2751451	2753552	Actually, no, I think one of our side loaders was broken.
2753712	2754392	Fucking nerd.
2755232	2757593	Number six, the 3DO.
2757754	2758694	Hell no, I have taste.
2760100	2761040	I've played a 3DO.
2761301	2762301	I know, I played one once.
2762321	2763562	I haven't bought a TDI.
2765162	2768204	Number 5, I believe, was the Virtua Boy.
2768324	2769444	Number 5 was the Virtua Boy.
2769584	2771285	I have one in one of those hard cases.
2772585	2773726	Drew says it never had a chance.
2774426	2776407	It never had a chance, and believe me, I own one.
2776467	2777408	It never had a chance.
2778588	2781509	I actually do own one, and they call him the Great Red Migraine Machine.
2781810	2784231	The Amazing Red Seizure Machine of Death.
2785111	2786592	With a horrible controller!
2787132	2787752	Oh my god.
2788753	2789713	No, it was a horrible controller.
2790074	2791655	Number four, the CDI.
2791975	2792175	No.
2793036	2793576	You don't have that?
2793856	2795937	No, because it had those shitty not Zelda games on them.
2797338	2798559	But it had Myst, too.
2799339	2800560	I could play that on PC.
2800880	2802280	570,000 units sold to the CDI.
2802921	2805282	Number three, the Atari Jaguar.
2805402	2805602	No.
2805942	2808104	The only reason I would ever want one, though, is for Tempest.
2808744	2810025	And that's exactly what the story says.
2810085	2813106	The system had Tempest 2000, but every other game was garbage.
2813266	2813626	Sold 250,000 units.
2815911	2819012	Number two, the 32X from Sega.
2819052	2819592	You do have that?
2819612	2820613	I have two 32Xs.
2820873	2823934	And you agree with it being the number two worst selling console of all time?
2824394	2825755	Selling has nothing to do with that.
2825775	2827115	That's more of an add-on than a console.
2827915	2831417	Okay, but by their terms, sold versus hype.
2832177	2833337	This is a fair entry on the list.
2833357	2834978	I'm surprised the Pico's not on here.
2836398	2838559	Here it is, the number one.
2838899	2840320	It is not the Neo Geo.
2840953	2842034	Although that was a good guess.
2842194	2843295	I can't believe that wasn't on here.
2843315	2843855	It's one of the ten.
2843875	2845817	The number one, the Apple Pippin.
2846477	2847198	I do not have a Pippin.
2847728	2858113	The Pippin was made between Apple and Bandai, which is funny because there's a lot of people who've always said Apple should get into gaming, Apple should get into gaming, but Apple did get into gaming in 95 with Bandai.
2858413	2862035	They launched their system for $600, and this was in 95.
2862155	2866097	See, I figured that the Neo Geo for sure would be up there because it weren't their game.
2866257	2869379	I don't remember how much the system was, but the games were like a couple hundred bucks, weren't they?
2869419	2871040	Yeah, but you get arcade-perfect games.
2871816	2872577	Woo!
2873177	2874158	Hey, you know what?
2874278	2875618	I'll buy an arcade cabinet then.
2875658	2876039	I mean, seriously.
2876059	2876339	You know what?
2876399	2877219	It's been worth it to me.
2877319	2880401	I actually, you know, I can sit down and play my Samurai Shodown 2.
2881302	2883883	And on top of that, with no region lockout, you have no problem.
2883923	2885704	After a while, some of the games go down in price.
2886405	2893129	You know, we can pick up some of the classics, you know, Magician Lord and, you know, all kinds of games.
2893749	2894410	I have GameTap.
2895570	2896471	I have Magician Lord and GameTap.
2896491	2899172	Yeah, but keep in mind, I had this, you know, five years ago.
2899933	2900133	I know.
2902341	2907304	42,000 units sold at the Apple Pippin and always makes PC World's worst tech products of all time lists.
2908804	2909765	Good job, Apple.
2910585	2911146	We salute you.
2911966	2918129	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line if you want to feedback on the worst console you've ever played or really anything in general.
2918149	2926814	We'll take your calls right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype if you want to call us that way because our 800 number is only toll-free.
2927533	2927993	in the U.S.
2928053	2928594	and Canada.
2928854	2930314	You can also call us on Skype.
2930354	2933195	The username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2933275	2935216	Let's go to the phones and take some calls.
2935696	2936857	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2936897	2937277	Who's this?
2938438	2939658	This is DarkTetsuya.
2939978	2941019	Hi, DarkTetsuya.
2941039	2941999	What's on your mind, buddy?
2943600	2946521	Oh, I just had an announcement I had to make.
2946941	2949422	Announcements, announcements, announcements.
2949813	2955198	A horrible way to die, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to talk to death, a horrible way to die.
2955498	2956979	Who never sang that at campfire, huh?
2957159	2957980	I never sang that.
2958601	2959541	I never went to camp.
2960462	2961343	All right, never mind.
2961423	2963004	I'm hoping somebody in chat knows that song.
2963265	2964466	All right, DT, what's the announcement?
2965146	2966247	Well, okay.
2966687	2970010	Who would you say would be your two biggest fans?
2971091	2972673	Our two biggest fans?
2974194	2974334	Yes.
2978491	2985415	You know, before you were on staff, I would have said you, but you're right for the site now, so I can't say you, DarkTetsuya.
2986556	2987596	Definitely Misty.
2989978	2995741	Probably... Well, apparently... Maybe Misty and... Oh, see, Ranma's an op.
2995801	2996782	Well, Misty's an op, too.
2997122	3000724	Maybe Misty... Well... Alright, well... Ruin everything!
3000744	3002945	You're doing it wrong!
3002965	3003445	Alright, what?
3003526	3004526	Give me your goddamn announcement.
3004546	3005567	I'm getting to the point.
3005707	3005967	Alright.
3007253	3014379	Well, as of about two weeks ago, during Guys on the Show, she asked me out.
3015880	3019323	Ooh, like asked you out on a date or what?
3019363	3019883	What's going on?
3020063	3020523	Yeah.
3021224	3021764	Sweet.
3022425	3028330	So, wait, so you're saying that some of the biggest fanboys and girls in OLR history are hooking up?
3029731	3029951	Yeah.
3030151	3032593	This is a scary day in Orange Lounge radio history.
3032633	3036416	This is a very scary day, and this radio station might have that effect on people.
3038376	3042740	We're going to crash Guys on a Show, and we're planning on it in November.
3042760	3044201	Wait, you're not going to crash the real show?
3045302	3045783	This show?
3045843	3046143	Yeah.
3046703	3051948	Guys on a Show is just kind of the, you know... Guys on a Show might be canceled by November.
3052028	3054170	I don't know if I would crash a show like that.
3054210	3056051	It's kind of like beating a dead horse.
3057252	3059995	You should come back to Guys on a Show so we can play what we'll be having for dinner.
3060695	3061556	No, no, no.
3061616	3064338	Crashing Guys on a Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.
3064679	3064939	All right.
3068530	3072912	That is, like, the worst and the best analogy at the same time.
3073012	3074153	I really don't know what to think of that.
3074173	3077794	That'd be like pissing in an ocean of bed liser.
3078074	3078315	All right.
3078535	3079455	Well, congratulations.
3080135	3089019	And keep in mind, Artitsuya, if you should start having relationship troubles, there'll be a new advice show coming to the station soon to help you out.
3089220	3091401	So, you know, put Rice Princess's number on speed dial.
3091821	3094482	And congratulations, and I hope things work out for you guys.
3096367	3101511	I hope she makes you some of her arts and crafts, because she's so funny, because she finds OLR inspiration.
3102031	3108577	And, like, I've got all these random messages from her, like, I was at the 99 cent store, and I saw these orange things, and they made me think of this date.
3109677	3110118	She's cute.
3110658	3113300	So, get some OLR beats from her.
3114942	3115262	Oh, yeah.
3115382	3115642	Alright.
3115902	3118945	Well, DarkSakura, anything you want to comment on the news going on this week in gaming?
3121247	3122348	Oh, man, I don't know.
3122408	3122608	It's
3124827	3126088	Not really, I understand that.
3126288	3127728	Yeah, it's kind of a slow news week, isn't it?
3127828	3128088	All right.
3129429	3132510	Thanks so much for your call and good luck and everything.
3132550	3133571	Okay, have a good night, all right?
3134711	3135172	You too.
3135352	3135672	Bye.
3138093	3139213	I like that he calls it.
3139694	3141434	There's really not a lot I want to say about gaming.
3143195	3146657	TheRobD says, Guys on the show, it's like pissing in an ocean of piss.
3146917	3152939	Can somebody put that as an iTunes review, actually, for this show, since guys on the show isn't podcasts?
3153139	3153420	Because, like...
3154758	3155958	Legend of Zaku He's using his chimp voice
3184930	3185270	No.
3185490	3187511	Actually, I think Zaku's one of our biggest fans, too.
3187531	3189012	You've been listening to us a long time, haven't you?
3190273	3191573	I think over three years now.
3191713	3192354	Three years now.
3192414	3193354	Jesus, go outside.
3193754	3194274	I'm just kidding.
3194495	3196395	What's on your mind, buddy?
3197196	3202338	Yeah, just drinking on Saturdays and going to my old plain drunk TDR.
3207334	3208555	You know what?
3209075	3213578	In these three years, I used to sometimes go, oh boy, here comes a Zaku call.
3213598	3217921	But now I kind of look forward to the Zaku calls because, man, Zaku just tells it like it is.
3217941	3219643	Do you know why we celebrate Cinco de Mayo?
3225021	3227503	Um, Mexican Independence, even though I'm not Mexican.
3227563	3227943	Beer.
3228543	3229204	I know.
3229304	3231225	And drinking, and lots of Mexican flavor.
3231265	3232606	Beer that's not called Corona, please.
3232646	3237468	Weren't you like, please don't be offended if I get this wrong, weren't you like Peruvian?
3237989	3238209	Yes.
3238649	3239930	Oh, I got it right, yeah, I'm awesome.
3239970	3240490	Okay, sorry.
3240770	3241831	Anyway, alright, go ahead.
3242931	3250836	Yeah, just chilling that day, just trying to get a buzz off of Corona with a shot of rum inside there.
3250916	3253777	There's a video game story in here somewhere, right?
3253918	3258900	Yeah, and just trying to play DDR after two drinks, after a margarita.
3259461	3261902	But yeah, and then just today, just watching Spider-Man 3.
3262142	3262622	Nothing much.
3262983	3265524	I mean, I really didn't have that much of a weekend.
3267333	3269795	So you're calling into the show tonight just to tell us this or what?
3269895	3275680	No, that and basically Supernova 2 location test getting cancelled.
3275860	3280324	That's what I wanted to ask you about because you called into the show last week to talk about this.
3280344	3281525	I know.
3282325	3285528	One week I say it's on and the other week it's not on.
3285908	3288670	It's not bothering me.
3288710	3295696	I can understand Konami just taking a look at themselves as developers and realizing that they really want to
3296906	3301789	They probably, you know, for all we know, they probably might be spending the time just making it better.
3301849	3303751	Or making another Frogger game.
3305032	3309475	Because you realize you and the rest of the internet will tear this game a new butthole if it sucks.
3309595	3310695	Well, they've already did.
3311016	3312937	I mean, they're already prejudging as we speak.
3313217	3315699	They're already saying that, oh, LoL is not going to get released.
3316119	3317820	I can understand that as a developer.
3317840	3318641	Indie Groove is better.
3318681	3321363	Why the fuck did you get rid of Indie Groove?
3321463	3323344	As a developer, I understand that if you...
3323877	3333925	If you release a piss-poor product, you're just going to piss people off further, so you want to prevent that by spending more time trying to make something really presentable to the masses.
3334065	3337527	I keep forgetting you're a developer now, and you develop for cell phone games, huh?
3337888	3338428	Yeah.
3338448	3340930	You've got the toughest job in the industry, my friend.
3341450	3346014	We go through a lot of features during the development process.
3346414	3351198	Even though we're close to shipping, there's always one or two big features that we try to get on
3353123	3355844	before they try to make the application better.
3358444	3359344	Well, you know, yeah.
3359404	3365145	I mean, it's got to be internally tested to hell before they're going to do an open test.
3365165	3373367	Right, so they're probably going to, from what we know, they could be implementing new features, adding more songs to make it a worthy location test.
3373567	3375267	We don't want this game to get bubble-bubbled.
3376087	3376367	Right.
3376487	3377148	Yeah, all right.
3377728	3379368	Anything else, Saku, before we go to another call?
3382263	3385907	Just make sure to tell your arcade to get 2DX Gold.
3386568	3392516	Because if you don't in the next few weeks... Zaku, my local arcade is a golf land.
3392656	3397702	Yeah, the chances of actually being released in this country are getting slim at this point.
3398726	3404529	So I urge all my Bimati brethren to please get out there, get your arcade to pick up gold.
3404569	3408771	Zaku, I would love to, but my local arcade is Rozo Golf Land where video games go to die.
3408912	3411713	I will, however, give countries a place to call.
3412153	3413174	I'll give the bowling alley a call.
3413674	3414855	Get Dave and Buster's to do it.
3414875	3416295	They have the biggest purse.
3416396	3421158	So if they buy for all their locations, that would be pretty big.
3422119	3424040	That should make some sort of impact.
3424420	3424700	All right.
3425120	3426461	All right, Zaku, thanks so much for the call.
3427110	3427410	Good luck.
3427450	3429531	I hope you guys get work on the 2DX.
3429551	3430891	I hope the 2DX campaign works.
3431591	3438953	Rob D in chat says, Okay, my iTunes review has officially been changed from OLR, your source for the gamer lifestyle, to OLR.
3439013	3440453	It's like pissing in an ocean of piss.
3441573	3442074	Beautiful.
3443114	3446075	Because I want people to look at the iTunes reviews and go, What the fuck is this show?
3446455	3447235	What the fuck is this show?
3447435	3449095	I better download this show and check it out.
3449155	3449435	See?
3450276	3451696	Reverse psychology works every time.
3451836	3454076	And they realize that you're just scamming them and they stop.
3454096	3454737	Exactly.
3454837	3455917	Well, hey, I...
3457048	3457929	You guys said it!
3459310	3460251	Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.
3460271	3460611	Who's this?
3461211	3461772	Hey, what's up, guys?
3461792	3462232	It's Toshin.
3462472	3462973	Hi, Toshin.
3462993	3463673	What's on your mind, buddy?
3465435	3468357	Just having another reference to another Wednesday-related show.
3468457	3469898	I went shopping this weekend for games.
3470819	3471520	I bought a couple.
3471800	3473361	You went shopping this weekend for games.
3473381	3473841	What'd you buy?
3475263	3480126	I went to Big Chain Store and they had a sale, so I picked up both Phoenix Wright games.
3481868	3484310	I got Cardfighter's DS, unfortunately.
3486651	3487071	Shut up!
3487611	3489392	It's a good game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
3490192	3494934	It's true, but none of us knew about the bug until somebody found it.
3495414	3496174	Is it still in the wrapping?
3496214	3496934	You can take it back.
3497154	3500895	Don't worry, they're going to probably offer a return program where you can send it back to SNK.
3501075	3503716	And then wait six weeks for a replacement copy.
3504777	3505297	Yeah, I know.
3505457	3509418	You'll probably get another free copy of Metal Slug something.
3509718	3515140	Speaking of which, the Game Boy Advance of Metal Slug still hasn't come out yet, and it's been in development for months, almost a year now.
3515340	3516120	Metal Slug Forever?
3517304	3518044	Yes, almost.
3518404	3519224	All right, sorry, Toshin.
3519444	3519704	Go on.
3519744	3523185	Well, I picked up Metal Slug Anthology, so that's... For the Wii?
3523805	3524905	No, for the PS2.
3525105	3525545	That's all right.
3525625	3526166	Do you have a Wii?
3526186	3526986	You don't have a Wii, do you?
3527406	3527786	No, I don't.
3527806	3528746	That's what I was going to say.
3529866	3532147	I meant the... Drew, I meant the system.
3532227	3532767	Grow up.
3533747	3534147	God.
3534947	3535847	This isn't Wednesday, man.
3536227	3536887	No, I know, I know.
3536907	3541728	This isn't Wednesday, but Drew's in the, you know, pee-pee-poo-poo mentality of those jokes.
3542408	3543369	Save it for the afterbirth.
3543849	3544349	For real.
3544749	3545089	Anyway, um...
3546368	3550009	I was going to say, okay, so you don't have a Nintendo Wii, but you have a PS2.
3550929	3552450	What of these games have you played so far?
3552750	3553430	Have you played them all?
3554630	3556310	I'm working on Phoenix Royale 1 right now.
3556450	3556951	It's pretty good.
3557211	3557651	All right.
3557951	3558531	It's pretty good?
3559251	3559451	Yeah.
3559491	3563012	I mean, it took me a year and a half to get a copy, for crying out loud.
3563032	3564472	I couldn't find a copy anywhere.
3564733	3565033	All right.
3565173	3566213	And have you played any of the other games?
3567313	3568433	I like Metal Slug a lot.
3568633	3569774	I love Metal Slug anyway.
3569854	3570574	It's just a fun game.
3570953	3579620	Please explain the draw of Metal Slug, because I know Jamie tries very hard, but Matt and I still tease her, so you gotta stick up for Jamie here a little bit.
3579720	3580841	What's the draw of Metal Slug?
3581721	3586785	It's just old-school, run-around... It's like... You like Contra, don't you, Rob?
3587145	3588006	You like 8-bit stuff.
3588146	3588867	Yeah, I like Contra.
3589887	3594231	I think it's just like Neo Geo's version of Contra, with better sprites...
3596340	3598821	It's not that I don't understand the draw of Metal Slug.
3598861	3604824	It's just I don't understand why it's got to be on the PlayStation 2, on the Xbox, on the 360, on the Wii.
3605264	3608706	Why do they have to re-release it 7 billion times?
3609266	3609586	Yeah.
3609966	3613208	Why, hello there, Bustamove, which we were talking about earlier in the program.
3613928	3614568	Exactly.
3615509	3616069	Oh, God, yeah.
3616249	3618810	You know, now that I think about it, SNK kind of sucks.
3619391	3622272	I mean, like, sometimes they really, really suck.
3623021	3626382	I mean, like, the N in SNK stands for suck.
3626502	3627443	Or UC, I don't know.
3627863	3630204	It's... Sorry.
3631044	3632424	The N stands for suck?
3632644	3632905	Yes.
3635305	3637406	So Don Phonics worked for me!
3637426	3639527	Yeah, no.
3640307	3643028	Orange Loud... OLR, the L stands for suck.
3643889	3644489	SMRT.
3646790	3647770	No, that would be it.
3648170	3650591	OLR, the L stands for smarts.
3652840	3653040	Oh, God.
3654382	3656063	Sorry, I just drooled everywhere and laughing.
3658405	3661128	Send those blocks of Crayolas care of Rob.
3662048	3665011	Sorry, I had a secret meeting with Ken Kutaragi this week.
3665031	3665692	What can I say?
3665712	3669015	You jumped ship again?
3669435	3671297	Even the entire chat room was like, what?
3675060	3676001	Train wreck.
3676561	3678002	All right, anyway, sorry.
3678343	3678503	Yeah.
3679073	3680835	Your call's derailing this show, Toshin.
3680855	3681615	We need to wrap it up.
3681655	3682376	Any other thoughts?
3684078	3686220	If I'm derailing the show, get back on the train.
3687041	3687341	All right.
3687701	3694488	It's like Toshin's call is the microwave waves to Rob's pacemaker is basically what it is.
3694768	3698291	Hey, at least I'm doing something right, I think.
3698832	3699192	What'd you say?
3699212	3701454	I said at least I'm doing something right, I think.
3701674	3703556	You're derailing this show.
3703596	3704397	It's the right thing to do.
3705507	3706808	Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.
3707028	3711132	Alright, Tosh, thanks so much for calling, Tosh, and have fun with the games.
3711412	3711852	Alright, later.
3714234	3718038	You know what's funny about that phone call is he really wasn't calling to comment on any news or anything going on.
3718058	3720640	He was just kind of like, hey guys, I bought some games this week.
3721761	3722682	But we love those types of calls.
3722722	3725144	I forgot to mention I played Super Paper Mario this week.
3725164	3725925	Oh, what'd you think?
3726766	3727726	Well, it's pretty fun.
3727746	3729208	I'm just going through the games slowly.
3729368	3730449	It's too fucking easy, though.
3730953	3731833	Like, the puzzles aren't that hard.
3731853	3732274	For now.
3733074	3735055	I think the difficulty ramps up a lot later on.
3736175	3736816	More calls!
3737436	3738256	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3738296	3738636	Who's this?
3739357	3739777	Hey, what's up?
3739837	3742478	It's the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind?
3742498	3743819	Uh, not too much.
3744219	3745659	You're really quiet tonight for some reason.
3746440	3747900	I don't know.
3748521	3748901	Wait, what?
3749101	3750862	You're really, really quiet tonight for some reason.
3750902	3752162	Can you turn up your mic?
3752663	3753063	A little better.
3753083	3753543	What's on your mind?
3754383	3757165	I was saying that he doesn't stand for sucking my podcast that he does.
3758905	3760346	Either way, I just had a
3760919	3763180	Quick question for you guys about gaming.
3763520	3764241	All right, what's up?
3764461	3768683	By the way, that podcast you're referencing, of course, This Day in Gaming, right?
3769463	3769983	Yeah, definitely.
3770083	3771704	Great podcast over on All Games.
3771844	3772284	Check it out.
3772745	3773605	All right, what's the question?
3775206	3780648	Well, you know, the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console both had a lot of time to develop so far.
3781729	3783090	Which would you prefer at this moment?
3783770	3786531	I was having this discussion with one of my friends earlier in the week, and I...
3788894	3806286	I sided with the Virtual Console just because I like the idea of having a lot of classic games that are in their original form and are guaranteed to be good as opposed to the Xbox Live Arcade where you do have a few good games on there and it's nice to have these extra features but some of the remakes aren't that great and some of the games themselves aren't that great.
3806306	3809348	But, but, and this is the big but here, um,
3810220	3815963	The Xbox Live Arcade, you can download free demos, and you can check out the game and see if it sucks before you actually have to buy it.
3816443	3830369	The Nintendo system, or the virtual console, or whatever, the Nintendo games, Genesis games, you may remember them, oh my god, those are so awesome, and you download them, spend your five bucks, whatever, and wow, that really sucked, now it's just gonna sit on my drive forever.
3830790	3836012	Also, I hate the way the shop is set up, fucking running off of webpages with JavaScript is retarded.
3836673	3838575	and it should have been built into the console anyways.
3838955	3848304	And besides, I think the Xbox Live Arcade has a better selection right now and my god, PlayStation Network put out something because one release a month is awful.
3849024	3850626	Notice how Rob D. didn't even mention them.
3851326	3852127	There's a reason for that.
3852908	3855530	As far as Xbox... Well, I play Lemmings on the PC.
3856631	3861055	Exactly, I played Lemmings on the PC like 15 years ago and it's just now coming out on PlayStation Network.
3861796	3862056	Anyhow...
3862763	3865407	Um, you know, I kind of have to side with Loki.
3865507	3870833	I think Xbox Live, just the technology itself is superior because here it is.
3871194	3873136	Nintendo won't go online.
3873496	3879724	Virtual console, I would give the trophy to in a heartbeat if I could play like Ice Climber online with my friends.
3880029	3880769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3901812	3903012	I can compare scores.
3903373	3909415	I mean, go listen to Part A when I got mad at PK or Uno because he has a slightly bigger Boom Boom Rocket score than I do.
3909795	3911576	You don't get that on Virtual Console.
3912356	3922320	Although Virtual Console, in the terms of the games they offer, yeah, you know you're getting good shit because these games were quality, for the most part, were quality games that came out many years ago.
3922940	3927201	I could go to Jamie's house and play that shit because she still has them all, right?
3927362	3927642	Yeah.
3928542	3930683	But, you know, I mean, all kidding aside, you know...
3931687	3934708	The only reason I pretty much download these is just something about having them.
3935149	3936689	They pretty much equate to impulse buys.
3937490	3937770	I don't know.
3938370	3939871	Yeah, I gotta agree with you on most of those points.
3939991	3940911	They are legitimate points.
3941591	3944593	I would like to be able to play a timed demo or something on the Virtual Console.
3944693	3946153	I don't see why Nintendo didn't do that.
3947114	3957238	But to me, in my opinion, and this is why I do side with the Virtual Console, the quality of the average Virtual Console title, again, in my opinion, is much higher than the quality of the average Xbox Live Arcade title.
3958872	3966416	What I'd really like to see Nintendo do, though, is bring over some of those games like Bottom of the Lagoon and some of those other games that didn't make it over here.
3966816	3970758	I'd like to see them translate those, localize those, and actually release them on the virtual console.
3970898	3971598	Second Densetsu 3?
3971638	3973859	Yeah, exactly.
3973999	3974639	Exactly.
3974719	3975480	Case point.
3976540	3976920	There it is.
3976960	3979381	If that does it, I think it's game, set, and match.
3979421	3980342	Exactly, yeah.
3980662	3983964	Second Densetsu 3 could single-handedly change my mind in all of this.
3985084	3985664	But I don't know.
3985784	3987025	I just... I get...
3987825	3988888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3996311	3998912	And those ideas were out on the table a year ago.
3999572	4001993	And yet, well, Sony, I don't know, they're just crazy.
4002033	4003693	I don't know why they haven't adopted this stuff.
4003713	4008935	But Nintendo literally seems to be saying, we're just better than that.
4009015	4012776	We just don't want to do that because we want to do this whole other thing.
4012896	4021019	And although I applaud some of the decisions they made with the Wii, I feel like they're living in the 2600 era when it comes to online right now.
4022439	4024060	Yeah, they definitely got to do something with that for sure.
4024520	4025000	It's horrible.
4026125	4027146	Well, that's all I got for you guys.
4027206	4028446	Well, Rob D., thanks for the discussion.
4028466	4031228	It was definitely an interesting discussion and a good thing to talk about, so I appreciate it.
4031768	4032188	Not a problem.
4032228	4032888	Have fun with your show.
4032908	4033709	You guys have a great show.
4033769	4034169	See you later.
4034309	4034669	Will do.
4034749	4035350	Take care, buddy.
4035730	4037171	Bye-bye.
4037591	4038771	I'm looking over to the chat room.
4038811	4042933	PK or Uno says, My copy of iTunes is only giving me one review for the OLR podcast.
4043233	4044034	That's a great point.
4044094	4045995	I forgot to mention that only the U.S.
4046075	4048376	store actually has 41 reviews because
4048715	4051276	The reviews are separated by region.
4052357	4054658	Last time I checked, there was one review in the Canadian store.
4055038	4057439	I didn't see any in the British store or the Japanese store.
4057559	4058879	That might have changed.
4059520	4061380	The reviews are based by region.
4061400	4066123	If you go to your iTunes store, if you're in a foreign country, that just means we need your help even more.
4066163	4070905	If you're in a foreign country using their iTunes stores, please hype us up a little bit.
4070945	4071625	We'd appreciate it.
4072645	4073686	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4073706	4074046	Who's this?
4075851	4079735	Hi, this is DMN and no, I'm not living in San Francisco or New York.
4080095	4083099	Well, I figure this time I can since it's not really anything specific to the company.
4083419	4083719	All right.
4095476	4101080	I haven't heard anything about this period up until a couple of people said, hey, are you aware your company's moving?
4101140	4102041	I'm like, huh?
4102141	4116291	Well, the way I read the story, it sounded like the sales department was moving, and people are, I don't know if they're jumping to conclusions or if there's just some evidence I missed, but it seems like people are just kind of saying, oh, all of Nintendo's moving because the sales department is moving.
4116991	4122215	Well, you know, I work... I think it's some jag off in the, uh... I honestly think it's some jag off in the, um...
4123277	4125499	Gaming Media, who's trying to spawn a story.
4125519	4126480	It's a bubble rumor.
4126800	4133365	I think that certain companies should decide to move to Sacramento instead of San Francisco.
4133726	4136628	Real estate is a lot cheaper, and I need another job.
4137769	4138609	A better job.
4139350	4140851	You just want to stalk me, Loki.
4141372	4142593	I just want a better job.
4143834	4147677	Alright, well, okay, so thank you for clarifying that.
4147817	4150199	You haven't booked travel to San Francisco or New York anytime soon.
4151900	4152721	Not for business.
4153582	4155484	I don't want spoilers either.
4155504	4156264	I will agree with you.
4156284	4156645	Kirsten Dunst
4182122	4182523	It was good.
4182563	4185045	It wasn't great.
4185966	4187688	I loved Kirsten Dunst.
4187728	4188469	Shut your mouth.
4188549	4192634	I kept wishing so hard that Mary Jane would die, and then why was Gwen in the movie at all?
4192814	4193515	She served no point.
4194876	4198340	She was there to piss off Mary Jane, and I personally like seeing Mary Jane pissed off.
4198440	4198661	Emo Boy.
4202935	4203956	I love Kirsten Dunst.
4203996	4209939	Did you never see, like, Drop Dead Gorgeous or The Virgin Suicides or Interview with a Vampire?
4209999	4210319	Hello.
4210659	4219024	Granted, things changed, obviously, in the movie and stuff, but I laughed because I never really was into the comics for Spider-Man, but I laughed when they were talking.
4219764	4220625	Now, this is how nerdy I am.
4221004	4243609	I was watching a Science of Spider-Man 3, like, these people were debating on how this actually could happen, but they were talking about how Gwen Stacy died in the comics or whatever, how her neck snapped, remember, because in the first movie, you know, it was actually MJ and stuff, and he caught her and saved the gondola and stuff, but, um, I was really hoping they would kill MJ that way.
4245190	4246510	Yeah, please, spoiler free.
4247381	4248862	It's been out for years now.
4249042	4249782	Screw you.
4250022	4250262	Oh, no.
4250322	4250742	Oh, I'm sorry.
4250762	4251923	I thought you guys were talking about the third movie.
4251943	4252943	No, I was talking about the first movie.
4252983	4253544	Okay, my bad.
4254204	4258065	No, I was just saying I was hoping that her neck would snap in, you know, this movie.
4258085	4258726	All right.
4258886	4259886	I'll see it at some point.
4259946	4262067	I just, again, I'm waiting for the teenagers to go away.
4262707	4262847	So.
4263688	4263948	All right.
4265048	4265829	Anything else, DMN?
4267069	4268470	Did you play any games this week?
4274761	4277663	Kevin the Groove will be our third host this week, so don't miss it.
4277803	4278423	Good times.
4278503	4280765	Hey, any actual games you've been playing this week?
4283266	4286068	No, it's been a rough week, so I haven't really gotten a chance to play any games.
4286428	4289030	All right, well, then I expect a phone call next week with a full report.
4290391	4291231	We'll see what happens.
4291372	4292092	All right, sounds good.
4292152	4292892	Take care, DMN.
4294153	4294473	Later.
4294874	4295114	Later.
4295594	4295774	Bye.
4295994	4297475	And you don't want to move to San Francisco anyway.
4297495	4298276	The traffic sucks.
4299056	4300077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4317032	4322397	And I've used that 80 to 880 interchange quite a few times because I've gone to South Bay, you know, like Hayward and stuff.
4322417	4323178	I have friends in Hayward.
4323558	4324579	But that's about it.
4324899	4328122	I've never used that one that actually collapsed because that's how you get from SF to Oakwood.
4328142	4338351	This is where Super Mario Kart technology would come in handy because all you have to do is put one of those boost panel downs and a little, you know, a little jump there and boom, you're done.
4339512	4340954	You can clear that gap, no problem.
4342075	4343376	Oh, Loki, you kill me.
4344042	4350868	All right, well, that's about going to do it here for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before I ask for any last-minute stories.
4351368	4352089	But of course!
4353730	4356993	There's some interesting stuff coming out of San Francisco today, actually.
4357473	4366561	The play First Person Shooter has premiered tonight, and it's kind of going into a story we talked about a little bit earlier about how people are blaming...
4367293	4370234	Video games for school shootings and stuff like that.
4370274	4372954	And it's kind of their commentary on that.
4373214	4374215	So it should be pretty cool.
4375515	4379636	It's like I want to see that play because it's really not that far away, but at the same time I don't.
4379796	4380416	Does that make sense?
4381036	4382817	I feel like it's like, so what?
4382837	4383837	It's a play about video games.
4383877	4384277	Big deal.
4384617	4385097	Exactly.
4385277	4387198	It's just something for the bloggers to write about.
4387698	4391839	And talk about in the realm of ridiculous, but the way things are going, who knows.
4393101	4395302	Apparently there's been some investigation.
4395522	4405246	Two Belgium papers were reporting that police were investigating a virtual rape that happened in Second Life.
4405426	4406066	Where else?
4407967	4412208	I mean, basically... Insert joke here.
4412248	4414089	Do I even have to try tonight?
4414289	4418691	I mean... Goddamn, you Second Life fans are getting shit on tonight's show.
4418731	4419271	I'm so sorry.
4419771	4420031	What?
4420611	4422252	Obviously he can't get any in his first life.
4422950	4437320	But it begs the point, Regina Lynn over at Wired said, psychologically, the upheaval of virtual rape isn't anywhere near the trauma of real rape, and I can't see us making virtual rape a matter for the real life police.
4438461	4445746	Personally, if it were me and someone said, yeah, this guy just raped me in my video game, I'd probably hang up on them.
4446886	4448207	I'd be like, I don't give a shit.
4448828	4450309	Why are you wasting my time?
4450549	4451790	We're coming down to rescue you.
4453453	4455774	I just got raped in a video game.
4456774	4456954	No.
4457394	4461515	If they start treating this shit as real, it's just like the whole taxing people on virtual commerce.
4461555	4464436	Or that kid who got taken away for making the map of his school.
4465916	4466296	People.
4467137	4468357	It's not real.
4468817	4469857	It's not real.
4469957	4471358	It's a fucking video game.
4471418	4473098	They make money in the video game.
4473158	4474479	You can't tax them on that.
4474659	4476999	Or if you're going to tax them, it has to be on game money.
4477620	4478540	Not real money.
4478800	4480660	And no, you shouldn't be able to tax them on it.
4482461	4482861	Anyways.
4483753	4487855	Moving on a little bit here, DDR, coming to schools in Scotland.
4488315	4491637	So that should be pretty cool, seeing that it's catching on in other places.
4493598	4502022	For the Simpsons video game, they have a counter now, counting down the video game's release or release info on the launch.
4502402	4507164	They have a mock site that's making fun of Grand Theft Auto 4, so that's pretty cool.
4507604	4509345	It says 22 on there.
4511006	4512787	And let's see, what else we've got here?
4514491	4522236	The people behind the wonderful game Puzzle Quest are actually making a new space-themed game called Galactrix.
4523137	4525418	And I'm talking a little bit about that.
4526799	4527940	But it looks pretty cool.
4528240	4531522	They're trying to make sure it's not just a Puzzle Quest clone.
4532943	4535345	And that's it, pretty much.
4538046	4538326	All right.
4538767	4540548	Anything from you, Miss DarkSakura?
4540568	4540608	No.
4541889	4543890	One time, I fed my snakes some beer.
4545111	4546612	It cleared this way and that.
4547092	4548533	It was all fucked up!
4549654	4552316	Thank you for taking the IQ level of our show down a couple notches.
4552376	4554897	It's always good to be humbled like that.
4555338	4557539	I was going to talk about some stupid rumors that I read.
4557979	4558960	Actually, this was funny, though.
4558980	4562722	Remember they banned some sort of theme on Xbox Live?
4563683	4565764	The sexy girl theme or something like that?
4566685	4567645	Sexy girl theme.
4567665	4570047	I don't know if it's sexy girl, but yeah, it's some girl...
4570854	4572875	Weird Girls You'll Never Have theme.
4573296	4573976	Something like that.
4574516	4575257	I thought that was funny.
4575497	4579280	That and how people are saying that the next PlayStation model is coming out in 18 months.
4580560	4580881	Yeah.
4581461	4582181	Never going to happen.
4583783	4584083	That's all.
4584343	4584643	All right.
4584743	4586845	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4587065	4589887	Drew, Nami, thanks so much for being here again.
4589927	4590527	We appreciate you.
4590907	4591848	You've been missing a little while.
4592749	4594930	Uh, yeah, I've been doing some entertaining in the chat room.
4595070	4598890	Alright, I apologize, uh, we were actually originally, we were thinking about doing a match game tonight.
4598950	4607672	Mikulatov was trying to, he said he'd stay for the show if he could, we would do a match game tonight, but then we just did a match game like, you know, three episodes ago, so, uh, we're holding off on match game.
4607912	4611333	Will you come back for maybe the next match game or next dumb little game we play here in studio?
4611753	4611953	Sure.
4612113	4612713	Alright, sounds good.
4613754	4614534	Um, Loki!
4615674	4617334	Your final, oh wait, did I give you your final thought?
4617374	4618154	I'm sorry, Duguru.
4618335	4619035	I want pie.
4619215	4619535	Thank you.
4619615	4620475	Loki, your final thought.
4621598	4645076	Super Mario, or Super Paper Mario, I was going to say Super Mario RPG It's actually pretty cool, a little easy right now, but I'm only on the third level But I like it, it's growing on me I like there is a funny part, and it's kind of a spoiler a little bit, but in one of the third levels There's a power-up you can get that turns you into a giant version of 8-bit Mario Or whatever, and so you can go smash through stuff
4645618	4646078	Jamboroo Boran
4671761	4674342	Don't shoot fire in my face anymore.
4674442	4676062	Please fucking ride.
4676402	4677162	DarkSakura.
4682543	4683223	Tired.
4684103	4684483	All right.
4684843	4685644	I want pie.
4686664	4687364	It has no sugar.
