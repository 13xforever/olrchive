Today is Saturday, May the 26th, and we are live here at Funabay!
Hello everybody out there on the internet and here in the room with us and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
And we're here live at Fonamay in front of an audience that's significantly bigger than we had last year.
So thank you guys very much.
I appreciate that.
And Loki's Mac Heckler is back.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I've been playing with my Pokemans.
Let me show you them.
Are they in your pants right now?
No, they're in my purse.
Oh, okay.
That's not as exciting.
After, what, three weeks of me saying that I was going to get Pokemon Pearl, my hubby finally came home with it, interrupting my nonstop streak of nothing but Deadpool on Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
So I've had to pass off the fangirlism from one to another.
And I actually missed, I forgot how much fun Pokemon was.
And I've been playing a crap ton of pinball.
Like real pinball or that Microsoft thing?
Dan's been playing the other pinball and I have to say that it actually is starting to impress me more with the full version.
And also he had the Double Dragon thing.
He's been playing a lot of that.
But we've sort of been talking about breaking out the Saturn again because I've been wanting to play Guardian Heroes.
You're so random sometimes.
We have any Saturn fans in the house?
You know it's a dead system, right?
They don't make games for you anymore.
It will never die.
All right.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
because I can't stop playing the damn game.
And we're actually looking to overclock our Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories games even more.
We're now, because GameStop is having a wonderful sale on 2GB memory sticks, we're going to dump the ISOs onto the memory sticks and overclock those and play multiplayer games.
So it's going to be even faster, about 10 times faster, actually.
And then, other than that, just co-op...
Crackdown, and a little bit of the Halo 3 beta.
Not too much, because I don't really care.
Is it just me, or is Halo 3 just Halo 2, like a little prettier?
Yeah.
Okay, I thought it was just me.
But I've never been a big fan of first-person shooters.
At least you can jump in it.
I mean, it's not going to be like the next perfect dark game, you know.
It's like jump technology.
It's now, it's not later.
Perfect Dark Zero jumping?
Yeah, seriously, you need to be able to jump in that game.
All right.
My gaming week.
Wow, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft still because I have no life.
And I also checked out a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
I've played about every new game they have out there.
And Russian Attack.
What was that?
I never played that game back in the 80s.
I don't even remember that game.
I remember.
It's really hard.
But it seems to be on every Konami compilation that they've released in the past 10 years.
DarkSakura
We don't have any kids in the audience.
Why are they giving us that, though, when there's stuff like Yaya Kung Fu and all that?
I heard the Japanese got that as an exclusive.
They just hate us.
We need Kid Dracula for life.
They hate us.
I also played Xevious, which they did not change at all.
You know how usually they do a graphical upgrade or something when they put the games on Xbox Live?
No, if you pay five bucks for this, you're just getting Xevious, which is, for me, not even that great a shooter to begin with.
I remember fondly way more shooters in the 80s.
DJ Max Portable 2 DJ Max Portable 2
BBNA 2DS.
I actually did play Owen Don 2, speaking of that.
You know, it isn't as good as Eatly Beat Agents at all, I think.
No, it's not as good.
But they have a mode in it, in Owen Don 2, which makes those white circles disappear.
And it makes the game...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
He's the guy that calls in like every week.
He's here.
Come up here and say something, Ranma.
Did anybody come from further than New York?
I didn't think so.
So say something to the folks, Ranma.
Ring, ring.
How you doing?
I'm doing good.
How about you guys?
Good.
So we're going to hang in New York City, right?
We're going to do another OLR con something.
Oh, yeah.
Let me ask you, do you like sushi?
It's all right.
I know a couple of cool places.
Sounds good.
All right, so we'll check the forums for more information on the meetup.
And I'm sure we'll be hearing from you during the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
Maybe.
All right, sounds good.
If it wasn't for DarkSakura, I would not be here.
Thank you, Ranma.
That makes me feel happy in a special place.
Careful, this is a family event.
All right.
In my liver.
AnimeSecrets.org AnimeHell.org AnimeSucks.biz
They don't just give those to anybody.
I thought that was just one of those blog accounts that you go and it says, like, Viagra, Viagra Now, Viagra... Anyway.
No, it lists a bunch of different various, you know, themes on it.
You can buy this for your soul or something.
Google, google.com.
How about... However, I found out... I found out, though, that if you typo Google by typing in goggle, it will pull up a porn site.
All right.
Enough of the...
No B-tards allowed.
Let's get into some news this week because we don't have a whole lot of time.
We're going to talk about some gaming news.
How many of you guys are excited for Super Smash Bros.
Melee on the Nintendo Wii?
About freaking time, I agree.
Yeah, I've been excited about Melee like two years ago.
Yes, thank you, Super Smash Bros.
Brawl.
Sorry, I'm still playing the GameCube one once in a while, actually.
But, of course, there's a website up, the Smash Bros.
Dojo, and they have this whole blog going on there.
And I don't know how many of you guys checked it out, but they just announced some of the musicians that are going to be in this game.
And it's like a smorgasbord of all these musicians that have done different stuff.
I noticed, let's see, you have from the Animal Crossing series, you have Kazumi, Totaka.
What's his name, the little...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
and my favorite, Yuzo Koshiro from Actraiser, Streets of Rage and Midnight Maximum 2.
And I hope he's going to do something kind of in that vein for this game.
They're going to have cars from Midnight Maximum 2 in the game.
You think that would be one of the hidden characters?
If it works for Fighters Megamix, then...
I was actually looking at Iraha for Sylphid.
You think a plane's going to come in and shoot?
From Game Arts, though, we also have a connection to Grandia.
Yeah, but you see, though, these haven't been on Nintendo.
Well, I guess it's Super Nintendo, so that would be a Nintendo console.
Well, here you have the guy that did the Killer7 music.
Why don't we get the serial killer in this game?
That would be fun.
Cut up Mario.
It would be a good time.
We've already got Snake ready to garrot.
Ranma wants to see the Black Mage.
We need specifically the 8-bit theater Black Mage.
I hate these geometry things with you to hang out with your Pokemans.
I'm trying to think about exactly how that's going to work on the Wii.
You're going to use the directional pad to move around and you tap the screen to shoot.
Well, wouldn't it be smarter to use the nunchuck thing because it has the more directional thing?
Yeah, on the Wii, not the DS.
Well, the Wii, you're probably going to use the analog stick on the nunchuck to move around and you're going to use the Wii Remote to point and shoot.
One thing that I noticed on here is that they're quoted saying it's supposed to be an extensive single-player campaign.
I would actually like to see a multiplayer Geometry Wars.
It is going to be multiplayer.
But on the Wii?
Online.
On the Wii?
Yes, on the Wii.
About freaking time.
They specified single player.
Because they're going to have the single player campaign, right?
No.
Story mode for Geometry Wars?
A square approaches.
On a planet far away, a bunch of polygons landed on a planet and gave everybody seizures.
So they decided to kill them all.
Wow.
How exactly do you get a story out of Geometry Wars?
That's going to be something else.
Here's how they're basically... In the nightmare of a mathematician.
They said, well, early tests, it says, with the remote and nunchuck combination were very promising, and noobs managed to rack up respectable scores with ease.
Trauma Center Online, where you can, you know, kill your patients together.
Cause trauma.
So if you're a fan of Geometry Wars, you're probably also a fan of some of the download games.
And coming to the Virtual Console soon, you're going to have some pretty good stuff, including Mega Man, which was leaked onto the Australian ratings board there, kind of their version of the ESRB.
So that's going to be coming to the Virtual Console.
Also, according to Nintendo Power coming to the Virtual Console there, Paper Mario, the original.
So you'll be able to check that out as well.
Cool.
Now, okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but on the GameCube, did they not release a Mega Man compilation that had improved audio and visuals, right?
Yeah.
Right?
On the GameCube?
On the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
Okay, and this you could probably pick up for $20 new, maybe even less used, right?
Yeah.
And Wii's backwards compatible, so I could play it on the Wii.
Yeah.
And they're going to charge me $5 for old school Mega Man Y. Yeah.
Because you'll buy it.
Yeah.
People are stupid.
Is it the convenience of it?
It's because they don't sell the other one anymore.
Well, you can get it on eBay.
I'm sure it's not that hard to find.
Oh, but that involves me buying it online.
I mean, who shops online?
$14?
GameCrazy, $14, says the audience.
Well, also rumored to be coming to Virtual Console soon, ActRaiser, of course, is pretty awesome.
And also to Xbox Live Arcade, Fatal Fury Special.
Which I can just play at home on the Neo Geo.
By the way, it's about freaking time.
Actraiser's on its way over here.
It's rumored, because ESRB has a rating now.
Oh, come on!
Japan's got it, Europe's got it.
How long do I have to wait for my Actraiser?
Forever.
Don't worry, Rob.
The sad thing is I have the cartridge and the Super Nintendo sitting in a trunk somewhere.
It's on schedule.
It's going to be coming out right after Duke Nukem Forever comes out.
They're going to be releasing the Kid Icarus sequel, and then you're going to get ActRaiser right after that.
Joy.
All right.
Any Sony PlayStation 3 fans in the house?
Woo!
Thank you, Jamie.
Hey, only for one game.
This is kind of interesting.
There's a couple.
There's a couple folks and some hecklers for the PlayStation 3.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe this will win over some fans for the PlayStation 3.
Oh, wait, wait.
I forgot.
I'm a Microsoft fanboy because that's what they said on the forum.
Oh, my God.
That forum post was incredible, wasn't it?
Was it you that wrote it?
Somebody totally blasted Loki on the forums for being a Microsoft fan.
Tell us about that real quick before we get into the Sony story.
They were basically saying, what are you talking about?
Sony doesn't have any PlayStation 3 exclusives coming.
I hear it lists all this stuff, including they also listed Home as a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
I don't know if that's a game or not.
Life is a game.
I'm like, that's great and all, but even still, there's more exclusives coming out from Microsoft, and they also have the whole, I don't know, stuff that came out a year ago since it's been out for a year.
All right, well, maybe, I don't know, maybe this will make Loki love Sony a little more.
I don't know.
But do you have an HDMI connection to your TV?
No.
Well, then you won't care, because if you do, you get upscaled DVDs now, thanks to the 1.80 patch.
You get full 1080p upscaled DVDs.
And the PS2 and PS1 games are getting upscaled, too.
So that's kind of fun, if you can actually notice the difference.
Now I can have extra jaggedy edges on my jumping flash.
You also get, if you have an Epson printer, you get to print photographs now.
My Epson printer sucks.
You can transfer PlayStation 2 and 1 save files from the PlayStation 3 using a memory card adapter.
So you can kind of get your files around a little bit easier thanks to this patch.
And PSP remote play over the internet.
One thing I should add, though, is that Epson has just recently put out a really nice high-scale printer that will do high-resolution prints and print directly to CD.
So imagine something like that, though, with printing out your PlayStation stuff as nice as those would come out.
Taking screen captures of all those games I don't play?
Rob.
Anyway.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Hi.
All right.
I thought she'd behave herself now that we're in front of other people.
Alright, so that's it.
I'm fueled by the power of evil.
Alright, so Jamie, anything else on PlayStation 3, news-wise?
Actually, yes.
What's that?
Which is a big, you know, whoop-de-hoo.
But anyway, there's rumors coming back up, according to a GameFAQs forum member that... GameFAQs?
I know, this is why I'm like, who?
Well, to be fair, it's... The guy from PSN Magazine.
It's a guy that saw, it was a forum post by a guy who had a magazine.
Again, who?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it had a Zetagears reference to it before the game came out.
Yeah, remember, Rumble is so last gen.
Remember that?
I remember when you used to have to attach things to get your Rumble.
Oh, are you talking about the Rez thingy?
No, I'm talking about the... I'm talking about the Nintendo 64... Anyways...
Something coming to the PlayStation 3 and also the 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, and it's getting a limited edition as well.
Basically, you're going to get this nice little, almost looks like a lockbox or a metal safety deposit box, and included in that will be an art book, a soundtrack, which, you know, their soundtracks are always awesome.
and Keychain and of course keys to the safety deposit box.
Yay!
Crap I don't need!
I have mine on order already.
That sounds like a good set.
And a limited edition Rockstar duffel bag.
What was the price point on that?
$90.
Okay, that's actually a good set.
That would be something worthwhile to get.
The Cardcaptor Sakura box on Dreamcastle is ridiculous.
I think it's cool to get an art book and to get a CD and to get a duffel bag.
I don't think it's as cool to get a plate, a clock, and a fork.
How many of you cool kids want a rock star duffel bag?
That's what I thought.
One, two, three.
All the girls raised their hand first.
That was interesting.
Interesting.
All right.
All right, anyhow, if you want to get something a little more sooner than that, there's some release dates.
And this is the best part of the show, by the way, especially for you guys here, because I know a lot of you guys are into your anime and all that stuff.
You get to hear me horribly mispronounce Japanese release dates.
Good times.
You get to horribly hear me pronounce this stuff.
So we have coming out in Japan, we have Foza Force.
I can't even pronounce the English ones right.
God.
God.
I'm just so nervous.
I feel naked because everybody's looking at us.
Thank God you're not really.
Forza Motorsport 2 is coming out in the Asian regions anyway because it's coming to the U.S.
as well.
Any Forza fans in the house?
I see one hand.
Coming to the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard 4, which you know is Resident Evil 4, on May 31st.
So it's a little more than a week out, but it's almost coming.
And also coming out on the PlayStation 3, not a lot, over on the PlayStation 2, you get Guilty Gear XX Accent Core is coming out in Japan on May 31st.
Guilty Gear fans in the house.
I'm totally going to be getting that.
And hooray, another Pachinko game, Aladdin Destiny from Sega.
Sega cranks out these Pachinko games every week over there.
It's like brain training.
And then here's my favorite title of the week, Love Drops.
It's coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan from Dimple Entertainment.
Okay, this one seems cute.
Bringing you some love drops.
That's funny because that's Sasa's old nickname, the Kirito.
Love drops?
No, the Kirito one.
I want love drops.
Panic Palette is another game coming out over in Japan as well.
Did I say Galaxy Angel?
On the Nintendo DS, New Zealand Story DS, another update of an old-ass game.
Go figure on May 31st.
New Zealand Story, that's an old-ass game.
Boring, I know.
No offense to the New Zealanders who may be listening.
Anyways, coming out in the U.S., a whole lot of, I don't know.
Anyways, Surf Supps coming out on almost everything, although you probably won't be playing it.
Forza Motorsports 2 on the 360.
Forza!
Shadowrun on the 360 and for Vista.
Also, are we sure it won't get delayed due to partial nudity?
I don't know.
You should have an advanced release with extra partial nudity.
Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is coming out on 360, so that should be pretty cool.
Let's see here.
Just a small little title.
Mario Party 8 is going to be coming out as well.
Tamagotchi Party On for the Wii.
We have a Tamagotchi fan in the house.
All right.
There you go.
She's got the first one at home.
And on the DS, Pony Friends.
Wake Me Up When It's My Little Pony Friends.
And Tank Beat, which is actually kind of neat.
Pony Friends, Jamie.
Yay!
PSP also has Crush coming out.
That should be pretty cool.
And then on PC, you've always got a bunch of weird name titles, including...
Dream Day Wedding, and Circus Empire.
Is that like one of those roller coaster tycoon type games, Circus Empire?
Maybe.
I want to have an attraction where clowns kill each other.
That would be pretty fun.
Clown Survivor.
Good times.
I still like Clown Quake.
The old Quake mod.
Oh, is there like an old mod?
Really?
Yeah.
That's fine.
Why doesn't Xbox 360 put mods for like Doom and stuff?
It's downloadable.
No, they totally need to start doing the old Quake mods up.
No, but like legit mods, you know?
Something that Microsoft approves.
Like, you know, this can be downloadable content.
You know, change all the Doom sprites to... You know what I want on Xbox Live?
I want ASCII Quake.
I was also going to mention, real quick, this is kind of an exclusive, no one's heard about this yet, but... Uh-oh, here we go again, we're going to get busted.
It's not a Namco game, is it?
That's okay, I have my cyanide pill ready.
Thank God.
No, coming out to the U.S.
are going to be remakes of old Hudson titles, and these are not being released by Konami, it's being released by yet another company.
I believe that they go... I'm trying to...
Anyways, we're going to see, not a good Bomberman, but we're going to see remakes of Adventure Island, Bonk, and Star Soldier coming out over here in the fall.
So those are going to be starting in August and kind of running through the rest of the year.
But those will not be coming from Konami.
They're already out in Japan already.
Can I also say there's a Betty Boop game coming to Nintendo DS?
That's pretty awesome.
Betty Boop the game.
Do you touch her and she goes, boop, boop, boop?
I hope not.
Star Soldier, though, has a special place in my heart because it spawned one of my favorite games ever, Star Parodia.
Anyone ever a PC Engine fan?
Star Parodia is a game where you play as Bomberman or a flying PC Engine or the plane from Star Soldier and you basically play through a parody of Star Soldier.
But I like playing as a flying PC Engine.
Oh, please say those titles.
There's two titles coming out from another smaller company called Smart Boys Game Room and Smart Girls Playhouse.
What does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?
I don't know.
Jamie, what does a smart girl keep in her playhouse?
Assault weapons.
I see.
All right, your turn.
Well, coming out in the UK, a few things.
On the 31st, we have the Marvel Trading Card Game.
Yay.
Yay.
On the first, we have Capcom Puzzle World, Legend of the Dragon, SBK07 Super Bike World Championship, Shadowrun for PC, and a History Channel game, Great Battles of Rome.
Oh yeah, and Tomb Raider, but who cares?
Okay, and Wario Master of Disguise.
And Meteus Disney Edition.
Good times.
Meteos Disney Edition.
I never did pick that up over here.
Anybody have Meteos Disney Edition in the house?
Anybody?
It's not much different.
It's not selling very well.
Remember, Meteos Disney Edition goes faster at night.
I hate you.
Just kidding.
Well, of course, Sony's already been in court before.
They had to pay all those damages to Immersion over it.
And what happened is that Target Technology, not the store, but Target Technology actually filed a suit earlier this month.
And it has to do with patent violations, and they're related to Sony's Blu-ray technology.
and basically the suit says that Sony America, Sony Pictures, Sony DADC, it says that all their products marketed under the Blu-ray name actually infringe on a patent that Target already owns for these reflective layer materials and optical discs.
So it's another one of those like, hey, we invented this obscure technology a long time ago and never said anything about it until now.
No, they've been using it.
It doesn't seem like a lawsuit of convenience.
No, because they were using it on DVDs, on dual-layer DVDs for a while.
But I'm talking about the PlayStation 3's been out how long now?
That's what always puzzles me about these lawsuits.
Like, did somebody just roll out of bed and see the people shooting each other for a PlayStation 3?
Keep in mind, you know how long things take in the corporate world.
Once you realize that you've got a problem, how long does it take to go through meetings, check with legal...
I don't know, do we have any Rockstar fans in the house that might know?
Anybody?
Just teasing.
Little DDR joke, by the way.
For anything that occurs in the corporate world, you can expect at least a three-month delay.
Before they start thinking about doing something.
All right.
Well, this is sure to cause another lawsuit.
Yes?
No one can hear you.
Yeah, no one can hear you, Ranma.
He's bringing up the whole issue with BlackBerry.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come on.
We've got 20 minutes.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Rapid fanboy power, go.
Basically, same thing happened with BlackBerry and Research in Motion.
Research in Motion sued BlackBerry over different copyright infringements and patent technologies and stuff.
They settled out, but if they had won, they would have no longer been able to sell BlackBerrys and all that, and those who use them would have been screwed.
That's a pretty massive market.
All right.
Well, speaking of things that are likely to get sued over, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down and all over every week and find her favorite website to share with you guys, and we call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
That's the wrong music, by the way.
That's all I have.
Live radio, boys and girls.
All right, fine.
We'll just go with it.
All right.
My Website of the Week is fairly simple, one that you've all been to if you're here at faname.com.
Let's hear it for the staff.
Fonamay.com, let's hear it for the Fonamay staff.
Wendell from Stage Zero's in the house.
My hero.
Wendell, did you hear me yelling at you earlier to take it off?
Wait, before we came up to the room, I said something a lot nicer.
Uh-oh, here he comes.
Wendell's coming towards the front of the room.
No, we do want to say a big thanks to the Fonamay staff, though, for having us here a second year in a row, suckers.
Hey, we appreciate you coming over.
No problem.
Part of my voice that's been kind of... What the fuck happened to your voice?
You know what?
It's not necessarily that I've been working all day.
It's just that I've had really bad allergies over the last two weeks.
It's like the county that I'm living in, it's just horrible.
Coming down to San Jose, I've been breathing a little better.
My voice is being a little better, but I know by the end of the convention I'll be all right.
Thank you so much, DarkSakura.
It was Tic Tacs?
She's got me some... It's like a pack of smokes from right here.
I ain't gonna help.
They're lozenges from Ikea.
I just wanted to say, though, that Fatima is a very special place, or like a special time for me, because I have a little bit of a story that I'm about to tell you.
All right.
It was like, I think it was about 2001.
It was 2001.
It was over at the Santa Clara Convention Center.
And...
I believe it was the same year that our good friend Mel had won his DDR machine.
It was.
Yeah, he won his solo 2000 machine.
It was about March of 2001.
And one of those nights I got a little tipsy, rather inebriated, and I was feeling the need to play some DDR.
So I go down to where the DDR machines are at.
They had the solo machine.
Right behind where the fourth plus was at.
And I got my little games on, played it.
I was really, really, a little tipsy to a point where I actually tried to do a knee drop and cut my knee on the pad.
But the knee drop was late.
Yeah, it was.
Next thing you know, my friend Brandon decides, you know, checks me up, puts a bandage on my knee.
And as I decide to sit down and try to relax, try to relax and just like try to sober up.
So, I sit down over at the, right by the side of the ER machine, and I'm sitting right next to this woman, and I look to her and I say, Hi, how are you?
My name is Wendell.
What are you?
And this woman... And I'm the love doctor.
And strangely enough, the woman replies to me and says, Hi, my name is Jamie, otherwise known as DarkSakura.
So, this was the first time that I actually first met
DarkSakura, and then I was formally introduced to her at the tournament.
When you were sober.
When I was sober, later on in October for a tournament.
So, anime is probably like a very special place where I first met the very lovely and talented DarkSakura.
There's another note to that.
You played DDR with me when I was still trying to pass sevens, and you passed your first eight that night, I think.
I believe it was.
Drunk.
Drunk, yes.
Yes.
I also remember that after I spoke with her, I proceeded to fall asleep right next to her.
And then everybody came up.
It was Mike Noe and Mel.
And all of them came and fetched you.
I think that was the case because I don't remember the rest of it.
I was two days sleep deprived and he was one night drunk.
I don't remember the rest of that night.
I was like, bye Wendell, nice to meet you.
I'm going to sit here.
Wendell, I got one more question for you before we get back to the game news because we've only got 15 minutes left.
First off, thank you since you're here and you're on Fanime staff for having us, of course, again this year.
Fanime is very thankful that you came by once again.
No problemo.
It's good times, good times.
I don't get to see people play dress-up except on Halloween usually, so this is a good time.
So what did you have to do to get those beats?
That's all I wanted to ask.
It was a painful experience.
All right.
Well, then we won't make it.
Maybe that panel will happen actually later on tonight.
Oh, no.
I basically had to pay for it online with like $10 worth of shipping and handling.
All right.
Well, Wendell from Stage Zero, everybody, thank you for reminiscing.
I got to head back to Stage Zero myself, so I got to do it.
All right.
Much love to Jamie.
Much love to Rob.
What's up, Loki?
All right.
Thank you very much, sir.
So we get random celebrity drop-ins from the Faname staff.
Appreciate it.
All right, to reminisce about stories here.
So, all right, so the website of the week is Fonamay.com, and you can pre-reg for 2008.
Yes, you can.
Do it.
All right.
All right, what's up next?
Well, an interesting tale of a game system that defies all logic, traveled through time, killed a baby.
Anyways, and that is, no, not the Phantom.
Phantom never came out.
But anyways, that is the claim, apparently, of some folks that are trying to sue Microsoft and Walmart, claiming that an overheated Xbox power supply had caused their house to burn up and killing their infant named Wade.
Unfortunately... The Xbox stole my baby!
They are seeking $50,000 in damages.
That's all?
Yes.
I really shouldn't make, because a baby did die, and that's really sad.
But somebody's suing Microsoft over... But here's the best part, though.
This is the best part.
Remember, this took place in December 2004.
However, Microsoft, a representative, was kind to remind us that the 360 was not available in December of 2004, and in fact came out a few years later.
Yes, and it is.
My FU of the week is addressed to the people who are not bathing at this convention.
I can smell the funk of fanboy a mile down the road at the pita place.
Do yourselves a favor.
If you are going to go to a convention, if you can pay to get in and buy crap in the dealer's room, you can afford to use a bathroom and at least buy some freaking deodorant.
Hello.
They should put Febreze in your package every year.
Use it, babe, please.
Fanboy Funk is not sexy.
Febreze on my package might burn a little bit, actually.
All right, my FU of the week would go to traffic on the way down here and the five CHP officers I passed on the way here.
They are out in force today.
That's crazy.
My FU of the week goes to Comcast, and I'll explain why.
I'm watching a TV show, it sounds like this.
All of a sudden, commercial comes on, and it's like that.
and I'll see you next time.
Uh, there is an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 on the way if you live in South Korea.
If you live in South Korea.
Maybe they can put StarCraft on it eventually.
That would be a good time.
So, uh, yeah, that's going to be coming over to South Korea.
It's going to cost you $556 and it lands on June 16th.
Could it be coming to the U.S.?
But what's 20 gigs going to do?
I mean, what exactly can you put on that drive right now?
Well, you have to remember, though, that the 80-gig PS3 that's coming out in Korea is actually going to be coming out with a video-on-demand service as well.
So, you know, that's probably what they're going to put on that drive.
Unless it's Korean schoolgirl hentai, I don't think most people are really going to care.
Well, you know, I could import them.
Oh, really?
No, really.
Go ahead.
What?
Famitsu is talking about, well, it's an ad out for a new R-Type that's an R-Type Tactics, and all I have to say to that is, what the hell?
No, just give me more R-Type, regular old R-Type with shooting things.
What exactly is R-Type Tactics?
Like, you have to move your ship around?
Yep.
That's so stupid.
You don't need to make every game into a Tactics game.
I don't know if that'll be coming to the U.S.
anytime soon.
There was only one really good tactics game, and that's none of them.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Final Fantasy Tactics, good times.
Uh, uh, Vandal Hearts?
Actually, no, oops, sorry.
Actually, um, Fire, the Fire Emblem.
Disgaea.
All right.
Fire Emblem.
One more, then we'll get Task Force Launch.
And then some genius out there decided to purchase the rights for The Sims to make it into a movie.
And that genius company would be
No, 20th Century Fox.
They have just picked up the movie rights to The Sims.
Why?
Because don't you want to see it in a movie where you have a house full of eight... Actually, I think a Sims reality show would be awesome where you'll put eight people in a house and then forget to build a toilet and watch what happens.
Because that's all I ever did in The Sims.
Make sure none of them know how to cook.
Or there was the house that my friend made once.
My friend Billy, who is a huge homosexual, made this house that had seven guys and one girl.
And all the guys would just make out with each other all day.
And the girl had to cook and clean and wipe up their pee because he forgot to build a toilet.
Hilarious.
Love the Sims.
I'm hoping Spore is just as fun.
All right.
Let's get to some Ask Orange Lounge.
We want your feedback and questions.
We don't have a whole lot of time, so we've got to make it quick.
Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
Okay, that's enough of Rob's singing.
Alright, who's got a question?
Come on down.
You, sir.
Come on down.
Come on down, because otherwise we can't hear you.
What's your name and where are you from?
Ray, GS68.
Ray, GS68!
What's up?
So, I have a question.
Have you watched any anime here?
I just got here like an hour and a half ago, so no.
I did in the hotel.
Actually, what we watched last night in the hotel room was Shaun of the Dead and Hard Gay.
I may watch some Yowie later if I can find it.
So I'll be late.
Thank you.
All right.
Oh, yes.
Oh, goody.
I can get smacked later.
That'll be fun.
Oh, you're going to go down there to get the questions?
Well, as far as this mic cord will take me.
All right.
Sounds good.
Any other questions?
Which is about this far.
Yeah.
Oh, here's our heckler.
Come on down, sir.
What's your name?
Where are you from?
Jacob, and I'm from the interweb.
All right, Jacob from the interweb.
What's your question?
Back in the day, Loki was quite the edit maker for DDR.
Which was your favorite edit you made?
I don't remember what they're called now, but there was the one on, what was it, Ecstasy that was pretty fun.
It stopped.
Oh, I remember one now.
There was one that was on Exotic Ethnic that was a double.
It was like...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
that I won the Hell Edit contest with.
Yeah, I remember.
Whatever happened to the Step Edit contest?
Yeah, it was DXY called another.
Yes, the classic Make Edit Get Porn contest.
I have a whole lot of hentai things to... Good times.
All right, any other questions, folks?
Come on down.
Oh, yes, you in the back.
Come on down.
Isn't she cute?
We have a loli.
What's your name, sweetie?
Where are you from?
Cassie from Marina.
All right, what's on your mind?
Well, it's a really obscure question, but it's for her.
Okay.
What was your starter Pokemon in Pearl?
I used Chimchar.
Chimchar.
Oh, she just made a face.
I'm going to take you out in the parking lot.
Keep in mind, I'm obsessed with fire.
I like the water Pokemon.
Ever since, well, my first video game Pokemon that I played was Blue version, and I started out with Squirtle, and from that, the obsession began.
I started off with Charmander.
You know, I picked... It starts from the very beginning.
Because everybody in Pokemans is picking that penguin, I decided to pick the grass Pokemon so I could kill them all very quickly.
See, for me, if I can't burn it, what good is it?
Alright.
However, for those of you guys that know Miklatov, who listens to the show, he also has a chimchar and he has the best name ever for it.
It's HoMonkey.
I accidentally skipped past where I was going to name it, but I was going to name it Firebutt.
Or Homoki, whatever you want to say.
All right.
One more question, then we've got to get out of here because I see more people coming in, which means people more popular than us must be waiting to start a panel.
One more.
You already went.
One more question.
Anybody?
Anybody?
Go.
Question.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Let's go home.
Bye.
All right.
Here we go.
Come on up real quick.
Hold on.
Do you guys remember the PTS movie?
Our little panel?
Lack thereof, I should say.
We made a big, big, big plug on it a long time ago.
Never finished.
Is that the group, people that suck or something?
People talking shit.
People talking shit.
We were banned.
Wow, I screwed up.
We were banned from like every forum ever.
Congratulations.
That's quite an accomplishment.
Good job.
But you're here, we haven't banned you from the room, so... Not yet.
Hey, hey, I didn't start it.
Don't shoot the messenger.
All right.
All right.
Well, you're here, and you got on our show, so there you go.
We will help grant your voice.
All right, well, we'd like to thank all you guys very much for coming out and seeing our show live.
We appreciate it.
And thank you guys, of course, for supporting independent podcasting.
That's the most important thing.
Even if you think our show sucks, please support other independent podcasts because there's a lot of great ones out there.
That Orange Lens Radio is just crap.
I know.
Especially that Rob guy.
I'm going to go listen to the PTS show.
They sound more fun than us.
So there it is.
There it is.
I want to go listen to G4 Radio.
G4 Radio.
Do we have the ending music?
And of course I was 100% lying.
Quick, play the ending music.
They're getting out the torches and going to take us outside and beat us up.
Rabble, rabble.
