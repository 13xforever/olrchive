0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	28000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this May 20th, 2007 with part B of episode number 232, if you can believe it, of our podcast.
28000	30000	Yes, we've been doing this that long.
30000	34000	Anyhow, we talked a lot about some various Sony news in part A.
34000	38000	We talked a lot about some of the new games coming out from their press event.
38000	44000	How Warhawk is actually going to be on Blu-ray now and SOCOM and the Heavenly Sword multiplayer and so on and so on.
44000	51000	So this segment we're going to talk a little more about some of the other consoles.
51000	59000	And, of course, we need to start with the Xbox because huge news this week with Halo 3, of course, finally getting its beta.
59000	64000	A little bit delayed. I mean, what, about 13 hours before the folks on Crackdown could get in there.
64000	69000	Although Bungie said, okay, because, you know, we made a boo-boo in getting you guys in when we said we would.
69000	72000	We're going to extend the beta for four days. Hooray.
72000	74000	And you shouldn't bitch about things that are free anyway.
74000	85000	Well, the beta was followed up immediately with the news that when Halo 3 is going to come out in fall 2007, they mean September 25th, 2007.
85000	92000	And for those of you guys in Europe that feel like you always get screwed, you have to wait one day, September 26th, for you guys in Europe.
92000	95000	So you guys finally not having to wait as long.
95000	98000	So September 2007, which I...
98000	103000	May I point out that September 26th will be occurring at the same time as September 25th here.
103000	105000	Ah, so it really...
105000	106000	There's an eight-hour time difference.
106000	107000	Oh, that's right. Good point.
107000	108000	At least between here and London time.
108000	111000	That's right. So basically it's a simultaneous release.
111000	114000	Not what? It's an eight-hour difference.
114000	117000	As close as you can get to it, we should say.
117000	119000	So that's pretty rad for them.
119000	121000	Don't worry about Japan yet, but don't know.
121000	122000	They can wait.
122000	128000	They're probably not as anxious about Halo 3, although, you know, if they can sell some copies of it there, why not?
128000	131000	Loki, you've mentioned September before on this show, haven't you?
131000	137000	Yeah, and there was a blog post, which I took away during that whole, you know...
137000	139000	Yeah, when people were threatening to beat you up.
139000	142000	Take you out of the parking lot and beat you up if you keep stealing.
142000	145000	I was off by 13 days, but I was close.
145000	147000	That's probably closer than most people, though. Good job, though.
147000	149000	All right, so there it is.
149000	152000	Get your pre-orders in now. September 25th is the day.
152000	154000	If you want Halo 3...
154000	159000	Especially get those pre-orders in if you're looking for the Legendary Edition, because it's going to be fucking impossible to find.
159000	160000	Just so you know.
160000	162000	All right.
162000	168000	So, yeah, immediately once the Halo 3 beta came out, people started...
168000	175000	You know, the modders out there were already taking notice and trying to grab any sort of information that they possibly can.
175000	188000	Of course, no actual word on what exactly that meant, but apparently they're looking at the code in the beta to see how they can exploit the game when it comes out.
188000	191000	Not surprising.
191000	194000	What exactly are they doing to it?
194000	196000	Not really sure.
196000	200000	I guess they're trying to rip code out of the...
200000	207000	I don't know, basically taking the demo or beta that's on your hard drive and just trying to dissect it.
207000	214000	I mean, are they these typical type of multiplayer exploits where they're trying to make themselves invincible so they can go in there and just blow people up and know when to shoot them?
214000	216000	Yeah, lag stuff. I don't know.
216000	221000	I don't think they're really going to be able to do much because it's a beta.
221000	229000	And I don't think anyone can really decrypt the games anyways, so that would be interesting.
229000	230000	Yeah.
230000	236000	Well, there is actually a little bit more in regards to the news.
236000	242000	We were talking about the accounts on Xbox Live a week or so ago.
242000	251000	Just another update for the same thing is that they are actually banning modified consoles from Live.
251000	259000	So, in other words, the folks that are trying to fuck with their systems to do this beta by hack storing their consoles, they're getting the ban hammer.
259000	260000	Pretty much.
260000	261000	Smacking it down.
261000	272000	Now, they have this little text, right, because I remember Major Nelson, I was reading his blog earlier this week, had a post of the actual little picture that would come up if you are a recipient of the ban hammer.
272000	281000	It was interesting because it read to me like it was saying, don't call us, there's nothing you can do, you've been banned, F you, bye, is basically what it said.
281000	286000	And I was kind of like, what if you get banned accidentally?
286000	290000	I mean, you'd be screwed because Microsoft basically says, screw you.
290000	296000	I would be, if this ever happened to me and I didn't actually mod my console or whatever, I would be livid.
296000	298000	I'm sure this can't be 100% foolproof.
298000	319000	I would think, though, that in most, that they're counting on there being such a minority of people that that happens to, because honestly, if you haven't put anything in your system that doesn't belong there, never opened the case to do anything to it, what are the chances going to be that there's going to be some sort of flaw that comes up saying that you've modified your system?
319000	321000	Interesting.
321000	324000	MysticGohan in chat is talking about what's happened.
324000	326000	MysticGohan says, they unlocked the locked content.
326000	329000	They found out that there's a vehicle called the chopper in it.
329000	332000	And Bandit says, there's a ban cannon.
332000	334000	Not a ban hammer, but a ban cannon.
334000	336000	Ban cannon.
336000	338000	Instead of a man cannon, a ban cannon.
338000	340000	Remember the man cannon?
340000	343000	I have yet to see one of those in the beta, the man cannon.
343000	349000	Do you think this is an appropriate response to the hackers?
349000	350000	Sure.
350000	353000	I understand it, but I hope they're damn right every time.
353000	365000	I think there ought to be some type of way to appeal just in case, because if this ever happens to somebody who runs a podcast or a blog, it's going to be a PR nightmare for Microsoft.
365000	367000	That's just my opinion.
367000	368000	Anyhow.
368000	370000	I don't really think they care.
370000	373000	I guess not, but still.
373000	375000	If they ban the wrong person, it's going to be trouble.
375000	377000	Anyhow.
377000	379000	You heard the fuss I made when I got the red rings.
379000	381000	I hope they don't accidentally ban me.
381000	383000	I have to quit raw steel in here.
383000	385000	Hackers deserve to have their consoles bricked.
385000	386000	I agree.
386000	392000	But again, as long as they are 100% positive that the people they are banning are those that deserve it.
392000	397000	Don't hack your system until the next gen comes out.
397000	404000	Well, those of you guys that have not gotten your Xbox consoles banned, you have plenty to look forward to.
404000	414000	Xbox Live Arcade is getting a Bomberman port, and if you're still crying in the corner in the fetal position over Bomberman Act Zero, fear not.
414000	417000	This is a traditional Bomberman style game.
417000	418000	Hudson's putting it together.
418000	424000	They have confirmed after much speculation on the internet, which I believe we talked a little bit about last week on the show.
424000	425000	There was a trailer and stuff.
425000	426000	A little bit.
426000	428000	Hudson has stepped out and said, okay, you got us.
428000	433000	It is coming out, and it's going to have eight player support online.
433000	435000	Quote, this has been one of our most requested games.
435000	437000	Our fans have been clamoring for it.
437000	440000	We are thrilled to finally be able to deliver the game they want.
440000	442000	So there you have it.
442000	443000	That's going to be pretty awesome there.
443000	447000	Also new to the Xbox Live Arcade version.
447000	449000	Bomberman customizability.
449000	453000	Gamers will be able to design a unique bomber to identify themselves with online.
453000	458000	Hudson promises enough options for 10,000 possible combinations.
458000	463000	9,900 of which are ugly.
463000	469000	So anyways, something kind of funny coming out from Edge Magazine in the UK.
469000	471000	This is coming from Mark Raim.
471000	476000	They're talking about Gears of War and how they modified it into a golf game.
476000	485000	Apparently they were trying to sell the Unreal 3 engine to a Korean publisher that was looking to make casual games from it and possibly a golf game out of it.
485000	494000	So what they did to kind of demonstrate this is they modified one of the levels of Gears of War to make it more like a golf course with holes and stuff like that and mounds.
494000	500000	And then actually had their animator create a golf swing for Marcus Fenix.
500000	507000	And kind of demonstrated it using the actual grenade throwing engine in the actual game.
507000	509000	So that's kind of neat.
509000	514000	Don't expect it to actually come to live or anything as download content.
514000	517000	But hey, if they wanted to do that, that would be kind of neat.
517000	525000	Will Gears of War Golf, this tech demo here, become the Final Fantasy on Nintendo 64 tech demo of the future?
525000	527000	Like one of those highly sought after things?
527000	528000	I don't know.
528000	529000	Maybe not.
529000	532000	It'd be fun to have a downloadable demo or something like that.
532000	534000	Let's see a YouTube. Come on.
534000	538000	Wherever a story like this is to be found, there's soon a YouTube to be found.
538000	540000	So let's see a YouTube of this in action.
540000	543000	Marcus Fenix on the golf course. Amazing.
543000	547000	Well, this is actually something that makes me pretty happy.
547000	556000	Is that in recent submissions to the ESRB has been Echo the Dolphin and Sonic the Hedgehog for Xbox 360.
556000	562000	So you remember when we were talking about the Sega Vintage rumor that was going out?
562000	566000	Well, this seems to sort of support that theory.
566000	569000	Although it's not going to be called Sega Vintage.
569000	570000	I'm sorry.
570000	574000	They are going to call it Sega Ages something because that's just Sega.
574000	575000	So whatever.
575000	577000	Because ages is Sega backwards?
577000	578000	Yes.
578000	579000	Cute.
579000	585000	Rob, they've been doing the Sega Ages collection since the day of the Saturn.
585000	587000	That name is not going anywhere.
587000	590000	When was the last time there was a good Wayne's World reference anywhere?
590000	592000	Come on. I had to do it not.
592000	595000	Anyway, sorry. I killed the joke.
595000	597000	Anyhow, are you excited about this?
597000	599000	I don't know. This is like the five gazillionth time we've seen Sonic the Hedgehog.
599000	601000	I have both of those games.
601000	604000	But there'll be achievements and high def graphics?
604000	607000	How much do I give a shit about achievements, Rob?
607000	609000	You've seen my Xbox Live account.
609000	611000	Don't you have like zero points?
611000	619000	No. I have one achievement and that's from playing Uno and winning with a draw four.
619000	623000	The one time I've played on live.
623000	625000	You're not really a big 360.
625000	627000	Where's all your Marvel Ultimate Alliance achievements?
627000	628000	I'm playing on PS3.
628000	630000	But you're going to be playing on Xbox 360, yes?
630000	634000	Yeah, and then it'll have Cheater all over it.
634000	639000	Because I'm going to be level 99, 100K, max out my characters.
639000	641000	Yeah. That'll be me.
641000	643000	Interesting.
643000	645000	Alright.
645000	648000	Well, if you are a fan of Retro, are you interested in this, Loki?
648000	649000	The echo of the dolphin?
649000	650000	Nope.
650000	652000	Hey, KainVM, guess what? I have Dragon Force.
652000	654000	What?
654000	657000	KainVM says I want Dragon Force. Give me Dragon Force.
657000	658000	I have it.
658000	659000	Alright.
659000	661000	On the Saturn.
661000	664000	Going over to the Wii.
664000	667000	Of course, they love their virtual console stuff over on the Wii.
667000	675000	And again, the ESRB spills the dirt on what we can be looking forward to on the Wii Virtual Console.
675000	679000	Including Streets of Rage 2 coming to the Wii Virtual Console.
679000	682000	ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron.
682000	685000	Boy, they're really reaching with the Sega Genesis games now, aren't they?
685000	688000	And World Sports Competition from Hudson.
688000	689000	There you go.
689000	693000	Three games that are all but confirmed, basically, for the Virtual Console.
693000	696000	Anybody downloaded anything on Virtual Console lately?
696000	699000	Nope.
699000	703000	I guess I'm the only sucker for it. I got Legend of the Mystical Ninja because that game was awesome.
703000	704000	Oh, that was pretty fun.
704000	705000	It was an awesome game.
705000	708000	World Sports Competition.
708000	711000	That's such a generic name.
711000	714000	By the way, Nintendo.
714000	716000	Hello, Nintendo and Squeenix.
716000	719000	I am still waiting for Actraiser.
719000	720000	Thank you.
720000	724000	Japan and Europe have had it how long now and we're still waiting?
724000	726000	What the hell's the holdup? Actraiser.
726000	728000	On my Super Mario RPG.
728000	730000	Now.
730000	732000	Okay, sorry. I'm done being a little kid.
732000	737000	Anyways, so something else we talked about on a previous podcast.
737000	740000	Which later disappeared.
740000	743000	Into the Bermuda Triangle.
743000	745000	Which we will speak no longer of on this program.
745000	749000	Namco Museum Remix is coming to the Wii.
749000	751000	First time I've ever heard that.
751000	755000	No, I've never heard you say this on a previous podcast at all that suddenly disappeared a few weeks later.
755000	756000	Never heard it.
756000	757000	Never ever.
757000	758000	Never.
758000	764000	But it's going to actually, they're kind of remixing a few different things than you would normally expect.
764000	769000	Like Pac-Man rolls actually being remade into a Wii game.
769000	770000	That's kind of neat.
770000	772000	So that's going to be on there.
772000	778000	Pac-Motos, which is going to be a kind of a Mario Kart type game, sort of.
778000	783000	Basically Pac-Man knocks his opponents out of dangerous arenas.
783000	787000	Rally X Remix, they're redoing it in like 3D.
787000	792000	So it's a little bit different than the remixed ones I guess on the PSP.
792000	797000	Gator Panic Remix, which is I guess like whack-a-mole.
797000	803000	And then of course you're going to also see in Galaxian, Dig Dug, Mappy, Xevious,
803000	812000	Galpus I guess, I don't know, Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Mania, and QQ.
812000	819000	We'll all have remakes and I guess, oh no the originals.
819000	827000	It's set to release I guess, it says in the fall, August.
827000	836000	As much as I have issues with Namco lately for certain unsaid personal reasons, this
836000	837000	game looks pretty cool.
837000	839000	I can't let that get in the way of the fact that the game does look pretty cool.
839000	843000	And Pac and Roll on the Wii does seem like kind of a natural progression.
843000	845000	And I'm a sucker for these retro things.
845000	846000	What can I say?
846000	850000	I'm just such a fucking sucker for this crap and this looks kind of neat.
850000	857000	Yeah, and unfortunately it's going to be the only rolling game this year on the Wii, this
857000	858000	year.
858000	865000	Oh, you mean any other rolling games that people might have been thinking about, perhaps
865000	868000	they will see instead in 2008, is that what you're saying?
868000	869000	Maybe.
869000	871000	Oh, okay, I see, alright.
871000	875000	What other types, I've never heard of other rolling games, oh you're talking about Kororimpa
875000	876000	2 of course, right?
876000	877000	Of course.
877000	878000	Of course.
878000	880000	So, Sakura, I know you're a Namco fan.
880000	882520	Are you excited about this Namco museum remix?
882520	888580	You have, now, freaking, I know on the Playstation you take great pride, a little too much pride
888580	892800	in the fact that you have the NAMCO and trademark CDs, right?
892800	899380	No, I'm actually missing the, I think I'm missing the A, which is the one I want because
899380	900500	it has Super Pac-Man.
900500	902360	Your collection fails at life.
902360	907000	Well, they're really hard to find, although I can get the trademark one easy.
907000	911800	But, okay, so, are you excited about this whole remix thing on the Wii, I mean, is this
911800	915960	something that should be remixed or should Namco games be untouched and preserved in
915960	916960	a bubble forever?
916960	922800	Well, given that I was picking up the Sega Aegis 2900, and you know what those are, they're
922800	926760	all the touched up, redone versions of the old Sega games, then I have absolutely no
926760	927760	problem with this.
927760	935040	I would love to see D3 release all the Simple 2000 series over here.
935040	939800	Actually, there have been a few titles from the Simple 2000 series that snuck over.
939800	944240	They just, of course, are different titles, and, you know.
944240	947920	Bandit says, bring me Burger Time now, and Ross Steele has to remind Bandit that Burger
947920	950120	Time is by Data East, so it won't be an image.
950120	951120	I missed Data East.
951120	952120	I can has Burger Time now?
952120	953120	Huh?
953120	954120	I can has Burger Time now?
954120	955520	What the hell ever happened to Data East?
955520	956520	Are they still around?
956520	957520	They're doing pinball.
957520	959760	They should remake Breakthrough.
959760	962240	That was one of my first Nintendo games, and I loved it.
962240	966640	Okay, while we do our next segment, I'm going to research what happened to Data East.
966640	970480	I'm sure someone in chat wants to ruin it for me, but I'm not going to pay attention
970480	971480	to them for me.
971480	972480	That's my guess.
972480	973480	Bring me into triangle.
973480	974480	I'm going to do the research on my own.
974480	976840	All right, so we'll do our next segment in the meantime.
976840	978840	Speaking of internet, things we love to do.
978840	983680	Dark Sakura loves to look at the internet up and down and all over every week, and share
983680	985400	her favorite website with you.
985400	988920	So it's Dark Sakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right
988920	993640	now.
993640	998360	I decided not to do website of the week, sorry, no really.
998360	1005880	This is one that was suggested by our very own Loki, and it's fucking addicting.
1005880	1010600	It's Dofi blog, and let me see if I can read what this says.
1010600	1017660	Oh, it just says Dofi blog in Hiragana, I'm sorry.
1017660	1019400	It's a bunch of Flash games.
1019400	1020400	It's really crazy.
1020400	1029880	I've been playing Cat with Bo Golf, which is crazy, and there's also Stick Remover and
1029880	1038600	Double Wires, Egg Way, San San San, X Snow Cats, Neko Breakout, War of the Hell, Slug
1038600	1048160	Slayer, rolling Omosubi, and a bunch of other weirdo games involving cats.
1048160	1055120	I highly recommend X Snow Cats, that one's fun.
1055120	1062520	Egg Way is kind of retarded, and gets really weird, and then Double Wires is kind of neat.
1062520	1068240	It's almost like a stick Spiderman, and you have to navigate your way across the screen.
1068240	1081960	The website is ishi.blog2.fc2.com, and you can get to everything from there, ishi.blog2.fc2.com.
1081960	1084440	Which you have conveniently posted in chat for our listeners, I see.
1084440	1085440	Of course I have.
1085440	1090960	Thank you, DarkSakura, upstanding citizen.
1090960	1095760	Moving on, Data East, I looked them up on Wikipedia to figure out what went on.
1095760	1101400	They went under on June 25, 2003, is when they filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court,
1101400	1106280	and their intellectual properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, who's a Japanese
1106280	1110760	mobile game content provider, which explains how we have burger time on cell phones, because
1110760	1112960	I have seen that game in recent years.
1112960	1117200	So maybe you'll see bad dudes in a few years on phones, I don't know.
1117200	1119920	Are you a bad enough dude to have a milkshake?
1119920	1124440	But Data East went under, they did have a brief stint in pinball, and they did some
1124440	1133360	pretty good tables, Guns N' Roses, The Simpsons, Robocop, and they purchased Stern Electronics,
1133360	1138560	and then something changed and they made Stern Pinball, I think, and then they sold it all
1138560	1139560	to Sega.
1139560	1146600	No, no, no, no, no, no, Stern is their own company.
1146600	1150880	In fact, Stern is the company that released the Pirates of the Caribbean pinball a couple
1150880	1155400	months ago, and I think they also released the Family Guy pinball.
1155400	1157640	Okay, I get it, I see.
1157640	1163000	Data East exited the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 96, and the USA
1163000	1167720	division had already been transferred to Sega as part of a debt settlement, and then the
1167720	1171400	pinball factory changed hands one more time with Gary Stern purchasing the factory in
1171400	1174040	99 and renaming it Stern Pinball.
1174040	1175520	So there you go, that's what happened.
1175520	1177640	And Stern is still giving us our pinball.
1177640	1179640	There you go.
1179640	1181240	But unfortunately no more Data East.
1181240	1184640	No more Kid Nicky Radical Ninja, I'm sorry to say.
1184640	1188560	No more Bump N' Jump kids, or Ring King.
1188560	1190240	I know, Bump N' Jump was rad.
1190240	1195360	Anyway, but you do get plenty of Super Smash Brothers Brawl because that wasn't by Data
1195360	1199160	East, that's by people completely different, and of course that is one of the most anticipated
1199160	1204720	games coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and Loki, guess what, Loki, you're gonna love
1204720	1207040	this news, Loki.
1207040	1213160	Joo France, who is a Nintendo in France, they report on stuff.
1213160	1217760	They have reported that the Japanese gaming magazine Game Lab has given word that Super
1217760	1224640	Smash Brothers Brawl will have Tingle in it, your favorite Nintendo character of all time,
1224640	1225640	Tingle.
1225640	1226640	Boo.
1226640	1228320	From the Zelda series, of course.
1228320	1234600	Tingle is the, he's every fairy's fairy, let's just put it that way, and he goes around
1234600	1236720	spilling rupees and good times.
1236720	1241200	I remember he was in the Four Swords game on GameCube, good times.
1241200	1244560	So that would be great if Tingle shows up in the game.
1244560	1247760	Has not been confirmed by Nintendo, it's still a rumor, but that would be pretty awesome
1247760	1249880	if Tingle showed up in the game.
1249880	1254200	If nothing else but to drop power-ups in, because, you know, it doesn't necessarily
1254200	1258160	mean that Tingle is a character, could be that Tingle, you know, because, like, remember
1258160	1262600	how like Pokemon showed up, like the Pokeballs would show up in the old one on GameCube,
1262600	1266760	and you could just throw the Pokeballs and you had random, like, you know, like, what
1266760	1271560	were some of the Pokemon that showed up randomly, like the Charizard and stuff would blow fire
1271560	1272820	or whatever.
1272820	1274040	So there you go.
1274040	1277760	And with any luck, maybe Loki is secretly recording the voice of Tingle as we speak
1277760	1278760	for this upcoming game.
1278760	1281560	I am not recording the voice for Tingle.
1281560	1282560	God.
1282560	1284560	It's horrible.
1284560	1287360	Horrible, horrible.
1287360	1296440	Apparently now, if you're flying Delta Air, you can check out some free demos for the
1296440	1303320	DS, because now they have DS demo stations right there while you're waiting in line.
1303320	1309960	And some demos you'll be able to try out, Brain Age, Cooking Mama, Elite Beat Agents,
1309960	1310960	and Tomb Raider Legend.
1310960	1314120	Of course, all those are free.
1314120	1318360	Um, isn't this all the same shit that's in there usual?
1318360	1320360	I want to see yes.
1320360	1321360	Alright.
1321360	1326280	So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, but this isn't much incentive to fly Delta, because
1326280	1329720	if you think about it, like the Delta terminals are always right across from the airline you're
1329720	1333680	really flying, so, you know, you're within range of the Nintendo kiosk, right?
1333680	1336360	So you don't necessarily have to fly Delta.
1336360	1337360	True.
1337360	1341280	Unless you're in a place like the Sacramento Airport, where like Southwest dominates an
1341280	1344800	entire wing of the airport and there's no Delta to be seen anywhere.
1344800	1348920	I don't know, maybe that's just me.
1348920	1350920	Moving right along.
1350920	1358840	Well, there is some good news for our friends in Europe, is that Final Fantasy VI Advance
1358840	1362760	will be released on June 29th.
1362760	1367140	It has, you know, I've actually got the game, although to be honest I have yet to play it.
1367140	1377560	You have the Soul Shrine that gives you a bunch of monsters to beat up and a Kaiser
1377560	1385640	Dragon boss and a music player, but other than that it's the same game, except that
1385640	1387280	you have no Vanish X-Zone.
1387280	1390920	Oh, they took X-Zone out of the game?
1390920	1391920	No.
1391920	1392920	You have no Vanish X-Zone.
1392920	1393920	Oh, the trick.
1393920	1394920	The combo.
1394920	1395920	Okay, yeah, yeah.
1395920	1396920	No Vanish X-Zone.
1396920	1399280	What was the Vanish X-Zone combo?
1399280	1406240	If you cast, what happens if you cast Vanish, is that it makes the enemies disappear, but
1406240	1411000	it makes them I think vulnerable to all magic attacks, and then X-Zone sends them to another
1411000	1412000	dimension.
1412000	1413000	So basically it ends the battle.
1413000	1414000	X-Zone was like an insta-kill.
1414000	1417280	X-Zone was an insta-kill, but it didn't always work.
1417280	1420640	But if you used Vanish on the enemy first, it would always work.
1420640	1422520	So interesting.
1422520	1426280	I always used to just like casting reflect on all my characters and then just bouncing
1426280	1428320	the spells off there, even though I don't know if it did anything.
1428320	1433000	It was just nice to see lightning hit four times or whatever.
1433000	1434000	Good times.
1434000	1437320	Drunami would like to point out that Vanish Doom will also work.
1437320	1438600	The Vanish Doom combo.
1438600	1442520	I like, but still my favorite attack though in that entire game was Meteor, just because
1442520	1444000	it looks cool.
1444000	1445560	I never used the Vanish X-Zone CD.
1445560	1449340	I actually thought X-Zone was kind of a dumb spell, just because, I don't know, I like
1449340	1453080	to kill in the old-fashioned way, by the hand of my sword.
1453080	1454080	Ultima?
1454080	1455080	Yeah, or spamming Ultima.
1455080	1462000	Well, the other thing though that I really, okay, what was, in the Final Fantasy games
1462000	1465920	overall, what would you say is your one most useful spell?
1465920	1466920	Oh my.
1466920	1467920	That isn't Cure.
1467920	1470920	Yeah, I was just going to say Cure.
1470920	1471920	Curaga?
1471920	1472920	That isn't in the family of Cure.
1472920	1473920	Protect.
1473920	1479000	Oh, no, I rarely use Protect, unless it's Fantasy XI.
1479000	1484600	The number one spell I would use, Fire III, I guess.
1484600	1488280	Oh, where it has their MP every time?
1488280	1493120	No, Demi quarters their HP every time.
1493120	1494440	Oh, yeah, quarters their HP.
1494440	1500920	No, Demi I thought was- Demi was a HP attack, and you had cast Demi III, and it was even
1500920	1502200	more than that.
1502200	1503200	75%.
1503200	1504200	Yeah.
1504200	1505200	What was the MP?
1505200	1506680	And it would work on big enemies.
1506680	1509120	There was one for MP.
1509120	1514040	I don't remember.
1514040	1517200	I didn't care about their MP as long as I could kill them before they hit me.
1517200	1518200	No.
1518200	1520800	JVMON says Demi and Bio for me.
1520800	1521920	Bio was the other one.
1521920	1524600	I love Bio, but Demi was like my big pro.
1524600	1529440	Virus in IV was pretty rad, because it made that hideous noise whenever you cast it.
1529440	1533920	It sounded like cats getting hit, and it sounded like cats in a burlap bag being hit with a
1533920	1537120	bat when you cast Virus on the enemy.
1537120	1540480	I just like the chainsaw.
1540480	1541480	That was rad.
1541480	1545200	That's why I love VI, was that you did the little commands with, what was it, Sabin was
1545200	1546200	his name, right?
1546200	1547760	No, that was Edgar, I think.
1547760	1552520	No, Edgar had the chainsaw, but Sabin had the ones where you did the Street Fighter
1552520	1553880	stuff and he did special moves.
1553880	1555280	That was so rad.
1555280	1556280	He was really cool.
1556280	1557280	God damn, that game was great.
1557280	1558280	They're going to remake that.
1558280	1559320	That'd be awesome if they do.
1559320	1560320	I don't know.
1560320	1561920	I'm still, I don't know.
1561920	1564280	Don't mess with something that ain't broken, right?
1564280	1568160	I don't know, but I am curious to check out this Final Fantasy VI advance.
1568160	1569720	I know, I need to buy the advance one.
1569720	1570720	It's awesome.
1570720	1571720	All right.
1571720	1577920	Hey, Gsuck68 in chat says, Demi sucks, especially against most stronger enemies since they're
1577920	1580880	immune to it.
1580880	1582680	Not if you make them not immune to it.
1582680	1586400	RasteelUT says, Virus equals bio, translations.
1586400	1590680	I thought it was Virus and 4 and then bio in the later games.
1590680	1595280	Maybe it was translations, I don't know, but it still made the dying cat noise.
1595280	1598240	If you love Final Fantasy, then you must have this in your collection.
1598240	1601280	You can get a Chocobo Magic Book mug.
1601280	1606880	Yes, of course, NCSX, now I don't know how you guys feel about this company, NCSX.
1606880	1608480	Do you use them, Dark Sakura?
1608480	1609480	Oh, yeah.
1609480	1610480	NCSX is great.
1610480	1611480	Okay.
1611480	1613760	I wasn't, oh no, it's BuyRight is the one you hate, but they went under, right?
1613760	1615160	Oh, hell yes.
1615160	1622880	Okay, so NCSX, N-C-X-X, God damn it, N-C-S-X, live radio, is a place where you can buy these
1622880	1628680	mugs for $18 a piece, these Chocobo mugs, and damn, they look cute.
1628680	1629680	Look at that.
1629680	1630680	Look at those little Chocobo mugs.
1630680	1631680	Don't they look cute?
1631680	1632680	It reminds me of my- I thought you'd eat your Batsmaru one.
1632680	1636840	I know, my Batsmaru mug, which I do use once in a while for coffee for my Hello Kitty coffee
1636840	1638840	maker.
1638840	1640560	Maybe I should get a Chocobo mug to go along with this.
1640560	1641640	You should get me one too.
1641640	1642640	Cute coffee mugs are awesome.
1642640	1643640	Second drink out of a bird's head.
1643640	1647160	Maybe I'm going to go on a shopping spree at NCSX any day now.
1647160	1648160	I might have to think about that.
1648160	1650280	You can buy the handheld beat manias too.
1650280	1651400	Why should I buy a present for you?
1651400	1652400	What have you done for me?
1652400	1654320	What haven't I done for you?
1654320	1655320	A lot.
1655320	1656320	Oh.
1656320	1659040	What have you done for me lately?
1659040	1665720	Anyways, like most of those promo deals out there, there's a new one now to give a Wii
1665720	1668240	for free.
1668240	1672800	The way you do it is Gamefly, they're running a promotion where you persuade five of your
1672800	1678200	friends to sign up, and in return, they'll send you a free Wii six weeks later.
1678200	1681080	What people are doing is having their friends sign up, giving them like 10 bucks each to
1681080	1688800	do that, and then canceling it after a set amount of time, and there you go, free Wii
1688800	1689800	for 50 bucks.
1689800	1691400	I did that for an iPod.
1691400	1693160	So yeah, it's kind of like that scheme.
1693160	1699520	Of course, my guesses are going to catch on to this pretty quick, and they will change
1699520	1701520	something.
1701520	1703160	That shit really works, huh?
1703160	1706080	Like we can get the free Xboxes, because I keep hearing this commercial on the radio
1706080	1714600	for the free Xbox, and I'm always like, oh, schemes are so reek of shenanigans, but they
1714600	1715600	really work, huh?
1715600	1717200	I'll tell you how I did mine.
1717200	1719480	They had this Blockbuster online thing.
1719480	1725840	It was like Netflix, but Blockbuster, so it sucked, and if you sign up, they don't charge
1725840	1733660	you for like two weeks during their trial, right, but it takes six days for them to transfer
1733660	1738840	to the iPod site that you signed up for, so you cancel before they charge your credit
1738840	1744800	card, and so me and five people did that, and I got a iPod, and then my iPod broke.
1744800	1745800	So you got a cheap iPod.
1745800	1746800	You got a reaper.
1746800	1749880	I got one of the third edition iPods that they had the recall on.
1749880	1751360	Ah, it sucks.
1751360	1757320	All right, well, another scheme, of course, here on this program is our mailbag, and the
1757320	1761560	joke is you can interact with us every week on our program by sending us emails to mailbag
1761560	1765360	at orangesloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura likes to jump in there and pull out a few
1765360	1768960	of her favorites and read them to you here live on air.
1768960	1778400	So let's open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we got in this week's mailbag.
1778400	1781880	The first email comes from a French nun.
1781880	1788880	It says, Bonjour, DarkSakura, and please pardon my bad pronunciation because I am way, way
1788880	1789880	out of practice.
1789880	1792720	Christ, are all our emails actually in French this week?
1792720	1793720	No, they're not.
1793720	1794720	No, they're not.
1794720	1795720	I was like, did they actually listen to you?
1795720	1803000	It says, Vous avez une tres bevoir et j'adore vous entendre à la radio orange.
1803000	1805120	Okay, yeah, I'm really good.
1805120	1809640	Basically said I had a really good voice, and they like listening to the show.
1809640	1810720	So I have a general comment.
1810720	1813200	I find your show a little Xbox 360 heavy.
1813200	1818440	While I understand that there is little to talk about in the PS3 world, my PS3 is accumulating
1818440	1822800	dust extremely effectively, I'd love to hear you chat, argue, fight about other platforms
1822800	1827600	such as DSPSP, cell phone games, and insert obscure platform here.
1827600	1829000	Yeah, the CDI.
1829000	1830000	Oh my God.
1830000	1831000	Anyway.
1831000	1832000	We did, didn't we?
1832000	1833000	Yeah.
1833000	1834000	Listen to part A this week.
1834000	1838280	It's like nothing but non-Xbox 360 stuff.
1838280	1842280	I tuned in to hear about stuff I know nothing about, and to be honest, I buy games you guys
1842280	1843280	recommend.
1843280	1846880	So talk about as many platforms as possible, fair enough, and then I'm going to translate
1846880	1847880	this.
1847880	1848880	Thank you, Sakura.
1848880	1849880	Thank you.
1849880	1850880	Okay.
1850880	1855400	I'm still, my reading is not so bad.
1855400	1861680	And good luck with the new massage profession.
1861680	1868600	And this is a French Canadian listener who demands that we speak in French more.
1868600	1871600	That's all I know.
1871600	1872600	Anyway.
1872600	1875600	Parlez vous, freeze pop.
1875600	1886640	Thank you very much for the well wishes, and I'm actually going to be going, when I go
1886640	1891860	back to school, I'm actually planning on, I took a whole bunch of French, and I used
1891860	1896600	to be fairly conversational, so I'm going to go back and finish learning.
1896600	1904000	And Robert M., I'm sorry, but this made me crack up, Poisson to Babble, for Babblefish.
1904000	1905880	Are you going on to another email?
1905880	1907440	Can I respond to the last one real quick?
1907440	1908440	Please.
1908440	1909440	Sorry.
1909440	1911840	Oh, the Rob D. in chat says, OLR should cover the Sega CD more.
1911840	1912840	Maybe we should.
1912840	1913840	I don't know.
1913840	1914840	No, I just want to say about the Xbox 360 thing.
1914840	1919160	You got to realize, though, what platform has something coming out every week on it
1919160	1920800	with the Xbox Live Arcade?
1920800	1922080	There is the Xbox 360.
1922080	1924600	It's kind of got the most steam when it comes to game releases right now.
1924600	1925600	Let's face it.
1925600	1927080	We're in a lull right now when it comes to the Wii.
1927080	1931840	Yeah, we had Super Mario RPG, but there's really been no A-list titles since then or
1931840	1933080	really anywhere near it.
1933080	1934200	There was just that one.
1934200	1938040	And then the PlayStation 3, well, you said yourself, your system's gathering dust.
1938040	1942400	So I think that's why the show feels a little Xbox 360 heavy right now is because there's
1942400	1944000	a little bit more to talk about there.
1944000	1946040	But trust me, we're fans of all the systems.
1946040	1948200	We don't want to be partial.
1948200	1952280	We realize that if you do want Xbox 360 only content, there's other podcasts out there
1952280	1953280	that'll give it to you.
1953280	1956960	There's plenty of indie ones out there that are great that really focus on the Xbox.
1956960	1961160	We do want to talk a little bit about everything, but when the news is Xbox heavy, our show's
1961160	1962720	going to be Xbox heavy.
1962720	1966440	But on a week like this where Sony had their gamer's day, part A was pretty much nothing
1966440	1967440	but Sony.
1967440	1968440	So we try.
1968440	1969440	We try.
1969440	1975240	But if you have a game you want us to talk about, email it and we'll talk about it.
1975240	1976240	What is that?
1976240	1977240	A taco.
1977240	1978240	Oh, that's okay.
1978240	1979840	People are always offering us tacos.
1979840	1981400	Why aren't you on the show this week?
1981400	1983400	I'll take the stuff inside of it.
1983400	1990320	Because I got back too late and I'm better than you guys.
1990320	1991960	I'll take the stuff inside the taco.
1991960	1992960	Here you go.
1992960	1993960	Just start digging.
1993960	1995320	Do you have a fork?
1995320	1996760	I do not, but I can go get you one.
1996760	1999480	How was your gaming week real quick?
1999480	2002400	I played a lot of Oh Andon 2 and I've already beaten it.
2002400	2003400	I'm done.
2003400	2004400	Oh shit.
2004400	2005400	Nobody even mentions it.
2005400	2007680	I'm so sorry to interrupt your mailbag, but we need to hear about Oh Andon 2.
2007680	2009880	How is it?
2009880	2016320	Let me first stress that I'm not a Japanophile in the least.
2016320	2017720	So I don't care about J-pop.
2017720	2021460	I don't like J-pop, but I like these games.
2021460	2030000	So the music for me is sorely lacking, but it's harder than Oh Andon 1 and it doesn't
2030000	2032560	quite have the same charm as the first game.
2032560	2035600	Either Oh Andon 1 or Elite Beat Agents.
2035600	2036600	But I like it.
2036600	2040620	I would still say Elite Beat Agents is my favorite of the three, but Oh Andon 2 is better
2040620	2042920	than Oh Andon 1 and I like that.
2042920	2043920	It's really hard.
2043920	2047080	Did they change anything with the basic game mechanics or not really?
2047080	2051720	No, but they brought over the cool features from Elite Beat Agents where you can skip
2051720	2059280	the intro and the last stage is actually divided into two songs and oddly enough, you can skip
2059280	2062120	the endings for each songs now too, once you've beaten them.
2062120	2063720	So it's kind of weird.
2063720	2067240	Like if you're just replaying to get a better score.
2067240	2068720	And it's good.
2068720	2070280	And I've been playing Puzzle Quest also.
2070280	2071280	Oh, how's that?
2071280	2072280	I love it.
2072280	2074040	I want to try that out before you leave.
2074040	2075040	Okay.
2075040	2076440	Well, I'm leaving like sometime tomorrow.
2076440	2077440	Okay.
2077440	2078440	Good.
2078440	2080880	And I have a terrible backlog of DS games now.
2080880	2085320	I have like six that I need to play or beat and it's depressing because I keep finding
2085320	2086320	more I want.
2086320	2088400	How hard was it to find a copy of Puzzle Quest?
2088400	2089960	It was hard for me at the time.
2089960	2090960	I found it last weekend.
2090960	2097120	I found one at Best Buy, but I went to like EB and Best Buy this week and yeah, it's not
2097120	2098120	hard anymore.
2098120	2099120	Oh, okay.
2099120	2100120	Good.
2100120	2102720	So they finally put out enough so people can get that if they want.
2102720	2104520	Well, thank you Mikoltov.
2104520	2105520	You're welcome.
2105520	2106520	All right.
2106520	2107520	And can you get her napkins for her taco?
2107520	2108520	Actually, I'm going to eat it.
2108520	2109520	Okay.
2109520	2110520	You're just going to eat the taco?
2110520	2111520	Yeah.
2111520	2112520	It's delicious.
2112520	2113520	I'm going to start back tomorrow.
2113520	2114520	Well, no.
2114520	2115520	Good job, Shayne.
2115520	2116520	Ruining diets everywhere.
2116520	2120920	No, I've been good all day, but I think my headache is because I had so much sugar for
2120920	2124320	two days and then like dropped all of it.
2124320	2125840	So I need a buffer.
2125840	2127400	Jamie, you're a good looking gal.
2127400	2128400	Just eat the taco.
2128400	2130400	You don't have to worry about that stuff.
2130400	2131400	Yes, I do.
2131400	2132400	The chatters.
2132400	2133640	Jamie needs some love.
2133640	2134880	Tell her she has nice boobies or something.
2134880	2135880	I don't.
2135880	2141040	No, I don't because I figured I dropped 80, right?
2141040	2142040	Right.
2142040	2144720	And then I gained back 15.
2144720	2148480	So I'm going to be going back to the gym and everything because I still have a little bit
2148480	2149480	more to go.
2149480	2150480	I need to lose some too.
2150480	2151480	I'm starting to get a little bit.
2151480	2152480	Go to the gym with me.
2152480	2153480	We'll see.
2153480	2154480	Okay.
2154480	2155480	We'll see.
2155480	2156480	Oh, God.
2156480	2157480	Loki just did the most foul thing with his belly.
2157480	2158480	That was disgusting.
2158480	2159480	He shook it.
2159480	2160480	Oh, my God.
2160480	2161480	That was weird.
2161480	2162480	All right.
2162480	2164960	Anyhow, sorry, mailbag.
2164960	2165960	Okay.
2165960	2166960	Yeah.
2166960	2169160	Robert M., you're funny.
2169160	2170160	And by the way, there was not.
2170160	2171160	Look at chat.
2171160	2172160	Look at chat.
2172160	2173160	What?
2173160	2174160	There's Jamie Love.
2174160	2176400	Look at that.
2176400	2177400	That's why you do this show, right?
2177400	2178400	For your ego.
2178400	2179880	I'm not starving myself.
2179880	2180880	She's not, but.
2180880	2181880	I eat.
2181880	2182880	I'm not eating.
2182880	2183880	No, no, no, no.
2183880	2184880	Okay.
2184880	2191000	What I want to tell you guys is that diabetes, there's a tendency toward it in my family.
2191000	2195920	And it's not a matter of aesthetics or anything like that.
2195920	2198720	It's a matter of preventing disease on the way.
2198720	2201440	Jamie, that taco's not going to give you diabetes.
2201440	2202440	I know, but I'm.
2202440	2203440	Your mic isn't on.
2203440	2204440	Say the joke again.
2204440	2208720	It'll give you something else that starts with a D.
2208720	2211240	No, no.
2211240	2216160	The whole reason being is that I'm cutting back on my sugars because my blood sugar actually
2216160	2219120	was fairly borderline at my last blood test.
2219120	2221800	So I'm trying to avoid diabetes.
2221800	2223400	And that is the reason why.
2223400	2224400	All right.
2224400	2225400	All right.
2225400	2228440	Sorry to get on the tangent and get all depressing here on the program.
2228440	2231800	That and exercise is supposed to actually help with chronic fatigue syndrome because
2231800	2234960	I'm also trying to get myself off my meds.
2234960	2235960	Just eat the fucking taco.
2235960	2236960	I will after I'm done doing the fucking email.
2236960	2237960	Oh my God.
2237960	2240960	I'd eat it, but I don't like Mexican food.
2240960	2243240	So you know, that's just kind of weird.
2243240	2244240	Email.
2244240	2245640	Bite my ass.
2245640	2249880	And no, there was not a home release of dragon flare on laser desk.
2249880	2252000	Okay.
2252000	2253000	Was that the email?
2253000	2254000	Yes.
2254000	2255000	That was from.
2255000	2256800	You didn't even read the poor guy's email.
2256800	2258680	You just yelled at it.
2258680	2262320	It wasn't in really bad grammar.
2262320	2263320	He said so himself.
2263320	2264320	He's babble fish.
2264320	2265320	I'm sorry.
2265320	2266320	Plus song to babble.
2266320	2267320	Anyway.
2267320	2269320	Next email.
2269320	2271080	Hey dark Sakura, Loki in sky.
2271080	2272080	Wait, wait.
2272080	2273080	Time out.
2273080	2278640	Um, GZ, DR for Evie, dude, those boobs.
2278640	2280520	One of those nipples is a fucking comma.
2280520	2282180	So what are you trying to say?
2282180	2284600	One of her nipples is fucked up looking.
2284600	2286000	Sorry.
2286000	2287000	Derail the whole show.
2287000	2288000	What was that?
2288000	2289000	I hope that wasn't about my boobs.
2289000	2296560	He was making asking nipples and apparently one of your boobs is leaking because I used
2296560	2300080	a comma instead of a dot.
2300080	2303040	That's that's how come no one draws my boobs in chat.
2303040	2304040	Yeah.
2304040	2305040	That's lactating.
2305040	2306040	Boob.
2306040	2307040	Can I read the email?
2307040	2308040	Yes.
2308040	2309040	Thank you.
2309040	2310040	Sorry guys.
2310040	2311040	In the other room.
2311040	2318080	Um, dark Sakura to add the Monday on email and for say don't to uh, no, okay, whatever.
2318080	2319080	Okay.
2319080	2320080	I asked for an email in French.
2320080	2321920	Therefore I'm getting an email in French.
2321920	2324040	Um, and he loves our podcast.
2324040	2326720	So my friend just gotten really rusty, but I tried anyway.
2326720	2328040	I wanted to know a couple of things.
2328040	2331240	One, what is the deal with nights on the, we, is it still happening and when?
2331240	2332240	Um, yeah.
2332240	2333280	I don't know.
2333280	2337240	And what SNES RPG needs a DS remake the most?
2337240	2343920	And I'm going to say, um, Rob, second Densetsu three, but I want them to put out mother three
2343920	2344920	in America.
2344920	2348520	JVMON drew my boobs bigger than yours.
2348520	2351080	You have special pumped up boobs.
2351080	2354680	My nipples are the size of like dollars.
2354680	2357800	Nights um, I don't know.
2357800	2359680	It's more of a Christmas game for me, I think.
2359680	2360680	Oh really?
2360680	2363960	Because it has that kind of night Christmas, didn't they have Christmas nights?
2363960	2364960	Yeah.
2364960	2365960	Yeah.
2365960	2366960	It's, it's more of a Christmas game for me.
2366960	2367960	You think?
2367960	2368960	I think.
2368960	2369960	Yeah.
2369960	2370960	I think nights could be around Christmas.
2370960	2371960	Yeah.
2371960	2372960	They should release a Christmas nights as well.
2372960	2373960	Okay.
2373960	2375720	Well, um, I don't know if I've told, well, I've mentioned this several times.
2375720	2380440	Um, Christmas nights is actually, um, a, uh, a tradition at my house.
2380440	2383800	We break out the Saturn and we play Christmas nights up until Christmas day.
2383800	2384800	Nerd.
2384800	2387280	What was the other part of the question?
2387280	2388760	Games that should be redone or something?
2388760	2391120	Um, RPGs that should be released for the DS.
2391120	2393600	RPGs that should be released for the DS.
2393600	2394600	Guardian legend.
2394600	2395600	Okay.
2395600	2396600	Maybe that was an RPG.
2396600	2398840	Well, it's, it's, it's still a game that I want.
2398840	2400400	It's an adventure shooter.
2400400	2401400	Close enough.
2401400	2402960	I just want the guardian legend love.
2402960	2407680	Um, and I want to stop whining.
2407680	2413800	Um, how about the illusion of Gaia series or the whole, uh, Enix like soul blazer.
2413800	2414800	What was it?
2414800	2415800	Um, soul blazer.
2415800	2418720	Oh my God, Shane, this is a good taco.
2418720	2419720	Yes.
2419720	2422760	And illusion of Gaia and there was a third one, brain Lord.
2422760	2423760	That's the other one.
2423760	2424760	Brain Lord.
2424760	2425760	I want that whole series on DS.
2425760	2426760	Okay.
2426760	2427760	Next email.
2427760	2428760	Yes.
2428760	2430960	Unless you had anyone that you wanted to seek him out.
2430960	2431960	Huh?
2431960	2433800	What RPG would you like to see come out for the DS?
2433800	2434800	Taco the RPG.
2434800	2436800	For the DS?
2436800	2439400	Uh, remake, remake.
2439400	2441360	Super Mario RPG.
2441360	2444240	Where the fuck is my game?
2444240	2446560	Taco.
2446560	2450520	Jiranami says it was not brain Lord, it was Terra Nigma.
2450520	2451520	Next up.
2451520	2452520	Um, okay.
2452520	2458440	With the Xbox 360 keyboard, do you think World of Warcraft will come to the 360?
2458440	2459440	Why or why not?
2459440	2460440	Um, no.
2460440	2461440	And you don't need to know why.
2461440	2463220	No, I'm kidding.
2463220	2464220	That's from Daniel.
2464220	2466560	I kid you not.
2466560	2473960	Every time the, the video rep comes down to our work, we ask them that same question.
2473960	2476640	Is World of Warcraft coming to the 360?
2476640	2481820	And every time he says it's never coming to the 360 ever, probably because he hates us
2481820	2483360	asking him that question.
2483360	2485000	I don't think it's happening either.
2485000	2489720	I think Blizzard, if they're going to do something on the consoles, they will make a game specifically
2489720	2490720	for consoles.
2490720	2492560	I don't think they're going to port their game.
2492560	2493560	They don't really need to.
2493560	2495400	I mean, everybody has a computer.
2495400	2498040	People that don't even play PC games play World of Warcraft.
2498040	2499040	Okay.
2499040	2503080	You're only seeing games that are ported to that when they need more users.
2503080	2508000	World of Warcraft is not really having any trouble with not a large enough user base.
2508000	2513200	I mean, Blizzard probably figures if you have an Xbox 360, you also probably have a computer
2513200	2514680	capable of playing World of Warcraft.
2514680	2515680	Yeah.
2515680	2518400	And also, I mean, World of Warcraft runs on almost anything.
2518400	2523500	I mean, as far as like, you know, Linux, Mac OS, you know, Windows.
2523500	2528880	So it's not like it's a graphically intensive game.
2528880	2529880	Right.
2529880	2534160	And, uh, the last email, oh my God, Rob, I'm so sorry.
2534160	2535160	What?
2535160	2536160	Oh, the chat?
2536160	2539880	I just got unbanned from- I'm just ignoring the chat now.
2539880	2541880	This is from SacraMax.
2541880	2544080	I just got unbanned from Orange Lounge.
2544080	2547740	Remember to plug that if you haven't, and I want to say, screw you, Rob Jamie is cooler
2547740	2548740	than you.
2548740	2549740	I hate you.
2549740	2554420	I'm not even going to respond to it.
2554420	2557600	But I think that the thing is, the signature is the funny part.
2557600	2561480	Whoops, Rob gets eaten by a grew youngest OLR member, wishes World of Warcraft would
2561480	2565680	work on his computer, Pocky lover and Vietnamese otaku, hell yeah.
2565680	2566680	Whatever.
2566680	2567680	Okay.
2567680	2568680	Rob, heart.
2568680	2569680	Yeah, whatever.
2569680	2570680	All right.
2570680	2571680	Is that all the emails?
2571680	2572680	Yes.
2572680	2573680	All right.
2573680	2576480	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
2576480	2578760	How about some Rob fan mail next week?
2578760	2579760	After that email.
2579760	2583120	I want some Rob fan mail that Jamie has to read word for word on the air.
2583120	2586840	Rob fan mail in French.
2586840	2587840	Or in Spanish or something.
2587840	2590240	How about a language Jamie doesn't know that I know a little bit of?
2590240	2591240	How about Spanish?
2591240	2594400	I want Spanish love for me.
2594400	2596600	No love for Loki ever.
2596600	2597800	What?
2597800	2599720	Moving on to, yeah, that's right.
2599720	2603200	Moving on to another story talking about Nintendo.
2603200	2606760	Nintendo is following up a contest in some ways.
2606760	2611480	Microsoft just recently said that they would like original TV pilots because something
2611480	2614080	that they're going to distribute on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2614080	2618120	Well, now Nintendo has come out and said they're going to be holding this contest called the
2618120	2620760	Shortcut Shortcase.
2620760	2624640	The top three entries will be premiered at Rockefeller Center's annual summer film
2624640	2625640	showcase.
2625640	2626640	Shortcase?
2626640	2627640	I'm thinking of shortcake.
2627640	2629920	I must be hungry.
2629920	2631440	The theme is Nintendo.
2631440	2637560	The movies can be action, comedy, drama, whatever, as long as it has Nintendo hardware or Nintendo
2637560	2638560	characters.
2638560	2639920	There you have it.
2639920	2643520	The first place winner gets 10 grand and a trip to New York for the premiere and a lunch
2643520	2649400	meeting with the Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatcoff.
2649400	2652440	The top three entries all get Nintendo goodies.
2652440	2658720	You have until June 6th to get it together, so there's already a lot of Nintendo fanboy
2658720	2662540	stuff on YouTube, so this shouldn't be too hard for most people.
2662540	2671280	Get crackin' if you want to be a famous filmmaker.
2671280	2677840	One person that's not going to be featured in an upcoming live action Metal Gear Solid
2677840	2681400	movie would unfortunately be the voice of Snake David Hayter.
2681400	2685560	He will not have anything to do with the movie Fangirls Cry.
2685560	2690640	That makes me sad.
2690640	2697200	Basically they were asking him what his thoughts were on it and he's basically saying they're
2697200	2703640	taking Metal Gear as an apocalypse now of the digital age or something like that.
2703640	2704640	I don't know.
2704640	2709400	Hopefully it's not going to suck, but after looking at his headshot here I can see why
2709400	2715720	they don't want to go with him for Snake right now because man, the dude needs a haircut.
2715720	2716720	He looks like Joey Fatone.
2716720	2718560	That snake was running around with a mullet.
2718560	2729320	He looks like he's about ready to join a ren fair.
2729320	2731680	Snake was running around Metal Gear Solid 2 with a mullet.
2731680	2741200	Yeah, but he has guns and he's not a real special op guy, so I don't know, whatever.
2741200	2752660	Speaking of whatever, there's a next generation Wolfenstein in the works and they're stating
2752660	2757400	that it should be actually out in 2008.
2757400	2762420	It's being put out by Raven, so that's happy.
2762420	2766280	Will it be like the old school Wolfenstein 3D or the more met Castle Wolfenstein game
2766280	2767280	that came out later?
2767280	2768280	What was that called?
2768280	2769280	Return to Wolfenstein or whatever that game was?
2769280	2770280	Return to Castle Wolfenstein?
2770280	2771760	Yeah, I didn't care for that one.
2771760	2774720	Oh my gosh, Shane, this was the best taco.
2774720	2782280	It was more like one of those war sim games.
2782280	2785600	I just liked being able to shoot up Hitler and the war mech.
2785600	2787680	That was awesome in the old school 3D game.
2787680	2788680	Remember that?
2788680	2789680	Forget it.
2789680	2800260	Speaking of things of a questionable nature, there was a Flash game created about the Virginia
2800260	2801260	Tech rampage.
2801260	2803440	It was a Flash game.
2803440	2807440	This game was created by this guy, Ryan Lamborn.
2807440	2808440	This is interesting.
2808440	2815120	Basically, he made a Flash game that kind of glamorized the whole Virginia Tech shooting.
2815120	2817480	You could take part in it, whatever.
2817480	2822480	Obviously, this is very controversial, but what's interesting is what this author chose
2822480	2827840	to do in response to it, quote, Attention angry people, I will take this game down from
2827840	2831880	Newgrounds if the donation amount reaches $1,000 US.
2831880	2836760	I'll take it down from here if it reaches $2,000 US, and I will apologize if it reaches
2836760	2837760	$3,000 US.
2837760	2843560	Of course, he never really says what the donations will go to besides his pocket.
2843560	2849540	I believe Newgrounds ended up taking the damn thing down anyway, but kind of interesting
2849540	2852040	that he kind of blackmailed the internet to take this game down.
2852040	2857400	He also said that he was joking about the whole wanting to collect money.
2857400	2860160	Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't really take it that way.
2860160	2861160	He did.
2861160	2862160	Later, there was an update.
2862160	2865660	The donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game
2865660	2866660	down.
2866660	2869500	I didn't think anyone would donate money to it, and so far, my PayPal account has proven
2869500	2870500	me right.
2870500	2871500	I don't know.
2871500	2873840	That seems like an afterthought excuse, doesn't it?
2873840	2874840	Yeah.
2874840	2878960	He's just probably thinking, well, maybe some dumb sucker will... If it was a joke, he
2878960	2881760	would have probably not put his PayPal account on there.
2881760	2883480	What a weirdo.
2883480	2884960	Who cares?
2884960	2886960	It's just some dumb ass trying to get attention just like...
2886960	2891320	I'm all for freedom of speech and all, but I don't know, and in a way, the media just
2891320	2894040	shouldn't even cover it, and that's really what it should be.
2894040	2897560	If you don't want this guy to make any money off it, don't fucking cover it so people don't
2897560	2898560	know about it.
2898560	2901360	I don't think anybody would have found it otherwise.
2901360	2904640	Media should take some responsibility, even the gaming blogs and stuff.
2904640	2906680	Don't fucking cover it if it's in poor taste.
2906680	2907680	Don't write about it.
2907680	2910080	I probably shouldn't even... God, I'm being a hypocrite right now.
2910080	2913220	I probably shouldn't have said anything about it, but it sounds like the game's already
2913220	2914220	down.
2914220	2916000	That's what I'm going off of, so whatever.
2916000	2921920	We come full circle to talking about GameTap again and what they're doing correct.
2921920	2924800	This is actually very cool.
2924800	2930840	GameTap has announced that they're doing an animated series called Revisioned, and what
2930840	2941720	it basically is, each season is going to focus on basically a game series or a game character.
2941720	2946600	For example, the first series that's up is Tomb Raider, and it's also going to be animated
2946600	2952040	by Warren Ellis, Peter Chung, and Jim Lee, to give you an idea.
2952040	2953040	That's cool.
2953040	2959000	It's basically Animatrix, but for games, so it's yet another original thing that they're
2959000	2960000	actually doing.
2960000	2961000	It's going to be pretty awesome.
2961000	2965520	I'd like to see some DVDs for this because that might be something worth checking out.
2965520	2971800	I want to see what they do beyond Tomb Raider, though, because that'd be pretty cool.
2971800	2974440	Doesn't GameTap have some type of deal with Tomb Raider right now?
2974440	2976960	There's going to be a Tomb Raider thing, a special edition thing?
2976960	2978240	There's a ton of stuff coming out of there.
2978240	2981040	I'm not feeling the Tomb Raider love, I'm sorry to say.
2981040	2982040	Oh well.
2982040	2983040	Whatever.
2983040	2984840	If that's what they want to do, I guess.
2984840	2986480	I never even saw the movies, ever.
2986480	2990360	Although if you're interested in checking out to see what it's going to look like, they
2990360	2996520	are going to have a little bit on the Tomb Raider GameTap collection website.
2996520	2998960	It's TombRader.GameTap.com.
2998960	3004120	You can check out a trailer for this new cartoon series.
3004120	3005120	Let's see.
3005120	3007240	Ross Steel in chat says, animated series on GameTap.
3007240	3010160	Oh God, it's Captain N all over again.
3010160	3014040	It Stun says, I think Tomb Raider Legend was going to be sold cheap on GameTap, if not
3014040	3015040	free.
3015040	3016040	All right.
3016040	3018560	That's why we love having a chat nearby.
3018560	3020240	They always like to correct us when we're wrong.
3020240	3021640	Tap.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3021640	3025600	If you don't want to do it by chat, well, shit, you can always call us.
3025600	3031160	You can call us 1-877-GAME-OLR and I'm pleased to say the Skype line is open.
3031160	3035400	You need to pick up the phone and call us at that number 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can give
3035400	3036520	us a call on Skype.
3036520	3038920	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3038920	3044320	All one word because the nice thing about that is that the 1-877 is a toll free number
3044320	3046280	but only in the US and Canada.
3046280	3050400	If you use the Skype line instead, you can be anywhere in the world and still call us
3050400	3051400	for free.
3051400	3053040	All right.
3053040	3057040	Let's go to the phones and we'll take this call right here.
3057040	3058920	Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3058920	3059920	Who's this?
3059920	3060920	Hi, DMN.
3060920	3061920	What do you want?
3061920	3065960	Oh, I'm so glad.
3065960	3067440	It's really you this week.
3067440	3068440	What's up?
3068440	3070440	Yeah, I'm glad to.
3070440	3072920	I'm out of impersonations right now.
3072920	3079680	However, I'm calling on behalf of DJ Tyrant to say one thing and if you'll excuse me,
3079680	3083680	I'll put the phone away from my mouse because I don't want everyone's speakers to explode.
3083680	3084680	One second.
3084680	3085680	Okay.
3085680	3086680	StarCraft 2!
3086680	3087680	Oh my God!
3087680	3088680	Okay.
3088680	3091720	Now we've gotten that out of the way.
3091720	3095000	Why is DJ Tyrant so excited about StarCraft 2?
3095000	3098720	DJ Tyrant is OLR's resident Blizzard fanboy.
3098720	3099720	Yeah.
3099720	3100720	Just real quick.
3100720	3101720	Sorry.
3101720	3102720	I'm sorry to interrupt real quick.
3102720	3105800	I'm just going to come back to that Tomb Raider animated series thing.
3105800	3111240	It's being animated and written by the guy that did Aeon Flux.
3111240	3112240	So that's pretty awesome.
3112240	3114160	Suddenly this has scored a lot of cool points in my book.
3114160	3115160	Yes.
3115160	3116160	Interesting.
3116160	3117160	Maybe I'll like Tomb Raider.
3117160	3118160	Now I may actually watch the first ten seconds.
3118160	3119160	Oh wait.
3119160	3120160	This is the first five.
3120160	3121160	It's coming July 10th.
3121160	3122160	That's when the series is starting.
3122160	3123160	Thank you.
3123160	3124160	So OMG!
3124160	3125160	StarCraft 2!
3125160	3126160	Well, what about you?
3126160	3129640	What are you feeling about StarCraft 2?
3129640	3137240	I've played StarCraft a little bit in my youth almost ten years ago.
3137240	3139760	Not a huge fan of the real-time strategy genre.
3139760	3140760	Yeah.
3140760	3141760	You know, that's my problem.
3141760	3145160	I never really played StarCraft because I wasn't a fan of the real-time strategy series.
3145160	3149200	I'll tell you, if this announcement had been Diablo 3, I would have had a total fan-gasm.
3149200	3151200	Yeah.
3151200	3152720	I think you and I both would have.
3152720	3157200	I love Diablo, but seeing as the announcement was happening in Korea, I think everyone did
3157200	3158200	their math.
3158200	3162200	2 plus 2 equals 5 and all that stuff.
3162200	3166880	But I'm also calling to announce the Phoenix Down usage on SDFU.
3166880	3170640	Okay, what's this all about?
3170640	3174440	We put our show on hiatus, one, because I've been going through a lot of personal turmoil
3174440	3180240	and now that's kind of subsiding and I feel my crazy, normal self.
3180240	3182640	We're revamping the format of SDFU.
3182640	3188840	For any people who were introduced to my antics in the chat room earlier last year, you know
3188840	3191840	I used to do a little around the horn thing and I scored people's arguments.
3191840	3195480	Well, now we're turning it into a show.
3195480	3202560	DJ Tyrant and three chatters from OLR's chat room will face each other off each week and
3202560	3206840	the winner gets to finish the show with me.
3206840	3211080	So wait, now I know you have a lot of special guests that come on, like you've had some
3211080	3215640	of the Destructoid bloggers on the program and you've had bigger names on your program
3215640	3216960	than we've had on this program.
3216960	3219520	So are you going to invite them to play along with you guys?
3219520	3221160	Oh, absolutely.
3221160	3223200	And I guess you guys can come play, too.
3223200	3225960	Oh, we get to come play DMN's little game, too?
3225960	3226960	Oh, nice.
3226960	3227960	Aww.
3227960	3228960	Aww.
3228960	3229960	Well, maybe I don't want to play your game.
3229960	3230960	I'm just kidding.
3230960	3231960	Well, I'll come on at some point, for sure.
3231960	3233520	I can't speak for the others, but I will.
3233520	3234520	Okay.
3234520	3235520	All right.
3235520	3237900	I can't think of anything else, though.
3237900	3239960	I guess it's time to hang up on me.
3239960	3240960	All right.
3240960	3241960	Bye.
3241960	3242960	All right.
3242960	3243960	Let's go to another call.
3243960	3244960	I really did hang up on him, by the way.
3244960	3245960	Hi.
3245960	3246960	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3246960	3247960	Who's this?
3247960	3248960	Legend of Zaku.
3248960	3249960	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3249960	3250960	What's up?
3250960	3251960	Fine.
3251960	3252960	Uh, yeah.
3252960	3253960	Just nothing much.
3253960	3261520	I just went in on the break yesterday, played some Distorted, Poppin' 14, Pump It Up Pro.
3261520	3262520	What's wrong with...
3262520	3263520	What's...
3263520	3264520	Wait, wait.
3264520	3266040	What are you booing Pump It Up Pro for over here, Shane?
3266040	3267040	No, I'm not.
3267040	3268040	What?
3268040	3269040	I'm sorry.
3269040	3270040	Sorry.
3270040	3272040	There's a confusion in the studio.
3272040	3273040	Give Shane a mic.
3273040	3274040	Damn it.
3274040	3276360	I said boo Pump It Up Pro.
3276360	3278080	Why boo Pump It Up Pro?
3278080	3283120	Because it's by the guys that do In The Groove, and the step charts suck from what I've seen.
3283120	3284120	Oh, I see.
3284120	3285120	That one.
3285120	3286120	Yeah.
3286120	3287120	And it's got crap music.
3287120	3288120	It's all right, though.
3288120	3289120	Okay.
3289120	3290120	Think about it.
3290120	3291120	It's like In The Groove.
3291120	3292120	It's already bad.
3292120	3293120	It's already Pump It Up having a love child.
3293120	3294120	Shane, put it down for a minute.
3294120	3295120	You're obviously biased.
3295120	3296120	I want to hear Zaku's opinion.
3296120	3297120	What?
3297120	3298120	No, I mean, I played it.
3298120	3300320	It pretty much is step mania.
3300320	3305360	It's like End of Mural found step mania and found a good use for it, and just mashed Cold
3305360	3308680	War songs in addition to their banya and K-pop.
3308680	3311560	So Pump It Up and In The Groove had sex, and this is their baby.
3311560	3312560	Yeah.
3312560	3315280	You pretty much have modifiers that you would normally find in step mania.
3315280	3321520	Mines, C400, Speed.
3321520	3323440	It plays pretty much better.
3323440	3328960	Since 8 on the Breakout, the high end cabinet for beta testing, so that's a nice high def
3328960	3330500	TV to go with it.
3330500	3334000	You know, I was talking with Kyle on email last month trying to get him on the show,
3334000	3335000	and we just lost...
3335000	3336680	I need to email him again and try to get him on the show.
3336680	3338680	I'd love to have him and Shane on the same show.
3338680	3339680	That would be a good time.
3339680	3341360	I doubt he'll be able to spill the beans.
3341360	3342360	I know.
3342360	3343360	He's pretty tight-lipped.
3343360	3344360	Yeah, it'll still be fun.
3344360	3347480	Anyway, so what else have you been up to in your gaming world lately?
3347480	3353400	Yeah, as I said, not only does 8 on the Breakout Pump It Up for beta testing, but New Jersey,
3353400	3359680	he also has 2DX distorted and Pop'n Music 14.
3359680	3360680	How is that?
3360680	3363640	Pop'n Music 14, Jesus Christ, they keep cranking those things out.
3363640	3365520	I mean, we're catching up to...
3365520	3370240	You know, 8 on the Break's catching up to TGA at this point.
3370240	3373520	So what are you doing, opening a candy bar?
3373520	3376400	No, it's just an oatmeal bar.
3376400	3379140	How is Pop'n Music 14?
3379140	3381220	It's a lot better, though.
3381220	3385280	It's a lot better than the one that I'm used to over in Queens, the one that we, the Pop'n
3385280	3386280	8 that I go to.
3386280	3388280	Do you have a case of the Munchies right now?
3388280	3389280	Almost.
3389280	3390280	I'm not high, though.
3390280	3392840	I'm just a little hungry tonight.
3392840	3398380	Yeah, besides that, just, you know, I just heard, you know, just, you know, pretty up
3398380	3400880	over the whole StarCraft II thing.
3400880	3402440	I've heard about that.
3402440	3403720	Are you excited about StarCraft II?
3403720	3404720	Are you a big RTS fan?
3404720	3409360	Well, it's been, yeah, it's been almost a decade since they actually, you know, it was
3409360	3412760	actually released the first one, so I've been itching to play it.
3412760	3417320	The only thing that'll bother me is if Koreans, you know, the South Koreans start cheating
3417320	3420560	on it and start, you know, bringing it down and battling it.
3420560	3423000	All right, Korea, no cheating.
3423000	3427160	Yeah, that's the only thing I worry about, but if anything, we'll just keep it to a land,
3427160	3430120	you know, we'll just keep it to strictly land games.
3430120	3431120	All right.
3431120	3432960	Like something you can do after work.
3432960	3437240	I still wish it had been Diablo III, though, but hey, I'll give it a try.
3437240	3438760	Blizzard puts out some quality shit.
3438760	3441920	I mean, they, I mean, seriously, what has Blizzard done wrong?
3441920	3443800	They're really, I can't think of a lot, a lot.
3443800	3446800	The only thing they need is World of StarCraft, and that's it, and they're set.
3446800	3448360	I don't know about that.
3448360	3449360	All right.
3449360	3454240	All right, Zaku, we gotta let you go, but have another oatmeal bar for me, buddy.
3454240	3455240	All right.
3455240	3456240	All right.
3456240	3457240	Later.
3457240	3458840	Did he just say whatever to me?
3458840	3461840	I think he did.
3461840	3464320	Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
3464320	3465920	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
3465920	3466920	Who's this?
3466920	3467920	Raven Stalton.
3467920	3468920	Hello, Raven Stalton.
3468920	3471840	What's on your mind, my friend?
3471840	3474800	Let me turn down the thing, and I'll tell you.
3474800	3478960	Yes, rule number one of radio, turn down the speakers when you're gonna be on the program.
3478960	3481240	Oh, we don't get that annoying ass echo.
3481240	3483760	Live radio, boys and girls.
3483760	3485200	I'm sorry about that.
3485200	3490640	I'm glad that you played that old To Go song from OLR, from OLR To Go, and the music break
3490640	3491640	that no one knows about.
3491640	3495000	Yeah, I was gonna say, the podcast listeners have no idea what you're talking about, but
3495000	3499120	we played, during the break, because we do a break between A and B, we play some music.
3499120	3500560	I can play a clip.
3500560	3502440	Playing clips of music is okay on podcasts.
3502440	3504360	Here's a little clip of Gradius, Full Speed.
3504360	3506360	This is our old theme song.
3506360	3516120	That was our old theme music back in the day when we were doing a live show and a separate
3516120	3517120	podcast.
3517120	3518120	That was a good time.
3518120	3520280	Wasn't that good times when we'd be in the studio for like five hours?
3520280	3521280	No.
3521280	3522280	Anyway, sorry.
3522280	3526000	What did you want to say about the song?
3526000	3531720	It just brings back good memories of listening to you go like, OLR To Go, We Cup, whatever,
3531720	3533720	and I'm like, ooh, OLR To Go.
3533720	3534720	Oh, the old song.
3534720	3536160	It's one of those really good memories.
3536160	3538920	Aw, so it's like a retro thing for you.
3538920	3541440	Yeah, and I didn't just call about that.
3541440	3544600	I did call about Fear and Halo 3 beta.
3544600	3545600	What about that?
3545600	3552400	Well, I've been playing a lot of FPSs and Xbox, and I played Fear for the Xbox.
3552400	3553400	I got it from Gamefly.
3553400	3554400	How was that?
3554400	3555400	I thought the game was good.
3555400	3561600	The thing I hate is about the corridors, and everything looks the same when you walk.
3561600	3562600	That's the thing I hate.
3562600	3566640	You always have an hour of looking at it, and then you finally figure it out.
3566640	3567640	That's what I hate about it.
3567640	3574560	My favorite gun is the particle gun, and you get to shoot things, and it turns into skeletons.
3574560	3575600	It's awesome.
3575600	3579880	Do you think that Halo 3 will outsell Halo 2?
3579880	3580880	I do.
3580880	3581880	I do.
3581880	3585280	Because it has my favorite gun, the assault rifle.
3585280	3586680	Just because of the assault rifle?
3586680	3589280	Yeah, just because of the assault rifle.
3589280	3593200	Everyone's been bitching about it on the forum, going, we need the assault rifle!
3593200	3594640	We need the assault rifle!
3594640	3596440	The battle rifle sucks!
3596440	3597440	Alright.
3597440	3601520	Any other quick words here before we get to another call?
3601520	3603800	A Tekken game podcast, that's it.
3603800	3604800	Alright.
3604800	3609400	If you want more of the Raven's Dolphin, he has his own podcast, Tekken Games, check it
3609400	3610400	out.
3610400	3612000	I know he has an OLR community page, too.
3612000	3617020	By the way, I dug up something out of the archive, here's what Raven was referring to.
3617020	3620680	Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, week of July 11th, 2005.
3620680	3626160	You're to be into the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
3626160	3631520	Oh, good times, old school memories, there you go.
3631520	3633480	You don't miss the five hour studio marathons?
3633480	3634480	No, Rob.
3634480	3638120	Well, I would go home literally sick with exhaustion.
3638120	3639120	No.
3639120	3641240	Aren't you glad we're much shorter now?
3641240	3642240	Seriously.
3642240	3643240	Hold on, we picked up another call.
3643240	3644920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3644920	3646800	Hey, it's Dr. Burst.
3646800	3648480	Hey, Dr. Burst!
3648480	3650520	I do not recognize your name as a caller.
3650520	3651520	You a new caller?
3651520	3652520	Yes.
3652520	3653520	Awesome.
3653520	3654520	What's on your mind, buddy?
3654520	3655520	New caller?
3655520	3659520	Yeah, I want to comment on the World of Warcraft on 360.
3659520	3661760	World of Warcraft on 360, a very popular topic.
3661760	3663440	What do you want to say about it?
3663440	3668440	Well, I just think, why not?
3668440	3672080	People want the game and Blizzard makes more money.
3672080	3673720	Why not?
3673720	3675640	But do they make more money?
3675640	3679480	Because again, what about the argument earlier about most people that have an Xbox 360 probably
3679480	3684080	have a computer via PC or Mac that's capable of playing World of Warcraft?
3684080	3691640	Well, I have the computer and I tried the demo for World of Warcraft and it doesn't
3691640	3692640	work that well.
3692640	3693640	Okay.
3693640	3697360	So, I don't know, maybe there's something to be said for the achievement point whores
3697360	3701920	of the world, Loki, that might have fun just playing the game to get achievements from
3701920	3702920	it.
3702920	3703920	Who knows?
3703920	3704920	I don't know.
3704920	3705920	Why not?
3705920	3706920	Anybody else in the room care to comment?
3706920	3707920	Why not while on the 360?
3707920	3712520	I'd actually be for it because it's the same thing they did with Final Fantasy XI.
3712520	3717560	I got on the 360 because my computer, it could run it well enough, but the 360, it's got
3717560	3724320	a set spec for it, so they're putting it on a system knowing that everybody's going to
3724320	3725320	have the same amount of...
3725320	3726320	It's like optimized for 360.
3726320	3728320	Yeah, it's optimized for that.
3728320	3731520	And so, if they did that with World of Warcraft, give me a keyboard and mouse.
3731520	3736100	I like my TV better than I like my computer monitor, so I would do it.
3736100	3740660	And voice chat built in right there too, because you could just do your own little private
3740660	3742080	room with your friends.
3742080	3748200	Rumor is that PC versions getting a voice chat patch, but that's a rumor.
3748200	3753840	Well, the thing is too, you probably couldn't do mods on World of Warcraft for a 360.
3753840	3754840	That's true.
3754840	3755840	Okay, that's true.
3755840	3759000	Yeah, good point is that one thing that PC gamers on their World of Warcraft love are
3759000	3760780	all the mods.
3760780	3765040	You can have the mods for what, Spam Century is a popular mod, or Titan Bar if you want
3765040	3766680	to get really popular, all that stuff.
3766680	3772600	You can't have that on the 360, or could you in downloadable content through Marketplace?
3772600	3775720	I'm not paying for Spam Century.
3775720	3778240	Well, what if Blizzard put out some of the popular ones for free?
3778240	3779640	Do you play WoW right now?
3779640	3781560	You would pay for Spam Century.
3781560	3782560	It's pretty bad.
3782560	3784800	I tried it on a demo.
3784800	3785800	I'm a Guild Wars player.
3785800	3791120	The demo that you downloaded is leading other websites that sell gold to download those
3791120	3793080	demos and spam us.
3793080	3794400	You said you're a Guild War player.
3794400	3797160	Why not Guild Wars on the 360?
3797160	3799440	That too.
3799440	3803840	Because it's instance based and there's so many load screens, it probably wouldn't work
3803840	3805160	that well.
3805160	3810440	Well, WoW has a lot of instances too, especially when you get into Endgame.
3810440	3811440	I think about Final Fantasy XI.
3811440	3814840	Final Fantasy XI had frickin' loading screens every time you went to a new area.
3814840	3817760	That's one of the reasons I like WoW is that it's very seamless.
3817760	3822200	You only really do loading screens when you go into instances or when you go to the other
3822200	3823200	continent.
3823200	3826080	But yeah, I don't know.
3826080	3827080	Tell us a little more.
3827080	3830360	We don't often get new colors, so Dr. Burst, what types of games have you been playing
3830360	3831360	this week?
3831360	3833480	Pretty much Guild Wars.
3833480	3834480	Guild Wars?
3834480	3835480	Yeah.
3835480	3836480	I'm getting back on Guild Wars.
3836480	3837480	Oh.
3837480	3838480	You guys should...
3838480	3839480	You looking for a guild?
3839480	3840480	I've got one.
3840480	3841480	Oh.
3841480	3843800	I've had one like five seconds after I made my account.
3843800	3844800	You guys should go...
3844800	3845800	Well, because you're a really good buddy.
3845800	3846800	I was playing with one of them.
3846800	3847800	Yeah, that's what I thought.
3847800	3849840	Well, you guys can do battle, right?
3849840	3851840	That's what Guild Wars is all about, right?
3851840	3852840	Yeah.
3852840	3853840	Yeah.
3853840	3854840	That's cool.
3854840	3859520	What is the best class in Guild Wars to play?
3859520	3860840	There's not really a best class.
3860840	3861840	Mesmer.
3861840	3864200	I made the doctor as a Mesmer.
3864200	3865200	Yeah, I saw.
3865200	3866200	Mesmers are so fun.
3866200	3867200	Oh, yeah.
3867200	3868200	I kind of like the Mesmers too.
3868200	3869200	I like my ranger.
3869200	3872000	I guess you have to say Mesmers are pretty awesome looking at least.
3872000	3873000	Yeah.
3873000	3874000	They are.
3874000	3875000	There you go.
3875000	3876000	Yeah.
3876000	3877000	That's one thing...
3877000	3878000	You know, that is one thing I really did like about Guild Wars when I was playing it is
3878000	3879000	that the game is extremely balanced.
3879000	3883400	I hate to keep dogging on Final Fantasy XI, we're going to have some angry Final Fantasy
3883400	3887880	XI fans, but the problem with Final Fantasy XI is that some job-sub-jobs combinations
3887880	3889560	just didn't work.
3889560	3892720	If you wanted to be a ranger black mage, good luck fighting a party, right?
3892720	3893720	Right, Miklotov?
3893720	3894720	Right?
3894720	3895720	That was my dream.
3895720	3900600	But the thing about Guild Wars is that every job-sub-job combination kind of makes sense.
3900600	3902920	They kind of built it a little smarter in that regard.
3902920	3906000	So props to Guild Wars for that.
3906000	3909800	I think the most hated class, Warrior Monk, still works.
3909800	3910800	Yeah.
3910800	3911800	Even though...
3911800	3912800	Actually, I think I played a Warrior Monk.
3912800	3914200	I mean, it was like Ghetto Paladin.
3914200	3919080	All right, well, Dr. Burst, thanks so much for the call and have fun in Guild Wars.
3919080	3921360	And if you see Jamie, you know, nuke her for me.
3921360	3922360	Okay.
3922360	3923360	See you.
3923360	3924360	Wait till like M at least a comparable level.
3924360	3925360	All right.
3925360	3926360	Bye.
3926360	3927360	I'm five right now.
3927360	3928360	Bye.
3928360	3929360	Well, keep working.
3929360	3930360	Bye, Dr. Burst.
3930360	3931360	Take care.
3931360	3932360	All right.
3932360	3933360	I love new collars.
3933360	3934360	Don't you love new collars?
3934360	3935360	For dinner.
3935360	3938880	I'm going to find the old collars because I like the old collars too, but it's nice
3938880	3940260	to get some new blood in once in a while.
3940260	3941260	For dinner.
3941260	3942260	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
3942260	3943260	Who's this?
3943260	3944260	All right.
3944260	3945260	I love new collars.
3945260	3946260	Hi.
3946260	3947260	It's Kane.
3947260	3948260	Hi, Kane.
3948260	3949260	What's on your mind?
3949260	3950660	I can hear myself a little bit, so just make sure you turn down your speakers.
3950660	3951960	We hear Rob all the time.
3951960	3952960	I know.
3952960	3953960	It's too much of me on this phone.
3953960	3954960	We should turn down our speakers.
3954960	3955960	I know.
3955960	3956960	Maybe I'll just...
3956960	3957960	I'm putting down my ears.
3957960	3958960	Okay.
3958960	3959960	That's fine.
3959960	3960960	Screw you all.
3960960	3961960	I will be quiet for this entire phone call.
3961960	3962960	I got to pee anyway.
3962960	3963960	You guys talk to the caller.
3963960	3965960	You talk to the caller, it's fine.
3965960	3966960	I know.
3966960	3967960	It's too much of me.
3967960	3968960	Rob, come here and fix it.
3968960	3969960	That's better.
3969960	3970960	I'm sorry.
3970960	3971960	Anyways.
3971960	3972960	Okay.
3972960	3973960	Now we can hear you.
3973960	3976360	I just wanted to talk about the whole console thing with the WoW.
3976360	3983280	Yeah, it would probably be better for most users, but honestly, who wants to pay that
3983280	3989120	extra money just because you have to pay for the subscription and the Xbox Live?
3989120	3992240	People do it for PSU.
3992240	3994040	And they're idiots because PSU sucks.
3994040	3995040	Yes, it does.
3995040	3996040	Oh my God.
3996040	3998040	I played that game for two days and canceled it.
3998040	3999040	Hey, hey.
3999040	4000360	I'm a fantasy star fanboy.
4000360	4001360	Leave it alone.
4001360	4002880	You know, PSO was great.
4002880	4003880	PSU is terrible.
4003880	4004880	PSO was awesome.
4004880	4005880	Yeah.
4005880	4007080	I played Blue Burst, though.
4007080	4011120	If you're worried about paying an extra fee to play on Xbox Live, do it the smart way
4011120	4012440	and pay for a year.
4012440	4014160	Then you're not going to really worry about it anymore.
4014160	4019440	You're not going to be thinking, oh, I'm paying this on top of my Xbox Live fee.
4019440	4020440	It really works out nice.
4020440	4021440	Well, yeah.
4021440	4023760	You've got the Xbox Live anyway, right?
4023760	4024760	Who me?
4024760	4025760	No.
4025760	4026760	Well, I mean, if you're...
4026760	4027760	Well, you don't...
4027760	4029560	Well, if you've got the silver...
4029560	4033160	You got silver, and they made Final Fantasy XI, if I remember right.
4033160	4035220	If you have silver, you could play it online.
4035220	4037080	Why couldn't they do that with WoW also?
4037080	4038080	Owned.
4038080	4039680	That's what it is.
4039680	4041680	I don't know if they will.
4041680	4048560	Well, at any rate, I don't think that it's that good of an idea because, I mean, World
4048560	4054200	of Warcraft already is, they don't even have any type of controller support on it for PC,
4054200	4057680	so I think that it would be very interesting to see how they'd map something like that
4057680	4058680	over.
4058680	4063720	Yeah, they're probably going to really, really screw up on it when they do.
4063720	4066920	I'm not going to hold my breath on it.
4066920	4069160	You'll never know until it happens.
4069160	4070160	That is true.
4070160	4071160	Mm-hmm.
4071160	4074680	And Rob spent the entire time not in this room.
4074680	4076420	Oh, that's cool.
4076420	4079040	I was playing that stick figure game.
4079040	4081040	I'm here now!
4081040	4083040	And I'm going to break Rob's head.
4083040	4085760	Rob and Loki yell.
4085760	4086760	Okay.
4086760	4091440	Did this guy just threaten to break my head?
4091440	4092440	That's okay.
4092440	4093440	I will break you.
4093440	4095800	Don't break my head.
4095800	4096800	That's not nice.
4096800	4097800	All right.
4097800	4098800	What?
4098800	4099800	For that, you get hung up on.
4099800	4100800	Aww.
4100800	4101800	Thanks for calling.
4101800	4102800	All right.
4102800	4106560	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4106560	4108960	Hi, this is Chainsaw Juggling.
4108960	4109960	Chainsaw!
4109960	4111440	Wait, what is his name?
4111440	4112440	Chainsaw Juggling.
4112440	4118480	Yeah, I just wanted to say I have the new issue of games for Windows, and they have
4118480	4121600	it confirmed that voice chat is coming.
4121600	4122600	Voice chat is coming.
4122600	4124000	So if you don't want that.
4124000	4127880	Thank God we don't have to buy Event now, because our guild was seriously thinking about
4127880	4128880	getting Event.
4128880	4131040	And dear God, I can hear myself echoing.
4131040	4133000	Am I really that loud?
4133000	4134000	Yes, Rob, you are.
4134000	4136120	Actually, because you have the speakers up right now.
4136120	4137120	Oh, maybe that's why.
4137120	4138120	Okay, I'll back up a little bit.
4138120	4139480	So, oh, that's cool.
4139480	4140760	So they confirmed that for the next patch.
4140760	4141760	That's good.
4141760	4142760	So did they say about how long?
4142760	4143760	Yeah.
4143760	4148760	Well, it's saying it's coming after the next patch, and then also that what they're
4148760	4152080	going to try and do is make it so that the person's talking their name, like, so that
4152080	4156440	you can click on it and then heal that person or trade with them.
4156440	4158440	Huh, that's kind of cool.
4158440	4164880	Wait, so wait, it's gonna be voice chat, even not in parties, like in the barons, everybody
4164880	4165880	could have voice chat.
4165880	4166880	That could be horrible.
4166880	4170440	I think it's supposed to be more than a party.
4170440	4174040	Because I don't want to be walking through the barons and then suddenly some asshole
4174040	4176200	comes on with a Chuck Norris joke on the speakers.
4176200	4177200	That would kind of ruin the game.
4177200	4180600	That would probably be one of the worst things ever.
4180600	4182400	Or make it better.
4182400	4184040	Loki says we'll make it better.
4184040	4185040	All right.
4185040	4188880	Chainsaw, Juggling, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4188880	4191760	They're adding guild bank.
4191760	4193400	They're adding what?
4193400	4194800	A guild bank.
4194800	4195800	A guild bank?
4195800	4196800	Oh, that's kind of cool.
4196800	4198840	So like the entire guild can share one bank?
4198840	4204360	Yeah, and it's supposed to be set up so certain members can only access certain items within
4204360	4206160	the bank.
4206160	4208080	That's kind of cool, because some people are doing that already, right?
4208080	4210560	Like they'll set up a dummy character that the guild members can log into.
4210560	4213760	I'm going to let nobody have access to our stuff but me.
4213760	4215320	You're a jerk.
4215320	4216320	All right.
4216320	4217720	Hey, come join our guild if you're a wild player.
4217720	4218720	We need more people.
4218720	4220720	Yeah, I got to start over again.
4220720	4223480	I'm having a lot of time, but I'll do it.
4223480	4224480	What?
4224480	4225480	It takes like an hour to get to 10.
4225480	4226480	Come on.
4226480	4227480	Yeah.
4227480	4228480	We're a casual guild.
4228480	4229480	We don't want a lot of time from you.
4229480	4230480	That's right.
4230480	4231480	We just tell dick and fart jokes.
4231480	4232480	No, we don't.
4232480	4234680	It took me about a year and a half to get 40.
4234680	4235680	Oh, snap.
4235680	4236680	That's...
4236680	4237680	Oh, he's a player like me.
4237680	4238680	Yeah.
4238680	4239680	He's a player like me.
4239680	4240680	That's still cool.
4240680	4241680	All right.
4241680	4242680	You can still come join us.
4242680	4247640	We'll call and chase out Juglin and we'll hopefully have you in the wild guild at some
4247640	4248640	point.
4248640	4249640	All right.
4249640	4250640	See you guys.
4250640	4251640	Have a good night.
4251640	4252640	All right.
4252640	4253640	See you.
4253640	4254640	Thanks.
4254640	4255640	You too.
4255640	4256640	Lots of noobs tonight.
4256640	4257640	This is an interesting change here.
4257640	4258640	Let's do one more call.
4258640	4259640	Hi.
4259640	4260640	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4260640	4261640	Who's this?
4261640	4262640	Hey, it's Ron.
4262640	4263640	What's up, everyone?
4263640	4264640	Hi, Rama.
4264640	4265640	How you doing?
4265640	4266640	Good.
4266640	4267640	Are you all ready?
4267640	4268640	For Fauna Mae?
4268640	4269640	Hell, yeah.
4269640	4270640	I'm actually very excited.
4270640	4271640	Are you excited, Darksucker?
4271640	4276880	I'm going to find a sewing machine to put my... I actually got the skirt for my Jessica
4276880	4283000	costume, but it might not happen, so I'm going to focus on the ninja costume and do that
4283000	4284000	one.
4284000	4289480	That's cool, because if I knew enough people on the West Coast, I bet you a dollar one
4289480	4292160	of them would be bringing their sewing machine to the con.
4292160	4293160	Probably.
4293160	4294720	I mean, you'll probably have that anyway.
4294720	4299720	Well, the only problem being is that I actually need the red ponytail wig and I cannot find
4299720	4300720	one.
4300720	4305360	I have, though, a long red wig that I'm thinking about just sort of pulling back into a ponytail
4305360	4306360	and faking it.
4306360	4311360	Well, if you want, I can do some last minute wig shopping for you, if you like.
4311360	4313200	If it's not too expensive.
4313200	4315760	I've been hunting one down like crazy.
4315760	4317160	I can't find anything.
4317160	4320520	Well, I know a couple of nice spots.
4320520	4323440	I'll check them out on my way to work this week, because I just have to pick up a couple
4323440	4324440	of stuff.
4324440	4325440	You are so my hero.
4325440	4326440	I try.
4326440	4330640	Anything you want to share with the listeners, besides Rama and Jamie talked to each other
4330640	4332240	about private things hour.
4332240	4333240	Cosplay!
4333240	4334240	Well, I...
4334240	4339360	I missed the first half hour, so I don't know if you guys pimped out that you guys are going
4339360	4340760	to be at Fond of May this year.
4340760	4343560	Yes, we mentioned, because we're not going to have a live show on Sunday because of it,
4343560	4346800	so yeah, we definitely pimped the fact that we're going to be at Fond of May 2 p.m. Saturday.
4346800	4351200	Just a reminder for those who may not have heard Part A yet, we're not going to be live
4351200	4356240	next week, because we are going to be live at Fond of May on Saturday, taping.
4356240	4360200	Now, are we still down for Part A?
4360200	4361560	I believe so.
4361560	4364520	I don't think Loki's going to be there, but the rest of us can have some fun.
4364520	4366960	I don't know if it's going to be an official podcast.
4366960	4371880	We're thinking of having it be a special show for live journal MySpace, like our fan communities.
4371880	4375520	So basically, anybody that wants it can get it, but it won't be a part of the official
4375520	4376520	podcast.
4376520	4378520	Okay, because I like rum and Cokes.
4378520	4380160	We'll see what we can come up with.
4380160	4383520	Why don't I bring my Patrón from my last year's birthday?
4383520	4385800	Ooh, that's expensive stuff, girl, don't bring that.
4385800	4388800	I've been drinking some of it, but I can't drink all that tequila by myself.
4388800	4390040	You know me in tequila.
4390040	4391040	You know me in tequila.
4391040	4392040	We don't get along.
4392040	4393040	So you'll be drinking it by yourself.
4393040	4395040	Even good tequila makes me go crazy.
4395040	4396040	Give me a bottle of Malibu.
4396040	4397040	We're good.
4397040	4398600	Rob, let's put in some money for some Grey Goose.
4398600	4399600	All right.
4399600	4401600	Oh, I got five on that.
4401600	4402600	All right.
4402600	4404560	Rama, anything else besides liquor chat?
4404560	4406760	Just about it.
4406760	4407760	All right.
4407760	4410080	See you next week, Rama.
4410080	4411480	Next week, give me See You Friday.
4411480	4412480	Fuck, that's right.
4412480	4413480	See You Friday.
4413480	4414480	Hell yeah.
4414480	4415480	Later.
4415480	4416480	Later.
4416480	4417480	All right.
4417480	4418800	Ooh, do we even have a meetup planned for him at the con?
4418800	4422400	Oh, no, I've got to figure out where I'm going to park my car overnight and all that crazy
4422400	4423400	stuff.
4423400	4424400	I decided I'm not going to go.
4424400	4425400	You're not going to Fonomay?
4425400	4426400	No, it's my birthday weekend.
4426400	4429200	Why would I spend it with people I'm just going to make fun of?
4429200	4430200	I'd do that anyway.
4430200	4431200	I'm not going to pay to get into that.
4431200	4432440	What are you going to do for your birthday?
4432440	4433440	Your birthday's Wednesday, right?
4433440	4434440	Yeah.
4434440	4435440	Happy birthday.
4435440	4436440	I'm going to-
4436440	4438440	How old are you going to be, 30?
4438440	4439440	12.
4439440	4440440	I'm going to be 12.
4440440	4441840	You're going to be 30, 12?
4441840	4443400	I'm not going to be 30, 12.
4443400	4445920	I'm going to be 24, and it's terrible.
4445920	4446920	So I'm actually going to go 22.
4446920	4450280	I'm going to go down a year, at least this year.
4450280	4455280	Maybe next year, I'll go back up to 23, but no, I don't have any plans yet, but in the
4455280	4461600	hopes that I come up with something better than going to the anime, I'm going to ditch
4461600	4468160	it because I didn't have fun last year, really, so it's not my thing, but I want to buy stuff
4468160	4472040	like Power Ranger things because I know they have them there.
4472040	4475720	Mr. Wendell is in chat right now saying, Rob, at least you're not Jahi.
4475720	4478760	Oh God, I would kill to have Jahi on the Friday thing.
4478760	4480280	Oh my God, no.
4480280	4484480	You don't- do you know the story about Jahi and Tequila?
4484480	4485480	Probably really funny.
4485480	4489720	He threw up so bad at Iguana Girl's apartment.
4489720	4491920	I love Jahi.
4491920	4493520	He's one of my favorite people ever.
4493520	4494520	He's just-
4494520	4495520	And Wendell didn't.
4495520	4496520	He completely swore off-
4496520	4497520	Oh God, and I love Wendell, too.
4497520	4498520	I'm so excited to see everybody.
4498520	4501580	Wendell, didn't he completely swear off Tequila because of this?
4501580	4506200	I'm not going to embarrass him over the air, especially since I don't know if he's listening
4506200	4509560	or not, but oh my God, I heard the story.
4509560	4512040	It was monumental.
4512040	4514840	I'm so excited to drink with all my friends.
4514840	4515840	I miss Jahi.
4515840	4520340	You know, I randomly ran into Jahi one time when Kristen and I were in San Francisco.
4520340	4522880	If he's not on the show somehow, I'm going to cry.
4522880	4526080	Jahi has to be on our party podcast.
4526080	4530200	Okay, remember back in the day when we would do our live events?
4530200	4532660	We broadcasted all day from one of the tournaments.
4532660	4534880	We did the Sacramento DDR tournament at Scandi.
4534880	4538760	I remember we broadcasted all day on the live stream, like eight hours of tournament coverage,
4538760	4539760	right?
4539760	4543760	Okay, seriously, during one part of the program, we just gave Jahi the mic, and for like an
4543760	4549680	hour, he just spun off these random, insane badlings.
4549680	4554840	It was incredible, riveting radio, and yeah, we really probably should wrap up the show
4554840	4555840	now, huh?
4555840	4556840	Because now we're starting to talk about stuff that-
4556840	4557840	Yeah.
4557840	4558840	Like all these personal-
4558840	4559840	Afterbirth FTW.
4559840	4560840	All right.
4560840	4562160	So anyway, we're going to wrap it up.
4562160	4567440	So any last minute stories in studio, folks?
4567440	4568740	I like beer.
4568740	4573200	I'm a level 11 wizard on Puzzle Quest, because it's really awesome.
4573200	4575200	But you're not a nerd at all.
4575200	4577160	Dude, I just like playing the-
4577160	4582120	Lucky, what the fuck is that you're playing?
4582120	4585080	I'm playing Stick Remover.
4585080	4586080	Sounds exciting.
4586080	4588760	It's on the Zoffy blog, the same one that had the cat golf thing.
4588760	4589760	Oh, okay.
4589760	4590760	That's a good story.
4590760	4591760	Any last minute stories, Loki?
4591760	4595440	Well, here's a few things.
4595440	4596880	You can get free game.
4596880	4599640	They just posted something on Kotaku about it called Echoes.
4599640	4603480	It looks kind of like Geometry Wars and Asteroids, so that's pretty cool.
4603480	4607160	So check that out.
4607160	4610680	King of Fighters is being made into a live action movie.
4610680	4611880	Dear God, no.
4611880	4615360	It's being directed by Gordon Chan, a guy from Hong Kong who-
4615360	4617000	Okay, then maybe it'll be cool.
4617000	4621320	It's spawned other Asian martial arts flicks, like The Medallion, starring Jackie Chan,
4621320	4625720	Fist of Fury, starring Jet Li, and let's see-
4625720	4629520	Okay, then I have a little bit of hope.
4629520	4638520	Also it looks like AXIS Entertainment's Joseph Cho, Appleseed, ex Machina, and let's see,
4638520	4646980	Convergence Entertainment's Tim Kwok of Wicked City, I guess, will handle the production.
4646980	4652160	Sounds like it'll be out in Asia early 2008.
4652160	4657440	And then also one game that's going to be coming out as well for 2008, Winning Eleven
4657440	4665800	2008, and Konami, apparently this is coming from Game Wave, a print magazine in Germany,
4665800	4671360	and it says it'll be released on multiple platforms, even on the PlayStation 3, improved
4671360	4676880	animations, more realistic and change-dribbling animations, one-on-one tackles and offside
4676880	4682920	traps will have better results, better online service, no lag, and full HD support with
4682920	4683920	18GB storage.
4683920	4689400	So I guess you could dump the game onto the hard drive.
4689400	4695360	Nice.
4695360	4696640	Looks like that's pretty much it.
4696640	4703480	Oh, and Microsoft is asking gamers for Xbox Live Arcade game ideas.
4703480	4708240	Laser Cats the Game, dude I'm so going to suggest that.
4708240	4714320	I demand the OL Army to mobilize to this thread and request Laser Cats the Games, where is
4714320	4715320	this at?
4715320	4716320	Is that on the Gamerscore blog, wasn't it?
4716320	4717320	I don't remember where it was.
4717320	4718320	Major Nelson's site-
4718320	4722080	Also, Activision wants your input for the next Spider-Man game.
4722080	4723680	How about Don't Suck?
4723680	4728240	How about Don't Make Another One?
4728240	4729240	That's it.
4729240	4731680	How about be able to set Kirsten Dunst on fire?
4731680	4734440	That would be great!
4734440	4737640	I want Kill Gwen Stacy the game.
4737640	4740800	Would Special Supplement kill MJ?
4740800	4743440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the evening.
4743440	4746940	Loki, since you have the mic right now, your final thought.
4746940	4753280	My final thought is I want to play more Earth Defense Force.
4753280	4757160	Miek Latov, thanks for piping in for the last part of the show here, even though you've
4757160	4759240	been playing Puzzle Quest the whole time.
4759240	4760240	We will still give you an opportunity-
4760240	4761920	Hey, I talked while you were in the bathroom.
4761920	4762920	All right, fine.
4762920	4764480	Give your final thought.
4764480	4768240	I really like that YouTube video of the little kid getting kicked in the face by the Breakdancer,
4768240	4770880	because I've been watching it a whole lot.
4770880	4771880	Good times, good times.
4771880	4774120	I think I have no heart.
4774120	4778040	On some really wrong LiveJournal community, I won't mention that I watch once in a while,
4778040	4782560	there was a picture of that and it just said, Bay-bality.
4782560	4785640	That's stupid, because it didn't turn somebody into a baby.
4785640	4786640	Keep the baby in the head.
4786640	4787640	It was funny.
4787640	4790960	Then there was a Street Fighter one too, where they made it look like he did a little flash
4790960	4794840	kick and it said, Guile, and then the baby... I'm going to show it to you, maybe during
4794840	4795840	the afterbirth.
4795840	4803680	Real quick, I was going to say, there is a funny thing that... This is on HMV, I guess.
4803680	4808920	They're advertising their Manhunt 2, since it's coming out later this summer.
4808920	4813120	They're adding in that little sticker on it, it says, Jack Thompson becomes angry, but
4813120	4818400	then again, he's always, and then it has the date.
4818400	4822400	It just occurred something to me, that I think part of the reason why, even though it's just
4822400	4827260	to get his face all over everything, I think that lawyers are required to do a certain
4827260	4832640	number of hours of things that are for the public good.
4832640	4835640	You know what I mean?
4835640	4841120	Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it, but they're supposed... I think that that might be his
4841120	4843120	consideration.
4843120	4847680	Well, he's still a twat.
4847680	4848680	He is.
4848680	4849680	All right, anyway.
4849680	4852000	He's got a yeast infection or something.
4852000	4855680	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
4855680	4857960	Pay me.
4857960	4864200	My final thought is, reject false icons, since Dark Soccer never says it anymore, and why
4864200	4865640	don't you ever say that anymore?
4865640	4867160	It makes me a little sad.
4867160	4868160	Reject false icons, Rob.
4868160	4869520	All right, thank you.
4869520	4875900	My other final thought would be, both here.
4875900	4876900	Have a great week.
