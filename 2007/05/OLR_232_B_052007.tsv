19878	20919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
48766	51346	We're going to talk a little more about some of the other consoles.
51446	54047	And, of course, we need to start with the Xbox.
54127	58568	Because huge news this week with Halo 3, of course, finally getting its beta.
59168	60368	A little bit delayed.
60688	63549	I mean, what, about 13 hours before the folks on Crackdown could get in there?
64129	69230	Although Bungie said, okay, because, you know, we made a boo-boo in getting you guys in when we said we would.
69250	70830	We're going to extend the beta for four days.
70950	71390	Hooray.
71930	73690	And you shouldn't bitch about things that are free anyway.
74130	77551	Well, the beta was followed up immediately with the news that
78436	82920	When Halo 3 is going to come out in Fall 2007, they mean September 25th, 2007.
83220	89486	And for those of you guys in Europe that feel like you always get screwed, you have to wait one day.
90066	92048	September 26th for you guys in Europe.
92108	94890	So you guys finally not having to wait as long.
94910	102937	So September 2007, which I... May I point out that September 26th will be occurring at the same time as September 25th here.
104473	105694	There's an eight-hour time difference.
105714	106134	That's right.
106394	106794	Good point.
106854	108295	At least between here and London time.
108435	108855	That's right.
108915	111176	So basically it's a simultaneous release.
112016	112716	Not what?
112796	114777	It's an eight-hour difference.
114957	117138	As close as you can get to it, we should say.
117418	118639	So that's pretty rad for them.
119139	121620	No word about Japan yet, but I don't know.
122480	127382	They're probably not as anxious about Halo 3, although they can sell some copies of it there.
127422	127802	Why not?
128583	131244	Loki, you've mentioned September before on this show, haven't you?
131464	132104	Yeah, I haven't.
132878	138800	There was a blog post which I took away during that whole... Yeah, when people were threatening to beat you up.
139000	142282	Take you out of the back parking lot and beat you up if you keep squealing.
142442	144723	I was off by 13 days, but I was close.
144743	146143	That's probably closer than most people, though.
146404	146944	Good job, though.
147504	148224	Alright, so there it is.
149385	150405	Get your pre-orders in now.
150485	152046	September 25th is the date.
152446	158989	If you want Halo 3... Especially get those pre-orders in if you're looking for the Legendary Edition because it's going to be fucking impossible to find.
159249	159809	Just so you know.
161414	175459	Alright, so yeah, immediately once the Halo 3 beta came out, people started, you know, the modders out there were already taking notice and trying to grab any sort of information that they possibly can.
175479	187904	Of course, no actual word on what exactly that meant, but apparently they're looking at the code in the beta to see how they can exploit the game when it comes out.
189685	190205	Not surprising.
191215	192676	What exactly are they doing to it?
194376	195096	Not really sure.
195317	206961	I guess they're trying to rip code out of the, you know, like, I don't know, basically taking the demo that's on your, you know, or beta that's on your hard drive and just kind of trying to dissect it.
207761	214684	I mean, are they these typical type of multiplayer exploits where they're trying to make themselves invincible so they can go in there and just blow people up and no one can shoot them?
214704	215324	Yeah, lag stuff.
215544	215864	I don't know.
217961	221262	I don't think they're really going to be able to do much because it's a beta.
221302	228765	I don't think anyone can really decrypt the games anyways, so that'll be interesting.
230846	236008	Well, there is actually a little bit more in regards to the news.
236028	241950	We were talking about the accounts on Xbox Live a week or so ago.
243118	251086	Just another update for the same thing is that they are actually banning modified consoles from live.
252147	258974	So in other words, the folks that are trying to fuck with their systems to do this beta by hack storing their consoles, they're getting the ban hammer.
259375	259775	Pretty much.
260536	261157	Smacking it down.
262093	264435	Now, they have this little text, right?
264455	272441	Because I remember Major Nelson, I was reading his blog earlier this week, had a post of the actual little picture that would come up if you are a recipient of the Banhammer.
272782	279527	And it was interesting because it read to me like it was saying, don't call us, there's nothing you can do, you've been banned, F you, bye.
280067	281108	That's basically what it said.
281208	285771	And I was kind of like, what if you get banned accidentally?
286392	287593	I mean, you'd be screwed.
288223	290604	Because Microsoft basically says, screw you.
290984	295566	If this ever happened to me and I didn't actually mod my console or whatever, I would be livid.
296346	297767	I'm sure this can't be 100% foolproof.
298527	304629	I would think, though, that they're counting on there being such a minority of people that that happens to.
304649	311712	Because honestly, if you haven't put anything in your system that doesn't belong there, I've never opened the case to do anything to it.
312646	318808	What are the chances going to be that there's going to be some sort of flaw that comes up saying that you've modified your system?
320188	320648	Interesting.
321408	323609	Mystic Gohan in chat is talking about what's happened.
323869	326150	Mystic Gohan says they unlocked the locked content.
326370	328650	They found out that there's a vehicle called the Chopper in it.
329290	331211	And Bandit says there's a band cannon.
332591	334052	Not a band hammer, but a band cannon.
334412	335252	Band cannon.
335972	337592	Instead of a man cannon, a band cannon.
338853	339673	Remember the man cannon?
340242	345343	I've yet to see one of those in the beta, the man cannon.
345784	348824	Do you think this is an appropriate response to the hackers?
349565	350745	Sure.
350825	353386	I understand it, but I hope they're damn right every time.
353406	364429	I think there ought to be some type of way to appeal just in case because if this ever happens to somebody who runs a podcast or a blog, it's going to be a PR nightmare for Microsoft.
365289	368010	That's just my opinion.
368630	369530	I don't really think they care.
370071	374593	I guess not, but, you know, still, if they ban the wrong person, it's going to be trouble.
375013	379395	All right, anyhow, you heard the fuss I made when I got the red rings.
379475	381155	I hope they don't accidentally ban me.
381195	382556	I have to quote Raul Steele in here.
382936	384817	Hackers deserve to have their consoles bricked.
385077	385517	I agree.
385737	386117	I agree.
386157	391999	But again, I just, as long as they are 100% positive that the people they are banning are those that deserve it.
392499	394600	Don't hack your system until the next gen comes out.
396341	396601	All right.
396946	403289	Well, those of you guys that have not gotten your Xbox consoles banned, you have plenty to look forward to.
403970	414095	Xbox Live Arcade is getting a Bomberman port, and if you're still crying in the corner in the fetal position over Bomberman Act Zero, fear not!
414540	416742	This is a traditional Bomberman-style game.
416802	417863	Hudson's putting it together.
418443	424087	They have confirmed after much speculation on the Internet, which I believe we talked a little bit about last week on the show.
424127	425108	There was a trailer and stuff.
425408	428290	Yeah, Hudson has stepped out and said, okay, you got us.
428691	432473	It is coming out, and it's going to have eight-player support online.
433194	435356	Quote, this has been one of our most requested games.
435436	436837	Our fans have been clamoring for it.
437177	440099	We are thrilled to finally be able to deliver the game they want.
440579	441280	So there you have it.
442121	443362	That's going to be pretty awesome there.
443742	445443	Also new to the Xbox Live Arcade version.
447344	449044	Bomberman Customizability.
449505	453366	Gamers will be able to design a unique bomber to identify themselves with online.
453646	460309	Hudson promises enough options for 10,000 possible combinations, 9,900 of which are ugly.
463411	468093	So anyways, something kind of funny coming out from Edge Magazine in the U.K.,
469026	470727	And this is coming from Mark Reim.
471048	476111	And they're talking about Gears of War and how they've modified it into a golf game.
476452	484838	Apparently they were trying to sell the Unreal 3 engine to a Korean publisher that was looking to make casual games from it and possibly a golf game out of it.
485018	494185	So what they did to kind of demonstrate this is they modified one of the levels of Gears of War to make it more like a golf course with holes and stuff like that and mounds.
494665	497087	And then actually had their animator
497540	525162	Create a golf swing for Marcus Fenix And, you know, kind of demonstrate it using the actual I think it was the grenade throwing engine in the actual game So, that's kind of neat Don't expect it to actually come to, you know, live or anything as download content But, you know, hey, if they wanted to do that, that'd be kind of neat Will Gears of War Golf, this tech demo here Become the Final Fantasy on Nintendo 64 tech demo of the future?
525443	527124	Like one of those highly sought after things?
527728	528048	I don't know.
529248	529609	Maybe not.
529669	532389	It'd be fun to have a downloadable demo or something like that.
532470	533450	Let's see a YouTube.
533530	533990	Come on.
534250	537711	Wherever a story like this is to be found, there's soon a YouTube to be found.
538171	539772	So let's see a YouTube of this in action.
540212	541672	Marcus Phoenix on the golf course.
542193	542633	Amazing.
543653	546694	Well, this is actually something that makes me pretty happy.
549095	555737	Recent submissions to the ESRB has been Echo the Dolphin and Summit the Hedgehog for Xbox 360.
556992	562434	So that, you remember when we were talking about the Sega Vintage rumor that was going out?
563115	566336	Well, this seems to sort of support that theory.
566756	569477	Although, it's not going to be called Sega Vintage.
569577	572479	I'm sorry, they are going to call it Sega Ages something.
572999	573979	Because that's just Sega.
575000	575560	So, whatever.
576040	577941	Because Ages is Sega backwards?
578021	578381	Yes.
578601	579261	Cute.
579281	580302	Not cute.
581027	585208	Rob, they've been doing the Sega Ages collection since the day of the Saturn.
585669	587349	That name is not going anywhere.
587449	590130	When was the last time there was a good Wayne's World reference anywhere?
590190	591791	Come on, I had to do it not.
592751	594572	Anyway, sorry, I killed the joke.
595132	596913	Anyhow, are you excited about this?
596993	599654	I don't know, this is like the five gazillionth time we've seen Sonic the Hedgehog.
599674	600394	I have both of those games.
601234	603715	But there'll be achievements and high-def graphics.
604235	606416	How much do I give a shit about achievements, Rob?
607094	608855	You've seen my Xbox Live account.
608875	610977	Don't you have like zero points?
611057	611297	No.
612258	617342	I have one achievement, and that's from playing Uno and winning with a draw four.
619323	621204	The one time I've played on live.
623186	624147	You're not really a big 360.
624827	626789	Where's all your Marvel Ultimate Alliance achievements?
627189	628090	I'm playing on PS3.
628230	629511	But you're going to be playing on Xbox 360, yes?
630467	633428	Yeah, and then it'll have Cheater all over it.
634008	638970	Because I'm going to be level 99, 100k, max out my characters.
639430	639870	Yeah.
640670	641270	That'll be me.
641751	642251	Interesting.
644532	644912	All right.
645192	648233	Well, if you are a fan of retro, are you interested in this, Loki?
648353	649133	The Echo of the Dolphin?
649333	649873	Nope.
650213	651534	Hey, KaneVM, guess what?
651614	652434	I have Dragon Force.
653094	653294	What?
654695	656175	KaneVM says I want Dragon Force.
656215	656875	Give me Dragon Force.
656916	657396	I have it.
658216	658416	All right.
660014	687971	on the Saturn going over to the Wii of course they love their virtual console stuff over on the Wii and again the ESRB spills the dirt on what we can be looking forward to on the Wii Virtual Console including Streets of Rage 2 coming to the Wii Virtual Console ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron boy they're really reaching with the Sega Genesis games now aren't they and World Sports Competition from Hudson
688581	689021	There you go.
689101	693363	Three games that are all but confirmed, basically, for the Virtual Console.
693684	695545	Anybody downloaded anything on Virtual Console lately?
696245	697405	Nope.
699246	700627	I guess I'm the only sucker for it.
700667	702888	I got Legend of the Mystical Ninja because that game was awesome.
703248	703929	That was pretty fun.
703949	705049	It was an awesome game.
705209	707450	World Sports Competition.
708531	710372	That's such a generic name.
710952	712913	By the way, Nintendo.
713754	715815	Hello, Nintendo and Squeenix.
715955	718236	I am still waiting for ActRaiser.
718891	722373	Thank you, Japan and Europe have had it how long now?
722453	723374	And we're still waiting?
723894	724834	What the hell's the holdup?
725455	725915	Actraiser!
726355	727936	On my Super Mario RPG!
728416	728696	Now!
728716	732038	Okay, sorry, I'm done being a little kid.
732339	742204	Anyways, so something else we talked about on a previous podcast, which later disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle.
743031	744852	which we will speak no longer of on this program.
745513	749075	Namco Museum Remix is coming to the Wii.
749275	750215	First time I've ever heard that.
750775	755238	No, I never heard you say this on a previous podcast at all that suddenly disappeared a few weeks later.
755698	756178	Never heard it.
756499	756979	Never ever.
757119	757339	Never.
757439	768886	But it's going to actually, they're kind of remixing a few different things than you would normally expect like pack and rolls actually being remade into a Wii game.
769646	770266	That's kind of neat.
770526	771467	So that's going to be on there.
771786	781731	Pac-Motos, which is going to be a Mario Kart type game, but basically Pac-Man knocks his opponents out of dangerous arenas.
783611	790695	Rally-X Remix, they're redoing it in 3D, so it's a little bit different than the remixed ones on the PSP.
792536	795557	Gator Panic Remix, which is like Whack-A-Mole.
797438	811321	and then of course you're going to also see Galaxian, DigDog, Mappy, Xevious, Galplus, Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Mania, and QQ.
813101	818282	We'll all have remakes and I guess, oh, no, the originals.
819502	824923	It's set to release, I guess, it says in the fall.
830784	836806	As much as I have issues with Namco lately for certain unsaid personal reasons, this game looks pretty cool.
836826	839167	I can't let that get in the way of the fact that the game does look pretty cool.
839207	842448	And, you know, pack and roll on the Wii does seem like kind of a natural progression.
843229	845169	And I'm a sucker for these retro things.
845189	845890	What can I say?
846110	848831	I'm just such a fucking sucker for this crap.
848971	850191	And this looks kind of neat.
850531	854473	Yeah, and unfortunately, it's going to be the only rolling game this year on the Wii.
856590	860272	DarkSakura, I know you're a Namco fan
879963	881484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
908528	911209	But are you excited about this whole remix thing on the Wii?
911249	917130	I mean, is this something that should be remixed, or should Namco Games be untouched and preserved in a bubble forever?
917150	927172	Well, given that I was picking up the Sega Ages 2900, and you know what those are, they're all the touched-up, redone versions of the old Sega games, then I have absolutely no problem with this.
927712	934533	I would love to see D3 release all the simple 2000 series over here.
935427	939088	Actually, there have been a few titles from the Simple 2000 series that snuck over.
939748	941809	They just, of course, are different titles.
944009	950171	Bandit says, bring me BurgerTime now, and Ross Steele has to remind Bandit the BurgerTime is by Data East, so it won't be in a minute.
950211	951611	I can have BurgerTime now?
952431	952652	Huh?
952892	954052	I can have BurgerTime now?
954092	955492	What the hell ever happened to Data East?
955532	956293	Are they still around?
956413	957153	They're doing pinball.
957333	959213	They should remake Breakthrough.
959693	961894	That was one of my first Nintendo games, and I loved it.
962435	968279	DarkSakura loves to look at the internet up and down and all over every week and share her favorite website with you.
968319	971301	So it's DarkSakura's website of the week and she's going to tell you what it is right now.
993661	995441	I decided not to do a website of the week, sorry.
996022	996402	No, really.
998263	1005066	This is one that was suggested by our very own Loki, and it's fucking addicting.
1005766	1010428	It's Dofiblog, and let me see if I can read what this says.
1011729	1015111	Oh, it just says Dofiblog in Hiragana, I'm sorry.
1017572	1018712	It's a bunch of flash games.
1019313	1020073	It's really crazy.
1021259	1026042	I've been playing Cat with Bo Golf, which is crazy.
1027363	1047937	And there's also Stick Remover, and Double Wires, Eggway, San San San, X Snow Cats, Neko Breakout, War of the Hell, Slug Slayer, New Rolling Omosubi, Rolling Omosubi, and a bunch of other weirdo games involving cats.
1048258	1049358	I highly recommend...
1051607	1055789	X Snowcats Eggway Double Wires Ishii.blog2.fc2.com
1077463	1081766	Ishi, I-S-H-I dot B-L-O-G 2 dot F-C-2 dot com.
1081907	1084389	Which you have conveniently posted in chat for our listeners, I see.
1084469	1085269	Of course I have.
1085409	1087411	Thank you, DarkSakura, upstanding citizen.
1090774	1091254	Moving on.
1091873	1095396	Data East, I looked them up on Wikipedia to figure out what went on.
1095736	1112548	They went under on June 25, 2003 is when they filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court, and their intellectual properties were acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, who is a Japanese mobile game content provider, which explains how we have burger time on cell phones, because I have seen that game in recent years.
1112921	1116503	So maybe you'll see bad dudes in a few years on phones.
1116663	1117143	I don't know.
1117343	1119705	Are you a bad enough dude to have a milkshake?
1119865	1120985	But Data East went under.
1121105	1125108	They did have a brief stint in pinball, and they did some pretty good tables.
1125448	1127869	Guns N' Roses, The Simpsons, Robocop.
1127889	1128890	I have Guns N' Roses.
1129630	1130470	And what else?
1130570	1136394	They purchased Stern Electronics, and then something changed, and they made Stern Pinball, I think.
1136654	1137774	Well, no, Stern Pinball.
1137794	1138935	And then they sold it all to Sega.
1139582	1141123	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1141243	1141564	All right.
1141584	1141904	Stern.
1141964	1143085	Yes, pinball goddess.
1143245	1146508	Stern is their own company.
1146548	1151271	In fact, Stern is the company that released the Pirates of the Caribbean pinball like a couple months ago.
1152532	1155174	And I think they also released the Family Guy pinball.
1155895	1156575	Okay, I get it.
1156695	1156996	I see.
1157436	1161219	Data East exited the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 96.
1162040	1166143	And the USA division had already been transferred to Sega as part of a debt settlement.
1167438	1173700	and then the Pinball Factory changed hands one more time with Gary Stern purchasing the factory in 99 and renaming it Stern Pinball.
1173960	1174440	So there you go.
1174660	1175201	That's what happened.
1175441	1177481	And Stern is still giving us our pinball.
1177962	1178402	There you go.
1179582	1181143	But unfortunately, no more Data East.
1181203	1183724	No more Kid Nicky Radical Ninja, I'm sorry to say.
1184624	1186925	No more Bump and Jump Kids or Ring King.
1186945	1188605	I love Bump and Jump.
1188625	1189746	I know, Bump and Jump was rad.
1190246	1193887	Anyway, but you do get plenty of Super Smash Bros.
1193927	1195648	Brawl because that wasn't by Data East.
1195668	1196948	That's by people completely different
1197332	1197772	Super Smash Bros.
1197812	1197972	Brawl
1220359	1221599	Tingle in it!
1221940	1224701	Your favorite Nintendo character of all time, Tingle.
1224901	1225401	Boo.
1225681	1228142	From the Zelda series, of course.
1228282	1231863	Tingle is the... He's every fairy's fairy, let's just put it that way.
1233524	1236325	He goes around spilling rupees, and good times.
1236805	1239266	I remember he was in the Four Swords game on GameCube.
1239626	1240127	Good times.
1241127	1244048	So that would be great if Tingle shows up in the game.
1244488	1248830	Has not been confirmed by Nintendo, it's still a rumor, but that would be pretty awesome if Tingle showed up in the game.
1249855	1252017	If nothing else, but to drop power-ups in.
1252478	1255681	Because, you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that Tingle is a character.
1255701	1259544	It could be that Tingle, you know, because, like, remember how, like, Pokemon showed up?
1259584	1262787	Like, the Pokeballs would show up in the old one on GameCube?
1262867	1268653	You could just throw the Pokeballs and you had random, like, you know, like, what were some of the Pokemon that showed up randomly?
1268713	1271736	Like, the Charizard and stuff would blow fire or whatever.
1272737	1273137	So there you go.
1273897	1278719	And with any luck, maybe Loki is secretly recording the voice of Tingle as we speak for this upcoming game.
1278860	1280660	I am not recording the voice for Tingle.
1281981	1282441	God.
1282461	1283982	It's horrible.
1284582	1285663	Horrible, horrible.
1286503	1287824	Anyways.
1289845	1296849	Apparently now, if you're flying Delta Air, you can check out some free demos for the DS.
1297289	1301231	Because now they have DS demo stations right there.
1301653	1302554	while you're waiting in line.
1303134	1310798	And some demos you'll be able to try out, Brain Age, Cooking Mama, Elite Beat Agents, and Tomb Raider Legend.
1311039	1312840	Of course, all those are free.
1315961	1318063	Isn't this all the same shit that's in there usual?
1318443	1319183	I want to say yes.
1321745	1321985	All right.
1322665	1326948	So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, but this isn't much incentive to fly Delta because if you think about it,
1327250	1328271	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1352970	1356053	There is some good news for our friends in Europe.
1357274	1360956	Final Fantasy VI Advance will be released on June 29th.
1364099	1366561	I've actually got the game, although to be honest I have yet to play it.
1367081	1376489	You have the Soul Shrine that gives you a bunch of monsters to beat up and...
1377202	1381105	A Kaiser Dragon Boss, and a music player.
1381466	1384348	But other than that, it's the same game.
1384949	1387511	Except that you have no Vanish Egg Zone.
1388932	1390193	Oh, they took Egg Zone out of the game?
1390794	1390994	No.
1391414	1392815	You have no Vanish Egg Zone.
1393116	1394637	Oh, the trick you used to do.
1394657	1395938	The combo.
1395978	1396959	No Vanish Egg Zone.
1396999	1399902	What was the Vanish Egg Zone combo?
1400422	1404165	What happens if you cast Vanish is that it makes the enemies disappear, but...
1406115	1411476	It makes them, I think, vulnerable to all magic attacks, and then X-Zone sends them to another dimension.
1411956	1413077	So basically, it ends the battle.
1413097	1414497	X-Zone was like an insta-kill.
1414677	1416897	X-Zone was an insta-kill, but it didn't always work.
1417197	1419658	But if you used Vanish on the enemy first, it would always work.
1420578	1421938	So, interesting.
1422579	1428360	I always used to just, like, cast and reflect on all my characters and then just balancing the spells off there, even though I don't know if it did anything.
1428580	1431481	It was just nice to see, like, lightning hit, you know, four times or whatever.
1432941	1433441	Good times.
1434014	1436796	Drew Nami would like to point out that Vanished Doom will also work.
1437277	1438258	The Vanished Doom combo.
1438698	1443021	I like, but still my favorite attack, though, in that entire game was Meteor, just because it looks cool.
1444082	1445583	I never used the Vanished Exon TD.
1445644	1452489	I actually thought Exon was kind of a dumb spell, just because, I don't know, I like to kill in the old-fashioned way, by the hand of my sword.
1453029	1454931	Yeah, or spamming Ultima.
1455592	1455732	Well...
1456991	1465674	The other thing, though, that I really... Okay, what was... In the Final Fantasy games, overall, what would you say is your one most useful spell?
1466914	1467234	Oh, my God.
1467254	1467935	That isn't Cure.
1468075	1468915	Yeah, I was going to say Cure.
1469555	1470095	Cureaga?
1471076	1472596	That isn't in the family of Cure.
1472656	1473196	Protect.
1475337	1478658	No, I rarely use Protect unless it's Final Fantasy XI.
1478958	1481139	The number one spell I would use?
1482599	1483960	Fire III, I guess.
1484000	1484260	Demi.
1486122	1487864	Oh, where it has their MP every time?
1488484	1493128	No, Demi quarters their HP every time.
1493188	1494309	Oh yeah, quarters their HP.
1494429	1497572	No, Demi I thought was... Demi was an HP attack.
1498252	1501615	And you cast Demi 3 and it was like even more than that.
1501635	1501615	75%.
1501915	1506219	What was the... And it would work on big enemies.
1506559	1507620	There was one for MP.
1512424	1512864	I don't remember.
1514170	1516771	I didn't care about their NP as long as I could kill them before they hit me.
1517711	1519652	Jvmon says Demi and Bio for me.
1520772	1521932	Bio was the other one.
1522012	1522812	I love Bio.
1522932	1524213	But Demi was like my big favorite.
1524233	1528114	Virus in 4 was pretty rad because it made that hideous noise whenever you cast it.
1529414	1530995	It sounded like cats getting hit.
1531555	1535976	It sounded like cats in a burlap bag being hit with a bat when you cast Virus on the enemy.
1537176	1538237	I just like the chainsaw.
1540376	1541316	That was rad.
1541356	1545798	That's why I love 6, was that, you know, you did the little commands with, what was it, Saban was his name, right?
1546199	1547619	No, that was Edgar, I think.
1547739	1551881	No, Edgar, well, Edgar had the chainsaw, but Saban had the ones where you did, like, the... The Street Fighter stuff?
1551901	1553962	Yeah, the Street Fighter stuff, and he did special moves.
1553982	1554782	That was so rad.
1555243	1556043	He was really cool.
1556083	1557043	God damn, that game is great.
1557063	1557744	They're going to remake that.
1557764	1559144	That'd be awesome if they do.
1559444	1559765	I don't know.
1559785	1561765	I'm still, you know, I don't know.
1561785	1563886	Don't mess with something that ain't broken, right?
1564367	1564647	I don't know.
1564667	1568188	But I am curious to check out this Final Fantasy 6 Advance.
1568228	1569449	I know, I need to buy the Advance one.
1569489	1569949	It's awesome.
1571074	1578480	Hey, GSucks68 in chat says, Demi sucks, especially against most stronger enemies since they're immune to it.
1580781	1582242	Not if you make them not immune to it.
1583003	1586565	RawSteelUT says, virus equals bio, translations.
1586745	1589627	I thought it was virus and four and then bio in the later games.
1590188	1591709	Maybe it was translations, I don't know.
1591991	1594133	But it still made the dying cat noise.
1595254	1598156	If you love Final Fantasy, then you must have this in your collection.
1598196	1601118	You can get a Chocobo Magic Book Mug.
1601839	1603860	Yes, of course, NCSX.
1604000	1607043	Now, I don't know how you guys feel about this company, NCSX.
1607083	1608184	Do you use them, DarkSakura?
1609024	1609325	Oh, yeah.
1609405	1610285	NCSX is great.
1610486	1611146	Okay.
1611186	1611386	Oh, no.
1611406	1612607	It's Byrite is the one you hate.
1612647	1613528	But they went under, right?
1614349	1615249	Oh, hell yes.
1615329	1615810	Okay.
1615830	1617231	So NCSX.
1618372	1618952	God damn it.
1619152	1620293	NCSX.
1620834	1621194	Live radio.
1621857	1625039	is a place where you can buy these mugs for $18 a piece.
1625799	1628100	These Chocobo mugs, and damn, they look cute.
1628160	1628521	Look at that.
1628621	1629601	Look at those little Chocobo mugs.
1629621	1630121	Don't they look cute?
1630362	1632363	It reminds me of my... I got you your Batsmaroo one.
1632383	1637105	I know, my Batsmaroo mug, which I do use once in a while for coffee for my Hello Kitty coffee maker.
1638686	1640487	Maybe I should get a Chocobo mug to go along with this.
1640507	1641367	You should get me one, too.
1641467	1642588	Cute coffee mugs are awesome.
1642608	1643689	So I can drink out of a bird's head.
1644069	1646850	Maybe I'm going to go on a shopping spree at NCSX any day now.
1647231	1648071	I might have to think about that.
1650223	1651364	Why should I buy a present for you?
1651444	1652144	What have you done for me?
1652644	1653525	What haven't I done for you?
1654385	1654765	A lot.
1655525	1658466	What have you done for me lately?
1658846	1667669	Anyways, like most of those promo deals out there, there's a new one now to get a Wii for free.
1668129	1676652	And the way you do it is Gamefly, they're running a promotion where you persuade five of your friends to sign up and in return they'll send you a free Wii six weeks later.
1678094	1685600	What people are doing is having their friends sign up, giving them like $10 each to do that, and then canceling it after a set amount of time.
1686621	1688843	And there you go, free Wii for $50.
1688903	1690544	I did that for an iPod.
1691345	1693026	So yeah, it's kind of like that scheme.
1693127	1699812	Of course, my guess is they're going to catch on to this pretty quick, and they will change something.
1701288	1702849	So that shit really works, huh?
1703069	1704509	Like we can get the free Xboxes.
1704529	1707111	Because I keep hearing this commercial on the radio for the free Xbox.
1707211	1714194	And I'm always like, oh, schemes are so reek of shenanigans.
1714214	1715114	But they really work, huh?
1715134	1716455	I'll tell you how I did mine.
1717195	1719376	They had this Blockbuster online thing.
1719436	1721677	It was like Netflix but Blockbuster, so it sucked.
1722457	1728580	And if you sign up, they don't charge you for like two weeks during their trial, right?
1729358	1738866	So, but it takes six days for them to transfer to the iPod site that you signed up for, so you cancel before they charge your credit card.
1739326	1742028	And so me and five people did that, and I got an iPod.
1742508	1742749	Wow.
1742849	1743709	And then my iPod broke.
1744750	1745731	So you got a cheap iPod.
1745751	1746452	You got a refurb.
1746512	1749414	I got one of the third edition iPods that they had the recall on.
1750034	1750615	Ah, that sucks.
1751556	1752016	All right, well.
1752752	1754994	The first email comes from a French nun
1782912	1784013	Bonjour, DarkSakura.
1786014	1789376	And please pardon my bad pronunciation because I am way, way out of practice.
1789516	1790257	Oh, Christ.
1790317	1792638	Are all our emails actually in French this week?
1792998	1793419	No, they're not.
1793639	1795160	I was like, did they actually listen to you?
1796801	1803285	Vous avez une très belle voix et j'adore vous entendre à la radio orange.
1803985	1804205	Okay.
1804525	1805446	Yeah, I'm really good.
1805726	1808828	Basically said I had a really good voice and they like listening to the show.
1809568	1810669	So, I have a general comment.
1810769	1813171	I find your show a little Xbox 360 heavy.
1813571	1819915	While I understand that there is little to talk about in the PS3 world, my PS3 is accumulating dust extremely effectively.
1820376	1827180	I'd love to hear you chat, argue, fight about other platforms such as DS, PSP, cell phone games, and insert obscure platform here.
1827961	1828822	You know, the GDI.
1829062	1829502	Oh my god.
1829522	1830143	Anyway.
1830743	1831383	We did, didn't we?
1831944	1832204	Yeah.
1832544	1833885	Listen to Part A this week.
1833945	1835766	It's like nothing but non-Xbox 360 stuff.
1838350	1842634	I tune in to hear about stuff I know nothing about, and to be honest, I buy games you guys recommend.
1843034	1845195	So talk about as many platforms as possible, fair enough?
1845876	1846937	And then I'm going to translate this.
1847617	1852221	DarkSakura, thank you.
1852721	1855083	Okay, still, my reading is not so bad.
1855263	1859646	And good luck with the new massage profession.
1861528	1864430	And this is a French-Canadian listener who...
1865876	1870640	Demands that we speak in French more.
1875784	1876924	Parlez-vous freeze-pop?
1878786	1879186	I know that.
1879266	1879486	What?
1881068	1894838	Anyway, thank you very much for the well wishes, and I'm actually going to be going, when I go back to school, I'm actually planning on, I took, you know, a whole bunch of French, and I used to be fairly conversational, so I'm going to go back and finish French.
1896531	1899032	and Robert M. I'm sorry, but this made me crack up.
1899352	1902873	Poisson de Babel for Babelfish.
1903853	1904873	Wait, are you going on to another email?
1904913	1905634	I'm on another email.
1905654	1906934	Wait, can I respond to the last one real quick?
1907034	1907214	Sorry.
1907674	1910595	Oh, the Rob D. in chat says, OLR should cover the Sega CD more.
1911695	1912155	Maybe we should.
1912195	1912476	I don't know.
1912716	1914196	No, I just want to say about the Xbox 360 thing.
1914396	1920258	You've got to realize, though, what platform has something coming out every week on it with the Xbox Live Arcade?
1920718	1921278	There is the Xbox 360.
1922048	1922728	Thanks for watching!
1939013	1939654	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1970313	1973554	If you have a game you want us to talk about, email it and we'll talk about it.
1975115	1975815	What is that?
1976255	1976835	A taco.
1977375	1980056	Oh, that's okay.
1980216	1981236	Why aren't you on the show this week?
1981476	1982837	I'll take the stuff inside of it.
1982857	1985338	Because I got back too late.
1986498	1990319	And I'm better than you guys.
1990379	1991979	I'll take the stuff inside the taco.
1992219	1992700	Here you go.
1992900	1993720	Just start digging.
1993820	1994460	Do you have a fork?
1995400	1996641	I do not, but I can go get you one.
1996741	1997881	How was your gaming week real quick?
1999559	2002340	I played a lot of Oendan 2, and I've already beaten it.
2002460	2002840	I'm done.
2003700	2005201	Oh shit, nobody even mentions it.
2005221	2007581	I'm so sorry to interrupt your mailbag, but we need to hear about Oendan 2.
2007661	2008061	How is it?
2009782	2020764	Let me first stress that I'm not a Japanophile in the least, so I don't care about J-pop, and I don't like J-pop, but I like these games.
2021405	2026666	So the music for me is sorely lacking, but it's harder than Oendan 1.
2028383	2032006	and... It doesn't quite have the same charm as the first game.
2032406	2034968	Either Owen Don 1 or Elite Beat Agents.
2035509	2036189	But I like it.
2036289	2038631	I would still say Elite Beat Agents is my favorite of the three.
2039072	2042734	But Owen Don 2 is better than Owen Don 1 and I like that.
2042875	2043655	It's really hard.
2043755	2045877	Did they change anything with the basic game mechanics?
2046317	2046778	Or not really?
2046898	2056625	No, but they brought over the cool features from Elite Beat Agents where you can skip the intro and the last stage is actually divided into two songs.
2057106	2057206	And...
2058075	2063038	Oddly enough, you can skip the endings for each song now too once you've beaten them, so it's kind of weird.
2063638	2065659	Like if you're just replaying to get a better score.
2067180	2067640	And it's good.
2068240	2070201	And I've been playing Puzzle Quest also.
2070501	2070962	Oh, how's that?
2071522	2072142	I love it.
2072682	2073903	I want to try that out before you leave.
2074223	2076404	Okay, well I'm leaving like sometime tomorrow.
2076544	2077885	Okay, good.
2078245	2080867	And I have a terrible backlog of DS games now.
2080887	2085929	I have like six that I need to play or beat, and it's depressing because I keep finding more I want.
2086009	2087670	How hard was it to find a copy of Puzzle Quest?
2088393	2089934	It was hard for me at the time.
2089974	2090795	I found it last weekend.
2090815	2092116	I found one at Best Buy.
2092537	2097821	But I went to EB and Best Buy this week, and yeah, it's not hard anymore.
2098001	2098482	Oh, okay, good.
2098522	2102545	So they finally put out enough so people can get it if they want.
2103026	2103806	Well, thank you, Mikotov.
2104427	2104947	You're welcome.
2104967	2105148	Bye.
2105168	2105688	All right.
2105848	2107590	And can you get her napkins for her taco?
2107610	2108370	Actually, I'm going to eat it.
2108911	2109932	You're just going to eat the taco?
2109952	2110192	Yeah.
2110312	2110973	It's delicious.
2110993	2112214	I'm going to start back tomorrow.
2114551	2115852	Good job, Shane.
2115912	2116952	Ruining diets everywhere.
2116992	2125396	No, I've been good all day, but I think my headache is because I had so much sugar for two days and then dropped all of it, so I need a buffer.
2125696	2127237	Jamie, you're a good-looking gal.
2127277	2127977	Just eat the taco.
2128317	2129418	You don't have to worry about that stuff.
2129718	2130278	Yes, I do.
2130818	2132019	The chatters.
2132459	2133480	Jamie needs some love.
2133540	2135240	Tell her she has nice boobies or something.
2135380	2139782	No, I don't because I figured I dropped 80, right?
2140623	2140843	Right.
2141703	2142484	And then I gained back 15.
2142524	2142704	Mm-hmm.
2144642	2148863	So I'm going to be going back to the gym and everything because I still have a little bit more to go.
2149464	2150304	I need to lose some too.
2150324	2151844	Go to the gym with me.
2151864	2152184	We'll see.
2152544	2152805	Okay.
2154525	2154985	Oh, God.
2155045	2157306	Loki just did the most foul thing with his belly.
2157786	2159066	That was disgusting.
2160947	2163068	He like shook it.
2163188	2163728	Oh, my God.
2163748	2164228	That was weird.
2164528	2164728	All right.
2164768	2165308	Anyhow, sorry.
2165428	2165789	Mailbag.
2165929	2166169	Okay.
2166909	2168969	Yeah, Robert M., you're funny.
2169090	2170430	And by the way, there was not.
2170570	2171030	Look at chat.
2171270	2171570	What?
2173051	2173851	There's Jamie Love.
2175555	2175935	Look at that.
2176255	2177696	That's why you do this show, right, for your ego?
2177716	2179317	I'm not starving myself.
2179778	2184381	She's not, but... I eat... No, no, no, no.
2184441	2190084	Okay, what I wanted to tell you guys is that diabetes, there's a tendency toward it in my family.
2190825	2195728	And it's not a matter of aesthetics or anything like that.
2195848	2198570	It's a matter of preventing disease on the way.
2198790	2200531	Jamie, that taco's not going to give you diabetes.
2201572	2202152	I know, but I'm...
2204417	2205297	Mike isn't on.
2205337	2206218	Say the joke again.
2206838	2210680	We'll give you something else that starts with a D. No, no.
2211220	2218103	The whole reason being is that I'm cutting back on my sugars because my blood sugar actually was fairly borderline at my last blood test.
2219064	2220804	So I'm trying to avoid diabetes.
2221725	2223486	And that is the reason why.
2223826	2224806	All right.
2224906	2228208	Sorry to get on the tangent and get all depressing here on the program.
2228228	2233210	That and exercise is supposed to actually help with chronic fatigue syndrome because I'm also trying to get myself off my meds.
2234841	2236422	Just eat the fucking taco.
2236482	2238424	I will after I'm done doing the fucking email.
2238484	2239284	Oh my god.
2239364	2242627	I'd eat it, but I don't like Mexican food, so, you know, this is kind of weird.
2242827	2243187	Email!
2243868	2244608	Bite my ass.
2245289	2248751	And no, there was not a home release of Dragonflare on Laserdisc.
2251473	2251694	Okay.
2251954	2253115	Was that the email?
2253535	2256737	Yes, that was from... You didn't even read the poor guy's email.
2256777	2257758	You just yelled at it.
2258719	2260320	It was in really bad grammar.
2260340	2261201	Fuck.
2262327	2263007	He said so himself.
2263027	2263668	He's Babblefish.
2263748	2264008	I'm sorry.
2264248	2265589	Poisson de Babble.
2267290	2268290	Anyway, next email.
2269411	2270851	Hey, DarkSakura, Loki, and Skye.
2271992	2272632	Wait, wait.
2272832	2273213	Time out.
2274313	2278355	GZDR4EV Dude, those boobs.
2278635	2280696	One of those nipples is a fucking comma.
2281297	2282037	What are you trying to say?
2282157	2283718	One of her nipples is fucked up looking?
2284918	2285199	Sorry.
2285979	2286999	Derail the whole show.
2288000	2288260	What?
2288300	2289181	Was that how that was about my boobs?
2289201	2290761	He was making asking nipples.
2290781	2290861	Oh.
2293772	2296734	DarkSakura, you asked for an email in French, so you... Okay, whatever.
2318206	2319107	JVmon drew my boobs bigger than yours.
2319127	2320267	JVmon drew my boobs bigger than yours.
2348430	2351053	You have special pumped up boobs.
2351073	2353916	My nipples are the size of like dollars.
2354436	2357179	Nights, um, I don't know.
2357739	2359481	It's more of a Christmas game for me, I think.
2359882	2360362	Oh, really?
2360502	2362544	Yeah, because it has that kind of night Christmas.
2362644	2363625	Didn't they have Christmas nights?
2363946	2364086	Mm-hmm.
2364315	2366515	Yeah, it's more of a Christmas game for me.
2366635	2366976	You think?
2367556	2368276	I think, yeah.
2368356	2369736	You think Knights could be around Christmas?
2369916	2371857	Yeah, they should release a Christmas Knights as well.
2371957	2372217	Okay.
2372237	2375637	Well, I don't know if I've told, well, I've mentioned this several times.
2375897	2380358	Christmas Knights is actually a tradition at my house.
2380398	2383079	We break out the Saturn and we play Christmas Knights up until Christmas Day.
2384499	2384759	Nerd.
2385859	2387020	What was the other part of the question?
2387080	2388460	Games that should be redone or something?
2389120	2390640	RPGs that should be re-released for the DS.
2391580	2393321	RPGs that should be re-released for the DS.
2393361	2393961	Guardian Legends?
2395154	2397175	Okay, maybe that wasn't an RPG.
2397355	2398776	It's still a game that I want.
2398796	2399856	It's an adventure shooter.
2400236	2400877	Close enough.
2401417	2402737	I just want the Guardian Legend, love.
2402758	2404458	So do I, oh my god.
2404478	2407260	And I want to stop whining.
2409321	2410901	How about the Illusion of Gaia series?
2411021	2414163	Or the whole Enix Soul Blazer, what was it?
2415543	2416344	Soul Blazer.
2416644	2419045	Oh my god, Shane, this is a good taco.
2420205	2421986	And Illusion of Gaia, and there was a third one.
2422026	2423447	Brain Lord, that's the other one, Brain Lord.
2424380	2425680	I want that whole series on DS.
2425900	2426741	Okay, next email.
2427201	2427401	Yes.
2427521	2429821	Unless you had anyone that you wanted to seek him out?
2430921	2431121	Huh?
2431622	2433462	What RPG would you like to seek him out for the DS?
2433502	2434622	Taco the RPG.
2434902	2435862	For the DS?
2437123	2438383	Uh, remake, remake.
2439483	2440964	Super Mario RPG!
2441244	2442664	Where the fuck is my game?
2444204	2444704	Taco.
2446145	2446405	Okay.
2446565	2449045	Juranami says it was not Brain Lord, it was Terranigma.
2450286	2450726	Next up.
2452206	2452286	Um...
2452938	2457800	Okay, with the Xbox 360 keyboard, do you think World of Warcraft will come to the 360?
2457840	2459001	Why or why not?
2459141	2459621	Um, no.
2460402	2461182	And you don't need to know why.
2462283	2462723	No, I'm kidding.
2463023	2464083	That's from Daniel.
2464504	2465304	I kid you not.
2466425	2473048	Every time the Vividi rep comes down to our work, we ask him that same question.
2473808	2475209	When's World of Warcraft coming to the 360?
2476589	2478590	And every time he says it's never coming to the 360.
2478630	2478710	Ever.
2482049	2484891	I don't think it's happening either.
2485031	2490395	I think Blizzard, if they're going to do something on the consoles, they will make a game specifically for consoles.
2490455	2492176	I don't think they're going to port their game.
2492496	2493557	They don't really need to.
2493757	2495058	I mean, everybody has a computer.
2495158	2498000	People that don't even play PC games play World of Warcraft.
2498260	2502503	Okay, you're only seeing games that are ported to that when they need more users.
2502903	2505085	World of Warcraft is not really having any trouble with
2506286	2508307	Not a large enough user base.
2508507	2514590	Blizzard probably figures, if you have an Xbox 360, you also probably have a computer capable of playing World of Warcraft.
2514770	2518552	Yeah, and also, I mean, World of Warcraft runs on almost anything.
2518592	2522834	I mean, as far as Linux, Mac OS, Windows.
2523414	2527956	So, it's not like it's a graphically intensive game.
2529457	2529657	Right.
2530998	2533319	And the last email, oh my god, Rob, I'm so sorry.
2533699	2533939	What?
2534940	2535460	Oh, the chat?
2536348	2538669	I just got unbanned from... I'm just ignoring the chat now.
2539489	2541210	No, this is from SakuraMax.
2541971	2543811	I just got unbanned from Orange Lounge.
2543851	2545612	Remember to plug that if you haven't.
2545972	2547173	And I want to say, screw you, Rob.
2547193	2548073	Jamie is cooler than you.
2548113	2548454	I hate you.
2553176	2554176	I'm not even going to respond to it.
2554356	2556877	But I think that the thing is, the signature is the funny part.
2557558	2560099	Hopes Rob gets eaten by a Gru youngest OLR member.
2560179	2562360	Wishes World of Warcraft would work on his computer.
2562420	2564181	Pocky lover and Vietnamese otaku.
2564221	2564561	Hell yeah.
2566499	2566859	Whatever.
2567519	2567720	Okay.
2568200	2568720	Rob Hart.
2569020	2569440	Yeah, whatever.
2569880	2570961	Alright, is that all the emails?
2571541	2571741	Yes.
2572061	2572321	Alright.
2573302	2578104	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com How about some Rob fan mail next week?
2578644	2579284	After that email.
2579324	2582145	I want some Rob fan mail that Jamie has to read word for word on the air.
2582926	2584366	Rob fan mail in French.
2586807	2587808	Or in Spanish or something.
2587828	2590088	How about a language Jamie doesn't know that I know a little bit of?
2590108	2590769	How about Spanish?
2590809	2593230	I want Spanish love for me.
2594370	2595371	No love for Loki ever.
2596131	2596211	Uh...
2597113	2597253	What?
2597593	2598693	Moving on to, yeah, that's right.
2599474	2602474	Moving on to another story talking about Nintendo.
2602655	2606356	Nintendo is following up a contest in some ways.
2606696	2613998	Microsoft has recently said that they would like original TV pilots because something that they're going to distribute on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2614338	2619619	Well, now Nintendo has come out and said they're going to be holding this contest called the Shortcut Shortcase.
2620419	2625261	And the top three entries will be premiered at Rockefeller Center's annual Summer Film Showcase.
2626932	2627332	Shortcase?
2627812	2628693	I'm thinking of Shortcake.
2628733	2629213	I must be hungry.
2629914	2631374	The theme is Nintendo.
2631434	2638338	The movies can be action, comedy, drama, whatever, as long as it has Nintendo hardware or Nintendo characters.
2639238	2639819	So there you have it.
2640079	2648903	The first place winner gets $10,000 and a trip to New York for the premiere and a lunch meeting with the Tribeca Film Festival co-founder, Craig Hatkoff.
2649363	2651905	The top three entries all get Nintendo goodies.
2652365	2654446	You have until June 6th to get it together.
2655046	2656567	So there's already a lot of Nintendo...
2657179	2661321	There's already a lot of Nintendo fanboy stuff on YouTube, so this shouldn't be too hard for most people.
2661981	2665402	So, get crackin' if you want to be a famous filmmaker.
2666703	2667003	Yes.
2669064	2680889	Anywho, so one person that's not going to be featured in an upcoming live-action Metal Gear Solid movie would unfortunately be the voice of Snake, David Hayter.
2681389	2685271	He will not have anything to do with the movie Fangirls Cry.
2685451	2686291	That makes me sad.
2687671	2692274	Snake right now, because man, the dude needs a haircut.
2715694	2716674	He looks like Joey Fatone.
2716694	2718035	Snake was running around with a mullet.
2718555	2724777	He looks like he's about ready to join a Ren Faire.
2726618	2726958	I don't know.
2729159	2731280	Snake was running around Metal Gear Solid 2 with a mullet.
2732060	2738042	Yeah, but he has guns and he's not a real special op guy, so... I don't know.
2739023	2739343	Whatever.
2741184	2742124	Speaking of whatever...
2743407	2747469	There's a next generation Wolfenstein in the works.
2748629	2755712	And they're stating that it should be actually out in 2008.
2757333	2760494	It's being put out by Raven.
2761694	2762315	So that's happy.
2762355	2767056	Will it be like the old school Wolfenstein 3D or the more meh Castle Wolfenstein game that came out later?
2767097	2767577	What was that called?
2767597	2768957	Return to Wolfenstein or whatever that game was?
2768977	2770058	Return to Castle Wolfenstein?
2770218	2771378	Yeah, I didn't care for that one.
2771818	2773199	Oh my god, Shane, this was the best taco.
2774694	2781216	It was more like one of those, like, you know, War Sim games.
2782457	2785458	I just liked being able to shoot up like Hitler in the War Mac.
2785518	2787338	That was awesome in the old school 3D game.
2787358	2787758	Remember that?
2789019	2789319	Forget it.
2791339	2792760	Also, oh boy.
2793580	2801323	Speaking of things of a questionable nature, there was a Flash game created about the Virginia Tech Rampage.
2801363	2802303	It was a Flash game.
2802899	2805920	and this game was created by this guy, Ryan Lamborn.
2806400	2814964	And this is interesting, is the response, basically, you know, he made a flash game that was basically, you know, it, you know, kind of glamorized the whole Virginia Tech shooting.
2815084	2817305	You could, you know, take part in it, whatever.
2817485	2819745	Obviously, this is very controversial.
2820506	2823527	But what's interesting is what this author chose to do in response to it.
2823587	2825468	Quote, attention, angry people.
2826228	2830169	I will take this game down from Newgrounds if the donation amount reaches $1,000 U.S.,
2831980	2837563	I'll take it down from here if it reaches $2,000 US and I will apologize if it reaches $3,000 US.
2837663	2843227	Of course, he never really says what the donations will go to besides his pocket.
2843887	2846489	I believe Newgrounds ended up taking the damn thing down anyway.
2847169	2852192	But kind of interesting that he kind of blackmailed the internet to take his game down.
2852212	2856975	He also said that he was joking about the whole, you know, wanting to collect money.
2857415	2859837	Well, unfortunately, a lot of people didn't really take it that way.
2859937	2860397	Yeah, he did.
2860777	2861658	Later, there was an update
2862025	2865907	The donation thing is there as a joke against all the people commanding me to take my game down.
2865947	2869989	I didn't think anyone would donate money to it, and so far my PayPal account has proven me right.
2870689	2871009	I don't know.
2871049	2873671	That seems like an afterthought excuse, doesn't it?
2874051	2881294	Yeah, he's just probably thinking, well, maybe some dumb sucker will, you know... If it was a joke, he would have probably not put his PayPal account on there.
2882575	2883135	What a weirdo.
2884276	2884576	Who cares?
2884916	2889018	It's just some dumbass trying to get attention just like... I mean, I'm all for freedom of speech and all, but...
2889754	2890094	I don't know.
2890374	2892175	And in a way, the media just shouldn't even cover it.
2892775	2893776	And that's really what it should be.
2893816	2898117	I mean, if you don't want this guy to make any money off it, don't fucking cover it so people don't know about it.
2898457	2899938	I don't think anybody would have found it otherwise.
2901178	2902659	Media should take some responsibility.
2902719	2904079	Even the gaming blogs and stuff.
2904459	2906460	Don't fucking cover it if it's in poor taste.
2906540	2907260	Don't write about it.
2907780	2910061	I probably shouldn't even... God, I'm being a hypocrite right now.
2910101	2913562	I probably shouldn't have said anything about it, but it's... Well, it sounds like the game's already down.
2913603	2915343	That's what I'm going off of, so whatever.
2915843	2917704	And we come full circle...
2918291	2920812	GameTap has announced that they're doing an animated series called Revisioned.
2920972	2925194	Each season is going to focus on a game series or game character.
2941438	2950462	So for example, the first series that's up is Tomb Raider, and it's also going to be animated by Warren Ellis, Peter Chung, and Jim Lee.
2951142	2955064	To give you an idea, it's basically Animatrix, but for games.
2955444	2960746	So it's yet another original thing that they're actually doing that's going to be pretty awesome.
2960886	2965048	I'd like to see some DVDs for this, because that might be something worth checking out.
2966514	2967054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2984844	2986205	I never even saw the movies, ever.
2986405	2996231	Although, if you're interested in checking out to see what it's going to look like, they are going to have a little bit on the Tomb Raider GameTap collection website.
2996411	3002314	It's tombraider.gametap.com You can check out a trailer for this new cartoon series.
3004015	3004455	Let's see.
3004555	3007257	Ross Steel in chat says, Animated series on GameTap.
3007357	3007817	Oh, God.
3007857	3009198	It's Captain N all over again.
3010099	3014181	HitStun says, I think Tomb Raider Legend was going to be sold cheap on GameTap, if not free.
3015540	3017061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3042816	3045177	is a toll-free number, but only in the U.S.
3045237	3045737	and Canada.
3046057	3050960	So if you use the Skype line instead, you can be anywhere in the world and still call us for free.
3051780	3052080	All right.
3052900	3056662	Let's go to the phones, and we'll take this call right here.
3057342	3058843	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3058863	3059223	Who's this?
3061724	3062385	Oh, am I kidding?
3062405	3062945	It's DMN.
3063245	3063845	Hi, DMN.
3063885	3064666	What do you want?
3064706	3065406	Oh, I'm so glad.
3065466	3067267	It's really you this week.
3067307	3067667	What's up?
3069007	3070448	Yeah, I'm glad, too.
3070528	3072269	I'm out of impersonations right now.
3073024	3083727	Um, however, I'm calling on behalf of DJ Tyrant, um, to say one thing, and, um, if you'll excuse me, I'll put the phone away from my mouth, because I don't want everyone speaking to it, so, one second.
3084047	3084527	Okay.
3085027	3091228	Okay, now we've gotten that out of the way.
3091668	3094129	Why is, uh, DJ Tyrant so excited about StarCraft 2?
3095449	3098310	DJ Tyrant is OLR's resident Blizzard fanboy.
3099625	3102366	Now I may actually watch the first ten seconds as opposed to the first five.
3129733	3134999	I played StarCraft a little bit in my youth, you know, all those ten years ago.
3136640	3139624	I'm not a huge fan of the real-time strategy genre.
3140504	3141806	Yeah, you know, that's my problem.
3141826	3145149	I never really played StarCraft because I wasn't a fan of the real-time strategy series.
3145169	3149454	I'll tell you, if this announcement, though, had been Diablo 3, I would have had a total fangasm.
3150925	3152726	Yeah, I think you and I both would have.
3152746	3157830	I love Diablo, but seeing as the announcement was happening in Korea, I think everyone did their math.
3158311	3161853	2 plus 2 equals 5 and all that stuff.
3162134	3167838	But I'm also calling to announce the Phoenix Down usage on SDFU.
3167978	3168999	Okay, what's this all about?
3170600	3179567	We put our show on hiatus, one, because I've been going through a lot of personal turmoil, and now that's kind of subsided and I feel my crazy normal self.
3180171	3182512	We're revamping the format of SPFU.
3182592	3191937	For any people who were introduced to my antics in the chat room earlier last year, you know I used to do a little around the horn thing and I scored people's arguments.
3191977	3193398	Well, now we're turning it into a show.
3195439	3204664	DJ Tyrant and three chatters from OLR's chat room will face each other off each week, and the winner gets to finish the show with me.
3206779	3209920	So, wait, now I know you have a lot of special guests that come on.
3209960	3216541	Like, you've had some of the Destructoid bloggers on the program, and you've had bigger names on your program than we've had on this program.
3216901	3218901	So, are you going to invite them to play along with you guys?
3220002	3220682	Oh, absolutely.
3221102	3222622	And I guess you guys can come play, too.
3223422	3225743	Oh, we get to come play DMN's little game, too?
3225763	3226243	How nice.
3226663	3226783	Aww.
3227163	3227303	Aww.
3227383	3228463	Well, maybe I don't want to play your game.
3228783	3229243	I'm just kidding.
3229643	3231584	Well, I'll come on at some point, for sure.
3231744	3232904	I can't speak for the others, but I will.
3234827	3239610	I can't think of anything else, so I guess it's time to hang up on me
3261351	3263373	What's wrong with... What's... Wait, wait.
3263493	3265755	What are you booing Pump It Up Pro for over here, Shane?
3266135	3266656	No, I'm not.
3267436	3268237	What?
3268277	3271920	Sorry, I... Sorry, there's confusion in studio.
3271980	3272601	Give Shane a mic.
3273161	3273442	Damn it.
3274156	3276276	I said, boo, Pump It Up Pro.
3276316	3277417	Why boo Pump It Up Pro?
3277697	3282978	Because it's by the guys that do In The Groove and the step charts suck from what I've seen.
3282998	3283818	Oh, it's that one.
3283858	3287059	Yeah, and it's got crap music and it's terrible.
3287079	3288059	It's alright though.
3288079	3288519	Think about it.
3288539	3291840	It's like In The Groove and Pump It Up having a love child.
3292040	3292900	Shane, put it down for a minute.
3292920	3293760	You're obviously biased.
3293780	3294660	I want to hear Zago's opinion.
3294680	3294840	What?
3295380	3296440	Nah, I mean, I played it.
3296500	3300121	I mean, it pretty much is step mania.
3300221	3303842	It's like End of Mirror found step mania and found a good use for it
3304474	3308376	and just mash Cowboy songs in addition to their banya and K-pop.
3308576	3311137	So Pump It Up and In The Groove had sex and this is their baby.
3311738	3315800	Yeah, you pretty much have modifiers that you would normally find in Step Mania Mines.
3317060	3319422	C400 speed.
3319982	3327486	I mean, it plays pretty much better since it's on the breakout at the high-end cabinet for beta testing.
3328106	3330127	So it has a nice high-def TV to go with it.
3330458	3335039	You know, I was talking with Kyle on email like last month trying to get him on the show and we just lost time.
3335059	3336779	I need to email him again and try to get him on the show.
3337119	3338700	I'd love to have him and Shane on the same show.
3338720	3339480	That would be a good time.
3339500	3341280	I doubt he'll be able to spill the beans.
3341560	3341900	I know.
3341940	3342821	He's pretty tight-lipped.
3342881	3343721	Yeah, it'll still be fun.
3344521	3347262	Anyway, so what else have you been up to in your gaming world lately?
3348082	3357744	Yeah, as I said, not only does Aiden on the breakout pump it up for beta testing, but New Jersey also has 2DX Distorted and Poppin' Music 14.
3359625	3360746	How is Poppin' Music 14?
3361406	3363607	Jesus Christ, they keep cranking those things out.
3363667	3368070	I mean, we're catching up to TGA at this point.
3371412	3372032	What are you doing?
3372092	3372913	Opening a candy bar?
3374594	3375954	No, it's just an oatmeal bar.
3376334	3377635	How is Poppin' Music 14?
3379076	3380037	It's a lot better, though.
3381137	3386180	It's a lot better than the one that I'm used to over in Queens, the Poppin' 8 that I go to.
3386440	3387741	Do you have a case of the Munchies right now?
3388764	3390264	I'm almost, I'm not high though.
3390644	3391945	I'm just a little hungry tonight.
3393105	3400346	Yeah, besides that, just, you know, I just heard, you know, just, you know, pretty up over the whole StarCraft 2 thing.
3400366	3402387	You heard about that.
3402407	3403547	Are you excited about StarCraft 2?
3403787	3405007	Are you a big RTS fan?
3405628	3412189	I mean, it's been, yeah, it's been almost a decade since they actually, you know, it was actually released, the first one, so I've been itching to play it.
3412689	3417650	The only thing that'll bother me is if Koreans, you know, the South Koreans start cheating on it.
3418177	3420158	and start, you know, bringing it down and battling it.
3420838	3422039	Alright, Korea, no cheating.
3422920	3430083	Yeah, that's the only thing I worry about, but if anything, we'll just keep it to a land, you know, we'll just keep it to strictly land games.
3430464	3430784	Alright.
3430824	3432004	Like something you can do after work.
3433045	3436507	I still wish it had been Diablo 3, though, but hey, I'll give it a try.
3437227	3438728	Blizzard puts out some quality shit.
3438808	3441450	I mean, seriously, what has Blizzard done wrong?
3441810	3443391	They're really, I can't think of a lot.
3443631	3446112	The only thing they need is World of Starcraft and that's it.
3447053	3447693	I don't know about that.
3449417	3449697	All right.
3450197	3451457	All right, Saku, we've got to let you go.
3452018	3453818	But have another oatmeal bar for me, buddy.
3454438	3454758	All right.
3454838	3455158	All right.
3455939	3456319	Later.
3457439	3458619	Did you just say whatever to me?
3458879	3459359	I think you did.
3461720	3464080	Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
3464481	3465821	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3465841	3466201	Who's this?
3467241	3468021	Raven Stolfen.
3468141	3469122	Hello, Raven Stolfen.
3469142	3470162	What's on your mind, my friend?
3471762	3474583	Let me turn down the thing, and I'll tell you.
3474763	3478904	Yes, rule number one of radio, turn down the speakers when you're going to be on the program.
3479742	3481023	We don't get that annoying ass echo.
3481063	3482564	Live radio, boys and girls.
3483865	3484646	I'm sorry about that.
3485326	3491631	I'm glad that you played that old To Go song from OLR, from OLR To Go, and the music break that no one knows about.
3491691	3494453	Yeah, I was going to say, the podcast listeners have no idea what you're talking about.
3494493	3499096	But yeah, we played during the break, because we do a break between A and B, we play some music.
3499156	3500017	I can play a clip.
3500357	3502639	Playing clips of music is okay on podcasts.
3502659	3504260	Here's a little clip of Gradius Full Speed.
3504280	3505241	This is our old theme song.
3511909	3516492	How was our old team music back in the day when we were doing a live show and a separate podcast?
3516532	3517272	That was good times.
3517293	3519734	Wasn't that good times when we'd be in the studio for like five hours?
3520074	3520334	No.
3522396	3522876	Anyway, sorry.
3523376	3524817	What did you want to say about the song?
3526779	3531382	It just brings back good memories of listening to you go like, Oh, it's the last radio to go, week of whatever.
3531662	3533483	And I'm like, Oh, it's the last radio.
3534564	3536045	It's one of the really good memories.
3536765	3537986	So it's like a retro thing for you.
3539304	3541425	Yeah, and I didn't just call about that.
3541485	3543605	I did call about Fear in Halo 3 Beta.
3544106	3544986	Hmm, what about that?
3546666	3552328	Well, I've been playing a lot of FPSs in Xbox, and I played Fear for the Xbox.
3552408	3553508	I got it from Gamefly.
3553949	3554209	Mm-hmm.
3555409	3555669	How was that?
3555689	3556629	I thought the game was good.
3556929	3560791	The thing I hate is about the corridors, and everything looks the same when you walk.
3561431	3562271	That's the thing I hate.
3562311	3566432	You always, like, have an hour of looking at it, and then you finally figure it out.
3566492	3567553	That's what I hate about it.
3568113	3568233	Hmm.
3575558	3577999	Do you think that Halo 3 will outsell Halo 2?
3579959	3580919	I do, I do.
3581380	3583520	Because it has my favorite gun, the assault rifle.
3585140	3586501	Just because of the assault rifle?
3587761	3589241	Yeah, just because of the assault rifle.
3589261	3594382	Everyone's been bitching about it on the forums going, we need the assault rifle, we need the assault rifle.
3594622	3595663	The battle rifle sucks.
3597123	3597403	All right.
3598375	3600336	Any other quick words here before we get to another call?
3601717	3603078	Tech and Game Podcast, that's it.
3603298	3603498	Bye.
3603938	3604278	All right.
3604959	3609061	If you want more of the Raven's Dolphin, he has his own podcast, Tech and Games.
3609161	3609681	Check it out.
3610201	3611682	I know he has an OLR community page, too.
3611942	3613863	By the way, I dug up something out of the archive.
3613903	3615864	Here's what Raven was referring to.
3616865	3619346	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 11, 2005.
3622600	3625901	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
3626362	3627362	Oh, good times.
3627462	3628202	Old school memories.
3628362	3628883	There you go.
3631464	3633204	You don't miss the five-hour studio marathons?
3633665	3634465	No, Rob.
3634485	3638107	Well, I would go home literally sick with exhaustion.
3638467	3639027	No.
3639507	3641008	Aren't you glad we're much shorter now?
3641748	3642088	Seriously.
3642108	3642368	Hold on.
3642388	3643089	We picked up another call.
3643129	3644069	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3644089	3644509	Who's this?
3645210	3646250	Hey, it's Dr. Burst.
3646510	3647751	Hey, Dr. Burst.
3648531	3650312	I do not recognize your name as a caller.
3650332	3651032	Are you a new caller?
3651755	3651975	Yes.
3652475	3652855	Awesome.
3653095	3653916	What's on your mind, buddy?
3653956	3654396	New caller?
3656016	3658397	Yeah, I want to comment on the World of Warcraft on 360.
3659297	3661638	World of Warcraft on 360, a very popular topic.
3661658	3662378	What do you want to say about it?
3663479	3665979	Well, I just think, why not?
3666499	3671601	I mean, people want the game, and Blizzard makes more money.
3672021	3672461	Why not?
3673602	3674962	But do they make more money?
3675342	3681444	Because, again, what about the argument earlier about most people that have an Xbox 360 probably have a computer, be it PC or Mac,
3681826	3683467	It's capable of playing World of Warcraft.
3685289	3692094	Well, I have a computer, and I tried the demo for World of Warcraft, and it doesn't work that well.
3693355	3693696	Okay.
3694196	3694997	So, I don't know.
3695037	3702062	Maybe there's something to be said for the achievement point whores of the world, Loki, that might have fun just playing the game to get achievements from it.
3702363	3702683	Who knows?
3703624	3703964	I don't know.
3704024	3704444	Why not?
3704504	3705725	Anybody else in the room care to comment?
3705765	3706546	Why not WoW on the 360?
3707587	3708888	I'd actually be for it.
3709434	3712195	because, like, it's kind of the same thing they did with Final Fantasy XI.
3712615	3726340	I got it on the 360 because my computer, you know, it could run it well enough, but the 360, it's got a set, you know, spec for it, so they're putting it on a system knowing that everybody's going to have the same amount of... It's, like, optimized for 360.
3726380	3727500	Yeah, it's optimized for that.
3727520	3727820	Okay.
3728241	3734843	And so, you know, if they did that with World of Warcraft, give me a keyboard and mouse, I like my TV better than I like my computer monitor, so I would do it.
3735991	3741452	And voice chat built in right there too because you could just do your own little private room with your friend.
3741592	3746854	Rumor is, rumor is that PC version is getting a voice chat patch, but that's a rumor.
3748094	3753015	Well, the thing is too, you probably couldn't do mods on World of Warcraft or 360.
3753655	3754296	That's true.
3754336	3754996	Okay, that's true.
3755076	3755676	Yeah, good point.
3755716	3759777	Is that, you know, one thing that PC gamers on their World of Warcraft love are all the mods.
3760387	3761808	Spam Sentry I tried it on a demo
3784797	3785638	I'm a Guild Wars player.
3785738	3792923	The demo that you downloaded is leading other websites that sell gold to download those demos and spam us.
3792983	3794264	You said you're a Guild Wars player.
3794324	3795285	Why not Guild Wars on the 360?
3797006	3797406	That too.
3797446	3804211	It's just that because it's instance-based and there's so many load screens, it probably wouldn't work that well.
3805853	3808795	Well, WoW has a lot of instances too, especially when you get into Endgame.
3808955	3809215	I don't know.
3810014	3811354	But, I mean, I think about Final Fantasy XI.
3811374	3814875	Final Fantasy XI had freaking loading screens every time you went to a new area.
3815195	3817616	That's one of the reasons I like WoW is that it's very seamless.
3817696	3822617	You only really do loading screens when you go into instances or new continent or when you go to the other continent.
3823477	3824097	But, yeah, I don't know.
3825237	3826557	Well, tell us a little more.
3826737	3827858	We don't often get new callers.
3827898	3830718	So, Dr. Burst, what types of games have you been playing this week?
3831978	3832799	Pretty much Guild Wars.
3833299	3833839	Guild Wars?
3833859	3833979	Yeah.
3834939	3835999	I'm getting back on Guild Wars.
3837199	3837319	Oh.
3837800	3838940	You guys should be looking for a guild.
3839520	3839900	I've got one.
3841185	3843848	I had one like five seconds after I made my account.
3843888	3844849	There's not really a best class.
3862774	3864055	I made the Doctor as a Mesmer.
3893351	3895493	That was my dream.
3895693	3900316	But the thing about Guild Wars is that every job, sub-job combination kind of makes sense.
3900757	3902778	Like, they kind of built it a little smarter in that regard.
3902858	3904239	So, props to Guild Wars for that.
3905720	3909523	Yeah, even the most hated class, Warrior Monk, still works.
3910144	3910444	Yeah.
3911385	3912666	Actually, I think I played a Warrior Monk.
3912686	3914067	I mean, it was like Ghetto Paladin.
3915948	3918890	Alright, well, Dr. Burst, thanks so much for the call and have fun in Guild Wars.
3919010	3921092	And if you see Jamie, you know, nuke her for me.
3922300	3924121	Wait till I'm at least a comparable level.
3925522	3926983	I'm five right now.
3927383	3927883	Keep working.
3927944	3928504	Bye, Dr. Burris.
3928544	3928864	Take care.
3929945	3930225	All right.
3930245	3931125	I love new callers.
3931185	3931946	Don't you love new callers?
3932966	3933407	For dinner.
3934627	3940171	Not that I mind the old callers because I like the old callers too, but it's nice to get some new blood in once in a while.
3940271	3940691	For dinner.
3940831	3941952	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3941972	3942312	Who's this?
3944591	3945852	Hi, it's Kane.
3946012	3947353	Hi, Kane, what's on your mind?
3947373	3950514	I can hear myself a little bit, so just make sure you turn down your speakers.
3950615	3951975	We hear Rob all the time.
3952055	3953416	I know, it's too much of me.
3953496	3954897	We should turn down our speakers.
3955137	3955357	I know.
3955918	3957278	Maybe I'll just... I'm turning down my ears.
3957298	3957739	Okay, that's fine.
3957799	3958559	Screw you all.
3958679	3960260	I will be quiet for this entire phone call.
3960300	3961021	I've got to pee anyway.
3961061	3961921	You guys talk to the caller.
3962341	3963022	Hi, caller.
3963162	3963862	Who is this again?
3964983	3966784	I know, it's too much of me.
3966804	3967904	Rob, come here and fix it.
3969786	3970406	I'm sorry.
3971166	3972047	Okay, now we can hear you.
3972067	3973888	I just want to talk about the whole...
3974574	3988398	Yeah, it would probably be better for most users, but honestly, who wants to pay that extra money just because you have to pay for the subscription and Xbox Live?
3988898	3991298	People do it for PSU.
3992178	3993579	And they're idiots because PSU sucks.
3993759	3994399	Yes, it does.
3994479	3998140	Oh my god, I played that game for like two days and canceled it.
3999235	4000556	I'm a Phantasy Star fanboy.
4000576	4001916	Leave that alone.
4001956	4002776	PSO was great.
4002816	4003737	PSU was terrible.
4003777	4005017	PSO was awesome.
4005618	4006918	I played Blue Burst, though.
4007038	4011960	If you're worried about paying an extra fee to play on Xbox Live, do it the smart way and pay for a year.
4012340	4014081	Then you're not going to really worry about it anymore.
4014101	4018603	You're not going to be thinking, oh, I'm paying this on top of my Xbox Live fee.
4019403	4020443	It really works out nice.
4021544	4023505	Well, yeah, you've got the Xbox Live anyway, right?
4024645	4025065	Who, me?
4025105	4025285	No.
4025445	4026526	Well, I mean, if you're...
4027128	4032452	You don't... Well, if you've got the silver... You got silver, and they made Final Fantasy XI, if I remember right.
4033112	4034833	If you have silver, you could play it online.
4035133	4036694	Why couldn't they do that with WoW also?
4038816	4039096	Owned.
4039456	4039956	That's what it is.
4039976	4040757	I don't know if they will.
4042118	4047081	Well, at any rate, I don't think that it's that good of an idea, because... I mean...
4048362	4053404	World of Warcraft already is... They don't even have any type of controller support on it for PC.
4054124	4057765	So I think that it would be very interesting to see how they'd map something like that over.
4059105	4062426	Yeah, they're probably going to really, really screw up on it when they do.
4063827	4065207	I'm not going to hold my breath on it.
4066828	4068088	You never know until it happens.
4068988	4069549	That is true.
4071629	4074070	And Rob spent the entire time not in this room.
4075350	4076171	Oh, that's cool.
4076551	4077411	I was playing like...
4078321	4079362	I'm here now!
4080982	4082723	And I'm going to break Rob's head.
4083283	4084184	Rob and Loki yell.
4087866	4088126	Okay.
4088946	4090607	Did this guy just threaten to break my head?
4091267	4091848	That's okay.
4091928	4092828	I will break you.
4094429	4095589	Don't break my head.
4095649	4096430	That's not nice.
4097550	4097770	Alright.
4098531	4099711	For that, you get hung up on.
4100792	4101352	Thanks for calling.
4101932	4102352	Alright.
4104313	4105214	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4105234	4105554	Who's this?
4106957	4108438	Hi, this is Chainsaw Juggling.
4109038	4111440	Chainsaw, what's, uh, wait, what is his name?
4111480	4112361	Chainsaw Juggling.
4113601	4120826	Yeah, I just wanted to say I have the new issue of games for Windows, and they have it confirmed that voice chat is coming.
4121427	4122507	Voice chat is coming.
4123748	4128512	Thank God we don't have to buy a vent now, because our guild was seriously thinking about getting a vent.
4128712	4131113	And, dear God, I can hear myself echoing.
4131193	4132114	Am I really that loud?
4132854	4133635	Yes, Rob, you are.
4134594	4135915	Actually, because you have the speakers up right now.
4136055	4136695	Oh, maybe that's why.
4136775	4137695	Okay, I'll back up a little bit.
4138656	4139396	So, oh, that's cool.
4139416	4140597	So they confirmed that for the next patch.
4140617	4140957	That's good.
4141017	4142397	So did they say about how long?
4143558	4146219	Well, it's saying it's coming after the next patch.
4146939	4156163	And then also that what they're going to try and do is make it so that the person's talking their name lights up and you can click on it and then heal that person or trade with them.
4157184	4157904	Huh, that's kind of cool.
4157924	4158864	Wait, so is it...
4160638	4163360	Wait, it's going to be voice chat even not in parties?
4163420	4165821	Like in the Barrens, everybody could have voice chat?
4165841	4166642	That could be horrible.
4167723	4169924	I think it's supposed to be more than a party.
4171205	4176108	Because I don't want to be walking through the Barrens and then suddenly some asshole comes on with a Chuck Norris joke on the speakers.
4176148	4177089	That would kind of ruin the game.
4178229	4180111	That would probably be one of the worst things ever.
4180151	4181231	It would make it better.
4182392	4183453	Loki says it would make it better.
4184033	4184333	All right.
4185574	4187636	ChainsawJuggling, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4188796	4189637	They're adding guild names.
4191664	4192325	They're adding what?
4193505	4194205	A guild bank.
4194866	4195746	A guild bank.
4195846	4196586	Oh, that's kind of cool.
4196626	4198427	So like the entire guild can share one bank?
4199688	4204910	Yeah, and it's supposed to be set up so certain members can only access certain items within the bank.
4206011	4207951	That's kind of cool because some people are doing that already, right?
4207991	4210533	Like they'll set up a dummy character that the guild members can log into.
4210553	4213294	I'm going to let nobody have access to our stuff but me.
4213654	4214274	You're a jerk.
4215315	4215595	All right.
4215875	4217636	Hey, come join our guild if you're a WoW player.
4217676	4218336	We need more people.
4219505	4220945	Yeah, I've got to start over again.
4221005	4223226	I don't have a lot of time, but I'll do it.
4223926	4224046	What?
4224086	4225286	It takes like an hour to get to 10.
4225346	4225607	Come on.
4226587	4227647	We're a casual guild.
4227667	4228667	We don't want a lot of time from you.
4228687	4229688	We just tell dick and fart jokes.
4229908	4230668	No, we don't.
4231968	4233588	It took me about a year and a half to get 40.
4234869	4235569	Oh, snap.
4236109	4237409	Oh, he's a player like me.
4237429	4237990	Yeah.
4238130	4238770	He's a player like me.
4238790	4239490	That's still cool.
4239710	4239970	All right.
4239990	4241030	You can still come join us.
4241210	4241550	All right.
4241690	4247932	Well, thanks for calling Chase on Juggling, and we'll hopefully have you in the WoW guild at some point.
4249110	4249730	All right, see you guys.
4249750	4250190	Have a good night.
4250291	4250731	All right, see you.
4251151	4251671	Thanks, you too.
4252431	4253692	Lots of noobs tonight.
4254312	4255873	This is an interesting change here.
4256613	4257634	Let's do one more call.
4257814	4258834	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4258854	4259194	Who's this?
4260235	4260855	Hey, it's Ranma.
4260875	4261635	What's up, everyone?
4261795	4262416	Hi, Ranma.
4262436	4262976	How you doing?
4263556	4263916	Good.
4264056	4264857	Are you all ready?
4265197	4266097	For Fonamay?
4266577	4267298	Hell yeah.
4267438	4268658	I'm actually very excited.
4268698	4269719	Are you excited, DarkSakura?
4269899	4277402	I am, but I have to find a sewing machine to put my... I'm not... I actually got the skirt for my Jessica costume.
4278558	4283080	But it might not happen, so I'm going to focus on the ninja costume and do that one.
4285181	4285821	That's cool.
4286202	4291964	Because if I knew enough people on the West Coast, I bet you a dollar one of them would be bringing their sewing machine to the con.
4292364	4293024	Probably.
4293165	4294425	I mean, you probably have that anyway.
4295005	4299787	Well, the only problem being is that I actually need the red ponytail wig, and I cannot find one.
4300268	4305870	I do have, though, a long red wig that I'm thinking about just sort of pulling back into a ponytail and faking it.
4307165	4307445	Cosplay!
4307485	4307785	Cosplay!
4336050	4336711	Are we still down for Part A?
4359758	4362701	Why don't I bring my Patron from my last year's birthday?
4362721	4362781	Ooh.
4384542	4388705	I've been drinking some of it, but I can't drink all that tequila by myself.
4388745	4389946	You know me and tequila.
4390006	4390866	You know me and tequila.
4390906	4392868	We don't get along, so you'll be drinking it by yourself.
4392888	4394769	Even good tequila makes me go crazy.
4394949	4396070	Give me a bottle of Malibu.
4396090	4396490	We're good.
4396730	4398351	Rob, let's put in some money for some Grey Goose.
4398571	4398871	Alright.
4399372	4400352	Oh, I got five on that.
4401073	4401333	Alright.
4401833	4403814	Uh, Rama, anything else besides liquor chat?
4405215	4406396	Just about anything.
4406816	4407116	Alright.
4408237	4409398	See you next week, Rama.
4409918	4410358	Next week?
4410378	4411279	Let me see you Friday.
4411299	4411979	Fuck, that's right.
4412019	4412440	See you Friday.
4412480	4412980	See you Friday.
4413376	4414217	Hell yeah, later!
4439278	4439798	I'm going to be 12.
4439858	4441800	You're going to be 30-12?
4441860	4442881	I'm not going to be 30-12.
4442961	4444862	I'm going to be 24.
4445062	4445763	And it's terrible.
4445823	4446623	So I'm actually going to go 22.
4446663	4448465	I'm going to go down a year.
4449385	4450086	At least this year.
4450146	4452027	Maybe next year I'll go back up to 23.
4452688	4453909	But no, I don't have any plans yet.
4453949	4461895	But in the hopes that I come up with something better than going to the anime, I'm going to ditch it.
4462935	4464236	Because I didn't have fun last year, really.
4464477	4466298	So it's not my thing.
4466738	4467619	But I want to buy stuff.
4468300	4468980	and DarkSakura.com.
4491005	4493326	Love Jahi, he's one of my favorite people ever.
4493786	4500227	And Wendell, didn't he completely swear off Tequila because of this?
4501668	4508869	I'm not going to embarrass him over the air, especially since I don't know if he's listening or not, but oh my god, I heard the story.
4509570	4511270	It was monumental.
4512185	4514727	I'm so excited to drink with all my friends.
4539631	4542993	Like seriously, during one part of the program, we just gave Jahi the mic.
4543354	4549298	And for like an hour, he just spouted off these random insane babblings.
4549358	4552140	It was incredible, riveting radio.
4552300	4555102	And yeah, we really probably should wrap up the show now, huh?
4555122	4557664	Because now we're starting to talk about stuff that... Yeah.
4557824	4559005	Like all these personal stories.
4559025	4559965	Afterbirth FTW.
4560165	4560426	Alright.
4560946	4561927	So anyway, we're going to wrap it up.
4562127	4564569	So any last minute stories in studio, folks?
4567591	4568031	I like beer.
4568860	4573325	I'm a level 11 wizard on Puzzle Quest, because it's really awesome.
4573345	4574045	But you're not a nerd at all.
4574766	4577329	Dude, I just like playing the duels.
4577349	4578510	Loki, what the fuck is that you're playing?
4582354	4584175	I'm playing Stick Remover.
4585236	4585717	Sounds exciting.
4585737	4588640	It's on the Duffy blog, the same one that had the cat golf thing.
4588700	4588980	Oh, okay.
4589521	4589901	Sorry.
4590081	4591062	Any last minute stories, Loki?
4592604	4592664	Um...
4594127	4595228	Well, here's a few things.
4595408	4596789	You can get free game.
4596809	4599792	They just posted something on Kotaku about it called Echoes.
4599852	4603074	It looks kind of like Geometry Wars and Asteroids, so that's pretty cool.
4603414	4604235	So check that out.
4607137	4609900	King of Fighters is being made into a live-action movie.
4610680	4611421	Dear God, no.
4611821	4616685	It's being directed by Gordon Chan, a guy from Hong Kong who... Okay, then maybe it'll be cool.
4617005	4622590	...spawned other Asian martial arts flicks like The Medallion, starring Jackie Chan, Fists of Fury, starring Jet Li...
4624320	4625581	And let's see.
4626441	4627801	Okay, then I have a little bit of hope.
4629182	4644726	And also, it looks like Axis Entertainment's Joseph Cho, Appleseed, Ex Machina, and Convergence Entertainment's Tim Kwok of Wicked City, I guess, will handle the production.
4646766	4648707	Sounds like it'll be out in Asia early 2008.
4652069	4655150	And then also one game that's going to be coming out as well for 2008.
4655230	4657351	Winning Eleven 2008.
4657691	4664554	And Konami, apparently, this is coming from Game Wave, a print magazine in Germany.
4665634	4670356	And it's going to have, it says it will be released on multiple platforms, even on the PlayStation 3.
4670656	4675118	Improved defense, more realistic and changed dribbling animations.
4675558	4678259	One-on-one tackles and offside traps will have better results.
4679308	4684612	Better online service, no lag, and full HD support with 18GB storage.
4685332	4687554	So I guess you could dump the game onto the hard drive.
4689295	4689495	Nice.
4695179	4696500	Looks like that's pretty much it.
4696940	4701063	Oh, and Microsoft is asking gamers for Xbox Live Arcade game ideas.
4703244	4704205	LaserCat's the game.
4704245	4705426	Dude, I'm so going to suggest that.
4707120	4713923	I demand, no, I demand the OL Army to mobilize to this thread and request LaserCats the games.
4713963	4714503	Where is this at?
4714523	4715644	Is that on the Gamerscore blog?
4715964	4716264	Wasn't it?
4716364	4717264	I don't remember where it was.
4717324	4720866	Also, Activision wants your input for the next Spider-Man game.
4721986	4722947	How about Don't Suck?
4723587	4724767	How about Don't Make Another One?
4728049	4728409	That's it.
4728549	4730910	How about be able to set Kirsten Dunst on fire?
4731550	4732491	That would be great!
4734511	4736052	I want Kill Gwen Stacy the game.
4737553	4739574	with special supplement KillMJ.
4740655	4743216	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the evening.
4743456	4745197	Loki, since you have the mic right now, your final thought.
4746918	4751181	My final thought is I want to play more Earth Defense Force.
4753262	4756743	Miklatov, thanks for piping in for the last part of the show here.
4756864	4760265	Even though you've been playing Puzzle Quest the whole time, we will still give you an opportunity.
4760305	4762066	Hey, I talked while you were in the bathroom.
4762126	4762587	All right, fine.
4762627	4763327	Give your final thought.
4764565	4768368	I really like that YouTube video of the little kid getting kicked in the face by the breakdancer.
4768428	4770509	Because I've been watching it a whole lot.
4770789	4772030	Good times, good times.
4772090	4773110	I think I have no heart.
4774131	4778954	On some really wrong LiveJournal community, I won't mention that I watch once in a while, there was a picture of...
4779807	4781908	That, and it just said, Babality.
4782388	4785189	That's stupid, because it didn't turn somebody into a baby.
4785209	4785489	It was funny.
4785529	4786569	Kick the baby in the head.
4786589	4787010	It was funny.
4787050	4792271	And then there was a Street Fighter one, too, where they made it look like he did a little flash kick, and it said Guile.
4793152	4795332	I'm going to show it to you, maybe during the afterbirth.
4796893	4802775	Oh, real quick, I was going to say, there was a funny thing that, this is on HMV, I guess, they're going to be doing,
4803491	4808333	They're advertising their Manhunt 2 since it's coming out later this summer.
4808853	4814436	They're adding in that little sticker on it that says, Jack Thompson becomes angry, but then again, he's always.
4815396	4816377	And then it has the date.
4818398	4830403	It just occurred something to me that I think part of the reason why, even though it's just to get his face all over everything, I think that lawyers are required to do a certain number of hours of things that are
4831377	4832498	for the public good.
4832578	4833158	You know what I mean?
4835920	4837000	Yeah.
4837401	4839021	That's exactly it.
4839041	4843824	So I think that that might be his consideration.
4844525	4847546	Well, he's still a twat.
4847666	4848027	He is.
4848427	4852009	He's got like a yeast infection or something.
4852029	4853250	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4855611	4856031	Pay me.
4857952	4860574	My final thought is reject false icons and
4861730	4863211	and DarkSakura never says it anymore.
4863952	4865513	And why don't you ever say that anymore?
4865533	4866374	It makes me a little sad.
4866954	4868035	Reject false icons, Rob.
4868215	4868736	All right, thank you.
4869216	4872779	And my other final thought would be Balthier.
4875861	4876362	Have a great week.
