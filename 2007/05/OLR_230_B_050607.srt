3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Sunday, May the 6th of 2007.

6
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's 5-6-7.

7
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:25,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

8
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here for part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:28,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know...

10
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,954
[SPEAKER_03]: That would only happen once every few years where you get the consecutive numbers like that.

11
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is part B of our podcast.

12
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:40,979
[SPEAKER_03]: If you missed the first half of this episode, please go back over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and check out the first half of tonight's show.

13
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We are taping live on Sunday night here.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back into some video game news.

15
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:47,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

16
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:58,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bastards over at Microsoft decided that it's time to ruin more fun for you, including downloading stuff that you shouldn't be downloading, like demos and stuff from other regions.

17
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently now they're going to be enforcing their Xbox Live demo download region lockouts, and they're going to make it impossible for you to download content from other regions.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you've already downloaded stuff, good for you.

19
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:14,413
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to keep it still.

20
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,115
[SPEAKER_04]: But anything else, fuck yourself.

21
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:19,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it.

22
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:20,777
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't delete your accounts.

23
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see what content's on there, but you can't do shit.

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can look in the store window, but you can't buy.

25
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:26,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

26
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:26,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

27
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and I noticed you came out swinging on this story.

28
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,270
[SPEAKER_03]: The second word out of your mouth was bastards.

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious if you feel personally affected by this because you don't have a Japanese account or anything that you were using, right?

30
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:39,513
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.

31
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:41,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright.

32
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We only got demos for Armored Core 4.

33
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a demo for Tenchu Z last year.

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,557
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not mistaking, aren't they controlling this by IP address lookup, basically?

35
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,158
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're making sure your IP address is in the country you say you're from?

36
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, if that's the case, that's going to be fucking easy.

37
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:00,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's to stop them, yeah, what's to stop them from IP spoofing?

38
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:05,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Or port forwarding, or like, yeah, basically bouncing yourself off a different DNS server.

39
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Here come the hacks pretty soon.

40
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be easy.

41
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:11,296
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

42
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:14,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure you'll get right on that in hacking.

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I will.

44
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's talk about what's coming out to Xbox Live Arcade, in America at least.

46
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about all regions, but I know we're getting it here.

47
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually the arcade releases are pretty much universal.

48
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:34,004
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade, Double Dragon is coming out.

49
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was rumored earlier in the week to be coming out.

50
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:40,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But this got confirmed by a press release coming out of Empire Interactive.

51
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:45,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Speedball is going to be released as well.

52
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Speedball 2.

53
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:49,602
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a sports game featuring robots or something.

54
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:50,963
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

55
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it says, actually, I'm going to correct myself.

56
00:02:55,106 --> 00:03:00,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Speedball 2 is coming within the coming weeks, but Double Dragon is coming out this week.

57
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:04,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't know if Speedball 2 is necessarily this week or not, but we do know Double Dragon is for sure.

58
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had not even heard of Speedball 2 before.

59
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they call it a classic, but somehow I missed that one.

60
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on the Amiga, I think, and stuff like that.

61
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:12,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, that's why.

62
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I still was on the Commodore 64 by the time everybody was talking about Commodore Amiga.

63
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:28,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is actually another game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and that's Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords, which is already on PSP and Nintendo DS, and it's supposed to come out later this year.

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also going to be coming out with Mad Trax, which is like a Penny Racer the game or something.

65
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:41,398
[SPEAKER_08]: and a Rocket Bowl that's mini-golf, but bowling.

66
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Penny Racers really sucked.

67
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,719
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks a lot better.

68
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I had Penny Racers when I was little, though.

69
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks like, well, they had a game called Penny Racer on the Nintendo 64 and it blew up.

70
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:54,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm actually just talking about... Oh, no, wasn't that... No, that was Uniracer I'm thinking of.

71
00:03:55,005 --> 00:04:00,307
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this actually... No, this kind of reminds me of it, except without the old... Like the Micro Machines games, almost.

72
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:01,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

73
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,250
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be kind of... I mean, it has potential to be fun, but...

74
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:13,403
[SPEAKER_08]: But quite honestly, I'll just keep playing Uno and Symphony of the Night.

75
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:19,505
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Puzzle Quest is going to be so awesome.

76
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:20,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

77
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:25,146
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, we have other things coming out, of course, in all the regions of the world.

78
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, lots of good stuff.

79
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not a lot of good stuff, but some pretty good stuff coming out.

80
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 76 Driver Parallel Lines

81
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:02,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing, and Heat Seeker on PSP.

82
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Then of course on, let's see, the PC, not a whole lot coming out.

83
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:16,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Locomania, which sounds like a pretty interesting train simulator, and Circus Empire, which also equally probably boring.

84
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:24,621
[SPEAKER_04]: On PlayStation 3, you've got Big Fat Nada, and of course the Wii, nothing to look at there either.

85
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:25,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally,

86
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:30,663
[SPEAKER_04]: The DS, nothing to see there either.

87
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So a whole lot of nothing.

88
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I know actually I think on PlayStation 2 also .hack//G.U.

89
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Volume 2 is making its way up.

90
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it for the week.

91
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:41,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty light week.

92
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:42,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to start picking up.

93
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,146
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Japan, Rob?

94
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:46,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

95
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, over in Japan we will have Command & Conquer 3 as well, at least hitting the Asia regions, which I imagine a lot of folks who import games, if they want to pick up the Asian version, can get that.

96
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man 3

97
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:24,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple 2000 Series Volume 117

98
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, so it's just games going into this.

99
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, never mind.

100
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're budget games that get released by, like, D3.

101
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Earth Defense Force, for example.

102
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:50,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I get it.

103
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:52,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Zombies vs. Ambulance.

104
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put two and two together.

105
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have the ZeroSend, and you'll be happy to know here it is.

106
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The ZeroSend is coming out on PlayStation 2.

107
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:00,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if I can only download all of them.

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like planes blowing shit up.

109
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it looks like 1941 all over again.

110
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:04,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

111
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Psycho 2, Lady It's... Okay

112
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a board game simulator.

113
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's Shogi.

114
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:45,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, isn't part of the fun about this segment getting to hear me butcher Japanese pronunciation?

115
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,861
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the big, big, big release this week.

116
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,021
[SPEAKER_07]: That means greatest something.

117
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:59,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this might be why you don't see much coming out this week, because finally when I got to the bottom of the page and saw the PSP releases, Final Fantasy Tactics coming out in Japan this week, the PSP version there.

118
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure that's what you'll all be playing and importing this week.

119
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rest of the games just kind of don't matter anymore.

120
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,560
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the Europe release dates, Jamie?

121
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't I tell you about them, Rob?

122
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,145
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 9th, we have Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.

123
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:30,656
[SPEAKER_08]: The 11th brings us 32nd America's Cup of the Game on PC, Busted Move Bash on Wii, Driver 76 on PSP, Go Puzzle, PlayStation 3, Hard Rock Casino on PS2 and PSP, and for the DS, we also have Picross DS and Turn It Around.

124
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to bash the Bust a Move series after this many years.

125
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:35,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Go away.

126
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't come back.

127
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:40,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I want, like, a new actual Bust a Move, not a Puzzle Bobble.

128
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:45,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Bust a Move on the PlayStation 2 with the artwork that had the baby on it?

129
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:48,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, what in the fuck shit is this game?

130
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, didn't they have Bust a Move on the PlayStation 1?

131
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Bust a Move was on the PlayStation 1, right?

132
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't start on the PlayStation 2, if I remember correctly.

133
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:55,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

134
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've been on every platform.

135
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:58,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the U.S.

136
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Bust a Move, Puzzle Bobble.

137
00:08:59,506 --> 00:08:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

138
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:00,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I meant.

139
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:00,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

140
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,882
[SPEAKER_04]: The Japanese one, you know, you could emulate that on your PSP.

141
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:07,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

142
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, there's the workarounds.

143
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:10,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee!

144
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:13,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hooping and hollering and screaming out of pure joy.

145
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:18,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've never played Puzzle Bobble in my entire life out of the 50 times it's come out on the console.

146
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played Puzzle de Pon, which is almost the same thing.

147
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,654
[SPEAKER_08]: You should play Puzzle in Desert, it's fun.

148
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:25,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

149
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:26,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

150
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Warhawk.

151
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:28,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Warhawk.

152
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:30,861
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

153
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

154
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're so funny, Loki.

155
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:34,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad we have you on this program.

156
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:35,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Or go fuck yourself.

157
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:37,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

158
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:51,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for anybody who likes their, you know, nifty looking skins for, you know, or versions of their DS, as I point to Andrew with his old school Nintendo.

159
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: His Walmart bot cover for his DS.

160
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:56,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

161
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got the finger.

162
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I have one that's sent by Miyamoto.

163
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one that's signed by me and that's more awesomer.

164
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:12,423
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Golden DS Lite that has a backlit die-cast sword and shield crest.

165
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:20,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a custom charge stand and two painted styli in silver and black.

166
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:27,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way that anyone's going to be able to get one is to get it on eBay.

167
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:27,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

168
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:29,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have custom stuff.

169
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I need custom stuff.

170
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

171
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,951
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

172
00:11:55,376 --> 00:12:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great cause and everything, but I'm just waiting for Nintendo to steal the ideas.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,103
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Sony will release another PSP which will have the Zelda shield on it with the sword.

174
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't make any sense, but they copied it, so that's all that matters.

175
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just call it Dark... What was that game?

176
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The Soul Calibur.

177
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,291
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what the hell was that game?

178
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:13,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Cloud.

179
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:14,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Cloud, thank you.

180
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:15,833
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll call it the Dark Cloud cover.

181
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,254
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a new Dark Cloud game.

182
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:24,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there was an interview with Iwata...

183
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:30,879
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking a little bit about the state of Nintendo and a little bit about the releases.

184
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically saying that they're going to see a brand new Mario, Metroid, and Smash Bros.

185
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,945
[SPEAKER_04]: game in 07.

186
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So all three of those games are probably coming out around Christmas.

187
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to make their big splash.

188
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,872
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are coming this year.

189
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,414
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what's planned so far.

190
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be surprised if they move to next year.

191
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:59,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, dates under consideration, or dates subject to change, or whatever that crap is they always get away with doing to us.

192
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

193
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be coming out soon.

194
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to be honest, who's really surprised that, like, Metroid Prime 3 or whatever is coming out in the fall?

195
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: They gotta have something for this Christmas.

196
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:09,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, woohoo!

197
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought that would be coming around Christmas.

198
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:15,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me I can play it on the internet and I'll get tons more excited.

199
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

200
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:20,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me I don't have to use friend codes anymore and I'll blow a load.

201
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be very excited.

202
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:23,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

203
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:27,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this news made me about that excited.

204
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did, because this is one of my favorite, all-time favorite 80s Commodore 64 games ever.

205
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Impossible Mission.

206
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:39,557
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is incredible, incredibly great for the Commodore 64.

207
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:45,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's one of those games that my memories of it are way fonder than the way the game actually is, so don't try to tell me any difference.

208
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But however, the important thing about Impossible Mission is that it is coming out on the Virtual Console.

209
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the trick.

210
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:56,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not... You'll notice it's a Commodore 64 game, or was a Commodore 64 game.

211
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,781
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is not...

212
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:02,779
[SPEAKER_03]: A, like, you know, the rumors were that Commodore 64 was coming to Virtual Console.

213
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not simply a rehashed Impossible Mission.

214
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:14,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it is Impossible Mission with now, like, updated, also they're going to do updated mode with, you know, new graphics and all that stuff.

215
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, a new version of Impossible Mission with the retro one included.

216
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:21,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can think, like, a lot of those Xbox Live titles are kind of like this, right?

217
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But the interesting thing about this is that would make Impossible Mission the first Wii download title

218
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:29,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Actraiser, PSP, DS

219
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited.

220
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:02,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what's coming out to the UK Virtual Console?

221
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:04,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtua Fighter 2!

222
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, however, it is the Mega Drive version.

223
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, which over here, I do believe the Mega Drive was the Genesis.

224
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's going to be the crap version.

225
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I am not a fan of Virtua Fighter.

226
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,701
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband's a big Virtua Fighter fan.

227
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the Tekken girl of the house, but

228
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:32,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtua Fighter 2 made me cry, except that I did try the trick where you could hit Kage over and over and over again and knock off his mask.

229
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,167
Fuck them both, Soul Calibur.

230
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:41,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the right now that's out on the, that's coming out this week for a virtual console in the UK.

231
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:48,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this makes me happy, is Wonder Boy and Monster World, which I would really love, because I actually do own that game.

232
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very fun.

233
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,636
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too bad we don't have Master System games.

234
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,324
[SPEAKER_08]: for Virtual Console because I would love to have Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

235
00:15:59,444 --> 00:15:59,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

236
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:00,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet.

237
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a new Daytona game.

238
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that so much to ask?

239
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the theme song.

240
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I want any new Sega game to not suck.

241
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that too much to ask?

242
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:12,986
Yes.

243
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I may continue.

244
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:19,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Also out is Shockman, which was a PC Engine game.

245
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:25,528
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually in the Shibing... Let me start over.

246
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:31,946
[SPEAKER_08]: SheBeanMan series is called Shockman, which is basically like, you know, we're going to be Mega Man, but not really.

247
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,026
[SPEAKER_08]: There were a lot of PC Engine games that were like that.

248
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:41,928
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have Atlas Kid and the Enchanted Castle, also a Genesis slash Mega Drive game.

249
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, Virtua Crap 2.

250
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:45,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

251
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Virtua crap.

252
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why I take in my Virtua toilet.

253
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:55,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking a shit in Second Life.

254
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:57,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Or PlayStation Home.

255
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:01,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.Horizontalradio.com comments, Actdeft is cheering you on.

256
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Daytona on VC.

257
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:04,751
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, oh shit, yes, Loki.

258
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:05,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely pop-up?

259
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:07,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not on VC.

260
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about a fucking brand new game.

261
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like a redoing Sigarelli.

262
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:11,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Daytona 2.

263
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:13,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a newer game.

264
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:14,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Daytona 3.

265
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:15,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousand.

266
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Million.

267
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Million.

268
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Death Race Daytona Edition

269
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:41,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Alien Hominid is awesome.

270
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:06,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

271
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:08,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think they should do that for, like, completing a game.

272
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, getting, like, all 1,000, you know, achievement points or something like that.

273
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:12,923
[SPEAKER_04]: They should do that.

274
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how expensive can this be to put out?

275
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:17,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They are charging me $60 for a goddamn video game, right?

276
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:18,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

277
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:24,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe they, I guess, well, because of rentals and stuff, maybe they want to make sure people actually own the game or something.

278
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:24,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

279
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little something special for actually owning the game.

280
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Because back in the 2600 days, they didn't rent video games.

281
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

282
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:32,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss that.

283
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,414
[SPEAKER_03]: One way that you might want to train for winning those trophies is playing other video games because video games are good for you.

284
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:47,177
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's according to Yahoo, who this week ran a story about five ways that video games can make you better, stronger, and faster.

285
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:49,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I'd share those with you again coming from Yahoo.

286
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,040
[SPEAKER_03]: They can improve your eyesight is one.

287
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was from a March 2007 study at the University of Rochester because it tested college folks.

288
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently after 30 hours of gameplays,

289
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:10,311
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones who played the games outperformed the ones who didn't play the games in their ability to accurately pick out objects in a cluttered space.

290
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can play Where's Waldo better.

291
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I sit close to a TV, that's supposed to ruin my eyesight.

292
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:18,015
[SPEAKER_04]: This will actually help me as well.

293
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:23,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I play a game on the TV and sit too close, it'll kind of wash.

294
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:25,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

295
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to run a separate study on that.

296
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, they can help you focus.

297
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're relating this to, you know, folks that have like ADHD, you know, they don't have the ability to focus and stuff and like playing a video game forces you to focus.

298
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But I beg to differ because I have gaming ADD.

299
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I never beat video games anymore.

300
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I play them for five hours and then get sick of them.

301
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:49,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sick.

302
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they mean not necessarily over long term.

303
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they mean for periods of time.

304
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it's not for long term.

305
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,630
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not gaming ADD.

306
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:00,371
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just called, this game is fucking boring.

307
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, what were you talking about?

308
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, look, a bird!

309
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:07,318
[SPEAKER_13]: If you get the reference.

310
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:11,479
[SPEAKER_04]: They focus so much that they play and forget about their families and get divorces.

311
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Step number three, they can help you lose weight.

312
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, DDR, iToy Kinetic, Wii Sports.

313
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:21,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Or gain a lot of weight, depending on which game it is.

314
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:27,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, they can help you understand classic literature.

315
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You spoony bard!

316
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:40,788
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, Halo is being used by Roger Travis, who is an associate professor of modern and classical languages at the University of Connecticut.

317
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:51,396
[SPEAKER_03]: He uses the Halo story as some type of comparison to his stories, the Homer epics.

318
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's a story to Halo?

319
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:56,820
[SPEAKER_08]: How does Halo sound like the Odyssey or the Iliad?

320
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, specifically, I think he's citing Aenid.

321
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,058
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Virgil.

322
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:01,738
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't Homer.

323
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:05,780
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Virgil taking inspiration.

324
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

325
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there headshots in the Aenid?

326
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

327
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to read through this story here.

328
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,783
[SPEAKER_07]: The Aenid was by Virgil.

329
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:14,704
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is that?

330
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:15,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

331
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:17,905
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the story does say that.

332
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then why did they say, up here, they say Homer.

333
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was inspired by Homer.

334
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You want literature, you play Zenisaga.

335
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You want literature, you fucking read a book.

336
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:28,828
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

337
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And step five, they can literally save your life.

338
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are saying... Trauma center!

339
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:48,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, not just trauma center, but Dr. James Rosser of New York's Beth Israel Medical Center says to his patients that he's awesome at Super Monkey Ball because his hand-eye coordination helps in surgeries.

340
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:51,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want him in the doctor.

341
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:51,664
[SPEAKER_03]: He co-authored a study.

342
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:53,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, seriously, I'm moving to New York.

343
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

344
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Five ways that video games are good for you.

345
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I'm looking into the chat room there.

346
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:05,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So would that be like, you know, hey, I'm a great proctologist.

347
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I practice a lot on Oonga Boonga.

348
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:10,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

349
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,183
[SPEAKER_03]: James Patrick defending Halo a little bit, Loki.

350
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:14,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo has a lot of story.

351
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is just not in the game.

352
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:17,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's called sarcasm.

353
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:20,845
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then I won't read the rest of his comment.

354
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:26,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandalus is making a Shakespeare reference saying, do you bite your thumb at me, sir?

355
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know why he did that, because remember when we went miniature golf?

356
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:30,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We went miniature golfing with Vandalus the other night.

357
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:32,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually went to Golfland and golfed.

358
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:33,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami was there, too.

359
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was out there quoting Shakespeare.

360
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.

361
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:49,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, I think I actually impressed... I think I actually impressed William, because he kind of looked over at me and he was kind of like, you actually know Shakespeare?

362
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I pointed at Miss Oscar.

363
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:56,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to point out, you might want to turn your mic on once in a while.

364
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:57,084
Fuck.

365
00:22:57,504 --> 00:22:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

366
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I pointed out the best, though, Shakespeare fact of all.

367
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,327
[SPEAKER_08]: In the play Hamlet, the word bunghole is in it.

368
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:09,969
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the type of girl that stayed after class to look up shit in the dictionary, weren't you?

369
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,311
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was not.

370
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:13,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what we did.

371
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I would stay behind to look up the entomology behind it.

372
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:19,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Disgusting.

373
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:23,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Originated from the Latin word shite.

374
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,807
[SPEAKER_08]: No shite's the British deviation.

375
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:30,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why DarkSakura is in charge of the mailbag.

376
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:34,174
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very familiar with shit.

377
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:35,075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

378
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:36,436
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very familiar with shit.

379
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, she's perfect for reading your emails.

380
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:39,658
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

381
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,100
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting emails.

382
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of what makes this show so special is that we have the interaction with our listeners.

383
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:47,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it the Skype line, the chat room, or emails.

384
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:58,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com DarkSakura, open up the mailbag and pull out some shitty email to read.

385
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:04,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the first email of the evening is sent to us by Ion671.

386
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:17,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR guys and girls, I was looking at the screens for Eye of Judgment and while I'm not going to buy a PS3 for some aspects, the fact that you can see your animated monsters in your hand on screen

387
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,308
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, seems like a cool idea.

388
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:21,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Now developers just have to use it, maybe I'll follow.

389
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad Nintendo doesn't have the camera.

390
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing your Pokemon next to you on screen, think about it.

391
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,156
[SPEAKER_03]: A good idea?

392
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:28,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

393
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:33,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit when I first saw it at E3, I was kind of like, huh, well that's kind of neat.

394
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a next-gen system seller?

395
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,524
[SPEAKER_03]: No effing way.

396
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Because seriously, I don't see why they couldn't have done this last gen.

397
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,629
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so special about the Eye of Judgment, really?

398
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

399
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:45,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

400
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:48,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Stadium Pokemon Stadium

401
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:24,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, next email comes from our friend overseas that wrote us last week, from Matt.

402
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:32,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Orange Jones Radio, I'm writing you this week to answer the question posed in Part B of your podcast last week about the European Bimani community.

403
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:38,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say that where I am, it is alive and well, although I wouldn't describe it as thriving like California.

404
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Finding a machine here in Italy is pretty difficult unless you go to a bigger city like Milan or Torino.

405
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:51,949
[SPEAKER_08]: The arcade culture that is so fragile and dying where we come from kind of never existed here, as culture phenomenon video games are really frowned upon.

406
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:58,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you were playing Winning Eleven, then you were automatically labeled as Sfigato, the Italian equivalent of a nerd.

407
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:06,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, where you do find machines, they're always in immaculate condition and have a sizable community around them.

408
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,823
[SPEAKER_08]: The vibe I get from the European scene is like it was for me in 2002 in Tennessee.

409
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,725
[SPEAKER_08]: No websites like DDR Freak or communities of that nature exist,

410
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:17,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, everyone by name who plays regularly, and that's pretty cool.

411
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:23,278
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, DDR Freak was around in 2002 because I was a moderator in 2002 when it was NorCal only on the green board.

412
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that it's not like it is in California, right?

413
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the machines are all torn up and dirty?

414
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I guess the perception of what the Mamani scene is like here...

415
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Must be different over there, because I'll tell you, it's, you know what, go look at the DDR freak like NorCal, SoCalForums.

416
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of retrospective posts about how the community used to be.

417
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:47,764
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the last great DDR tournament you went to, DarkSakura?

418
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:49,264
[SPEAKER_08]: B3.

419
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:51,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Then how many years ago was that?

420
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the one I ran.

421
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many years ago was all this, though?

422
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:54,567
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple years.

423
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:57,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it was within Orange Lounge Radio's history.

424
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was in, what, 2003?

425
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:57,669
2003?

426
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was 03 is when B3 happened.

427
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long time ago.

428
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:03,655
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

429
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,948
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,361
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is an equal opportunity bitch, actually.

431
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:17,915
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just whenever the opportunity hits me.

432
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Just especially to foreigners because she hates British people, right?

433
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,060
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I want to move there.

434
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear British listeners, send me a ticket, please, and I'll rub you.

435
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she just wants to stalk David Tennant.

436
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, next email.

437
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,107
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't want to stalk David Tennant.

438
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go drinking.

439
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:36,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

440
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,471
[SPEAKER_03]: With Billy Piper and then hope something happens.

441
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:39,892
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

442
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:40,132
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

443
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,584
[SPEAKER_08]: She's pretty, but not my type.

444
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:42,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

445
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:43,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

446
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email comes from Necky.

447
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:48,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of one of our listeners from the UK.

448
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR, how's you?

449
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week's Don't Give a Shit episode was amazing.

450
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:56,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Be sure to get Warrior Bob back on as he is really cool.

451
00:28:57,316 --> 00:29:02,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, after hearing the whole Sony God of War goat fiasco, I was left feeling a little hoarse.

452
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Giggle.

453
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, Dead and Furious.

454
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:09,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of... Let me finish with email people.

455
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:17,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of this game about two months ago, my home site, dscommunity.co.uk, and it really doesn't look like that great.

456
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:18,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the screenshots?

457
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:20,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I don't like, but you're open to your opinion, though.

458
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,034
[SPEAKER_08]: On the theme of dead, touch the dead.

459
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:29,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy works in a fucking plug for his website every time he sends us an email and Jamie falls for it every time.

460
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to point out.

461
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:31,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't fall for it.

462
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually... No, it's cool.

463
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:35,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for promoting the indie websites.

464
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just giving this guy a hard time because he works it into every email.

465
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

466
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Lord of the Rings Online is a bitch.

467
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,221
[SPEAKER_08]: My mate has been trying to install it on his Vista since the day it was released.

468
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:51,103
[SPEAKER_08]: With Rob saying the game sucks, kind of influences my decision.

469
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, worth it or not?

470
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:57,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing left to say except the new Guitar Hero 2 song packs kick ass.

471
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hell yeah, they do.

472
00:29:59,166 --> 00:29:59,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, bye, Nikki.

473
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion is so my game at the moment.

474
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:02,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Played it loads.

475
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion is incredible.

476
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I just wanted to say, if you want to try Lord of the Rings, it's actually really easy.

477
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:20,087
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is you can go to any computer store and you can get a trial disc for like $2, except the only problem is it's labeled World of Warcraft because the game rips it off in every single way.

478
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, first of all, UK.

479
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Second of all, they're trying to install it on Vista and it's not working.

480
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:32,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can play World of Warcraft on Vista and I'm pretty sure they have the same trial thing in the UK because you can download them now.

481
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:33,054
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean...

482
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:36,038
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different than World of Warcraft.

483
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:41,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to say Lord of the Rings is not fun, and I already played it when it was called World of Warcraft.

484
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them judge for themselves.

485
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

486
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:45,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you listening to this show?

487
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,406
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to judge it for you.

488
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:47,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

489
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:49,909
[SPEAKER_03]: If you beg to differ, email nasty things to us.

490
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:50,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

491
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,852
[SPEAKER_08]: This comes from Osfer.

492
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like somebody new.

493
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't drunk, Osfer.

494
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise.

495
00:30:58,035 --> 00:30:59,316
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Osfer, not Osfer.

496
00:30:59,336 --> 00:30:59,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

497
00:30:59,557 --> 00:30:59,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

498
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, this is Osfer.

499
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:03,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say that I love the show.

500
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:08,683
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are sort of like a radio version of Attack of the Show from G4 TV.

501
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We know you meant it as a compliment, so we'll take it that way.

502
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:14,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what?

503
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,991
[SPEAKER_03]: When I met Kevin Pereira, he was really cool.

504
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:22,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say anything negative about the people on that show because they are really talented and all that jazz.

505
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,130
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

506
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:38,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just wanted to know, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky, how good are all of you at DDR and Beatmania?

507
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:41,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I suck at Beatmania, but I still love the game.

508
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,882
[SPEAKER_08]: As for DDR, I'm fairly decent.

509
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:57,326
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to difficulty, I'm able to do 10 footers like Max Unlimited, getting a grade of B, and Zephyr Oni, getting an A. As for my perfect attack, it needs work, but I'm not able to AAA anything in the arcade, yet I've AAA'd lots of songs on Heavy at home.

510
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,628
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I actually was pretty far up there, and then...

511
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I just get really, really, really exhausted really easily, so.

512
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:26,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be pretty good at DDR, especially when we started this show.

513
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I was beating nines regularly.

514
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:32,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ever quite have the stamina to clear a lot of tens.

515
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:36,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I could clear bag, but I couldn't really do the max 300s because there's just too much stamina.

516
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I got bag once.

517
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But my perfect attack was good.

518
00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:44,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually AAA'd quite a few seven and eight footers in the arcades, and I actually would participate in tournaments.

519
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came in fourth place in a couple of them.

520
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the highest I ever got is fourth place.

521
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:51,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, that's still a pretty decent showing for me.

522
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:52,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very proud of myself.

523
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But I suck now, but I don't have a good excuse like Jamie.

524
00:32:55,921 --> 00:33:00,663
[SPEAKER_03]: My excuse is I got fat, and that makes me not so good at DDR anymore.

525
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I lost all my stamina.

526
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be good.

527
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:09,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be able to do hard kata's and even my wonderful edits on doubles all the time.

528
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:15,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I can do sevens and eights and stuff, but it really kicks the crap out of me.

529
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I don't have the stamina for it anymore.

530
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,349
[SPEAKER_04]: If I played all the time, maybe...

531
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Just had a DDR machine in my house or something, that'd be different.

532
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I got really lazy with Beatmania, though, after not having a reliable machine to play on.

533
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we were playing 2DX7 style for a long time when we had it at Scandia.

534
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:37,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And Beatmania, I went from crappy to really crappy.

535
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:46,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But I had actually just started beating Seven Stars, because you were there when I beat Nine O'Clocks and...

536
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:48,743
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

537
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

538
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just kind of bored of it.

539
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care about 2DX anymore.

540
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

541
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is another bit more to this email.

542
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:28,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, when it comes to DDR Supernova 2, where the hell is the info?

543
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:33,269
[SPEAKER_08]: But this time last year, we practically knew most of Supernova 1's song list.

544
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you think Konami is keeping this under wraps?

545
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for reading, Ossifer.

546
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:41,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, they actually tried to keep it under wraps last year, as far as I was aware.

547
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they do keep it under wraps.

548
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's like Max 2, where we didn't see that shit coming until it was there.

549
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,420
[SPEAKER_04]: That made it exciting.

550
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a surprise.

551
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:55,602
[SPEAKER_04]: In Extreme, or not Extreme, but Supernova, it was like, here's everything.

552
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not exciting.

553
00:34:57,502 --> 00:35:01,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I would totally love, though, to have an unlock system the way that Max did.

554
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:06,924
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, to have stuff come out over time, which encourages people.

555
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:09,985
[SPEAKER_08]: The more that you play, the sooner you're going to get stuff coming out.

556
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:11,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that would be really fun.

557
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,436
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember how we would congregate around the machine?

558
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:16,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember.

559
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:20,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And say, okay, we have to do this many more until we get our next song.

560
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, DDR needs a card system in the US, and it needs something more battle-y.

561
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to become a more competitive game.

562
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the game could evolve, but no one's listening to me.

563
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:36,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And battle mode, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is not enough, because it's not the focus of the game.

564
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,411
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a PS to this.

565
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, I don't consider myself to be that great at DDR yet.

566
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

567
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:41,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

568
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:46,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I've met MegaManX and he lives pretty close by here in Northeast Ohio.

569
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:49,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

570
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:53,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think... This is my opinion on gaming, especially in a competitive sense.

571
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Why make a competition of it?

572
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Why just not have fun?

573
00:35:58,927 --> 00:35:59,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

574
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:00,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not just have fun with it?

575
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:03,488
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I remember reading... Actually, you know Foxtrot, right?

576
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,249
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sunday comic in the paper.

577
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how the little girl was trying to make...

578
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:13,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a paper airplane or something.

579
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:15,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And her dad's like, oh, let me show you.

580
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you want to have the best?

581
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:17,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you want to be this?

582
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:19,349
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, no, I just want to have fun.

583
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And no offense to this guy or his ego, but I have no idea who that guy is, he just said.

584
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who that is.

585
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Neither do I. I have no idea.

586
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:35,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's nice, but I'm good at DDR apparently, but I don't, you know, he's not that famous.

587
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:36,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, neither are we.

588
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:39,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I've got to open up the usual can of worms.

589
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:44,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what other game had a battle system that was actually pretty decent?

590
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:44,953
[SPEAKER_13]: In the Groove.

591
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:46,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess who swallowed that up?

592
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

593
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I think In the Groove was the same damn game as DDR.

594
00:36:52,497 --> 00:36:54,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a different wrapping.

595
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what game had a battle system?

596
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Step Mania.

597
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess which one became In the Groove?

598
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not want to have this debate again.

599
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob from Sakura Maxx.

600
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Jamie, just made a quick email to say pump up the volume rocks.

601
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,436
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite class in Ragnarok Online?

602
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:09,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Acolytes.

603
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:12,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a super Acolyte, but I played Assassins.

604
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually managed to get an Assassin Cross on one of my free servers.

605
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:21,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Still youngest listener who wants to blow shit up and hopes you get eaten by a Gru.

606
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:29,793
[SPEAKER_03]: When I played Ragnarok Online, I played an Acolyte who had a bow in his hair because he was cute and pretty.

607
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my wallpaper on my phone for a long time.

608
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:32,174
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

609
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:32,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a bad Acolyte.

610
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,077
How much they suck.

611
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:16,617
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course we'll feature a wonderful mix of music from a bunch of different games and should be performing at the Nokia Theater around October 19th.

612
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:17,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually pretty cool.

613
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:26,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, I actually really want to go to E4ALL, even though I've heard the talk about it's nothing more than a glorified EB Games.

614
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:28,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I just kind of want to go to that atmosphere.

615
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:33,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously the opportunist in me sees that it's a great promotion opportunity for our show.

616
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just kind of want to go and check it out.

617
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:37,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be fun.

618
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:44,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing too, to be honest, it sounds a lot more exciting than the E3 this year.

619
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:47,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Even looking at E3's show four plans, stuff like that, it's like,

620
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:49,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

621
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:50,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's awesome.

622
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, but E3 wasn't supposed to have the glitziness this year.

623
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure we're just a little bitter for not getting invited, which is true.

624
00:38:58,644 --> 00:38:59,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

625
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm kind of excited about E4ALL.

626
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:02,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I definitely want to go.

627
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:05,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we all can go.

628
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:06,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

629
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,330
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

630
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

631
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:09,972
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

632
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:11,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

633
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:15,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Some controversy going on this week with Blizzard, of course.

634
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:19,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's earlier been said that they are going to be announcing a new game on May 19th.

635
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh my God, is this blown up.

636
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I don't know who to believe.

637
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:26,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Because folks are saying, oh, leaked, it's StarCraft, the MMO.

638
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a StarCraft MMO that's coming out.

639
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:32,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's World of StarCraft, even though that name would make no sense at all because it's more than just a world.

640
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:33,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, why are you twitching?

641
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:34,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think they would do that.

642
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:35,683
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

643
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:36,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

644
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:37,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Compete with World of Warcraft.

645
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:38,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew's twitching.

646
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to know why he's twitching.

647
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:43,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, we don't need another MMO from Blizzard.

648
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:52,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, I know competing with yourself is actually good for business sometimes, but I don't think it would be such a good idea here.

649
00:39:53,330 --> 00:40:05,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, just adding fire to this rumor, Vivendi was giving a presentation to Wall Street and said, quote, all Blizzard franchises will become MMOs, which strikes me as hilarious because to me,

650
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: and I know Blizzard fans are going to get pissed but honestly to me World of Warcraft does already feel like World of Diablo to me honestly like the game plays very similar to me so I don't know what the big deal is but whatever but then Blizzard quickly responded to that quote the rumor is not true in regards to Blizzard we believe the rumors circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of information provided to industry analysts bottom line you don't know shit until May 19th period

651
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to hear every rumor under the sun.

652
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:38,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't know for sure until May 19th.

653
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:40,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I think it's StarCraft 2.

654
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:43,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not an MMO.

655
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:47,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just StarCraft 2 the way the StarCraft fans want their sequel to StarCraft.

656
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:50,753
[SPEAKER_13]: It damn well better be StarCraft 2.

657
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy with that.

658
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:55,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there you have it.

659
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens when the big announcement is made.

660
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:26,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of big announcements, and this is actually a very, very big announcement to me personally, is that one of our gaming legends, well, I should say legends in game making, Don Bluth, who brought us, you know, Dragon's Lair, is working on a Dragon's Lair movie that's a prequel to Dirk the Daring's whole ordeal outside of the Dragon's Lair.

661
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:27,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

662
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:37,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it actually will legitimately have a tie-in and be a little bit better than Dragon's Lair 2 was.

663
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon's Lair 2 was the acid trip game, I'm so sorry.

664
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,023
[SPEAKER_08]: But there better be gruesome, gory skeleton deaths in it.

665
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:46,783
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be really awesome.

666
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:49,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

667
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:54,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I feel about the Dragon's Lair franchise being milked to death 20 years past its prime.

668
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:56,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's not going to be as awful as the old cartoon was.

669
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

670
00:41:58,389 --> 00:41:59,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I feel about this.

671
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in the end, I will judge based on the product that's delivered, but, you know, I don't know.

672
00:42:04,574 --> 00:42:08,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have so much love for Dragon's Lair in my heart, and believe me, I do have a lot of love.

673
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely loved the Commodore 64 version of the game, if for nothing else, but I thought the music was some of the best soundtracks, like, ever in an 80s game.

674
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:18,145
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah.

675
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:18,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

676
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:29,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of 80s cartoons, you probably heard this week that they put up the first episode of the 1980s version of the Pac-Man cartoon on Xbox Live Marketplace.

677
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:29,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

678
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:30,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

679
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not hear that.

680
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:32,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for free download, too.

681
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:32,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

682
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:33,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Already?

683
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:34,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Already.

684
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:36,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit, I missed that.

685
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:36,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to check that out.

686
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:37,939
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

687
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was funny.

688
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:42,062
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD in chat says, Dragon's Lair franchise.

689
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a franchise.

690
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:44,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one arcade game that was innovative.

691
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:46,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a sequel because they had the sequel.

692
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,322
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

693
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:17,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out, though, for a low, low price of $29.95.

694
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty much, you know, the GameCube or PlayStation 2 version with tacked on Wii controls and going to have the bonus content that was also available on the PlayStation 2 version as well.

695
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:34,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you think that's worth $30, then definitely worth picking up.

696
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

697
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:38,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

698
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:44,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, maybe I'm the only person on the planet that didn't buy this game for the GameCube or PlayStation 2 because I played my friend's copy.

699
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

700
00:43:46,177 --> 00:43:48,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually kind of interested because it was a fun game.

701
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:50,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with the Wii controls, it would be, you know, really fun.

702
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for $30, it's not a bad deal.

703
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:53,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

704
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to get it?

705
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?

706
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying it.

707
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,320
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

708
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:01,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

709
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:03,622
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

710
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:04,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

711
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:09,936
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys, and we're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

712
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:16,741
[SPEAKER_03]: GamePro ran a story this week called the 10 worst-selling game consoles of all time.

713
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:30,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this was done by actual sales figures, but it says, okay, quote, here are the 10 worst-selling consoles of all time in terms of high-profile systems that stood a viable chance.

714
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,451
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fairchild Channel left.

715
00:44:33,055 --> 00:44:34,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm actually going to name the ten systems.

716
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:37,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know how many of these you actually own, DarkSakura.

717
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, those of you, okay, I'm assuming none of you have read this story yet.

718
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:44,404
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you, if you haven't read the story yet, what would you guess is number one?

719
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,705
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one worst selling console of all time.

720
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:49,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The Fairchild Channel F. Fairchild Channel F. I don't know.

721
00:44:49,528 --> 00:44:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say, Drew?

722
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:51,349
[SPEAKER_07]: The Jaguar.

723
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jaguar.

724
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:54,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

725
00:44:56,513 --> 00:44:58,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually say the Neo Geo.

726
00:44:58,675 --> 00:44:58,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

727
00:44:59,195 --> 00:44:59,435
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

728
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:00,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaguar, Jaguar, Neo Geo.

729
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I already know, so I can't answer.

730
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:06,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual Boy says Frisbee and Chat, Master Systems says GS68.

731
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,750
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

732
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 10, the Dreamcast.

733
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:11,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I own two of them.

734
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:16,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dreamcast sold only 10.6 million units during its short three-year lifespan.

735
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:17,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Only?

736
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to know how many of these systems Jamie owns, by the way, in her house.

737
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,694
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what do you want to say, Loki?

738
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:29,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was just going to say, hopefully Sony can beat 10.6 million units in three years.

739
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.

740
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Number nine, the TurboGrafx-16.

741
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Turbo Duo and a PC Engine.

742
00:45:36,285 --> 00:45:37,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Number eight, the Saturn.

743
00:45:37,745 --> 00:45:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two of those.

744
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:39,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I have three.

745
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:41,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are nerds.

746
00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:42,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven, the Sega CD.

747
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:43,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I have three.

748
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:46,329
[SPEAKER_03]: No love for Sega on this list.

749
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:48,910
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you have three Sega CDs?

750
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:49,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't one enough?

751
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a drawer loader and two side loaders.

752
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, I think one of our side loaders was broken.

753
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:54,392
Fucking nerd.

754
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Number six, the 3DO.

755
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:58,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no, I have taste.

756
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played a 3DO.

757
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I played one once.

758
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:03,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't bought a TDI.

759
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 5, I believe, was the Virtua Boy.

760
00:46:08,324 --> 00:46:09,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 5 was the Virtua Boy.

761
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:11,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one in one of those hard cases.

762
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:13,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew says it never had a chance.

763
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:16,407
[SPEAKER_13]: It never had a chance, and believe me, I own one.

764
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:17,408
[SPEAKER_13]: It never had a chance.

765
00:46:18,588 --> 00:46:21,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually do own one, and they call him the Great Red Migraine Machine.

766
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The Amazing Red Seizure Machine of Death.

767
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: With a horrible controller!

768
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

769
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:29,713
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was a horrible controller.

770
00:46:30,074 --> 00:46:31,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, the CDI.

771
00:46:31,975 --> 00:46:32,175
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

772
00:46:33,036 --> 00:46:33,576
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have that?

773
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,937
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it had those shitty not Zelda games on them.

774
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:38,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had Myst, too.

775
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I could play that on PC.

776
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,280
[SPEAKER_03]: 570,000 units sold to the CDI.

777
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:45,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, the Atari Jaguar.

778
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:45,602
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

779
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:48,104
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason I would ever want one, though, is for Tempest.

780
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly what the story says.

781
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:53,106
[SPEAKER_03]: The system had Tempest 2000, but every other game was garbage.

782
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:53,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Sold 250,000 units.

783
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:59,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, the 32X from Sega.

784
00:46:59,052 --> 00:46:59,592
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have that?

785
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:00,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two 32Xs.

786
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:03,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And you agree with it being the number two worst selling console of all time?

787
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:05,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Selling has nothing to do with that.

788
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:07,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more of an add-on than a console.

789
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:11,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but by their terms, sold versus hype.

790
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:13,337
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fair entry on the list.

791
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:14,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised the Pico's not on here.

792
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, the number one.

793
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:20,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the Neo Geo.

794
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that was a good guess.

795
00:47:22,194 --> 00:47:23,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe that wasn't on here.

796
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:23,855
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the ten.

797
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,817
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one, the Apple Pippin.

798
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not have a Pippin.

799
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:38,113
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pippin was made between Apple and Bandai, which is funny because there's a lot of people who've always said Apple should get into gaming, Apple should get into gaming, but Apple did get into gaming in 95 with Bandai.

800
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:42,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They launched their system for $600, and this was in 95.

801
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:46,097
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I figured that the Neo Geo for sure would be up there because it weren't their game.

802
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:49,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember how much the system was, but the games were like a couple hundred bucks, weren't they?

803
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you get arcade-perfect games.

804
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:52,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

805
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:54,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know what?

806
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy an arcade cabinet then.

807
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

808
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:56,339
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

809
00:47:56,399 --> 00:47:57,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been worth it to me.

810
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:00,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, you know, I can sit down and play my Samurai Shodown 2.

811
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, with no region lockout, you have no problem.

812
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,704
[SPEAKER_08]: After a while, some of the games go down in price.

813
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:13,129
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we can pick up some of the classics, you know, Magician Lord and, you know, all kinds of games.

814
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:14,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I have GameTap.

815
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Magician Lord and GameTap.

816
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:19,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but keep in mind, I had this, you know, five years ago.

817
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:20,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

818
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:27,304
[SPEAKER_03]: 42,000 units sold at the Apple Pippin and always makes PC World's worst tech products of all time lists.

819
00:48:28,804 --> 00:48:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Apple.

820
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:31,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We salute you.

821
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:38,129
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we are going to open up the Skype line if you want to feedback on the worst console you've ever played or really anything in general.

822
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:46,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take your calls right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype if you want to call us that way because our 800 number is only toll-free.

823
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: in the U.S.

824
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:48,594
[SPEAKER_03]: and Canada.

825
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:50,314
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also call us on Skype.

826
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

827
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:55,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the phones and take some calls.

828
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:56,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

829
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:57,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

830
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,658
[SPEAKER_03]: This is DarkTetsuya.

831
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, DarkTetsuya.

832
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:01,999
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

833
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I just had an announcement I had to make.

834
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Announcements, announcements, announcements.

835
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:15,198
[SPEAKER_03]: A horrible way to die, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to talk to death, a horrible way to die.

836
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:16,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Who never sang that at campfire, huh?

837
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:17,980
I never sang that.

838
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I never went to camp.

839
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:21,343
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, never mind.

840
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping somebody in chat knows that song.

841
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:24,466
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DT, what's the announcement?

842
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:26,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

843
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:30,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Who would you say would be your two biggest fans?

844
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Our two biggest fans?

845
00:49:34,194 --> 00:49:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

846
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:45,415
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, before you were on staff, I would have said you, but you're right for the site now, so I can't say you, DarkTetsuya.

847
00:49:46,556 --> 00:49:47,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely Misty.

848
00:49:49,978 --> 00:49:55,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably... Well, apparently... Maybe Misty and... Oh, see, Ranma's an op.

849
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:56,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Misty's an op, too.

850
00:49:57,122 --> 00:50:00,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Misty... Well... Alright, well... Ruin everything!

851
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:02,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing it wrong!

852
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:03,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what?

853
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:04,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me your goddamn announcement.

854
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:05,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting to the point.

855
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:05,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

856
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:14,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as of about two weeks ago, during Guys on the Show, she asked me out.

857
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, like asked you out on a date or what?

858
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:19,883
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

859
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:20,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

860
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:21,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

861
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:28,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wait, so you're saying that some of the biggest fanboys and girls in OLR history are hooking up?

862
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:29,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

863
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:32,593
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a scary day in Orange Lounge radio history.

864
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very scary day, and this radio station might have that effect on people.

865
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:42,740
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to crash Guys on a Show, and we're planning on it in November.

866
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you're not going to crash the real show?

867
00:50:45,302 --> 00:50:45,783
[SPEAKER_03]: This show?

868
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

869
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:51,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys on a Show is just kind of the, you know... Guys on a Show might be canceled by November.

870
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:54,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I would crash a show like that.

871
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like beating a dead horse.

872
00:50:57,252 --> 00:50:59,995
[SPEAKER_08]: You should come back to Guys on a Show so we can play what we'll be having for dinner.

873
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:01,556
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

874
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:04,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Crashing Guys on a Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.

875
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:04,939
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

876
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, like, the worst and the best analogy at the same time.

877
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:14,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know what to think of that.

878
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:17,794
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be like pissing in an ocean of bed liser.

879
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:18,315
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

880
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:19,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, congratulations.

881
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:29,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep in mind, Artitsuya, if you should start having relationship troubles, there'll be a new advice show coming to the station soon to help you out.

882
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, put Rice Princess's number on speed dial.

883
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And congratulations, and I hope things work out for you guys.

884
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:41,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope she makes you some of her arts and crafts, because she's so funny, because she finds OLR inspiration.

885
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, I've got all these random messages from her, like, I was at the 99 cent store, and I saw these orange things, and they made me think of this date.

886
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:50,118
[SPEAKER_03]: She's cute.

887
00:51:50,658 --> 00:51:53,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So, get some OLR beats from her.

888
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:55,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

889
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

890
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:58,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DarkSakura, anything you want to comment on the news going on this week in gaming?

891
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:02,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man, I don't know.

892
00:52:02,408 --> 00:52:02,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

893
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, I understand that.

894
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of a slow news week, isn't it?

895
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:08,088
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

896
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for your call and good luck and everything.

897
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, have a good night, all right?

898
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:15,172
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

899
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:15,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

900
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that he calls it.

901
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:21,434
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really not a lot I want to say about gaming.

902
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:26,657
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD says, Guys on the show, it's like pissing in an ocean of piss.

903
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:32,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Can somebody put that as an iTunes review, actually, for this show, since guys on the show isn't podcasts?

904
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like...

905
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:35,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku He's using his chimp voice

906
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,270
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

907
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think Zaku's one of our biggest fans, too.

908
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:09,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to us a long time, haven't you?

909
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I think over three years now.

910
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:12,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years now.

911
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:13,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus, go outside.

912
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:14,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

913
00:53:14,495 --> 00:53:16,395
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

914
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:22,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just drinking on Saturdays and going to my old plain drunk TDR.

915
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:28,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

916
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:33,578
[SPEAKER_03]: In these three years, I used to sometimes go, oh boy, here comes a Zaku call.

917
00:53:33,598 --> 00:53:37,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I kind of look forward to the Zaku calls because, man, Zaku just tells it like it is.

918
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:39,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why we celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

919
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Mexican Independence, even though I'm not Mexican.

920
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:47,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer.

921
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:49,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

922
00:53:49,304 --> 00:53:51,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And drinking, and lots of Mexican flavor.

923
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:52,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer that's not called Corona, please.

924
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you like, please don't be offended if I get this wrong, weren't you like Peruvian?

925
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:58,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

926
00:53:58,649 --> 00:53:59,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got it right, yeah, I'm awesome.

927
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry.

928
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, alright, go ahead.

929
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:10,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just chilling that day, just trying to get a buzz off of Corona with a shot of rum inside there.

930
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video game story in here somewhere, right?

931
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:18,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and just trying to play DDR after two drinks, after a margarita.

932
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and then just today, just watching Spider-Man 3.

933
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:22,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much.

934
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:25,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really didn't have that much of a weekend.

935
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're calling into the show tonight just to tell us this or what?

936
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:35,680
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that and basically Supernova 2 location test getting cancelled.

937
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:40,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I wanted to ask you about because you called into the show last week to talk about this.

938
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:41,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

939
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:45,528
[SPEAKER_01]: One week I say it's on and the other week it's not on.

940
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,670
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bothering me.

941
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:55,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand Konami just taking a look at themselves as developers and realizing that they really want to

942
00:54:56,906 --> 00:55:01,789
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably, you know, for all we know, they probably might be spending the time just making it better.

943
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Or making another Frogger game.

944
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you realize you and the rest of the internet will tear this game a new butthole if it sucks.

945
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:10,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've already did.

946
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're already prejudging as we speak.

947
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:15,699
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already saying that, oh, LoL is not going to get released.

948
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand that as a developer.

949
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Indie Groove is better.

950
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:21,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck did you get rid of Indie Groove?

951
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:23,344
[SPEAKER_01]: As a developer, I understand that if you...

952
00:55:23,877 --> 00:55:33,925
[SPEAKER_01]: If you release a piss-poor product, you're just going to piss people off further, so you want to prevent that by spending more time trying to make something really presentable to the masses.

953
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:37,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting you're a developer now, and you develop for cell phone games, huh?

954
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:38,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

955
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,930
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the toughest job in the industry, my friend.

956
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:46,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through a lot of features during the development process.

957
00:55:46,414 --> 00:55:51,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we're close to shipping, there's always one or two big features that we try to get on

958
00:55:53,123 --> 00:55:55,844
[SPEAKER_01]: before they try to make the application better.

959
00:55:58,444 --> 00:55:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, yeah.

960
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:05,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got to be internally tested to hell before they're going to do an open test.

961
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:13,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so they're probably going to, from what we know, they could be implementing new features, adding more songs to make it a worthy location test.

962
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want this game to get bubble-bubbled.

963
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:16,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

964
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:17,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right.

965
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Saku, before we go to another call?

966
00:56:22,263 --> 00:56:25,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure to tell your arcade to get 2DX Gold.

967
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:32,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't in the next few weeks... Zaku, my local arcade is a golf land.

968
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:37,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the chances of actually being released in this country are getting slim at this point.

969
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:44,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So I urge all my Bimati brethren to please get out there, get your arcade to pick up gold.

970
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:48,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku, I would love to, but my local arcade is Rozo Golf Land where video games go to die.

971
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:51,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, however, give countries a place to call.

972
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:53,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give the bowling alley a call.

973
00:56:53,674 --> 00:56:54,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Get Dave and Buster's to do it.

974
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,295
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the biggest purse.

975
00:56:56,396 --> 00:57:01,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they buy for all their locations, that would be pretty big.

976
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,040
[SPEAKER_01]: That should make some sort of impact.

977
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

978
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,461
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Zaku, thanks so much for the call.

979
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

980
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys get work on the 2DX.

981
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the 2DX campaign works.

982
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:18,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob D in chat says, Okay, my iTunes review has officially been changed from OLR, your source for the gamer lifestyle, to OLR.

983
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:20,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like pissing in an ocean of piss.

984
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:22,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

985
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:26,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want people to look at the iTunes reviews and go, What the fuck is this show?

986
00:57:26,455 --> 00:57:27,235
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is this show?

987
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I better download this show and check it out.

988
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:29,435
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

989
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:31,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Reverse psychology works every time.

990
00:57:31,836 --> 00:57:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And they realize that you're just scamming them and they stop.

991
00:57:34,096 --> 00:57:34,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

992
00:57:34,837 --> 00:57:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I...

993
00:57:37,048 --> 00:57:37,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys said it!

994
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.

995
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:40,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

996
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:41,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, guys?

997
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Toshin.

998
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:42,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Toshin.

999
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:43,673
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1000
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:48,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Just having another reference to another Wednesday-related show.

1001
00:57:48,457 --> 00:57:49,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I went shopping this weekend for games.

1002
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:51,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a couple.

1003
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You went shopping this weekend for games.

1004
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you buy?

1005
00:57:55,263 --> 00:58:00,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to Big Chain Store and they had a sale, so I picked up both Phoenix Wright games.

1006
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:04,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Cardfighter's DS, unfortunately.

1007
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:07,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up!

1008
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:09,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

1009
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:14,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true, but none of us knew about the bug until somebody found it.

1010
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it still in the wrapping?

1011
00:58:16,214 --> 00:58:16,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take it back.

1012
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, they're going to probably offer a return program where you can send it back to SNK.

1013
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And then wait six weeks for a replacement copy.

1014
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:25,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1015
00:58:25,457 --> 00:58:29,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably get another free copy of Metal Slug something.

1016
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:35,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, the Game Boy Advance of Metal Slug still hasn't come out yet, and it's been in development for months, almost a year now.

1017
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Slug Forever?

1018
00:58:37,304 --> 00:58:38,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, almost.

1019
00:58:38,404 --> 00:58:39,224
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sorry, Toshin.

1020
00:58:39,444 --> 00:58:39,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on.

1021
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:43,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I picked up Metal Slug Anthology, so that's... For the Wii?

1022
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:44,905
[SPEAKER_11]: No, for the PS2.

1023
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:45,545
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

1024
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a Wii?

1025
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:46,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a Wii, do you?

1026
00:58:47,406 --> 00:58:47,786
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't.

1027
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:48,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to say.

1028
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:52,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant the... Drew, I meant the system.

1029
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:52,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow up.

1030
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

1031
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't Wednesday, man.

1032
00:58:56,227 --> 00:58:56,887
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know, I know.

1033
00:58:56,907 --> 00:59:01,728
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't Wednesday, but Drew's in the, you know, pee-pee-poo-poo mentality of those jokes.

1034
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:03,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Save it for the afterbirth.

1035
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,349
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

1036
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, um...

1037
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:10,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, okay, so you don't have a Nintendo Wii, but you have a PS2.

1038
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:12,450
[SPEAKER_03]: What of these games have you played so far?

1039
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you played them all?

1040
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on Phoenix Royale 1 right now.

1041
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:16,951
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty good.

1042
00:59:17,211 --> 00:59:17,651
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1043
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:18,531
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good?

1044
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:19,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1045
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:23,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it took me a year and a half to get a copy, for crying out loud.

1046
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:24,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find a copy anywhere.

1047
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:25,033
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1048
00:59:25,173 --> 00:59:26,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you played any of the other games?

1049
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Metal Slug a lot.

1050
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:29,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Metal Slug anyway.

1051
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:30,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a fun game.

1052
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:39,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Please explain the draw of Metal Slug, because I know Jamie tries very hard, but Matt and I still tease her, so you gotta stick up for Jamie here a little bit.

1053
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,841
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the draw of Metal Slug?

1054
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:46,785
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just old-school, run-around... It's like... You like Contra, don't you, Rob?

1055
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:48,006
[SPEAKER_11]: You like 8-bit stuff.

1056
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:48,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like Contra.

1057
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just like Neo Geo's version of Contra, with better sprites...

1058
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I don't understand the draw of Metal Slug.

1059
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:04,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I don't understand why it's got to be on the PlayStation 2, on the Xbox, on the 360, on the Wii.

1060
01:00:05,264 --> 01:00:08,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they have to re-release it 7 billion times?

1061
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:09,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1062
01:00:09,966 --> 01:00:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, hello there, Bustamove, which we were talking about earlier in the program.

1063
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:14,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1064
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:16,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, yeah.

1065
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:18,810
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, now that I think about it, SNK kind of sucks.

1066
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:22,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, sometimes they really, really suck.

1067
01:00:23,021 --> 01:00:26,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, the N in SNK stands for suck.

1068
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:27,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Or UC, I don't know.

1069
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... Sorry.

1070
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: The N stands for suck?

1071
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:32,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1072
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:37,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So Don Phonics worked for me!

1073
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.

1074
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Loud... OLR, the L stands for suck.

1075
01:00:43,889 --> 01:00:44,489
[SPEAKER_03]: SMRT.

1076
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,770
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that would be it.

1077
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,591
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR, the L stands for smarts.

1078
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1079
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:56,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just drooled everywhere and laughing.

1080
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Send those blocks of Crayolas care of Rob.

1081
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:05,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I had a secret meeting with Ken Kutaragi this week.

1082
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

1083
01:01:05,712 --> 01:01:09,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You jumped ship again?

1084
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:11,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the entire chat room was like, what?

1085
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Train wreck.

1086
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:18,002
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway, sorry.

1087
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:18,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1088
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:20,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Your call's derailing this show, Toshin.

1089
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:21,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to wrap it up.

1090
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:22,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts?

1091
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:26,220
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm derailing the show, get back on the train.

1092
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:27,341
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1093
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:34,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Toshin's call is the microwave waves to Rob's pacemaker is basically what it is.

1094
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:38,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, at least I'm doing something right, I think.

1095
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:39,192
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you say?

1096
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:41,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I said at least I'm doing something right, I think.

1097
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:43,556
[SPEAKER_03]: You're derailing this show.

1098
01:01:43,596 --> 01:01:44,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the right thing to do.

1099
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:46,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we don't give a shit anymore.

1100
01:01:47,028 --> 01:01:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Tosh, thanks so much for calling, Tosh, and have fun with the games.

1101
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:51,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, later.

1102
01:01:54,234 --> 01:01:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny about that phone call is he really wasn't calling to comment on any news or anything going on.

1103
01:01:58,058 --> 01:02:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just kind of like, hey guys, I bought some games this week.

1104
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:02,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But we love those types of calls.

1105
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:05,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot to mention I played Super Paper Mario this week.

1106
01:02:05,164 --> 01:02:05,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what'd you think?

1107
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:07,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's pretty fun.

1108
01:02:07,746 --> 01:02:09,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going through the games slowly.

1109
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too fucking easy, though.

1110
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:11,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the puzzles aren't that hard.

1111
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: For now.

1112
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:15,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the difficulty ramps up a lot later on.

1113
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:16,816
[SPEAKER_03]: More calls!

1114
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:18,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1115
01:02:18,296 --> 01:02:18,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1116
01:02:19,357 --> 01:02:19,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

1117
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:22,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind?

1118
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:23,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, not too much.

1119
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,659
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really quiet tonight for some reason.

1120
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1121
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:28,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?

1122
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really, really quiet tonight for some reason.

1123
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:32,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you turn up your mic?

1124
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:33,063
[SPEAKER_09]: A little better.

1125
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:33,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

1126
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I was saying that he doesn't stand for sucking my podcast that he does.

1127
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:40,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Either way, I just had a

1128
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:43,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick question for you guys about gaming.

1129
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,241
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what's up?

1130
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:48,683
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, that podcast you're referencing, of course, This Day in Gaming, right?

1131
01:02:49,463 --> 01:02:49,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

1132
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Great podcast over on All Games.

1133
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:52,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

1134
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:53,605
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what's the question?

1135
01:02:55,206 --> 01:03:00,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console both had a lot of time to develop so far.

1136
01:03:01,729 --> 01:03:03,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Which would you prefer at this moment?

1137
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I was having this discussion with one of my friends earlier in the week, and I...

1138
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:26,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I sided with the Virtual Console just because I like the idea of having a lot of classic games that are in their original form and are guaranteed to be good as opposed to the Xbox Live Arcade where you do have a few good games on there and it's nice to have these extra features but some of the remakes aren't that great and some of the games themselves aren't that great.

1139
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, and this is the big but here, um,

1140
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live Arcade, you can download free demos, and you can check out the game and see if it sucks before you actually have to buy it.

1141
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:50,369
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo system, or the virtual console, or whatever, the Nintendo games, Genesis games, you may remember them, oh my god, those are so awesome, and you download them, spend your five bucks, whatever, and wow, that really sucked, now it's just gonna sit on my drive forever.

1142
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:56,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I hate the way the shop is set up, fucking running off of webpages with JavaScript is retarded.

1143
01:03:56,673 --> 01:03:58,575
[SPEAKER_04]: and it should have been built into the console anyways.

1144
01:03:58,955 --> 01:04:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, I think the Xbox Live Arcade has a better selection right now and my god, PlayStation Network put out something because one release a month is awful.

1145
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:10,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice how Rob D. didn't even mention them.

1146
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason for that.

1147
01:04:12,908 --> 01:04:15,530
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as Xbox... Well, I play Lemmings on the PC.

1148
01:04:16,631 --> 01:04:21,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, I played Lemmings on the PC like 15 years ago and it's just now coming out on PlayStation Network.

1149
01:04:21,796 --> 01:04:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow...

1150
01:04:22,763 --> 01:04:25,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I kind of have to side with Loki.

1151
01:04:25,507 --> 01:04:30,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Xbox Live, just the technology itself is superior because here it is.

1152
01:04:31,194 --> 01:04:33,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo won't go online.

1153
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual console, I would give the trophy to in a heartbeat if I could play like Ice Climber online with my friends.

1154
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:40,769
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:03,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I can compare scores.

1156
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:09,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, go listen to Part A when I got mad at PK or Uno because he has a slightly bigger Boom Boom Rocket score than I do.

1157
01:05:09,795 --> 01:05:11,576
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get that on Virtual Console.

1158
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:22,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Virtual Console, in the terms of the games they offer, yeah, you know you're getting good shit because these games were quality, for the most part, were quality games that came out many years ago.

1159
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go to Jamie's house and play that shit because she still has them all, right?

1160
01:05:27,362 --> 01:05:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1161
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:30,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I mean, all kidding aside, you know...

1162
01:05:31,687 --> 01:05:34,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I pretty much download these is just something about having them.

1163
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:36,689
[SPEAKER_03]: They pretty much equate to impulse buys.

1164
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:37,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1165
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I gotta agree with you on most of those points.

1166
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:40,911
[SPEAKER_09]: They are legitimate points.

1167
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:44,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to be able to play a timed demo or something on the Virtual Console.

1168
01:05:44,693 --> 01:05:46,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see why Nintendo didn't do that.

1169
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:57,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But to me, in my opinion, and this is why I do side with the Virtual Console, the quality of the average Virtual Console title, again, in my opinion, is much higher than the quality of the average Xbox Live Arcade title.

1170
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:06,416
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'd really like to see Nintendo do, though, is bring over some of those games like Bottom of the Lagoon and some of those other games that didn't make it over here.

1171
01:06:06,816 --> 01:06:10,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see them translate those, localize those, and actually release them on the virtual console.

1172
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Second Densetsu 3?

1173
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1174
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:14,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1175
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:15,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Case point.

1176
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:16,920
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1177
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,381
[SPEAKER_03]: If that does it, I think it's game, set, and match.

1178
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, yeah.

1179
01:06:20,662 --> 01:06:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Second Densetsu 3 could single-handedly change my mind in all of this.

1180
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:25,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

1181
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:27,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I get...

1182
01:06:27,825 --> 01:06:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1183
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And those ideas were out on the table a year ago.

1184
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:41,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, well, Sony, I don't know, they're just crazy.

1185
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:43,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why they haven't adopted this stuff.

1186
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:48,935
[SPEAKER_03]: But Nintendo literally seems to be saying, we're just better than that.

1187
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:52,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't want to do that because we want to do this whole other thing.

1188
01:06:52,896 --> 01:07:01,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And although I applaud some of the decisions they made with the Wii, I feel like they're living in the 2600 era when it comes to online right now.

1189
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they definitely got to do something with that for sure.

1190
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's horrible.

1191
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's all I got for you guys.

1192
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:08,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob D., thanks for the discussion.

1193
01:07:08,466 --> 01:07:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely an interesting discussion and a good thing to talk about, so I appreciate it.

1194
01:07:11,768 --> 01:07:12,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a problem.

1195
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:12,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with your show.

1196
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:13,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a great show.

1197
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.

1198
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Will do.

1199
01:07:14,749 --> 01:07:15,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

1200
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1201
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:18,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking over to the chat room.

1202
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:22,933
[SPEAKER_03]: PK or Uno says, My copy of iTunes is only giving me one review for the OLR podcast.

1203
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:24,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great point.

1204
01:07:24,094 --> 01:07:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention that only the U.S.

1205
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,376
[SPEAKER_03]: store actually has 41 reviews because

1206
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: The reviews are separated by region.

1207
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:34,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I checked, there was one review in the Canadian store.

1208
01:07:35,038 --> 01:07:37,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any in the British store or the Japanese store.

1209
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:38,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That might have changed.

1210
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: The reviews are based by region.

1211
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,123
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to your iTunes store, if you're in a foreign country, that just means we need your help even more.

1212
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:50,905
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in a foreign country using their iTunes stores, please hype us up a little bit.

1213
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:51,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd appreciate it.

1214
01:07:52,645 --> 01:07:53,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1215
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:54,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1216
01:07:55,851 --> 01:07:59,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is DMN and no, I'm not living in San Francisco or New York.

1217
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:03,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I figure this time I can since it's not really anything specific to the company.

1218
01:08:03,419 --> 01:08:03,719
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1219
01:08:15,476 --> 01:08:21,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard anything about this period up until a couple of people said, hey, are you aware your company's moving?

1220
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, huh?

1221
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:36,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the way I read the story, it sounded like the sales department was moving, and people are, I don't know if they're jumping to conclusions or if there's just some evidence I missed, but it seems like people are just kind of saying, oh, all of Nintendo's moving because the sales department is moving.

1222
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I work... I think it's some jag off in the, uh... I honestly think it's some jag off in the, um...

1223
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming Media, who's trying to spawn a story.

1224
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:46,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bubble rumor.

1225
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:53,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that certain companies should decide to move to Sacramento instead of San Francisco.

1226
01:08:53,726 --> 01:08:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Real estate is a lot cheaper, and I need another job.

1227
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:58,609
A better job.

1228
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to stalk me, Loki.

1229
01:09:01,372 --> 01:09:02,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want a better job.

1230
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:07,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, okay, so thank you for clarifying that.

1231
01:09:07,817 --> 01:09:10,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't booked travel to San Francisco or New York anytime soon.

1232
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for business.

1233
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want spoilers either.

1234
01:09:15,504 --> 01:09:16,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I will agree with you.

1235
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:16,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirsten Dunst

1236
01:09:42,122 --> 01:09:42,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.

1237
01:09:42,563 --> 01:09:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't great.

1238
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Kirsten Dunst.

1239
01:09:47,728 --> 01:09:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut your mouth.

1240
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:52,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I kept wishing so hard that Mary Jane would die, and then why was Gwen in the movie at all?

1241
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:53,515
[SPEAKER_08]: She served no point.

1242
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:58,340
[SPEAKER_08]: She was there to piss off Mary Jane, and I personally like seeing Mary Jane pissed off.

1243
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:58,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Emo Boy.

1244
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:03,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Kirsten Dunst.

1245
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you never see, like, Drop Dead Gorgeous or The Virgin Suicides or Interview with a Vampire?

1246
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:10,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1247
01:10:10,659 --> 01:10:19,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, things changed, obviously, in the movie and stuff, but I laughed because I never really was into the comics for Spider-Man, but I laughed when they were talking.

1248
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is how nerdy I am.

1249
01:10:21,004 --> 01:10:43,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching a Science of Spider-Man 3, like, these people were debating on how this actually could happen, but they were talking about how Gwen Stacy died in the comics or whatever, how her neck snapped, remember, because in the first movie, you know, it was actually MJ and stuff, and he caught her and saved the gondola and stuff, but, um, I was really hoping they would kill MJ that way.

1250
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please, spoiler free.

1251
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:48,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been out for years now.

1252
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:49,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you.

1253
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:50,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1254
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1255
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:51,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you guys were talking about the third movie.

1256
01:10:51,943 --> 01:10:52,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was talking about the first movie.

1257
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:53,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my bad.

1258
01:10:54,204 --> 01:10:58,065
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just saying I was hoping that her neck would snap in, you know, this movie.

1259
01:10:58,085 --> 01:10:58,726
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1260
01:10:58,886 --> 01:10:59,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see it at some point.

1261
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:02,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, again, I'm waiting for the teenagers to go away.

1262
01:11:02,707 --> 01:11:02,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1263
01:11:03,688 --> 01:11:03,948
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1264
01:11:05,048 --> 01:11:05,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, DMN?

1265
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:08,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play any games this week?

1266
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:17,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin the Groove will be our third host this week, so don't miss it.

1267
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:18,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1268
01:11:18,503 --> 01:11:20,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, any actual games you've been playing this week?

1269
01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:26,068
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's been a rough week, so I haven't really gotten a chance to play any games.

1270
01:11:26,428 --> 01:11:29,030
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, then I expect a phone call next week with a full report.

1271
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

1272
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sounds good.

1273
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, DMN.

1274
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:34,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1275
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:35,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1276
01:11:35,594 --> 01:11:35,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1277
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to move to San Francisco anyway.

1278
01:11:37,495 --> 01:11:38,276
[SPEAKER_03]: The traffic sucks.

1279
01:11:39,056 --> 01:11:40,077
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1280
01:11:57,032 --> 01:12:02,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've used that 80 to 880 interchange quite a few times because I've gone to South Bay, you know, like Hayward and stuff.

1281
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:03,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends in Hayward.

1282
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's about it.

1283
01:12:04,899 --> 01:12:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never used that one that actually collapsed because that's how you get from SF to Oakwood.

1284
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:18,351
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where Super Mario Kart technology would come in handy because all you have to do is put one of those boost panel downs and a little, you know, a little jump there and boom, you're done.

1285
01:12:19,512 --> 01:12:20,954
[SPEAKER_04]: You can clear that gap, no problem.

1286
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:23,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Loki, you kill me.

1287
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:30,868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's about going to do it here for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before I ask for any last-minute stories.

1288
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:32,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course!

1289
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some interesting stuff coming out of San Francisco today, actually.

1290
01:12:37,473 --> 01:12:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: The play First Person Shooter has premiered tonight, and it's kind of going into a story we talked about a little bit earlier about how people are blaming...

1291
01:12:47,293 --> 01:12:50,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games for school shootings and stuff like that.

1292
01:12:50,274 --> 01:12:52,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of their commentary on that.

1293
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:54,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be pretty cool.

1294
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:59,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I want to see that play because it's really not that far away, but at the same time I don't.

1295
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

1296
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:02,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's like, so what?

1297
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a play about video games.

1298
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

1299
01:13:04,617 --> 01:13:05,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1300
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something for the bloggers to write about.

1301
01:13:07,698 --> 01:13:11,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And talk about in the realm of ridiculous, but the way things are going, who knows.

1302
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:15,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's been some investigation.

1303
01:13:15,522 --> 01:13:25,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Two Belgium papers were reporting that police were investigating a virtual rape that happened in Second Life.

1304
01:13:25,426 --> 01:13:26,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Where else?

1305
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:32,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, basically... Insert joke here.

1306
01:13:32,248 --> 01:13:34,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I even have to try tonight?

1307
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:38,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Goddamn, you Second Life fans are getting shit on tonight's show.

1308
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:39,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

1309
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:40,031
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1310
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:42,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously he can't get any in his first life.

1311
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:57,320
[SPEAKER_04]: But it begs the point, Regina Lynn over at Wired said, psychologically, the upheaval of virtual rape isn't anywhere near the trauma of real rape, and I can't see us making virtual rape a matter for the real life police.

1312
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:05,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, if it were me and someone said, yeah, this guy just raped me in my video game, I'd probably hang up on them.

1313
01:14:06,886 --> 01:14:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, I don't give a shit.

1314
01:14:08,828 --> 01:14:10,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you wasting my time?

1315
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:11,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We're coming down to rescue you.

1316
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got raped in a video game.

1317
01:14:16,774 --> 01:14:16,954
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1318
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:21,515
[SPEAKER_04]: If they start treating this shit as real, it's just like the whole taxing people on virtual commerce.

1319
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:24,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that kid who got taken away for making the map of his school.

1320
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:26,296
[SPEAKER_04]: People.

1321
01:14:27,137 --> 01:14:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not real.

1322
01:14:28,817 --> 01:14:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not real.

1323
01:14:29,957 --> 01:14:31,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking video game.

1324
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:33,098
[SPEAKER_04]: They make money in the video game.

1325
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tax them on that.

1326
01:14:34,659 --> 01:14:36,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're going to tax them, it has to be on game money.

1327
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Not real money.

1328
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, you shouldn't be able to tax them on it.

1329
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:42,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1330
01:14:43,753 --> 01:14:47,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on a little bit here, DDR, coming to schools in Scotland.

1331
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:51,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty cool, seeing that it's catching on in other places.

1332
01:14:53,598 --> 01:15:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Simpsons video game, they have a counter now, counting down the video game's release or release info on the launch.

1333
01:15:02,402 --> 01:15:07,164
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a mock site that's making fun of Grand Theft Auto 4, so that's pretty cool.

1334
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,345
[SPEAKER_04]: It says 22 on there.

1335
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, what else we've got here?

1336
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:22,236
[SPEAKER_04]: The people behind the wonderful game Puzzle Quest are actually making a new space-themed game called Galactrix.

1337
01:15:23,137 --> 01:15:25,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking a little bit about that.

1338
01:15:26,799 --> 01:15:27,940
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks pretty cool.

1339
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to make sure it's not just a Puzzle Quest clone.

1340
01:15:32,943 --> 01:15:35,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it, pretty much.

1341
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:38,326
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1342
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything from you, Miss DarkSakura?

1343
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:40,608
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1344
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:43,890
[SPEAKER_08]: One time, I fed my snakes some beer.

1345
01:15:45,111 --> 01:15:46,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It cleared this way and that.

1346
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:48,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all fucked up!

1347
01:15:49,654 --> 01:15:52,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for taking the IQ level of our show down a couple notches.

1348
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:54,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good to be humbled like that.

1349
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:57,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to talk about some stupid rumors that I read.

1350
01:15:57,979 --> 01:15:58,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this was funny, though.

1351
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember they banned some sort of theme on Xbox Live?

1352
01:16:03,683 --> 01:16:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The sexy girl theme or something like that?

1353
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:07,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexy girl theme.

1354
01:16:07,665 --> 01:16:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's sexy girl, but yeah, it's some girl...

1355
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird Girls You'll Never Have theme.

1356
01:16:13,296 --> 01:16:13,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

1357
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was funny.

1358
01:16:15,497 --> 01:16:19,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That and how people are saying that the next PlayStation model is coming out in 18 months.

1359
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:20,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1360
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Never going to happen.

1361
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:24,083
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1362
01:16:24,343 --> 01:16:24,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1363
01:16:24,743 --> 01:16:26,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1364
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, Nami, thanks so much for being here again.

1365
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:30,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you.

1366
01:16:30,907 --> 01:16:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been missing a little while.

1367
01:16:32,749 --> 01:16:34,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I've been doing some entertaining in the chat room.

1368
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:38,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I apologize, uh, we were actually originally, we were thinking about doing a match game tonight.

1369
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:47,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Mikulatov was trying to, he said he'd stay for the show if he could, we would do a match game tonight, but then we just did a match game like, you know, three episodes ago, so, uh, we're holding off on match game.

1370
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you come back for maybe the next match game or next dumb little game we play here in studio?

1371
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1372
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:52,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1373
01:16:53,754 --> 01:16:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Loki!

[SPEAKER_03]: Your final, oh wait, did I give you your final thought?

1375
01:16:57,374 --> 01:16:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Duguru.

1376

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1378
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

1379
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario, or Super Paper Mario, I was going to say Super Mario RPG It's actually pretty cool, a little easy right now, but I'm only on the third level But I like it, it's growing on me I like there is a funny part, and it's kind of a spoiler a little bit, but in one of the third levels There's a power-up you can get that turns you into a giant version of 8-bit Mario Or whatever, and so you can go smash through stuff

1380
01:17:25,618 --> 01:17:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamboroo Boran
