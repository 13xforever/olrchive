6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,460
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,680
It is Sunday, May the 6th of 2007.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,160
Hey, itís 567.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Get it?

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,440
Weíre here for part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,640
You know, that would only happen once every few years if we get the consecutive numbers

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
like that.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,400
Anyway, this is part B of our podcast.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,080
If you missed the first half of this episode, please go back over to www.orangeloungeradio.com

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,400
and check out the first half of tonightís show.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
We are taping live on Sunday night here.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,920
Letís get back into some video game news.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
Loki, start us off.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,680
So the bastards over at Microsoft decided that itís time to ruin more fun for you,

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,200
including downloading stuff that you shouldnít be downloading, like demos and stuff from

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,020
other regions.

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,760
So apparently now theyíre going to be enforcing their Xbox Live demo download region lockouts,

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,360
and theyíre going to make it impossible for you to download content from other regions.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,600
However, if youíve already downloaded stuff, good for you.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
You get to keep it still.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,440
But anything else, you can fuck yourself.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
You can see it.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,840
They wonít delete your accounts.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,800
You can see what content is on there, but you canít do shit.

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,760
So you can look in the store window, but you canít buy.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,720
And I noticed you came out swinging on this story, second word out of your mouth was ìbastards.î

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,960
So Iím curious if you feel personally affected by this, because you donít have a Japanese

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,840
account or anything that you were using, right?

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
No, not at all.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Itís all right.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,560
And we only got demos for Armored Core 4.

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,840
I had a demo for Tenchu Z last year.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,800
If Iím not mistaken, arenít they controlling this by IP address lookup, basically, that

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,480
theyíre making sure your IP address is in the country you say youíre from?

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,120
Oh, if thatís the case, thatís going to be fucking easy.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,880
So whatís to stop them from IP spoofing?

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Or port forwarding, or basically bouncing yourself off a different DNS server.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
Here come the hacks pretty soon.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Thatíll be easy.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,800
All right, well, Iím sure youíll get right on that in hacking.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,760
Iím sure I will.

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
All right.

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,880
Anyhow, letís talk about whatís coming out to Xbox Live Arcade, in America at least.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,720
I donít know about all regions, but I know weíre getting it here, and usually the arcade

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
releases are pretty much universal.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,280
But whatís coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade, Double Dragon is coming out, and that

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,320
was rumored earlier in the week to be coming out, but this got confirmed by a press release

53
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,040
coming out of Empire Interactive.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,240
Also Speedball is going to be released as well, Speedball 2.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,680
This was a sports game featuring, like, robots or something.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,000
There it is.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Although it says, actually, Iím going to correct myself, it says Speedball 2 is coming

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,620
within the coming weeks, but Double Dragon is coming out this week.

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,640
So we donít know if Speedball 2 is necessarily this week or not, but we do know Double Dragon

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
is for sure.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,960
And I had not even heard of Speedball 2 before, I know they call it a classic, but somehow

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
I missed that one.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,680
It wasnít like the Amiga, I think, and stuff like that.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Oh, well thatís why.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,640
I still was on a Commodore 64 by the time everybody was talking about Commodore Amiga.

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,120
Well there is actually another game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and thatís Puzzle Quest

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,400
Challenge of the Warlords, which is already on PSP and Nintendo DS, and itís supposed

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,240
to come out later this year.

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Itís also going to be coming out with Mad Tracks, which is like a Penny Racer the game

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,480
or something, and a Rocket Bowl thatís mini-golf but bowling.

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,640
Now Penny Racers really sucked.

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
This looks like a lot better.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,460
I had Penny Racers when I was little, though.

74
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,080
This looks like, well, they had a game called Penny Racer on the Nintendo 64 and it blew

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
up.

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
I donít know what Iím talking about.

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, wasnít that, you know, that was Uniracer Iím thinking of.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,880
No, this actually, no, this kind of reminds me of, except without any old, like the Micro

79
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Machines games, almost.

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Hm.

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,280
That could be kind of.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,160
I mean, it has potential to be fun, but...

83
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Like R.C.

84
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Pro-Am?

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,960
But, quite honestly, Iím just, uh, Iíll just keep playing, you know, Uno and Symphony

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,480
of the Night.

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,000
But um, yeah, Puzzle Quest is going to be so awesome, I canít wait.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,720
Anyways, we have other things coming out, of course, in all the regions of the world.

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,360
This week, lots of good stuff, well, not a lot of good stuff, but some pretty good stuff

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,120
coming to the US.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,720
Starting off with, of course, on the Xbox 360, we have Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,280
Wars finally making its way out, so thatís going to be pretty awesome.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,360
On Playstation 2, we have Tidal Legends 2, which will be making its way out, and Tidal

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,920
Legends Powered Up on the PSP, so thatís kind of neat.

95
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,640
Driver 76 will be making its way out on the PSP as well, of course being the prequel to

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
Driver Parallel Lines.

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,120
Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing, and Heat Seeker on PSP.

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,320
Then of course, on, letís see, the PC, not a whole lot coming out, weíve got Locomania,

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,160
which sounds like a pretty interesting train simulator, and Circus Empire, which also equally

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,040
probably boring.

101
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,040
On Playstation 3, youíve got Big Fat Nada, and of course, the Wii, nothing to look at

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,520
there either.

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,640
And finally, the DS, nothing to see there either, so a whole lot of nothing.

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,180
I know actually, I think on Playstation 2 also,.hack//G.U Volume 2 is making its way

105
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,360
out, so thatís it for the week, pretty light week, but itís going to start picking up.

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
What about Japan, Rob?

107
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,280
Well over in Japan, we will have Command & Conquer 3 as well, at least hitting the Asia regions,

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,520
which I imagine a lot of folks who import games if they want to pick up the Asian version

109
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,360
can get that, as well as Spiderman 3 this week, on the Xbox 360 those games are coming

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,820
out on.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,520
On the Nintendo Wii, not a lot, you pretty much have to wait until May 17th for the next

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,600
big game to come out on the Nintendo Wii.

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,320
It seems to be another really slow week in Japan actually, I remember last week was pretty

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,920
slow as well.

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,000
On May 10th on the Playstation 2, youíre getting Wrestle Kingdom 2 Pro Wrestling Sekai

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,080
Taisen as well as Simple 2000 Series Volume 117.

117
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
What the hell is this?

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
Iíve never even heard of Volumes 1 through 116.

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,440
You havenít heard of the Simple 2000 Series, man, I go on about these all the fucking time.

120
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Theyíre budget games for like 2,000 yen.

121
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,200
Oh, okay, so itís just games going into this, okay, never mind.

122
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,960
Well, theyíre budget games that get released by like D3, like Earth Defense Force for example.

123
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Okay, I get it.

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Or Zombies vs Ambulance.

125
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
I didnít put two and two together.

126
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Well, they have the Zero Sen, then youíll be happy to know here it is, the Zero Sen

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
is coming out on Playstation 2.

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,640
I can only download all of them.

129
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,520
It looks like planes blowing shit up, old planes, like it looks like 1941 all over again.

130
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Awesome.

131
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,640
They really need to bring the Simple series over to the US.

132
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,600
I mean, can you imagine just all the like really cheap ass games coming out?

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Thatíd be cool.

134
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,880
On the Nintendo DS this week, you get a game called Saikou Todai Shogi is coming out this

135
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
week.

136
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Itís a board game for the DS.

138
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,560
Saikou Todai Shogi.

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah, Saikou 2, lady.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Okay.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Itís a board game simulator.

142
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Yeah, itís Shogi.

143
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,640
And, yeah, isnít part of the fun about this segment getting to hear me butcher Japanese

144
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,240
pronunciation?

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
By the way, the big, big, big release this weekÖ

146
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
That means greatest something.

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,480
I think this might be why you donít see much coming out this week, because finally when

148
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,640
I got to the bottom of the page and saw the PSP releases, Final Fantasy Tactics coming

149
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,680
out in Japan this week, the PSP version there, so Iím sure thatís what youíll all be playing

150
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
and importing this week.

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,920
So the rest of the games just kind of donít matter anymore.

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
How about the Europe release dates, Jamie?

153
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Why donít?

154
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,040
Iíll tell you about them, Rob.

155
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,280
On the 9th, we have Two Worlds for Xbox 360 and PC.

156
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,680
The 11th brings us 32nd Americaís Cup of the Game on PC, Bus to Move Bash on Wii, Driver

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,160
76 on PSP, GoPuzzle, PlayStation 3, Hard Rock Casino on PS2 and PSP, and for the DS, we

158
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
also have Picross DS and Turn It Around.

159
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Iíd like to bash the Bus to Move series after this many years.

160
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Go away.

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
Donít come back.

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,760
I want a new actual Bus to Move, not a puzzle bobble.

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,000
Remember Bus to Move on the PlayStation 2 with the artwork that had the baby on it,

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,600
and it was like, ìWhat in the fuck shit is this game?î

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,880
Well, didnít they have Bus to Move on the PlayStation 1?

166
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,280
Bus to Move was on the PlayStation 1, right, and it started on PlayStation 2, if I remember

167
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
correctly.

168
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Right.

169
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Well, theyíve been on every platform.

170
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Iím talking about the US Bus to Move puzzle bobble.

171
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I know.

172
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Thatís why Iím here.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,720
The Japanese one, you know, you could emulate that on your PSP, because, you know, thereís

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
the workarounds.

175
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Yippee!

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Iím hooping and hollering and screaming out of pure joy, because Iíve never played puzzle

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,720
bobble in my entire life out of the 50 times itís come out on the console.

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I play Puzzle de Pons, which is almost the same thing.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,920
You should play Puzzle in Deserts, fun.

180
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Anyway.

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Anyways.

182
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,920
So, Warhawk, about that game thatís supposed to be coming out, I still donít know much

183
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,680
about it, other than the fact that itís going to be multiplayer only.

184
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,960
We do know that thereís going to be a beta and a demo, because this game needs all the

185
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,200
exposure possible.

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,600
So those should be coming soon, I know the gameís due out in June, and, yeah, should

187
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
be pretty exciting.

188
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,640
Alright, whatís also exciting is people getting to take their own pictures on their camera.

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
Itís the PSP camera.

190
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,140
It came out in Japan already, but itís still not come out in the US, but if youíre in

191
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,800
Europe or Australia, you do get the cam.

192
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,920
Itís called the Go Cam, and itís coming out May 16th.

193
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,000
It comes with a little program called Go Edit that allows you to edit sound and video all

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,960
from this little camera.

195
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,200
So check that out if youíre in Europe or Australia.

196
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,760
If youíre in the US, you donít get a camera.

197
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,440
Yes, in which case youíll get the free program called Go Fuck Yourself.

198
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, youíre so funny, Loki.

199
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
Iím so glad we have you on this program.

200
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Or Go Fuck Yourself A.

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:47,240
Well, for anybody who likes their nifty looking skins or versions of their DS, as I point

202
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,720
to Andrew with his old school ñ His Wal-Mart bot cover for his DS.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,880
Anyway, I have one thatís signed by Miyamoto.

204
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
I have one thatís signed by me, and thatís more awesomer.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,220
Thereís a Golden DS Lite that has a backlit diecast sword and shield crest, and it has

206
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:23,320
a custom charge stand, and two painted styli in silver and black.

207
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,520
The only way that anyoneís going to be able to get one is to get it on eBay, according

208
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,240
to this, and itís going to be going to the Childís Play charity.

209
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Good cause, stupid DS Lite.

210
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Or DS.

211
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
I donít know.

212
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
I think it sounds kind of cool.

213
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
It looks kind of nice.

214
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,520
I kind of wish they put that out officially.

215
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,480
I know, Iím kind of waiting for Nintendo to copy this idea and put it out, but not

216
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
for charity.

217
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,680
Donít get me wrong, I think itís a great cause and everything, but Iím just waiting

218
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,080
for Nintendo to steal the idea.

219
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,120
No, Sony will release another PSP, which will have the Zelda shield on it with the sword.

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,880
It wonít make any sense, but they copied it, so thatís all that matters.

221
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,480
Theyíll just call it Dark ñ what was that game?

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
The Soul Calibur.

223
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
No, what the hell was that game?

224
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Dark Cloud.

225
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Dark Cloud, thank you.

226
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Theyíll call it the Dark Cloud cover.

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
They need a new Dark Cloud game.

228
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Anyways, so there was an interview with Iwata, and he was talking a little bit about the

229
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,840
state of Nintendo and a little bit about the releases, basically saying that theyíre going

230
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,560
to see a brand new Mario, Metroid, and Smash Brothers game in í07, so all three of those

231
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
games are probably coming around around Christmas.

232
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,040
Theyíll make their big splash, but they are coming this year.

233
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:53,520
At least thatís whatís planned so far, so donít be surprised if they move to next year.

234
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,640
I know, dates under consideration, or dates subject to change, or whatever that crap is

235
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,280
they always get away with doing to us.

236
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Soon.

237
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Theyíll be coming out soon.

238
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Soon.

239
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,680
To be honest, whoís really surprised that Metroid Prime 3 or whatever is coming out

240
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
in the fall?

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
They gotta have something for this Christmas.

242
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,840
Whoa, I never thought that would be coming around Christmas.

243
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,800
Tell me I can play it on the internet, and Iíll get tons more excited, seriously.

244
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,120
Tell me I donít have to use friend codes anymore, and Iíll blow a load.

245
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,680
Iíll be very excited.

246
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Anyway, this news made me about that excited.

247
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,500
It really did, because this is one of my favorite, all-time favorite 80ís Commodore 64 games

248
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
ever.

249
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,260
Itís Impossible Mission.

250
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,120
This game is incredibly great for the Commodore 64.

251
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Iím sure itís one of those games that my memories of it are way fonder than the way

252
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,760
the game actually is, so donít try to tell me any different.

253
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,280
However, the important thing about Impossible Mission is that it is coming out on the Virtual

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Console.

255
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Hereís the trick.

256
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:00,760
Youíll notice itís a Commodore 64 game, or was a Commodore 64 game, but the rumors

257
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,840
were that Commodore 64 was coming to Virtual Console.

258
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,280
It is not simply a rehashed Impossible Mission.

259
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
No, no.

260
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:14,880
It is Impossible Mission with now updated mode with new graphics and all that stuff,

261
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,840
so a new version of Impossible Mission with the retro one included.

262
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,680
You can think a lot of those Xbox Live titles are kind of like this, but the interesting

263
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,480
thing about this is that would make Impossible Mission the first Wii download title that

264
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,400
is not simply some Nintendo game just copied over and resold.

265
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,840
So thatís very exciting news.

266
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,360
Iím almost more excited about this than I am ActRaiser finally freaking coming out here

267
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,760
at some point.

268
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,960
So Impossible Mission coming out soon.

269
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,420
They havenít said when, but they are saying itís going to be the first.

270
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,560
By the way, Impossible Mission also is coming to other regular platforms.

271
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,440
Itís coming out to the PlayStation 2, the PSP, and the DS.

272
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
Well, thatís pretty cool.

273
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,600
Yeah, Iím so excited.

274
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,440
Well guess whoís coming out to the UK Virtual Console?

275
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Virtua Fighter 2!

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,200
Sadly, however, it is the Mega Drive version.

277
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,120
Yeah, which over here I do believe the Mega Drive was the Genesis.

278
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,600
I know, itís going to be the crap version.

279
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,480
And you know, I am not a fan of Virtua Fighter, you know, my husbandís a big Virtua Fighter

280
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
fan.

281
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Iím the Tekken girl of the house, but Virtua Fighter 2 made me cry, except that I did try

282
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
the trick where you could hit Kage over and over and over again and knock off his mask.

283
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
Fuck them both, Soul Calibur.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Also though, right now thatís coming out this week for Virtual Console in the UK, now

285
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,360
this makes me happy, is Wonder Boy and Monster World, which I would really love, because

286
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,640
I actually do own that game.

287
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Very, very fun.

288
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,500
Itís too bad that we donít have Master System games for Virtual Console, because I would

289
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,800
love to have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

290
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Yet.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Yet.

292
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,640
I want a new Daytona game.

293
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,360
Is that so much to ask?

294
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Just for the theme song.

295
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,440
I want any new Sega game to not suck.

296
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
Is that too much to ask?

297
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,260
So if I may continue.

298
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,000
Also out is Shock Man, which was a PC Engine game.

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,860
It was actually in the, let me start over.

300
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,960
G-Bean Man series is called Shock Man, which is basically like, weíre going to be Mega

301
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Man, but not really.

302
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,200
There were a lot of PC Engine games that were like that.

303
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,800
And then we have Atlas Kid and the Enchanted Castle, also a Genesis slash Mega Drive game,

304
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,640
and like I said, Virtua Crap 2.

305
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
I like Virtua Crap.

306
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,760
Itís why I take in my Virtua toilet.

307
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Itís taking a shit in Second Life.

308
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
Or PlayStation Home.

309
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,400
Chat.org is not a strategy.com comments, Act Deft is cheering you on, Daytona on VC, Dark

310
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Tetsuya says, ìOh shit, yes Loki.î Completely pop-up?

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,800
Well not on VC, Iím talking about a fucking brand new game, you know, like a redoing Sega

312
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Rally.

313
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Who wants Daytona 2?

314
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,040
I want a newer game, Daytona 3,000 million.

315
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,320
Death Race Daytona edition.

316
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,240
And PS, it doesnít suck.

317
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,840
Yeah, and it doesnít suck.

318
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,240
Anyways, so whatís actually pretty cool, and thank god that someoneís doing it, theyíre

319
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:38,320
going to be giving out brand spanking real trophies for the leaderboards on Alien Hominid

320
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
HD on Live Arcade.

321
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
And these are so awesome.

322
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,920
I mean that right there is an excuse to play the game.

323
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,840
You get these nice shiny trophies and theyíre going to be doing that I guess every so often.

324
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,800
Alien Hominid is awesome.

325
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I like the trophies.

326
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,120
I think they should do that, or do something like the old Activision patches and stuff

327
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
like that.

328
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,680
Dude, the old Activision patches were so awesome.

329
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,000
Why canít Microsoft mail achievements to me in jacket patch form?

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Seriously.

331
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Well I think they should do that for completing a game, like getting all 1,000 achievement

332
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,280
points or something like that.

333
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
They should do that.

334
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
I mean how expensive can this be to put out?

335
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,040
They are charging me $60 for a goddamn video game, right?

336
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,880
But maybe they, I guess because of rentals and stuff, maybe they want to make sure people

337
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,120
actually own the game or something.

338
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I donít know.

339
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Maybe a little something special for actually owning the game.

340
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Because back in the 2600 days they didnít rent video games.

341
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,800
I donít know.

342
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I miss that.

343
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,240
One way that you might want to train for winning those trophies is playing other video games

344
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,600
because video games are good for you.

345
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,200
At least thatís according to Yahoo who this week ran a story about five ways that video

346
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,600
games can make you better, stronger, and faster and I thought Iíd share those with you again

347
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,320
coming from Yahoo.

348
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,680
They can improve your eyesight is one.

349
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,800
That was from a March 2007 study at the University of Rochester because it tested college folks

350
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,200
and apparently after 30 hours of game plays the ones who played the games outperformed

351
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
the ones who didnít play the games and their ability to accurately pick out objects in

352
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,080
a cluttered space so they can play Whereís Waldo better.

353
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,600
So if I sit close to a TV thatís supposed to ruin my eyesight, this will actually help

354
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
me as well.

355
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,680
If I play a game on the TV and sit too close, itíll kind of wash.

356
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
I donít know.

357
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,160
Youíll have to run a separate study on that.

358
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,680
Number two, they can help you focus and theyíre relating this to folks that have ADHD, they

359
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,760
donít have the ability to focus and stuff and playing a video game forces you to focus

360
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,040
but I beg to differ because I have gaming ADD.

361
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,280
I never beat video games anymore.

362
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Seriously.

363
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
I beat them for five hours and then get sick of them.

364
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Itís sick.

365
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
I think they mean not necessarily over long term.

366
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
I think they mean for periods of time, not for long term.

367
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
Thatís not gaming ADD.

368
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,520
Thatís just called, this game is fucking boring.

369
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Iím sorry, what were you talking about?

370
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,600
Oh, look a bird.

371
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
To get the reference.

372
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,640
They focus so much that they play and forget about their families and get divorces.

373
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Step number three, they can help you lose weight.

374
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
And of course, DDR, Itoy Kinetic, Wii Sports.

375
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,120
Or gain a lot of weight depending on which game it is.

376
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,000
Number four, they can help you understand classic literature.

377
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
For instance, Halo is being used by Roger Travis who is an associate professor of modern

378
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,120
and classical languages at the University of Connecticut.

379
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:50,760
And he uses the Halo story as some type of comparison to the Homeric epic, to his stories,

380
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
the Homer epics.

381
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,680
So, thereís a story to Halo?

382
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,240
How does Halo sound like the Odyssey or the Iliad?

383
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,560
Actually, specifically, I think heís citing Aenid.

384
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,200
That was Virgil.

385
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
That wasnít Homer.

386
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,600
It was Virgil taking the inspirationÖ

387
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
What theÖ

388
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Yeah.

389
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Were there head shots in the Aenid?

390
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Wait, hold on.

391
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Iím going to read through this story here.

392
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,960
The Aenid was by Virgil.

393
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
What the hell is thatÖ

394
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Anyway.

395
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,960
No, the story does say that.

396
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,240
Well, then why did they sayÖ up here they say Homeric epicÖ

397
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,720
Because it was inspired by Homer.

398
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Okay, I get it.

399
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
You want literature, you play Zenasaga.

400
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,360
You want literature, you fucking read a book.

401
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,600
How about that?

402
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,960
And step five, they can literally save your life.

403
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
And they are sayingÖ

404
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Trauma Center!

405
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Yeah, well, not just Trauma Center.

406
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,720
The doctor, Dr. James Rosser of New Yorkís Beth Israel Medical Center says to his patients

407
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,240
that heís awesome at Super Monkey Ball because his hand-eye coordination helps in surgeries.

408
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I donít want him to be a doctor.

409
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
He co-authored a study.

410
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I know.

411
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Seriously, Iím moving to New York.

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,280
There you go.

413
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,720
Five ways that video games are good for you.

414
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Letís see, Iím looking into the chat room there.

415
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,480
So would that be like, you know, ìHey, Iím a great proctologist.

416
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,680
I practice a lot of Oonga Boonga.î I mean, come on.

417
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,440
James Patrick defending Halo a little bit, Loki.

418
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,520
Halo has a lot of story.

419
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,880
A lot of it is just not in the game.

420
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I know.

421
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Itís called sarcasm.

422
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,960
All right, then I wonít read the rest of his comment.

423
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,480
Vandalous is making a Shakespeare reference saying, ìDo you bite your thumb at me, sir?î

424
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,080
And I know why he did that because remember when we went miniature golfing with Vandalous

425
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
the other night?

426
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,560
We actually went to Golfland and golfed.

427
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,480
Drunami was there, too, and I was out there quoting Shakespeare.

428
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,800
I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.

429
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,000
And like I think I actually impressedÖ I think I actually impressed William because

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,600
he kind of looked over at me and he was kind of like, ìYou actually know Shakespeare?î

431
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
And I also want to point out, you might want to turn your mic on once in a while.

432
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Fuck.

433
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Okay.

434
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,120
I pointed out the best, though, Shakespeare fact of all in the play Hamlet.

435
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,040
The word ìbungholeî isnít it?

436
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,320
You were the type of girl that stayed after class to look up shit in the dictionary, werenít

437
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
you?

438
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
No, I was not.

439
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Because thatís what we did.

440
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,160
I would stay behind to look up the entomology behind it.

441
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,680
Disgusting.

442
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,520
Originating from the Latin word ìscheitnau.î No, ìscheitî is the British deviation.

443
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,560
And this is why Dark Sakura is in charge of the mailbag, because sheís very familiar

444
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
with shit.

445
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Yeah, thatís right.

446
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,920
Sheís very familiar with shit, therefore sheís perfect for reading your emails.

447
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,080
No, just kidding.

448
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
We love getting emails.

449
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,720
Itís part of what makes this show so special is that we have the interaction with our listeners,

450
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,980
be it the Skype line, the chat room, or emails.

451
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,920
So if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

452
00:23:51,920 --> 00:24:00,240
Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, and pull out some shitty email to read.

453
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,600
Well the first email of the evening is sent to us by ion671, ìDear OLR guys and girls,

454
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I was looking at the screens for Eye of Judgment and while Iím not going to buy a PS3 for

455
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,480
it some aspects,î anyway, ìthe fact that you can see your animated monsters in your

456
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,560
hand on screen to me seems like a cool idea.

457
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,720
Now developers just have to use it, maybe Iíll follow, too bad Nintendo doesnít have

458
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
the camera.

459
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,120
Seeing your Pokémon next to you on screen, think about it.î

460
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
A good idea, yes.

461
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,260
I admit when I first saw it at E3 I was kind of like, ìHuh, well thatís kind of neat.

462
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,560
Is it a next gen system seller?

463
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,800
No effing way.î Because seriously, I donít see why they couldnít have done this last

464
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
gen.

465
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,640
Whatís so special about the Eye of Judgment, really?

466
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Nothing.

467
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Anyway.

468
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
But I do like the idea of Pokémon.

469
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Pokémon Stadium!

470
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Do you know where that would be cool?

471
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Internet play!

472
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,280
Wouldnít that be kind of cute to play on the internet and like you could actually have

473
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
your Pokémon?

474
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Oh no, look at my Pokémans!

475
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Look at my Pokémans, Jamie!

476
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Let me show you them!

477
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,720
My Pokémans brings all the boys to the yard and theyíre like, ìI got Charizard!î Anyway,

478
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
whatever.

479
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,040
Sorry, I totally fucked up that one parody.

480
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,680
But yeah, fail.

481
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,640
But the problem is Nintendo will never embrace internet gaming so that will never, ever happen.

482
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
But nevertheless, itís a cool theory.

483
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,640
Anyway, the next email comes from our friend overseas that wrote us last week, from Matt.

484
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
ìHey, Orange Dones Radio.

485
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,560
Iím writing you this week to answer the question posed in Part B of your podcast last week

486
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,960
about the European and Bemani community.

487
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,660
I can say that where I am, it is alive and well, although I wouldnít describe it as

488
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,440
thriving like California.

489
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,180
Finding a machine here in Italy is pretty difficult unless you go to a bigger city like

490
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,400
Milan or Torino.

491
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,960
The arcade culture that is so fragile and dying where we come from kind of never existed

492
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,560
here, as cultural phenomenon video games are really frowned upon.

493
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,140
Unless you were playing Winning Eleven, then you were automatically labeled as ìSfigato,î

494
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,480
the Italian equivalent of a nerd.

495
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,600
That being said, where you do find machines, theyíre always in immaculate condition and

496
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
have a sizable community around them.

497
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,280
The vibe I get from the European scene is like it was for me in 2002 in Tennessee.

498
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Websites like DDR Freak are communities of that nature, but everyone by name who plays

499
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,280
regularly and thatís pretty cool.

500
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,320
By the way, DDR Freak was around in 2002 because I was a moderator in 2002 when it was NorCal

501
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,960
only on the green board.

502
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,680
He said that itís not like it is in California, right?

503
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Where the machines are all torn up and dirty?

504
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,600
I was going to say, I guess the perception of what the Bemani scene is like here must

505
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,000
be different over there because Iíll tell you, go look at the DDR Freak like NorCal

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
SoCal forums.

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Itís a lot of retrospective posts about how the community used to be.

508
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,640
What was the last great DDR tournament you went to, DarkSakura?

509
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
B3.

510
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,360
Then how many years ago was that?

511
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Actually, the one I ran.

512
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,520
And how many years ago was all this though?

513
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Couple years.

514
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,040
It was within Orange Arms Radioís history.

515
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I think it was in 2003?

516
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
2003.

517
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Yeah, it was ë03 is when B3 happened.

518
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,120
That was a long time ago.

519
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,200
Itís just not what it used to be.

520
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,400
I donít know how else to phrase it.

521
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,080
Either I got old or the game got old, I donít know, or both.

522
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,520
So I would say itís not thriving in California, although I donít know.

523
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,120
You do see folks playing the game, like when we were at Golf Land, I saw some kid playing

524
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,860
the game and he looked pretty good and he had a little nickname that he put in the machine

525
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,400
and everything and he probably posts on some of those DDR communities, but I donít know.

526
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,440
I donít see the community like we used to.

527
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,160
Remember, we would go to Golf Land, we would literally pitch a tent behind those machines,

528
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,520
having the birthday cake or whatever was going on that night, sitting around.

529
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
It was a real community.

530
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
I donít see that like I used to.

531
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I donít know.

532
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Well, thereís a P.S. to this.

533
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,920
My terrible typo in the last email should have read as ìIt never fails to please.î

534
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,920
As Iím in Italy, my English is obviously not in the best of use.

535
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Somewhere in that dark place between ìnever fails to pleaseî and ìnever disappointsî

536
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,840
the abortion of a sentence was formed.

537
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,120
Thankfully, your proud line of judgement caught it and you guys made a funny joke out of it

538
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,280
too.

539
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
We knew it was.

540
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,920
I always play with everybody.

541
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,360
Yeah, Dark Sakura is an equal opportunity bitch, actually.

542
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Iím not.

543
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Hearts.

544
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,120
No, Iím just, whenever the opportunity hits me.

545
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Just especially to foreigners because she hates British people, right?

546
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,040
No, I want to move there.

547
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,000
Dear British listeners, send me a ticket, please, and Iíll rub you.

548
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,280
Well, she just wants to stalk David Tennant, but anyway, next email.

549
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,120
No, I donít want to stalk David Tennant.

550
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,800
I want to go drinking, anyway.

551
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,120
With Billy Piper and then hope something happens.

552
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,200
No, sheís pretty, but not my type, anyway.

553
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,960
Next email comes from Necky, speaking of one of our listeners from the UK.

554
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,940
Dear OLR, howís you?

555
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,440
Last weekís ìDonít give a shitî episode was amazing.

556
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,480
Be sure to get Warrior Bob back on as he is really cool.

557
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,920
Also after hearing the whole Sony God of War goat fiasco, I was left feeling a little horse

558
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
giggle.

559
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:15,880
Jamie, Dead and Furious, Iíve heard of this game about two months ago, my home site dscommunity.co.uk,

560
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,720
and it really doesnít look like that great.

561
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Have you seen the screenshots?

562
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,480
Personally, I donít like, but youíre open to your opinion, though.

563
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,920
On the theme of dead, touch the dead.

564
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,120
That guy works in a fucking plug for his website every time he sends us an email, and Jamie

565
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,520
falls for it every time, I just like to point out.

566
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,360
No, I donít fall for it, I actuallyÖ

567
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,320
No, itís cool, Iím all for promoting the indie website, so Iím just giving this guy

568
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,040
a hard time, because he works it into every email.

569
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,920
Itís cute.

570
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Okay.

571
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,200
Oh, Lord of the Rings Online is a bitch.

572
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,240
My mate has been trying to install it on his Vista since the day it was released.

573
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
With Rob saying the game sucks kind of influences my decision.

574
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,320
Worth it or not, nothing left to say except the new Guitar Hero 2 song packs kick ass.

575
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,200
Oh hell yeah, they do.

576
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,280
Why bye, Nicky.

577
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,920
Oblivion is so my game at the moment, played at loads.

578
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,560
Oh, Oblivion is incredible.

579
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,320
Anyway, I just wanted to say, if you want to try Lord of the Rings, itís actually really

580
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
easy.

581
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,000
All you have to do is you can go to any computer store and you can get a trial disc for like

582
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,940
two dollars, except the only problem is itís labeled ìWorld of Warcraftî, because the

583
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,600
game rips it off in every single way.

584
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,680
Rob, first of all, UK, second of all, theyíre trying to install it on Vista and itís not

585
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
working.

586
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,040
Well, you can play World of Warcraft on Vista and Iím pretty sure they have the same trial

587
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,480
thing in the UK, because you can download them now.

588
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,800
But I mean, itís different than World of the Rings.

589
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,160
Iím just trying to say, Lord of the Rings is not fun and I already played it when it

590
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
was called World of Warcraft.

591
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Let them judge for themselves.

592
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Fine.

593
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,280
And when you, why are you listening to this show?

594
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
You want me to judge it for you.

595
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
It sucks.

596
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,280
If you beg to differ, email nasty things to us.

597
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Just email.

598
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,640
This comes from Ospher, looks like somebody new.

599
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,400
I wasnít a drunk, Ospher.

600
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I promise.

601
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Thatís Ospher, not Ospher.

602
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Iím sorry.

603
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Yo, this is Ospher.

604
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,440
I just wanted to say that I love this show.

605
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,960
You guys are sort of like a radio version of Attack from the Show, Attack of the Show

606
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,520
from G4TV.

607
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,440
We know you meant it as a compliment, so weíll take it that way.

608
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Okay.

609
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,940
Actually, you know what?

610
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,080
When I met Kevin Pereira, he was really cool.

611
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,120
I canít say anything negative about the people on that show because they are really talented

612
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
and all that jazz.

613
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,440
Itís just what that entire network has become that is sad.

614
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,520
I watched G4 the other day because I was watching Cheaters at like 2 in the morning.

615
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
So email, huh?

616
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Sorry.

617
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Anyway, I just wanted to know, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky, how good are all of you at DDR and

618
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
BeatMania?

619
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
Personally, I suck at BeatMania, but I still love the game.

620
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,920
As for DDR, Iím fairly decent.

621
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,920
When it comes to difficulty, Iím able to do 10 furtors, footers like Max Unlimited

622
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,480
getting a grade of B, and Zephyr Oni getting an A. As for my perfect attack, it needs work,

623
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,760
but Iím not able to AAA anything in the arcade, yet Iíve triple Aíd lots of songs on Heavy

624
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,640
at home.

625
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,080
For me, I actually was pretty far up there, and then if youíve been listening for a while,

626
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I developed chronic fatigue syndrome after having pneumonia for three months, and since

627
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,160
then Iíve fallen out of practice with DDR, so Iím building it back up now.

628
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,920
Iím actually back up to seven furtors, sort of.

629
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,960
I just get really, really, really exhausted really easily.

630
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,480
I used to be pretty good at DDR, especially when we started this show.

631
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
I was beating nines regularly.

632
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,080
I didnít ever quite have the stamina to clear a lot of tens.

633
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
I could clear bag, but I couldnít really do the max 300, so thereís just too much

634
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
stamina.

635
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
I think I got bag once.

636
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,800
But my perfect attack was good.

637
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,240
I actually triple Aíd quite a few seven and eight furtors in the arcades, and I actually

638
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,120
would participate in tournaments, and I came in fourth place in a couple of them.

639
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,800
Thatís as high as I ever got is fourth place, but to me thatís still a pretty decent showing

640
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
for me.

641
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,040
I was very proud of myself.

642
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,920
But I suck now, but I donít have a good excuse like Jamie.

643
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,320
My excuse is I got fat, and that makes me not so good at DDR anymore.

644
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,680
Yeah, I lost all my stamina.

645
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I used to be good.

646
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,000
I used to be able to do hard catas and even my wonderful edits on doubles all the time,

647
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
and now I can do, you know, sevens and eights and stuff, but it really kicks the crap out

648
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
of me.

649
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,740
Itís just I donít have the stamina for it anymore.

650
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,600
If I played all the time, you know, maybe, you know, just had a DDR machine in my house

651
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,300
or something, thatíd be different, but.

652
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,120
I got really lazy with Beatmania, though, after not having a reliable machine to play

653
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,680
on because we were playing 2DX7 style for a long time when we had it at Scandia.

654
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Eight.

655
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Eight.

656
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,360
In Beatmania, I went from crappy to really crappy.

657
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,600
But I was, I had actually just started beating seven stars because you were there when I

658
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,920
beat Nine Oí Clocks and what was the Eurobeat one?

659
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Monkey Dance.

660
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
See, but hereís the thing.

661
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Hereís the thing.

662
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Seven stars isnít as hard as they come anymore.

663
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,600
So, weíre like dating ourselves in bimani terms, you know.

664
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, but I used to keep a list of all the seven stars Iíd beaten and stuff, but now

665
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
itís.

666
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,640
You remember when I used to have memorized my list of nine footers back in the day?

667
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
I know.

668
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
I know.

669
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Again, weíre all talking back in the day.

670
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,920
I love Beatmania 2DX, itíll always be one of my favorite games ever and itís one of

671
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,240
my favorite music games ever even to this day, but the series has just gotten old for

672
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
me.

673
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,360
Itís what, in its 14th version now and how much has the game changed?

674
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Not at all.

675
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
And Iím just kind of bored of it.

676
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I donít care about 2DX anymore.

677
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Iím sorry.

678
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,140
Well, there is another bit more to this email.

679
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,480
Also when it comes to DDR Supernova 2, where the hell is the info?

680
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,720
By this time last year, we practically knew most of Supernova 1ís song list.

681
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,960
Why do you think Konami is keeping this under wraps?

682
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,720
Thanks for reading, Oscar.

683
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,760
And yeah, they actually tried to keep it under wraps last year, as far as I was aware.

684
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,120
I hope they do keep it under wraps.

685
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,160
I hope itís like Max 2, where we didnít see that shit coming until it was there.

686
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
That made it exciting.

687
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I want a surprise.

688
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:56,200
And extreme, or not extreme, but you know, Supernova is like, hereís everything, and

689
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,380
itís just not exciting.

690
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,160
I would totally love, though, to have like an unlock system the way that Max did.

691
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,000
You know, to have stuff come out over time, which encourages people.

692
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,360
The more that you play, the sooner youíre going to get stuff coming out.

693
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,120
I think that that would be really fun.

694
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,440
You know, do you remember how we would congregate around the machine and say, okay, we have

695
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
to do this many more until we get our next song?

696
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,280
Iím telling you, DDR needs a card system in the US, and it needs something more battle-y.

697
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,880
It needs to become a more competitive game.

698
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,360
Thatís how the game could evolve, but no oneís listening to me.

699
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,920
And battle mode, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is not enough, because itís

700
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
not the focus of the game.

701
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,120
Thereís a PS of this, it says, ìI donít consider myself to be that great at DDR yet.

702
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Why?

703
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,720
Iíve met Mega Man X, and he lives pretty close by here in Northeast Ohio.

704
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
You know what?

705
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,800
I donít really think, this is my opinion on gaming, especially in a competitive sense.

706
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
Why make a competition of it?

707
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,440
Why just not have fun?î I agree.

708
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,480
Why not just have fun with it?

709
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,160
You know, I remember reading, actually, you know Foxtrot, right?

710
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:13,280
The Sunday comic in the paper, and how the little girl was trying to make a paper airplane

711
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,480
or something, and her dadís like, ìOh, let me show you!

712
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Donít you want to have the best?

713
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,840
Donít you want to be this?î Sheís like, ìNo, I just want to have fun.î

714
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,640
And no offense to this guy or his ego, but I have no idea who that guy is, he just said.

715
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I donít know who that is.

716
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Neither do I.

717
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I have no idea.

718
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,440
Iím not sure heís nice, but Iím good at DDR, apparently, but I donít, you know, heís

719
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
not that famous.

720
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Of course, neither are we.

721
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,160
Of course, Iíve got to open up the usual can of worms.

722
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Guess what?

723
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,920
The other game had a battle system that was actually pretty decent in the groove.

724
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,320
Guess who saw that up?

725
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
I disagree.

726
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,520
I think In the Groove was the same damn game as DDR.

727
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Itís just a different wrapping.

728
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,600
Guess what game had a battle system?

729
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,680
That mania, guess which one, you know, became In the Groove.

730
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I do not want to have this debate again.

731
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Fuck.

732
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,680
ìHey Jamie, just made a quick email to say pump up the volume rocks.

733
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,480
Whatís your favorite class in Ragnarok Online?

734
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
I like acolytes.

735
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,080
I did have a super acolyte, but I played assassins.

736
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,840
I actually managed to get an assassin cross on one of my free servers.

737
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,400
Still youngest listener who wants to blow shit up and hopes you get eaten by a group.î

738
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,880
When I played Ragnarok Online, I played an acolyte who had a bow in his hair because

739
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
he was cute and pretty.

740
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,080
That was my wallpaper on my phone for a long time.

741
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Thatís great.

742
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
I played a battle acolyte.

743
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,320
I donít know how much they suck.

744
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,080
Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

745
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,760
We look forward to hearing from you.

746
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
Back into some game news now.

747
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,040
Anyways, so, you know, this isnít a big surprise I think because video games live usually performs

748
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:59,400
at most of these big industry events, but, anyways, video games live will be performing

749
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,920
around the same time as the E4ALL convention in October and, of course, will feature a

750
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,800
wonderful mix of music from a bunch of different games and should be performing at the Nokia

751
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Theater around October 19th, so thatís actually pretty cool.

752
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
I donít know why.

753
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
I actually really want to go to E4ALL even though Iíve heard the talk about itís nothing

754
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
more than a glorified EB Games, but I donít know.

755
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,880
I just kind of want to go to that atmosphere and, obviously, the opportunist in me sees

756
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,680
it as a great promotion opportunity for our show, but I just kind of want to go and check

757
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
it out.

758
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
I think it would be fun.

759
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,380
The other thing too, to be honest, it sounds a lot more exciting than the E3 this year.

760
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:51,000
Even looking at E3ís show for plans, stuff like that, itís like, ìWow, yeah, thatís

761
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
awesome.î

762
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Well, you know, the E3 wasnít supposed to have the glitziness this year, and Iím sure

763
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,880
weíre just a little bitter for not getting invited, which is true, but I donít know.

764
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,840
Iím kind of excited about E4ALL.

765
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,640
I think I definitely want to go.

766
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,320
I hope we all can go.

767
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,480
That would be fun, but weíll see.

768
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Weíll see.

769
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,120
Anyhow, some controversy going on this week with Blizzard, of course, itís earlier been

770
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,120
said that they are going to be announcing a new game on May 19th, and, oh my God, is

771
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
this blown up.

772
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,320
Honestly, I donít know who to believe, because folks are saying, ìOh, leaked, itís StarCraft,

773
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,080
the MMO, itís the StarCraft MMO thatís coming out, itís World of StarCraft,î even though

774
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,560
that name would make no sense at all, because itís more than just a world.

775
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Drew, why are you twitching?

776
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,300
And I donít think they would do that.

777
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
You know why?

778
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Why?

779
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Compete with World of Warcraft.

780
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
Drewís twitching.

781
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,880
Number one, we donít need another MMO from Blizzard.

782
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,040
Number two, I know competing with yourself is actually good for business sometimes, but

783
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,520
I donít think it would be such a good idea here.

784
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:59,040
And, of course, just adding fire to this rumor, Vivendi was giving a presentation to Wall

785
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,800
Street and said, ìAll Blizzard franchises will become MMOs,î which strikes me as hilarious,

786
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,940
because to me, and I know Blizzard fans are going to get pissed, but honestly, to me,

787
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,280
World of Warcraft does already feel like World of Diablo to me, honestly, like the game plays

788
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,400
very similar to me, so I donít know what the big deal is, but whatever.

789
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,820
But then Blizzard quickly responded to that, ìThe rumor is not true in regards to Blizzard.

790
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,960
We believe the rumor circulating about this subject is based on a misinterpretation of

791
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,840
information provided to industry analysts.î Bottom line, you donít know shit until May

792
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
19th.

793
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Period.

794
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,000
Youíre going to hear every rumor under the sun, you wonít know for sure until May 19th.

795
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,320
Personally, personally, I think itís Starcraft 2.

796
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,540
And thatís not an MMO, not an MMO, I think itís just Starcraft 2, the way the Starcraft

797
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,840
fans want their sequel to Starcraft.

798
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,460
It damn well better be Starcraft 2.

799
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,000
I would be happy with that.

800
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,840
All right, so there you have it, weíll see what happens when the big announcement is

801
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
made.

802
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,140
Well, speaking of big announcements, and this is actually a very, very big announcement

803
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:12,320
to me personally, is that one of our gaming legends, well, I should say legends in game

804
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:19,480
making, Don Bluth, who brought us, you know, Dragonís Lair, is working on a Dragonís

805
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,840
Lair movie thatís a prequel to Dirk the Daringís whole ordeal outside of the Dragonís Lair.

806
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:34,120
So hopefully it actually will legitimately have a tie-in and be, you know, a little bit

807
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,760
better than, you know, Dragonís Lair 2 was.

808
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,680
Dragonís Lair 2 was the acid trip game, Iím so sorry.

809
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,760
But there better be like gruesome, gory, skeleton deaths in it, thatíd be really awesome.

810
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Awesome.

811
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,560
I donít know how I feel about the Dragonís Lair franchise being milked to death 20 years

812
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
past its prime.

813
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,080
At least itís not, I hope itís not going to be as awful as the old cartoon was.

814
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,520
Yeah, I donít know, I donít know how I feel about this.

815
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,260
I mean, in the end, I will judge based on the product thatís delivered, but, you know,

816
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,600
I donít know, I only have so much love for Dragonís Lair in my heart.

817
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,600
And believe me, I do have a lot of love, I completely loved the Commodore 64 version

818
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
of the game, if for nothing else, but I thought the music was some of the best soundtracks

819
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,240
like ever in an 80s game, but yeah, I donít know.

820
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,680
Speaking of 80s cartoons, you probably heard this week that they put up the first episode

821
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,960
of the 1980s version of the Pac-Man cartoon on Xbox Live Marketplace.

822
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Really?

823
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Yeah.

824
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I did not hear that.

825
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Itís for a free download too.

826
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Yeah.

827
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Already?

828
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Already.

829
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Holy shit, I missed that.

830
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
I want to check that out.

831
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Itís kind of cool.

832
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
I thought that was funny.

833
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,720
The Rob Dean chat says, ìDragonís Lair franchise.î It wasnít a franchise, it was one arcade

834
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
game that was innovative.

835
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
WellÖ

836
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Two arcade games.

837
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,920
Yeah, there was a sequel, because they had the sequel at Golf Land, and there was a sequel

838
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,800
on the Commodore 64 too, and then there was Space Ace, which some people kind of consider

839
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
a part of that series, even though itís not.

840
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Brain Dead 13?

841
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
You know what I mean?

842
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
So anyway.

843
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
What about Brain Dead 13?

844
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
What about it?

845
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
It was an awesome game.

846
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
It was an awesome game.

847
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Okay, if you say so.

848
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Anyways.

849
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,720
So, no else is an awesome game.

850
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Resident Evil 4.

851
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
And of course, itís coming to the Wii in a port of sense.

852
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,840
Itís going to be coming out though for a low, low price of $29.95.

853
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,320
And pretty much, you know, the GameCube or PlayStation 2 version with tacked on Wii controls,

854
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,760
and going to have the bonus content that was also available on the PlayStation 2 version

855
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
as well.

856
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,640
So, if you think thatís worth $30, then definitely worth picking up.

857
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
I donít know.

858
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,640
Well, I donít know.

859
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,200
I mean, like, maybe Iím the only person on the planet that didnít buy this game for

860
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,480
the GameCube or PlayStation 2, because I played my friendís copy.

861
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
So I donít know.

862
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,760
Iím actually kind of interested, because it was a fun game, and I think with the Wii

863
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,360
controls it would be, you know, really fun.

864
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,480
So for $30, itís not a bad deal.

865
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Itís a good game.

866
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Are you going to get it?

867
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Anybody else?

868
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Iím not buying it.

869
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
I donít know.

870
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
All right.

871
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Letís see.

872
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:10,280
One more story for you guys, and then weíre going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

873
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,520
GamePro ran a story this week called, ìThe 10 Worst Selling Game Consoles of All Time.î

874
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,960
I donít think this was done by actual sales figures, but it says, ìHere are the 10 worst

875
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,320
selling consoles of all time in terms of high-profile systems that stood a viable chance.î

876
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,560
The Fairchild Channel F.

877
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, Iím actually going to name the 10 systems.

878
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,840
I want to know how many of these you actually own, Dark Sakura.

879
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,960
First off, those of youóokay, Iím assuming none of you have read this story yet.

880
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,720
If you havenít read the story yet, what would you guess is number one, the number one worst

881
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,040
selling console of all time?

882
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,120
The Fairchild Channel F.

883
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
The Fairchild Channel F.

884
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
I donít know.

885
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
What would you say, Drew?

886
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
The Jaguar.

887
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
The Jaguar.

888
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Loki?

889
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,040
I would actually say the Neo Geo.

890
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,040
Okay.

891
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
All right.

892
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
Jaguar, Jaguar, Neo Geo.

893
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,600
I already know, so I canít answer.

894
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,920
Virtual Boy says Frisbee in chat.

895
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Master Systems says GS68.

896
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
All right.

897
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Letís see.

898
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,840
Number 10, the Dreamcast.

899
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,520
I own two of them.

900
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,080
The Dreamcast sold only 10.6 million units during its short three-layer lifespan only.

901
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah.

902
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,520
I want to know how many of these systems Jamieís owns, by the way, in their house.

903
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
All right.

904
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
What do you want to say, Loki?

905
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh, I was just going to say, hopefully, Sony can beat 10.6 million units in three years.

906
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,760
Letís see.

907
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,880
Number nine, the TurboGrafx-16.

908
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,520
I have a Turbo Duo and a PC Engine.

909
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,720
Number eight, the Saturn.

910
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
I have two of those.

911
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
I have three.

912
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,560
You guys are nerds.

913
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,120
Number seven, the Sega CD.

914
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,420
I have three.

915
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,980
No love for Sega on this list.

916
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,720
How do you have three Sega CDs?

917
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,780
Isnít one enough?

918
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,440
I have a drawer loader and two side loaders.

919
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,000
Actually, no, I think one of our side loaders was broken.

920
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,480
Fucking nerd.

921
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,320
Number six, the 3DO.

922
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,000
Hell no, I have taste.

923
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I played a 3DO.

924
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I know.

925
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I played one once in the Sears.

926
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,440
I havenít bought a CDI.

927
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Number five, I believe, was the Virtua Boy.

928
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,520
Number five was the Virtua Boy.

929
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,640
I have one in one of those hard cases.

930
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,440
Drew says it never had a chance.

931
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,480
It never had a chance, and believe me, I own one.

932
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
It never had a chance.

933
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,840
I actually do own one, and they call them the great red migraine machine.

934
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,000
The amazing red seizure machine of death with a horrible controller.

935
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh my God.

936
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It was a decent controller.

937
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,240
No, it was a horrible controller.

938
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,800
Number four, the CDI.

939
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
No.

940
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
You donít have that?

941
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,400
No, because it had those shitty not-Zelda games on them.

942
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
But it had Myst, too.

943
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,000
I could play that on PC.

944
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,080
Five hundred and seventy thousand units sold to the CDI.

945
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,000
Number three, the Atari Jaguar.

946
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
No.

947
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,840
The only reason I would ever want one, though, is for Tempest.

948
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,120
And thatís exactly what the story says.

949
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,480
The system had Tempest 2000, but every other game was garbage.

950
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,120
Sold 250,000 units.

951
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,160
Number two, the 32X from Sega.

952
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
You do have that?

953
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
I have two 32Xs.

954
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,760
And you agree with it being the number two worst-selling console of all time?

955
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Selling has nothing to do with that.

956
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,920
Itís more of an add-on than a console.

957
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,520
Okay, by their terms, sold versus hype is a fair entry on the list.

958
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,540
Iím surprised that Picoís not on here.

959
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,960
Here it is, the number one.

960
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,160
It is not the Neo Geo, although that was a good guess.

961
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,360
I canít believe that wasnít on here.

962
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Itís one of the ten.

963
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,400
The number one, the Apple Pippin.

964
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,800
I do not have a Pippin.

965
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,120
The Pippin was made between Apple and Bandai, which is funny, because thereís a lot of

966
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,560
people who have always said, ìApple should get into gaming.

967
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,500
Apple should get into gaming.î But Apple did get into gaming in í95 with Bandai.

968
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,280
They launched their system for six hundred bucks, and this is in í95.

969
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,160
See, I figured that the Neo Geo for sure would be up there, because it wasnít their game.

970
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,880
I donít remember how much the system was, but the games were like a couple hundred bucks,

971
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,880
werenít they?

972
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,200
Yeah, but you get arcade perfect games.

973
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
Woo-hoo!

974
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,280
Hey, you know what, itís been worth it.

975
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,600
Iíll buy an arcade cabinet then.

976
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,600
I mean, seriously.

977
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
You know what, itís been worth it to me.

978
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,920
I actually, you know, I can sit down and play my Samurai Showdown 2, and on top of that,

979
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,040
with no region lockout, you have no problem.

980
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,440
After a while, some of the games go down in price.

981
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,480
You know, we can pick up some of the classics, you know, Magician Lord and, you know, all

982
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
kinds of games.

983
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
I have GameTap.

984
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Magician Lord and GameTap.

985
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,760
Yeah, but keep in mind, I had this, you know, five years ago.

986
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,400
I know.

987
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,840
Forty-two thousand units sold of the Apple Pippin, and always makes PC Worldís worst

988
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,920
tech products of all time lists.

989
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,640
Good job, Apple.

990
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
We salute you.

991
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,160
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

992
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,720
If you want to feed back on the worst console youíve ever played, or really anything in

993
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:43,240
general, weíll take your calls right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype,

994
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,360
if you want to call us that way, because our 800 number is only toll free in the U.S. and

995
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Canada.

996
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,400
You can also call us on Skype.

997
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,080
The username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

998
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,240
Letís go to the phones and take some calls.

999
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,920
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1000
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
Whoís this?

1001
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
This is Dark Tetsuya.

1002
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,920
Hi, Dark Tetsuya.

1003
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,920
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1004
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,120
Oh, I just got an announcement I had to make.

1005
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,600
Announcements, announcements, announcements, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die,

1006
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,560
a horrible way to talk to death, a horrible way to die.

1007
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,040
Who never sang that at campfire, huh?

1008
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
I never sang that.

1009
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
I never went to camp.

1010
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,360
All right, never mind.

1011
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,240
Iím hoping somebody in chat knows that song.

1012
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
All right, DT, whatís the announcement?

1013
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,100
Well, okay, what would you say would be your two biggest fans?

1014
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:42,720
Our two biggest fans, you know, before you were on staff, I would have said you, but

1015
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,000
you write for the site now, so I canít say you, Dark Tetsuya.

1016
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,360
Definitely Misty.

1017
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Probably well.

1018
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Apparently.

1019
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh, do I, maybe Misty and, well, letís see, Ramaís an op.

1020
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,320
Well, Mistyís an op, too.

1021
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Maybe Misty.

1022
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
Well.

1023
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
All right, well.

1024
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Anything.

1025
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Youíre doing it wrong.

1026
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
All right, why?

1027
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
Give me your goddamn announcement.

1028
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Iím getting to the point.

1029
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
All right.

1030
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:15,320
Well, as of about two weeks ago, during guys on my show, she asked me out.

1031
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,480
Ooh, like asked you out on a date or what?

1032
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Whatís going on?

1033
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Yeah.

1034
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Sweet.

1035
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,760
So, wait, so youíre saying that some of the biggest fanboys and girls know all our history

1036
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,200
are hooking up?

1037
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Yeah.

1038
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,680
This is a scary day in Orange Lawnís radio history.

1039
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,680
This is a very scary day, and this radio station might have that effect on people.

1040
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,480
Weíre going to crash Guys on a Show, and weíre planning on it in November.

1041
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,400
Wait, youíre not going to crash the real show?

1042
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,400
This show?

1043
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah.

1044
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,480
Guys on the Show is just kind of the, you know, Guys on a Show might be canceled by

1045
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480
November.

1046
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,200
I donít know if you can crash a show like that.

1047
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
Itís kind of like beating a dead horse.

1048
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,320
You should come back to Guys on a Show so we can play what weíll be having for dinner.

1049
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,240
No, no, no, crashing Guys on a Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.

1050
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
All right.

1051
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,960
That is like the worst and the best analogy at the same time.

1052
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
I really donít know what to think of that.

1053
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,920
It would be like pissing in an ocean of denwiser.

1054
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Oh, God.

1055
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
All right.

1056
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,880
Well, congratulations, and keep in mind, Artisia, if you should start having relationship troubles,

1057
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,280
thereíll be a new advice show coming to the station soon to help you out.

1058
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,880
So put Rice Princessís number on speed dial.

1059
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,240
And congratulations, and I hope things work out for you guys.

1060
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,960
I hope she makes you some of her arts and crafts because sheís so funny because she

1061
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,120
finds OLR inspiration.

1062
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,680
And like Iíve got these random messages from her like, ìI was at the 99 cent store and

1063
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,200
I saw these orange things and they made me think of the station.î Sheís cute.

1064
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,960
Get some OLR beats from her.

1065
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
All right.

1067
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,400
Well, DarkTit Show, yeah, anything you want to comment on the news going on this week

1068
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
in gaming?

1069
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
Oh, man.

1070
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,400
I donít know.

1071
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Not really.

1072
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
I just had that.

1073
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Yeah.

1074
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Itís kind of a slow news week, isnít it?

1075
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
All right.

1076
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,520
Thanks so much for your call and, you know, good luck and everything.

1077
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,520
Yeah.

1078
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,520
Okay.

1079
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Have a good night.

1080
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,520
All right.

1081
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
You too.

1082
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Bye.

1083
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
I like that he calls it.

1084
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,280
Itís really not a lot of what I say about gaming.

1085
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,440
TheRobD says, ìGuys on the show, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î Can somebody

1086
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,400
put that as an iTunes review actually for this show since Guys on the Show isnít a

1087
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
podcast?

1088
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,600
Because like when we make that request for people to make five-star reviews in iTunes

1089
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,360
with these stupid little things we come up with, people have actually been doing it.

1090
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,360
Itís great.

1091
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,200
Weíre up to like 41 reviews in the store and we love each and every one of them.

1092
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
You guys are awesome.

1093
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,320
Well, you just got up to go pee.

1094
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Weirdo.

1095
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,800
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

1096
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Look at this.

1097
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Legend of Zaku.

1098
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

1099
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Have youÖ

1100
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Using his pimp voice.

1101
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,960
Have youÖ Hey, have you gotten with any OLR women recently?

1102
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,960
No.

1103
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,520
Actually, I think Zaku is one of our biggest fans too.

1104
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,200
Youíve been listening to us a long time, havenít you?

1105
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,840
I think over three years now.

1106
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
Three years now.

1107
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Jesus, go outside.

1108
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Iím just kidding.

1109
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1110
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Outside today.

1111
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Yeah, justÖ just drinking on Saturday, Cinco de Mayo, playing drunk TDR.

1112
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Thatís whatÖ

1113
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Drinking beers, beers, beers.

1114
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:33,680
In these three years, I used to sometimes go, ìOh, boy, here comes a Zaku call.î But

1115
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,040
now I kind of look forward to the Zaku calls because, man, Zaku just tells it like it is,

1116
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
you know.

1117
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah, Cinco de Mayo is going to get fucked up.

1118
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,560
Youíre going to be having Dave and Busters in your city.

1119
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,840
Do you know why we celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

1120
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Mexican independence, even though Iím not Mexican.

1121
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Beer.

1122
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
I know.

1123
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
Beer.

1124
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
And drinking and lots ofÖ

1125
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,840
Beer thatís not called Corona, please.

1126
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,480
Werenít you likeÖ please donít be offended if I get this wrong.

1127
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,480
Werenít you like Peruvian?

1128
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Yes.

1129
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Oh, I got it right.

1130
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Yeah, Iím awesome.

1131
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Okay.

1132
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Sorry.

1133
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,480
Anyway.

1134
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
All right.

1135
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Go ahead.

1136
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Yeah, justÖ just chilling that day.

1137
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,840
Just, you know, just gettingÖ trying to get a buzz off of, you know, Corona with a shot

1138
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
of rum inside there.

1139
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Thereís a video game story in here somewhere, right?

1140
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,160
Yeah, and justÖ and just trying to, likeÖ just trying to play DDR after two drinks

1141
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
after Margarita.

1142
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,320
But, yeah, and then just today, just watching Spiderman 3.

1143
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,320
Nothing much.

1144
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,120
I mean, everyÖ really had thatÖ really didnít have that much of a weekend.

1145
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,960
So youíre calling into the show tonight just to tell us this or what?

1146
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,960
What do youÖ

1147
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,960
No, thatÖ

1148
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Okay.

1149
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,360
That and basically Supernova 2 location test getting canceled, but thatís no big deal.

1150
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,560
Thatís what I wanted to ask you about, because you called into the show last week to talk

1151
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
about this.

1152
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
I know.

1153
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,720
One week I say itís actuallyÖ itís on and the other week itís not on.

1154
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
All right, soÖ

1155
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,680
Yeah, Iím notÖ itís not going to botherÖ itís not bothering me.

1156
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,440
I can understand Konami just taking a look at the, you know, look at themselves as developers

1157
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,880
and realizing that, you know, they really want toÖ they probably, you know, for all

1158
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,760
we know, they probably might be spending the time just making it better.

1159
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,320
Because youíre making another Frogger game.

1160
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,760
Because you realize you and the rest of the internet will tear this game a new butthole

1161
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
if it sucks.

1162
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
Well, theyíve already did.

1163
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,920
I mean, theyíre already prejudging as we speak.

1164
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,600
Theyíre already saying that, ìOh, LoL is not going to get released.î

1165
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
I understand as a developerÖ

1166
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,600
In the groove is better.

1167
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,440
Why the fuck did you get rid of in the groove?

1168
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
I meanÖ

1169
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,080
As a developer, I understand that if you release a piss-poor product, youíre just going to

1170
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,200
piss people off further.

1171
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,000
So you want to prevent that by spending more time trying, you know, trying to make something

1172
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
really presentable to the masses.

1173
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
I keep forgetting youíre a developer now.

1174
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,720
And you developed for cell phone games, huh?

1175
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,720
Yeah.

1176
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,960
Itís the toughest job in the industry, my friend.

1177
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,520
And we go through a lot of, you know, we had a lot of features during the development process.

1178
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,320
Even though weíre close to shipping, thereís always like one or two big features that we

1179
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:56,880
usually try to get on before, you know, they try to make the application better.

1180
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:04,120
Well, you know, yeah, I mean, itís got to be internally tested to hell before theyíre

1181
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,440
going to do an open test.

1182
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,520
So theyíre probably going to, for all we know, they could be implementing new features,

1183
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,600
adding more songs to make it a worthy location test.

1184
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
We donít want this game to get bubble bobbled.

1185
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Right.

1186
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Yeah.

1187
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,600
All right.

1188
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,400
Anything else, Zaku, before we go to another call?

1189
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,440
Just make sure to tell your arcade to get 2DX Gold.

1190
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,760
We really, because if you donít, in the next few weeksÖ

1191
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,400
Zaku, my local arcade is a golf land.

1192
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,800
Yeah, the chances of, you know, of actually being released in this country are getting

1193
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
slim at this point.

1194
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:44,280
So I urge all my Bimani brethren to please get out there, get your arcade to pick up

1195
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Gold.

1196
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,360
Zaku, I would love to, but my local arcade is Roseau Golf Land, where video games go

1197
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
to die.

1198
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,360
I will, howeverÖ

1199
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
Yeah.

1200
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
Get Dave and Busters to do it.

1201
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,360
Iíll get the bowling alleyÖ

1202
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,920
Get Dave and Busters to do it.

1203
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,960
They have the biggest purse, so if they buy for all their locations, thatíll be pretty

1204
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
big.

1205
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,960
But that should make some sort of impact.

1206
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,960
All right.

1207
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,200
All right, Zaku, thanks so much for the call.

1208
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Good luck.

1209
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
All right.

1210
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
Later.

1211
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,200
I hope the 2DX campaign works.

1212
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,520
Rob D. in chat says, ìOkay, my iTunes review has officially been changed from ìOLR, your

1213
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,960
source for the gamer lifestyle,î to ìOLR, itís like pissing in an ocean of piss.î

1214
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Beautiful.

1215
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,560
Because I want people to look at the iTunes reviews and go, ìWhat the fuck is this show?

1216
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,720
What the fuck is this show?î I better download this show and check it out.

1217
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,720
See?

1218
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
Reverse psychology works every time.

1219
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,840
And then they realize that youíre just scamming them and they stop it.

1220
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Exactly.

1221
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,400
Well, hey, you guys said it.

1222
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Hi, youíre on Orange Song Radio.

1223
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,400
Whoís this?

1224
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,400
Hey, whatís up, guys?

1225
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Itís Totion.

1226
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Hi, Totion.

1227
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1228
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,120
To just have another reference to another Wednesday-related show, I went shopping this

1229
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,120
weekend for games.

1230
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,880
I had quite a couple.

1231
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,480
You went shopping this weekend for games.

1232
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,200
What did you buy?

1233
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,960
I went to a big chain store and they had a sale, so I picked up both Phoenix Wright games.

1234
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,240
I got Card Fighters DS, unfortunately.

1235
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Sucker.

1236
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Shut up!

1237
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,240
Itís a good game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

1238
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,520
Except for the fact tható Itís true, but none of us knew about the

1239
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,440
bug until somebody found it.

1240
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
Is it still in the wrapping?

1241
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
You can take it back.

1242
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Donít worry.

1243
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,240
Theyíre probably going to offer a return program where you can send it back to SNKs.

1244
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,920
Theyíll wait six weeks for a replacement copy.

1245
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Yeah, I know.

1246
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,280
Theyíll probably get another free copy of Metal Slug something.

1247
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Whoop-de-doo!

1248
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,840
Speaking of which, the Game Boy Advance in Metal Slug still hasnít come out yet and itís

1249
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,360
been in development for like months, almost a year now.

1250
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
Metal Slug forever?

1251
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360
Yes, almost.

1252
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,360
All right, sorry, Toshin.

1253
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,360
Go on.

1254
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,760
Well, I picked up Metal Slug Anthology, so thatísó

1255
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,760
For the Wii?

1256
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
No, for the PS2.

1257
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,760
Thatís all right.

1258
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,760
Do you have a Wii?

1259
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
You donít have a Wii, do you?

1260
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,760
No, I donít.

1261
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,760
I was about to sayó

1262
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,760
Knock it off!

1263
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,400
Drew, I meant the system.

1264
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
Grow up.

1265
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
God.

1266
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
This is a Wednesday, man.

1267
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Jeez.

1268
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,920
I know, I know, this isnít Wednesday, but Drewís in the pee-pee-poo-poo mentality of

1269
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,920
those jokes.

1270
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,920
See me for the afterbirth.

1271
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
For real.

1272
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,120
Anyway, I wasnít going to say, okay, so you donít have a Nintendo Wii, but you have a

1273
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,120
PS2.

1274
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,560
What of these games have you played so far?

1275
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,120
Have you played them all?

1276
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,520
Iím working on Phoenix Royale 1 right now.

1277
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,520
Itís pretty good.

1278
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,520
All right.

1279
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Itís pretty good?

1280
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,120
Yeah, I mean, it took me a year and a half to get a copy, for crying out loud.

1281
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,760
I didnít find a copy anywhere.

1282
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,760
All right.

1283
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,760
Any other games?

1284
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,880
I like Metal Slug a lot.

1285
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
I love Metal Slug anyway.

1286
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,200
Itís just a fun game.

1287
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,480
Please explain the draw of Metal Slug, because I know Jamie tries very hard, but Matt and

1288
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,560
I still tease her, so youíve got to tellóyouíve got to stick up for Jamie here a little bit.

1289
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,800
Whatís the draw of Metal Slug?

1290
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,960
Itís just old-school, run-aroundóitís likeóyou like Contra, donít you, Rob?

1291
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
You like 8-bit stuff.

1292
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,960
Yeah, I like Contra.

1293
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,960
I think itís just like Neo Geoís version of Contra, with better sprites andó

1294
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,080
Itís not that I donít understand the draw of Metal Slug.

1295
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,800
I donít understand why itís got to be on PlayStation 2, on the Xbox, on the 360, on

1296
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
the Wiió

1297
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
Yeah, I donít understand that.

1298
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,880
Why do they have to re-release it 7 billion times?

1299
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
Yeah.

1300
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,800
Why, hello there, Bust-A-Move, which we were talking about earlier in the program.

1301
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Exactly.

1302
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,320
Oh, God, yeah.

1303
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,280
You know, now that I think about it, SNK kind of sucks.

1304
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,960
I mean, like, sometimes they really, really suck.

1305
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,960
I mean, likeó

1306
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
Does it all suck?

1307
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,960
The N in SNK stands for suck, or you see, I donít know.

1308
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Itísóugh.

1309
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
What?

1310
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Sorry.

1311
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
The N stands for suck?

1312
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
Yes.

1313
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,120
Hooked on phonics, worked for me.

1314
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,320
Yeah, no.

1315
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,440
O-L-R, the L stands for suck.

1316
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,440
S-M-R-T.

1317
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
No, yeah, that would be it.

1318
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,920
O-L-R, the L stands for smart.

1319
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
God.

1320
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,160
Sorry, I just drooled everywhere and laughing.

1321
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,640
Send those blocks of Crayolas care of Rob.

1322
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,120
Sorry, I had a secret meeting with Ken Kutaragi this week.

1323
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,120
What can I say?

1324
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,560
You jumped ship again?

1325
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,240
Even the entire chat room was like, ìWhat?î

1326
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
Train wreck.

1327
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,400
All right, anyway, sorry.

1328
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,880
Yeah, your callís derailing this show, Toshin.

1329
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
We need to wrap it up.

1330
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Any other thoughts?

1331
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,960
If Iím derailing the show, get back on the train.

1332
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,960
All right.

1333
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,920
Itís like, you know, Toshinís call is the microwave waves to Robís pacemaker, is basically

1334
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,920
what it is.

1335
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Hey, at least Iím doing something right.

1336
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
What?

1337
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,920
I think.

1338
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,920
What did you say?

1339
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,760
At least Iím doing something right, I think.

1340
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,760
You think?

1341
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Yeah, youíre derailing this show.

1342
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
Itís the right thing to do.

1343
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
No.

1344
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
Remember, we donít give a shit anymore.

1345
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,760
All right, Toshin.

1346
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Oh, yeah, that.

1347
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,400
Yeah, thanks so much for calling, Toshin.

1348
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
Have fun with the games.

1349
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
All right, later.

1350
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
Thanks.

1351
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,960
You know whatís funny about that phone call is he really wasnít calling to comment on

1352
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,120
any news or anything going on.

1353
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,240
He was just kind of like, ìHey, guys, I bought some games this week.î But we love those

1354
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
types of calls.

1355
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,120
I forgot to mention, I played Super Paper Mario this week.

1356
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Oh, what did you think?

1357
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Well, itís pretty fun.

1358
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,120
Iím just going through the games slowly.

1359
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,520
Itís too fucking easy, though.

1360
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,040
Like, the puzzles arenít that hard.

1361
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,040
For now.

1362
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,280
I think the difficulty ramps up a lot later on.

1363
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
More calls!

1364
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,280
Hi, youíre on Orange Lawnís Radio.

1365
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
Whoís this?

1366
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,280
Hey, whatís up?

1367
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,920
Itís the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. Whatís on your mind?

1368
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
Not too much.

1369
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,920
Youíre really quiet tonight for some reason.

1370
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
I donít know.

1371
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
The D doesnít stand for suck.

1372
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
The D does.

1373
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Wait, what?

1374
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,920
Youíre really, really quiet tonight for some reason.

1375
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,920
Can you turn up your mic or anything?

1376
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
How about now?

1377
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Is that better?

1378
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
A little better.

1379
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Whatís on your mind?

1380
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,640
I donít have a mic on my podcast, the G does.

1381
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:43,480
But either way, I just had a quick question for you guys about gaming.

1382
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,520
Alright, whatís up?

1383
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,320
By the way, that podcast youíre referencing, of course, this day in gaming, right?

1384
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,320
Yeah, definitely.

1385
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,000
Good, great podcast over on all games.

1386
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Check it out.

1387
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Alright, whatís the question?

1388
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,680
Well, you know, the Xbox Live Arcade and the Virtual Console both had a lot of time to

1389
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,840
develop so far.

1390
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,680
Which would you prefer at this moment?

1391
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:09,360
I was having this discussion with one of my friends earlier in the week and I sided with

1392
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,040
the Virtual Console just because I like the idea of having a lot of classic games that

1393
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,720
are in their original form and are guaranteed to be good as opposed to the Xbox Live Arcade

1394
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,120
where you do have a few good games on there and itís nice to have these extra features

1395
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,120
but some of the remakes arenít that great and some of the games themselves arenít that

1396
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,120
great.

1397
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:32,760
But, but, and this is the big but here, the Xbox Live Arcade you can download free demos

1398
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,480
and you can check out the game and see if it sucks before you actually have to buy it.

1399
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,640
The Nintendo system or the Virtual Console or whatever, the Nintendo games, Genesis games,

1400
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,260
you may remember them, ìOh my God, those are so awesomeî and you download them, spend

1401
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,120
your five bucks, whatever, and ìWow, that really sucked.

1402
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,000
Now itís just going to sit on my drive forever.î Also, I hate the way the shop is set up.

1403
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,360
Fucking running off of web pages with JavaScript is retarded and it should have been built

1404
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,000
into the console anyways.

1405
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,160
And besides, I think the Xbox Live Arcade has a better selection right now and my God,

1406
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,560
PlayStation Network put out something because one release a month isÖ

1407
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,880
Notice how Rob D. didnít even mention them.

1408
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Thereís a reason for that.

1409
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
As far as XboxÖ

1410
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,440
Well, I play Lemmings on the PC.

1411
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,440
Iím sorry.

1412
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,440
Exactly.

1413
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,760
I played Lemmings on the PC like 15 years ago and itís just now coming out on PlayStation

1414
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Network.

1415
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,440
Anyhow, you know, I kind of have to side with Loki.

1416
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,680
I think Xbox Live, just the technology itself is superior because here it is.

1417
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,840
Nintendo wonít go online.

1418
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,560
Virtual console, I would give the trophy to in a heartbeat if I could play like Ice Climber

1419
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,040
online with my friends.

1420
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,960
I know the technology is there.

1421
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Itís possible.

1422
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,960
You can do it.

1423
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,040
Lag is not an issue in this day of DSL and all this type of gaming, especially when you

1424
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,400
can play Xbox Live games online.

1425
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,760
Why wonít Nintendo let me do this?

1426
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,320
Thatís why I kind of hesitate in siding with Virtual Console because I love the fact that

1427
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,680
on Xbox Live I can see what my friends are playing.

1428
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,640
I can compare scores.

1429
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,040
Go listen to Part A when I got mad at PK or Uno because he has a slightly bigger Boom

1430
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,520
Boom Rocket score than I do.

1431
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,400
You donít get that on Virtual Console.

1432
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,440
Although Virtual Console in the terms of the games they offer, yeah, you know youíre getting

1433
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,680
good shit because these games for the most part were quality games that came out many

1434
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,880
years ago.

1435
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,720
I could go to Jamieís house and play that shit because she still has them all, right?

1436
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,160
But all kidding aside, the only reason I pretty much download these is just something about

1437
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
having them.

1438
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,600
They pretty much equate to impulse buys.

1439
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
I donít know.

1440
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,040
Yeah, I got to agree with you on most of those points.

1441
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,600
They are legitimate points that I would like to be able to play a timed demo or something

1442
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
on the Virtual Console.

1443
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,800
I donít see why Nintendo didnít do that.

1444
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,500
But to me, in my opinion, and this is why I do side with Virtual Console, the quality

1445
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,520
of the average Virtual Console title, again, in my opinion, is much higher than the quality

1446
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,520
of the average Xbox Live Arcade title.

1447
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,320
What Iíd really like to see Nintendo do though is bring over some of those games like Battle

1448
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,480
of the Lagoon and some of those other games that didnít make it over here.

1449
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,240
Iíd like to see them translate those, localize those, and actually release them on the Virtual

1450
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,240
Console.

1451
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,240
Second Densetsu 3?

1452
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
Please?

1453
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,240
Yeah, exactly.

1454
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,240
Exactly.

1455
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,640
Case point.

1456
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,640
There it is.

1457
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,640
If that does it, I think itís game set and mapped.

1458
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,640
Exactly, yeah.

1459
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,640
Second Densetsu 3 could single-handedly change my mind in all of this, but I donít know.

1460
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:33,440
I get irritated when I canít imagine the technology that Microsoft has developed is

1461
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,440
that complicated.

1462
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,520
Itís merely ideas.

1463
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,520
Those ideas were out on the table a year ago, and yet, well, Sony, I donít know, theyíre

1464
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,520
just crazy.

1465
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,200
I donít know why they havenít adopted this stuff, but Nintendo literally seems to be

1466
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,060
saying, ìWeíre just better than that.

1467
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,520
We just donít want to do that because we want to do this whole other thing.î Although

1468
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,760
I applaud some of the decisions they made with the Wii, I feel like theyíre living

1469
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,240
in the 2600 era when it comes to online right now.

1470
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,560
Yeah, theyíve definitely got to do something with that for sure.

1471
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,560
Itís horrible.

1472
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,240
Well, thatís all I got for you guys.

1473
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
Well, Rob D., thanks for the discussion.

1474
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,200
It was definitely an interesting discussion and a good thing to talk about, so I appreciate

1475
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
it.

1476
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Not a problem.

1477
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Have fun with your show.

1478
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
You guys have a great show.

1479
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
See you later.

1480
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
Will do.

1481
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
Take care, buddy.

1482
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Thanks for the chat room.

1483
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,920
PK or Uno says, ìMy copy of iTunes is only giving me one review for the OLR podcast.î

1484
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,080
Thatís a great point.

1485
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:29,160
I forgot to mention that only the US store actually has 41 reviews because the reviews

1486
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,960
are separated by region.

1487
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,840
Last time I checked, there was one review in the Canadian store.

1488
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,560
I didnít see any in the British store or the Japanese store, but that might have changed.

1489
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,160
The reviews are based by region, so if you go to your iTunes store, hey, if youíre in

1490
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,680
a foreign country, that just means we need your help even more, so if youíre in a foreign

1491
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,080
country using their iTunes stores, please hype us up a little bit.

1492
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,080
Weíd appreciate it.

1493
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,080
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

1494
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,080
Whoís this?

1495
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:00,160
Hi, this is DMN, and no, Iím not living in San Francisco or New York.

1496
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,120
Wow, thatís a pretty blunt statement there because I thought we didnít talk about what

1497
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,760
you did.

1498
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:15,360
Well, I figure this time I can since itís not really anything specific to the company.

1499
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,840
I havenít heard anything about this period up until a couple of people said, ìHey, are

1500
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,000
you aware your companyís moving?î Iím like, ìHuh?î

1501
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,280
Well, the way I read the story, it sounded like the sales department was moving, and

1502
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,640
people are ñ I donít know if theyíre jumping to conclusions or if thereís just some evidence

1503
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,960
I missed, but it seems like people are just kind of saying, ìOh, all of Nintendoís moving

1504
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,520
because the sales department is moving.î

1505
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:45,760
I think thereís some jag off in the gaming media whoís just trying to spawn a story.

1506
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,760
Itís a total rumor.

1507
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:53,800
I think that certain companies should decide to move to Sacramento instead of San Francisco.

1508
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,880
Real estate is a lot cheaper, and I need another job, a better job.

1509
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,320
You just want to stalk me, Loki.

1510
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,480
I just want a better job.

1511
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,880
Okay, so thank you for clarifying that.

1512
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,080
You havenít booked travel to San Francisco or New York any time soon?

1513
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,080
Not for business.

1514
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,600
For prostitution, on the other hand, thatís a different story.

1515
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,160
I know what this is about, but we canít talk about this on the air.

1516
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,560
DMN, anything else you want to share with us then?

1517
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,880
Completely taking this card in another direction.

1518
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
God damn it.

1519
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,280
Spider-Man 3 sucked.

1520
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,680
Did Spider-Man 3 suck, Dark Soccer?

1521
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,320
I didnít get that opinion from any of you.

1522
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,680
Most of it did, but all the parts with Mary Jane in it sucked.

1523
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,680
I didnít see it.

1524
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,680
I canít say it.

1525
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,680
I donít want spoilers either.

1526
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,680
No, I will agree with you.

1527
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,880
Kirsten Dunst was about as good as acting to let them move to the song.

1528
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,680
I loved Kirsten Dunst.

1529
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,680
Shut your mouth.

1530
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,640
I kept wishing so hard that Mary Jane would die, and then why was Gwen in the movie at

1531
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,640
all?

1532
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,960
Sheís heard no point.

1533
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,400
She was there to piss off Mary Jane, and I personally like seeing Mary Jane pissed off.

1534
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,040
That movie made me hate Toby Maguire even more.

1535
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,880
Emo Boy.

1536
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,080
I love Kirsten Dunst.

1537
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,280
Did you never see Drop Dead Gorgeous or The Virgin Suicides or The Interview with the

1538
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Vampire?

1539
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,280
Hello.

1540
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,800
Granted, things changed obviously in the movie and stuff, but I laughed because I never really

1541
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,400
was into the comics for Spider-Man.

1542
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,320
But I laughed when they were talkingónow, this is how nerdy I amóI was watching a science

1543
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,320
of Spider-Man 3 like these people were debating on how this actually could happen.

1544
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,240
But they were talking about how Gwen Stacy died in the comics or whatever, how her neck

1545
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,240
snapped.

1546
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,440
And in the first movie, it was actually MJ and stuff, and he caught her and saved the

1547
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,920
gondola and stuff.

1548
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,880
But I was really hoping they would kill MJ that way.

1549
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Spoilers!

1550
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,480
Yeah, please, spoiler-free.

1551
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,160
Itís been out for years now.

1552
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,160
Screw you.

1553
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,160
Oh, no.

1554
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,160
Sorry.

1555
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,160
I thought you guys were talking about the third movie.

1556
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,160
No, I was talking about the first movie.

1557
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,160
Okay, my bad.

1558
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,280
No, I was just saying I was hoping that her neck would snap in this movie.

1559
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,960
Iíll see it at some point.

1560
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,240
Again, Iím waiting for the teenagers to go away.

1561
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,160
Anything else, DMN?

1562
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Did you play any gamesó

1563
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,320
MCSU 20 is this week, and we have our third guestóor, our third host, as we do every

1564
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:17,920
10 episodes, Kevin the Groove, will be our third host this week, so donít miss it.

1565
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,920
Good times.

1566
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,120
Hey, any actual games youíve been playing this week?

1567
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,560
No, itís been a rough week, so I havenít really gotten a chance to play any games.

1568
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,080
All right, well, then I expect a phone call next week with a full report.

1569
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,400
Weíll see what happens.

1570
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
All right, sounds good.

1571
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
Take care, DMN.

1572
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Later.

1573
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,400
Later.

1574
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,400
Bye.

1575
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,560
And you donít want to move to San Francisco anyway.

1576
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,560
The traffic sucks.

1577
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,000
All right, thatís it foró

1578
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,640
Especially with all those freaking tanker trucks exploding on the freeways.

1579
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,120
Oh, God, that whole mess.

1580
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,640
I havenít even tried to drive to San Francisco since that happened.

1581
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,560
Iíve heard that thereís just a big chunk of the freeway missing now, like theyíve

1582
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,800
cleaned it up and stuff, but thatís going to take months to fix.

1583
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,800
Yeah.

1584
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,800
I mean, I drive by there all the time, and Iíve used that 80 to 880 interchange quite

1585
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,440
a few times, because Iíve gone to South Bay, you know, like Hayward and stuff.

1586
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,680
I have friends in Hayward, but thatís about it.

1587
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,280
Iíve never used that one that actually collapsed, because thatís how you get from SF to Oakland.

1588
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,280
This is where Super Mario Kart technology would come in handy, because all you have

1589
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,240
to do is put one of those boost panel downs and a little, you know, a little jump there

1590
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,560
and boom, youíre done.

1591
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,440
You can clear that gap no problem.

1592
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,760
Oh, Loki, you kill me.

1593
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,120
Alright, well thatís about going to do it here for another episode of Orange Lounge

1594
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,440
Radio, but not before I ask for any last minute stories.

1595
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,440
But of course!

1596
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,480
Thereís some interesting stuff coming out of San Francisco today actually.

1597
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:43,320
The Play First Person Shooter has premiered tonight, and itís kind of going into a story

1598
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:49,040
we talked about a little bit earlier about how people are blaming video games for school

1599
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,280
shootings and stuff like that, and itís kind of their commentary on that.

1600
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,720
So it should be pretty cool.

1601
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,800
Itís like I want to see that play, because itís really not that far away, but at the

1602
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,800
same time I donít.

1603
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
Does that make sense?

1604
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,440
I mean, I feel like itís like, you know, so what, itís a play about video games, big

1605
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
deal.

1606
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,440
Exactly.

1607
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,860
Itís just something for the bloggers to write about.

1608
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:11,400
And talk about in the realm of ridiculous, but you know, the way things are going, who

1609
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,400
knows.

1610
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,580
Apparently thereís been some investigation.

1611
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:22,520
Two Belgium papers were reporting that police were investigating a virtual rape that happened

1612
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,000
in Second Life.

1613
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:34,160
So where else, I mean, basically, insert joke here, do I even have to try tonight?

1614
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,640
I mean, goddamn you Second Life fans are getting shit on tonightís show.

1615
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,640
Iím so sorry.

1616
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
What?

1617
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,080
Obviously you canít get any in his first life.

1618
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:49,520
But it begs the point, Regina Lynn over at Wired said, ìPsychologically, the upheaval

1619
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,320
of virtual rape isnít anywhere near the trauma of real rape, and I canít see us making virtual

1620
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,280
rape a matter for the real-life police.î

1621
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:04,400
If personally, if it were me and someone said, ìYeah, this guy just raped me in my video

1622
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,960
game,î Iíd probably hang up on them.

1623
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,880
Theyíd be like, ìI donít give a shit.

1624
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,280
Why are you wasting my time?

1625
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:17,840
Weíre coming down their rescue.î ìI just got raped in a video game!î No, if they start

1626
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,520
treating this shit as real, itís just like the whole taxing people on virtual commerce.

1627
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,800
Or that kid who got taken away from making the map of his school.

1628
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,680
Itís just people.

1629
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,360
Itís not real.

1630
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,720
Itís not real.

1631
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,480
Itís a fucking video game.

1632
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,180
They make money in the video game.

1633
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,720
You canít tax them on that.

1634
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,920
Or if youíre going to tax them, it has to be on game money, not real money.

1635
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,680
And no, you shouldnít be able to tax them on it.

1636
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:46,480
Anyways, moving on a little bit here, DDR.

1637
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,400
Counting the schools in Scotland.

1638
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,640
So that should be pretty cool, seeing that itís catching on in other places.

1639
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:59,360
For the Simpsons video game, they have a counter now, counting down the video gameís release

1640
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,160
or release info on the launch.

1641
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,240
They have a mock site thatís making fun of Grand Theft Auto IV.

1642
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,240
So thatís pretty cool.

1643
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:11,200
It says 22 on there.

1644
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,480
And letís see, what else weíve got here.

1645
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:20,920
The people behind the wonderful game Puzzle Quest are actually making a new space-themed

1646
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:26,880
game called Galactrix, and Iím talking a little bit about that.

1647
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,080
But it looks pretty cool.

1648
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,240
Theyíre trying to make sure that itís not just a Puzzle Quest clone.

1649
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,800
And thatís it, pretty much.

1650
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,000
Alright, anything from you, Miss Dark Sakura?

1651
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,160
One time, I fed my snakes some beer.

1652
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,080
It cleared this way and that.

1653
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,800
It was all fucked up!

1654
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,200
Thank you for taking the IQ level of our show down a couple notches.

1655
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,000
Itís always good to be humbled like that.

1656
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,840
Oh, thereís, I was going to talk about some stupid rumors that I read.

1657
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,160
Actually, this was funny though.

1658
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,640
Remember they banned some sort of theme on Xbox Live?

1659
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,880
The sexy girl theme or something like that?

1660
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,880
Sexy girl theme.

1661
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,720
I donít know if itís sexy girl, but yeah, itís some girl weird.

1662
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,840
Girls youíll never have theme.

1663
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,080
Itís something like that.

1664
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,720
I thought that was funny.

1665
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:20,680
That and how people are saying that the next PlayStation model is coming out in 18 months.

1666
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,600
Yeah, never going to happen.

1667
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Thatís all.

1668
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,160
Alright, letís go around and get everybodyís final thoughts.

1669
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,000
Drew, Nami, thanks so much for being here again.

1670
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
We appreciate you.

1671
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Youíve been missing a little while.

1672
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,120
Uh, yeah, Iíve been doing some entertaining in the chat room.

1673
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,600
Alright, I apologize.

1674
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,040
We were actually originally, we were thinking about doing a match game tonight.

1675
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,400
Miklotov was trying to, he said heíd stay for the show if he could, we would do a match

1676
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,440
game tonight.

1677
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,520
But then we just did a match game like three episodes ago, so weíre holding off on match

1678
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,520
game.

1679
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,920
Will you come back for maybe the next match game or next dumb little game we play here

1680
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,920
in studio?

1681
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,920
Sure.

1682
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,920
Alright, sounds good.

1683
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,400
Um, Loki, your final, oh wait, did I give you your final thought?

1684
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
Iím sorry.

1685
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,400
I want pie.

1686
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,400
Thank you.

1687
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
Loki, your final thought.

1688
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,720
Uh, Super Mario, or Super Paper Mario, I was going to say Super Mario RPG.

1689
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
Itís actually pretty cool.

1690
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,640
A little easy right now, but Iím only on the third level, so.

1691
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,640
But I like it.

1692
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,400
It, itís, itís growing on me.

1693
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,800
I like, there is, there is a funny part, and itís kind of a spoiler a little bit, but

1694
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,920
in one of the third levels, um, thereís a power-up you can get that turns you into a

1695
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,240
giant version of 8-bit Mario, or whatever, and so you can go smash through stuff.

1696
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,840
Well, you go through this warp pipe, and a turtle sees you, or Koopa Troopa, and grabs

1697
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,240
the same power-up and turns into a giant turtle, and starts chasing after you.

1698
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,240
Oh, thatís cool.

1699
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,600
And you have the power-up and then stomp on it, and itís kind of funny.

1700
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,320
I just thought a little stuff like that is pretty cool.

1701
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,320
Yeah, that gameís cute.

1702
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,120
I need to play more of that game.

1703
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:55,440
Uh, my final thought is, um, Jamboreau, Boran, donít shoot fire in my face anymore, please,

1704
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,200
fucking ride, Dark Sakura.

1705
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,520
Tired.

1706
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:07,840
Alright, I want pie, it has no sugar.

1707
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,000
