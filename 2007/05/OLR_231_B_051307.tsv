0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	23000	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this May 13, 2007.
23000	26000	Remember, Orange Lounge Radio is distributed in two parts.
26000	33000	So if you're thinking, it's not May 13, that's because we record live and we get a whole chat room filled with people over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
33000	38000	And then we break the show up into two parts and take it to our audio archive throughout the week.
38000	41000	So let's get right back into some video game news.
41000	42000	Yes.
42000	43000	Take it away.
43000	51000	And this shouldn't come to a surprise to anybody, but there's a rumor that music downloads are coming to Xbox Live Marketplace.
51000	55000	Yeah, I could totally see that happening since, well, they have the Zune Marketplace right now
55000	61000	that has songs that you can download to your Zune that use the Microsoft Point.
61000	65000	How easy would it be to put these on Xbox Live Marketplace?
65000	67000	It's going to happen sooner or later.
67000	74000	So that's not surprising, especially since Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think,
74000	76000	and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.
76000	82000	Here's the problem I would have with the Zune Marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present,
82000	84000	I don't know a single person with a Zune.
84000	87000	I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.
87000	88000	Well, here's the thing, though.
88000	91000	Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to the Zune.
91000	95000	They just limit it to not just the Zune, but like...
95000	96000	Microsoft products.
96000	97000	You know, Microsoft.
97000	104000	Either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your...
104000	105000	I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.
105000	107000	I want to say I read something about this.
107000	111000	I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up
111000	115000	was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee.
115000	119000	I think something like, in the story, it says something like if you type a subscription fee,
119000	125000	and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have,
125000	129000	but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.
129000	130000	Like Napster.
130000	131000	I love this.
131000	135000	They're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months,
135000	137000	because, you know, there's a price break after three months.
137000	138000	Wait, no, there isn't.
138000	141000	There's not a price break at all.
141000	143000	But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.
143000	149000	It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever, per thing,
149000	151000	or do, like, a subscription.
151000	152000	The Napster model.
152000	153000	Yeah.
153000	154000	It should be a virtual console.
154000	155000	Interesting.
155000	156000	I don't know.
156000	162000	I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.
162000	163000	But they're trying.
163000	165000	They've made a lot of improvements.
165000	169000	Do you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?
169000	170000	I don't know.
170000	171000	Would that work?
171000	173000	It might be a good competition for Netflix.
173000	176000	Well, actually, that's funny that you mentioned Netflix.
176000	183000	I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.
183000	184000	Interesting.
184000	189000	That you were going to be able to, you know, download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.
189000	197000	Well, I heard a rumor that, you know, my cousins, you know, who, sisters, you know, friends, uncles,
197000	200000	person who works for, you know, Microsoft said that you suck.
200000	204000	Very uninterested.
204000	205000	All right.
205000	213000	Anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live marketplace as well.
213000	215000	I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.
215000	218000	Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?
218000	219000	Oh, yes, I have.
219000	220000	It is fucking disturbing.
220000	225000	I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted animation festival or whatever it's called.
225000	229000	I remember, look, you got me a Happy Tree Friend for Christmas a couple years ago.
229000	231000	Don't they have a show on G4 or something now?
231000	233000	It's basically episodes from the cartoon series.
233000	235000	It's got to be a watered down version, though, isn't it?
235000	236000	No, it's not.
236000	237000	It's the exact same thing.
237000	238000	Oh, wow, because that stuff was pretty gruesome.
238000	246000	Well, this is great because Happy Tree Friends is actually now going to be in a digitally distributed PC and Xbox Live arcade game.
246000	247000	I'm buying it.
247000	250000	Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.
250000	257000	It's being developed by Stainless Games and will be published by Sega and should be coming out in fall of 2007.
257000	260000	They're calling it an action puzzle game.
260000	262000	With death.
262000	269000	You can either be Flippy the Bear, Lumpy the Moose, or Handy the Amputee Beaver.
269000	271000	Lovely.
271000	274000	I like games with cute things dying.
274000	275000	I think that's fantastic.
275000	276000	I'll play it.
276000	278000	I'm sure Jamie is going to be all over this game.
278000	281000	This is Cooking Mama 07 right here.
281000	282000	This is it.
282000	284000	That's so awesome.
284000	305000	Well, something else that's fairly awesome, at least as far as rumor-y things, is there's a rumor posted at an Xbox 360 site in the Netherlands that Sega is working on a vintage collection for the Xbox 360 that among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.
305000	313000	So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Aegis for the PlayStation 2?
313000	322000	And not to mention also that they later found out that it was confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.
322000	324000	Goddamn internet liars.
324000	335000	What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Aegis compilation, like the Sega Aegis 2900, because I've got a few of those games. How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?
335000	338000	I wouldn't mind something like that if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.
338000	342000	Then, yeah, something like what you said there where you could just have all of them on one disk.
342000	345000	Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.
345000	346000	Well, a lot.
346000	348000	And I want Planet Harrier.
348000	349000	A good chunk of them.
349000	350000	Planet Harrier.
350000	356000	And they could just release the game and they could call it this. Remember when Sega was good?
356000	358000	And that's what they could call the game.
358000	362000	And it would sell millions of copies because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.
362000	363000	Sega Aegis.
363000	365000	There you go.
365000	369000	That's the selling point right there. Remember when Sega was good?
369000	374000	Yes, but I do remember when Crackdown was good, and it was good today.
374000	378000	And that's because I had the new download pack, and it's awesome.
378000	384000	But there were some complications, as there normally is with a lot of these download packs,
384000	388000	where it was resetting some of the game's progress.
388000	395000	And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.
395000	397000	You might find out that your save game's gone.
397000	398000	Whoopsie.
398000	401000	But they're working on a fix for it right now.
401000	407000	However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.
407000	408000	Just real quick.
408000	412000	All you have to do is get the brand new update, which will be coming out.
412000	417000	And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crashes, the update to the game.
417000	420000	Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.
420000	424000	And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.
424000	426000	And just reboot it, and you're good to go.
426000	429000	So I recommend doing that.
429000	432000	Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.
432000	435000	But the download content is fucking awesome.
435000	437000	Free or paid.
437000	439000	Either way, you've got to get it.
439000	443000	I don't think I have ever played Crackdown co-op, so I should be okay, right?
443000	444000	You should be fine.
444000	448000	But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.
448000	451000	And then go back into it and you can play it again.
451000	456000	And I played a co-op on the keys to the city mode, actually the land.
456000	460000	So that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.
460000	462000	So that you're probably safe on.
462000	469000	And just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.
469000	475000	But what they really, really, really need to release now is an instant replay saver
475000	477000	or something like that where you can create your own movies
477000	480000	because with all this extra crap that they threw in there,
480000	483000	there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.
483000	484000	All right.
484000	487000	Ross Deal, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com says,
487000	489000	Crackdown co-op is overrated.
489000	491000	You don't even have to really play together.
491000	493000	What do you think? What do you say to that?
493000	495000	Exactly. You don't have to play together, but it's still fun.
495000	499000	And it's not really fun to actually play together to try to beat missions and stuff.
499000	501000	It's just fun to fuck around.
501000	504000	That's the whole fun about it.
504000	506000	Well, some evidence has come to light this week
506000	508000	of a new Xbox Live game in development.
508000	511000	It's Bomberman Live on the Xbox 360.
511000	515000	And the evidence to support this game's release is that
515000	518000	the Australian government's Office of Film and Literature
518000	520000	actually has already raided this game.
520000	524000	Not only that, but a screenshot showed up earlier this week as well.
524000	528000	So it does look like Bomberman will be making its way to the Xbox Live arcade.
528000	530000	As to when, who knows.
530000	534000	But certainly this game is certain to get a lot better reception
534000	537000	than Bomberman Act Zero did on the Xbox 360,
537000	542000	which you might recognize as the worst Xbox 360 title out there in existence.
542000	544000	Not only that, they have a trailer for it, too, out there.
544000	545000	Look at that now.
545000	549000	So it's official, and it is old-school Bomberman.
549000	551000	Thank God.
551000	553000	You know what my only problem with this game would be?
553000	554000	What?
554000	555000	Because that's being developed by Backbone,
555000	557000	according to everything that I've seen online.
557000	558000	What else has Backbone done?
558000	559000	Death Junior.
559000	560000	Oh.
560000	562000	And Brooktown.
562000	565000	And a lot of really crappy games.
565000	568000	So I have no hope for this.
568000	569000	All right.
569000	570000	They're going to suck.
570000	572000	How can you fuck up Bomberman, though?
572000	573000	Oh, wait.
573000	574000	Bomberman Act Zero.
574000	575000	Bomberman Act Zero.
575000	576000	Good point.
576000	579000	It looked like classic Bomberman.
579000	580000	There's no way.
580000	583000	Just seriously, don't change anything.
583000	585000	Just make it playable on the internet.
585000	586000	The end.
586000	587000	That's it.
587000	590000	The last really good Bomberman was Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo.
590000	593000	I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.
593000	599000	Was that after Bomberman 94 on a Turbo?
599000	600000	I do believe so.
600000	601000	Bomberman 94 was really good,
601000	605000	but it was still I think the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.
605000	609000	With the multi-tap.
609000	612000	So just take that and make it online playable.
612000	614000	The end.
614000	617000	No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?
617000	621000	Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.
621000	625000	However, and it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.
625000	628000	God, I hate ads.
628000	631000	Stop putting flash ads on your site, you stupid butt heads.
631000	633000	Well, they got to make money somehow.
633000	636000	Delete crap heads.
636000	638000	Anyway.
638000	648000	In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.
648000	655000	And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.
655000	656000	At least so I'd have heard.
656000	660000	But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.
660000	667000	You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.
667000	670000	Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?
670000	671000	Yes.
671000	672000	Well, there you go.
672000	675000	No point me downloading this because I don't have that.
675000	677000	I don't know. I'll give it a try because I've been interested in it.
677000	680000	I play the Xbox 360 demo.
680000	683000	But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.
683000	686000	So, let's hope.
686000	688000	Yes.
688000	692000	And, unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June.
692000	693000	Spore.
693000	697000	Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.
697000	705000	Apparently, the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA.
705000	709000	And, of course, their fiscal year ends March 31st, 2008.
709000	714000	So, got to wait more for this game.
714000	724000	But you know what, though? I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up.
724000	727000	Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.
727000	730000	It didn't look like that much more to go. It looked pretty cool to me.
730000	741000	The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.
741000	750000	And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.
750000	754000	I don't know, though. News about games I'm really looking forward to getting delayed.
754000	756000	It really makes me angsty.
756000	762000	And when I get angsty, people die, and we have to do this little segment on the program called the FUs of the Week.
762000	775000	Dark Sakura, start us off.
775000	784000	A few of the week goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which for anyone who has gone into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.
784000	793000	It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it hops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.
793000	795000	Loki.
795000	805000	I'm pissed off at the fact that Grent thought of course not out yet. That makes me sad.
805000	810000	My FU of the Week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft. I hope you all die in a fire.
810000	815000	I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it, and it hasn't been doing a damn thing.
815000	820000	The Spammers are still getting through with all their tells. I hope they all die a lot.
820000	824000	I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs.
824000	827000	Niklotov, anything you have for FUs of the Week?
827000	835000	I was going to say FU to Drama, but I'm actually just going to say no, I have nothing.
835000	840000	So you're saying FU without saying FU?
840000	844000	Kind of, but not so much. I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.
844000	849000	All right. Very cryptic there.
849000	856000	That was a short FU of the Week segment. I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight. Everybody seems to be pretty happy.
856000	866000	All right. Well, this is some interesting news here, and I should clarify this is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story,
866000	870000	so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.
870000	878000	There's a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.
878000	887000	So in other words, and then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, well, the elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is,
887000	896000	and blah, blah, blah, blah, but to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data and not even the newest data.
896000	897000	So there you have it.
897000	905000	But of course, this is just going to say about this whole price war is going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
905000	911000	So there you go. That's it. That's all I got.
911000	913000	Question things that you read on the Internet.
913000	918000	I question everything that I read on the Internet and I question what the intelligence of this is.
918000	926000	They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360, which, first of all, it looks stupid.
926000	929000	I hate the color yellow so damn much.
929000	936000	And by the way, if I wanted like Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.
936000	937000	Why?
937000	939000	I don't know. I thought it looked kind of neat.
939000	941000	I mean, nobody else has one.
941000	949000	Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah,
949000	955000	to tie in with the Simpsons movie release on July 27th.
955000	958000	Yeah, whatever.
958000	960000	But you're a collector. Don't you want one of these?
960000	963000	I collect things that don't suck ass.
963000	967000	Fine. See if I care.
967000	970000	If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.
970000	976000	Well, this is, of course, is all tying into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.
976000	979000	And the game looks fucking awesome.
979000	982000	It's on pretty much every platform.
982000	986000	Of course, all the next gen platforms or current gen, however you want to call them,
986000	991000	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2 and PSP.
991000	994000	And it's just pretty awesome.
994000	1000000	It's basically the storyline revolves around them being put into an actual game.
1000000	1004000	And then they realize that they're stuck in a video game, kind of almost a little bit like Bart's nightmare, I guess.
1004000	1007000	But it's just awesome.
1007000	1009000	And the whole game looks kind of cel-shaded.
1009000	1014000	Reminds me a little bit of the 3D that's actually in like Futurama or something like that.
1014000	1017000	Very cool looking, though.
1017000	1018000	Awesome.
1018000	1022000	Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?
1022000	1025000	It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.
1025000	1026000	They're like episodes, basically.
1026000	1028000	So there's 16 levels in the game.
1028000	1035000	And there was some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.
1035000	1044000	For example, there was posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island types, stuff like that.
1044000	1047000	That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.
1047000	1048000	It'll be neat.
1048000	1050000	I think it's going to be pretty awesome.
1050000	1052000	Also, two-player co-op.
1052000	1055000	That's going to go over live on Xbox, maybe?
1055000	1059000	I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system.
1059000	1062000	But I think you might be able to do it over live as well.
1062000	1067000	GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead.
1067000	1070000	But that's made by Activision.
1070000	1072000	Medal of Homer.
1072000	1074000	Might get me to play one of those war games, finally, though.
1074000	1076000	Medal of Homer.
1076000	1081000	Of course, the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial, you might remember, back in the day when it was first out.
1081000	1084000	Like those shirts that said, Eat My Shorts, that were banned from school and stuff.
1084000	1088000	Well, of course, always a source of controversy is the game ratings system.
1088000	1099000	The ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings.
1099000	1103000	And 85% use them regularly when buying games.
1103000	1108000	That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.
1108000	1110000	So, kind of interesting there.
1110000	1112000	There you go.
1112000	1118000	I mean, of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game is safe for me.
1118000	1120000	And the parent just kind of listens to that.
1120000	1121000	So, I don't know.
1121000	1124000	Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.
1124000	1127000	90% of parents know about the system.
1127000	1131000	The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.
1131000	1133000	I don't know.
1133000	1137000	Well, there's one thing, though, between knowing about it and understanding how it's used.
1137000	1138000	True.
1138000	1143000	But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.
1143000	1157000	And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.
1157000	1164000	And that means that, you know, somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.
1164000	1166000	Was that you, Miklotov?
1166000	1167000	Did you do that?
1167000	1174000	Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?
1174000	1180000	Yes, because I live in Europe.
1180000	1183000	I'd just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.
1183000	1184000	It's healthy.
1184000	1186000	Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say.
1186000	1189000	And that time was one of them.
1189000	1191000	Go back to playing with Hoe Monkey.
1191000	1192000	Hoe Monkey.
1192000	1195000	All right.
1195000	1200000	I'm going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1200000	1205000	They have a list of features that's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.
1205000	1209000	Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.
1209000	1213000	You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.
1213000	1216000	Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.
1216000	1218000	And it looks pretty awesome.
1218000	1223000	Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.
1223000	1228000	And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already freaking even talked about already.
1228000	1231000	Thirty days after the date when it comes out.
1231000	1233000	I don't know. Interesting.
1233000	1237000	Oh, hooray. You can rate me with microtransactions in Bomberman. I'm so excited.
1237000	1239000	Awesome.
1239000	1243000	Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.
1243000	1253000	There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.
1253000	1262000	And, I don't know, this is coming from a forum post to this website Ecoustics.
1262000	1270000	And it's, I guess, 2chan in Japan. I don't know.
1270000	1276000	Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?
1276000	1283000	Yes, but here's the thing, though. They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.
1283000	1289000	They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.
1289000	1294000	They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.
1294000	1302000	Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so not going to happen yet.
1302000	1308000	And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.
1308000	1314000	Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player. That's going to make me sad.
1314000	1318000	Well, it's just like Betamax before people bought Betamax.
1318000	1320000	It must run in my family. My parents had a Betamax.
1320000	1321000	Laser discs.
1321000	1323000	That I didn't have, but she had it.
1323000	1325000	I still have them. I still watch them.
1325000	1330000	You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.
1330000	1331000	That's right.
1331000	1334000	That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.
1334000	1339000	You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point. I believe it's been confirmed since then,
1339000	1345000	but when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it, I've got to buy an HD DVD player.
1345000	1348000	I want one for the exact same reason. I don't care about anything else.
1348000	1353000	I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.
1353000	1358000	And to answer Ross, SteelUT, and Chad who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.
1358000	1363000	There you go, Heroes. HD DVD won the war. I had to have Heroes on HD.
1363000	1366000	Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.
1366000	1368000	What am I going to do all summer?
1368000	1373000	Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.
1373000	1374000	It did for me.
1374000	1375000	But that's one person.
1375000	1377000	They might come out on Blu-ray later.
1377000	1380000	But laserdisc didn't win the war either, so nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
1380000	1382000	Well, fuck you, Advent Children.
1382000	1383000	Fuck you.
1383000	1387000	Advent Children is coming out. The director's cut is coming out on Blu-ray only.
1387000	1394000	Advent Children? Okay, I care because little spirits within me coming out too.
1394000	1396000	I don't care about that.
1396000	1399000	But laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market, so it didn't necessarily die.
1399000	1400000	Of nerds.
1400000	1402000	No, and they're actually still releasing laserdiscs.
1402000	1403000	Really?
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1405000	Two companies are.
1405000	1409000	I remember how they had that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this.
1409000	1412000	Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars.
1412000	1414000	Can you imagine what would happen?
1414000	1417000	The kind of damage you could do with laserdisc if you threw it at somebody?
1417000	1418000	Yeah.
1418000	1421000	But dead platforms still get support all the time.
1421000	1426000	One of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.
1426000	1427000	5200, I think.
1427000	1428000	Or is it 5200?
1428000	1429000	Yeah.
1429000	1430000	Whatever.
1430000	1432000	Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.
1432000	1434000	Well, I have some happy news.
1434000	1439000	For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.
1439000	1446000	And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days,
1446000	1454000	was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.
1454000	1460000	And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.
1460000	1467000	And so I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.
1467000	1469000	Fangirlgasm.
1469000	1472000	Not necessarily. I just think it's good quality work.
1472000	1477000	A little disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.
1477000	1478000	True.
1478000	1480000	That was disappointing.
1480000	1483000	Hell, they should just do some original animation.
1483000	1486000	Just release some actual stuff.
1486000	1496000	Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies in the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.
1496000	1499000	Video game purists will probably hate it.
1499000	1511000	The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel will actually be playing the role.
1511000	1517000	Funny enough, Keira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role and both of them passed.
1517000	1523000	But Jessica Biel, because she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.
1523000	1526000	At least they got the sex right.
1526000	1530000	Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.
1530000	1536000	What's your face from Crouching Tiger or Hidden Dragon?
1536000	1537000	Zhang Ji?
1537000	1538000	Yeah.
1538000	1542000	Why don't they just have her play like fucking Cammy or something? At least that would make sense.
1542000	1544000	Well, keep in mind this is just a rumor.
1544000	1545000	I leave it out because he's a player again.
1545000	1546000	Again?
1546000	1548000	She did, in the old movie.
1548000	1549000	I know, I know.
1549000	1550000	She played Cammy?
1550000	1551000	Yeah.
1551000	1552000	Okay.
1552000	1553000	But you know who should play Chun-Li?
1553000	1554000	Who?
1554000	1555000	Ching Chong.
1555000	1557000	What?
1557000	1561000	He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays like the...
1561000	1563000	No, I'm just making a reaction.
1563000	1566000	No, that's Chow Chang, stupid.
1566000	1568000	I know Chow Chang, I'm just saying that's what Nelly calls her.
1568000	1571000	I think it was great though that she was Scottish.
1571000	1574000	Here's the thing.
1574000	1577000	This Asian girl with this thick Scottish accent.
1577000	1578000	It was great.
1578000	1581000	Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie.
1581000	1582000	He was a good Chun-Li too.
1582000	1590000	In the movie, City Hunter was more accurate than fucking Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.
1590000	1596000	Granted, I'm not going to say that Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, scantily clad, would not
1596000	1598000	be a draw for me to see his movie.
1598000	1602000	What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene like in the Japanese
1602000	1603000	one?
1603000	1605000	That would never happen, but that'd be hot.
1605000	1609000	I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.
1609000	1613000	Tigerclaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.
1613000	1617000	I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden
1617000	1618000	Dragon.
1618000	1620000	You know that chick?
1620000	1622000	Zhang Ziyi, that was her name.
1622000	1623000	Yeah, exactly.
1623000	1625000	ActDeaf says Kylie Minogue rocks.
1625000	1626000	That's true.
1626000	1630000	SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?
1630000	1633000	And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alva, Kiera Knightley.
1633000	1636000	They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.
1636000	1639000	I can never pronounce that guy's name.
1639000	1640000	Jeter.
1640000	1641000	You know what would be really awful?
1641000	1646000	Is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for
1646000	1647000	the movie.
1647000	1650000	That would be awful.
1650000	1659000	We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la, around the world, street fighting,
1659000	1661240	la la la la.
1661240	1665000	Maybe I should play Chun-Li.
1665000	1669920	RuPaul is Chun-Li.
1669920	1673000	I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere.
1673000	1677000	Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass.
1677000	1683000	Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass.
1683000	1685000	JVMon says Rob could be E. Honda.
1685000	1687000	Are we saying I'm fat?
1687000	1689000	What are we trying to say?
1689000	1694000	DJ Darknite says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3.
1694000	1697000	Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya.
1697000	1699000	That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li.
1699000	1701000	It could be Sanjaya from American Idol.
1701000	1710000	And GS68, as long as Loki plays Tingle.
1710000	1714000	Anyways, back to Guitar Hero.
1714000	1719000	Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the
1719000	1724000	80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer,
1724000	1732000	July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister,
1732000	1738000	I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist NotCovers, Rounded
1738000	1746000	Round, as made famous by RAT, I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow, and Mental
1746000	1752000	Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot, Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio, that's pretty
1752000	1757000	cool, and The Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia.
1757000	1762000	How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're
1762000	1763000	Not Gonna Take It?
1763000	1764000	How do you do that?
1764000	1765000	It could be an unlocked song.
1765000	1768000	Or even the song Remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the
1768000	1772000	whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly
1772000	1777000	Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're
1777000	1779000	gonna burn in hell.
1779000	1781000	That was awesome.
1781000	1782000	Anyway, sorry.
1782000	1786000	But yeah, why that random ass Twisted Sister song?
1786000	1790000	These are only, you know, seven songs that have been announced yet.
1790000	1794000	I mean, come on, it's gonna be, you know, there's gonna be more songs in there.
1794000	1799000	In case you're wondering, it is only gonna be coming out on Playstation 2, at least as
1799000	1800000	a disc.
1800000	1803000	360, get ready for another download!
1803000	1804000	Woohoo!
1804000	1806000	Do you have the facts to back that up?
1806000	1807000	That's a rumor.
1807000	1810000	It's only coming out on Playstation 2, as a disc.
1810000	1811000	Oh, okay.
1811000	1812000	Alright.
1812000	1815000	So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.
1815000	1816000	Or just unannounced.
1816000	1818000	Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.
1818000	1820000	No, but it's gonna be a download pack.
1820000	1821000	Alright.
1821000	1823000	You're very insistent about that.
1823000	1827000	Let's see, RawsteelUT seems to think they're gonna stick We're Not Gonna Take It in one
1827000	1829000	of those shitty download packs.
1829000	1830000	There you go.
1830000	1834000	Let's see, a couple people in chat, Drewnami and SSJ100matt both are asking, where's Come
1834000	1836000	On Feel the Noise?
1836000	1839000	These are only the first seven songs announced yet, folks!
1839000	1840000	I mean, come on!
1840000	1842000	There's gonna be another, like, 27 songs, at least.
1842000	1845000	Man, I still want Highway to Hell.
1845000	1847000	Our dirty deed's done dirt cheap.
1847000	1850000	As much as I hate ACDC, I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell.
1850000	1853000	I can't stand that fucking guy's voice.
1853000	1855000	Never did like it.
1855000	1856000	Alright.
1856000	1858000	But a game I could stand was Saints Row.
1858000	1860000	That was actually kind of fun.
1860000	1864000	If you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row,
1864000	1865000	sucks to be you.
1865000	1867000	It just got canned.
1867000	1869000	But there is a silver lining to the story.
1869000	1874000	Saints Row 2 is in development right now, and it's coming out on the Playstation 3 and
1874000	1879000	the Xbox 360, and they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.
1879000	1882000	I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.
1882000	1886000	Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.
1886000	1889000	The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment
1889000	1892000	into a larger installed base next year.
1892000	1894000	That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.
1894000	1897000	In other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1.
1897000	1899000	And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.
1899000	1902000	I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it through.
1902000	1905000	Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or
1905000	1906000	Crackdown.
1906000	1907000	Exactly.
1907000	1911000	Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.
1911000	1915000	Unless it sucks, in which case it will come out right afterwards.
1915000	1917000	It's actually not a bad decision though.
1917000	1918000	Alright.
1918000	1922000	Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.
1922000	1926000	You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.
1926000	1929000	And Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag head first.
1929000	1931000	And land on pavement apparently.
1931000	1934000	And pull out some of her favorite emails.
1934000	1937000	So Dark Soccer, what's in the email bag this week?
1937000	1938000	Fuck everybody.
1938000	1940000	I haven't got a single damn email.
1940000	1942000	So fuck it.
1942000	1946000	I should say just there was some spam and there was a couple.
1946000	1947000	The spam is squishy.
1947000	1949000	We had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.
1949000	1953000	And there were like a couple random emails that were like other types of inquiries that
1953000	1954000	aren't really suitable for on air.
1954000	1956000	But other than that, nothing.
1956000	1959000	Like Rob, what color are your underwear?
1959000	1963000	No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on air probably.
1963000	1964000	Yeah, Dark Tazzy has said it.
1964000	1965000	Pool's closed.
1965000	1967000	And Green.
1967000	1968000	What the?
1968000	1970000	Okay, whatever.
1970000	1971000	What?
1971000	1974000	I'm married, butthead.
1974000	1977000	What, are now they just starting to ask questions in chat?
1977000	1978000	Alright.
1978000	1979000	I'm doing some chat booting.
1979000	1980000	Alright.
1980000	1984000	Well, in lieu of a mail bag segment this week, by the way, if you want to send us an email,
1984000	1985000	mailbagatorangelaundry.com.
1985000	1986000	That is very odd though.
1986000	1990000	We've been doing this show for, you know, well, we've been doing a mail bag segment
1990000	1994000	in our show, I should say, since we were doing a podcast, which was what, January of 05?
1994000	1998000	Because when we were doing the old show, the three hour program about like DDR, we didn't
1998000	2000000	really do an email bag segment.
2000000	2003000	It was pretty much chat comments or nothing because you had to listen to the show live
2003000	2004000	or you didn't hear it at all, right?
2004000	2006000	So we didn't really have an email bag segment.
2006000	2010000	But ever since January of 05, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting
2010000	2012000	a readable email.
2012000	2015000	That's very strange, isn't it?
2015000	2020000	Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one, I want one in French.
2020000	2024000	Well, you know, the good news is now I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.
2024000	2026000	Someone email me in French.
2026000	2027000	Alright.
2027000	2028000	Alright, here we go.
2028000	2031000	That was my best French impersonation, by the way.
2031000	2032000	Alright, well.
2032000	2033000	That was horrible.
2033000	2034000	Thank you.
2034000	2035000	As most of my accents are.
2035000	2036000	Right.
2036000	2038000	Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.
2038000	2040000	Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.
2040000	2041000	What?
2041000	2042000	Okay, this is kind of stupid.
2042000	2045000	My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.
2045000	2046000	Uh-huh.
2046000	2051000	So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our
2051000	2054000	birthday party next month, right?
2054000	2056000	Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?
2056000	2060000	No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.
2060000	2068000	I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock and I'm going to dress as a police constable and
2068000	2070000	go around arresting my coworkers.
2070000	2071000	Lovely.
2071000	2072000	Did you have fun with that?
2072000	2073000	Or has that happened yet?
2073000	2074000	No, it's next month.
2074000	2075000	Picks, please.
2075000	2076000	Alright.
2076000	2080000	Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.
2080000	2082000	We had a phone call on our Skype line.
2082000	2087000	Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live and we'll take your
2087000	2088000	calls in a minute here.
2088000	2093000	But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.
2093000	2097000	Chris and Meg Z went to ASEN and Meg Z actually had an artist's table.
2097000	2100000	Because some folks are actually saying, like, hey, I never found Chris and Meg Z.
2100000	2101000	Where were they at the con?
2101000	2103000	Meg Z is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.
2103000	2105000	Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.
2105000	2106000	Yeah.
2106000	2107000	And she had an artist's table.
2107000	2108000	Meg Z had an art table.
2108000	2109000	Yeah, she did.
2109000	2110000	So that's where she spent most of the con.
2110000	2113000	So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the
2113000	2114000	art room, that's it.
2114000	2115000	And Chris was doing it too.
2115000	2116000	Yeah.
2116000	2119000	Chris apparently went around and hoarded out the show, but she says that in her voice message,
2119000	2121000	which we're going to listen to right now.
2121000	2123000	Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.
2123000	2126000	Hello, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
2126000	2132000	This is Chris over at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
2132000	2139000	And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well due to time
2139000	2145000	constraints, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done.
2145000	2151000	Probably done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.
2151000	2154000	The pimping out has not been going according to plan.
2154000	2158000	So I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.
2158000	2163000	I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did,
2163000	2164000	my phone kept dying.
2164000	2168000	Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including
2168000	2172000	a game room, both of which my cell phone reception did not work.
2172000	2178000	So obviously, this entire trip has been one big mass of blah for me.
2178000	2181000	Plus, I'm now losing my voice.
2181000	2184000	But I think I should give you guys a scope anyway.
2184000	2190000	Those of you who are interested in going to ASEN 2000, oops, messed up.
2190000	2194000	Those of you who are interested at all going to ASEN and are looking for games,
2194000	2195000	there's lots of things to do here.
2195000	2199000	The deal room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.
2199000	2206000	There's a lot of, what are those things called, you know, the dating sims.
2206000	2207000	There's a lot of those.
2207000	2209000	And a lot of Yowie ones for those fangirls.
2209000	2212000	A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which, again,
2212000	2216000	I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.
2216000	2218000	I just haven't had the time.
2218000	2221000	There's also card games for people.
2221000	2225000	There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters
2225000	2227000	and all that fun stuff.
2227000	2232000	And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.
2232000	2237000	This entire trip actually was paid for me due to the fact that I had no money.
2237000	2240000	It was part of my birthday present for my wonderful girlfriend, Maggie,
2240000	2242000	who's been selling her art.
2242000	2249000	And other than that, it's more focused on anime, obviously, than games.
2249000	2253000	But I don't discount the fact that they do give a lot of props to the gamers,
2253000	2255000	and there have been a lot of them.
2255000	2258000	I just, unfortunately, due to many different circumstances,
2258000	2261000	I haven't been able to get any good interviews.
2261000	2263000	But I do have pictures for anyone who's interested.
2263000	2269000	They will be up on my website, my live channel at Disneypunk10.
2269000	2271000	Or you can try to get ahold from Dark Sakura.
2271000	2274000	But other than that, I have tried.
2274000	2277000	I've been pimping out your show, I swear.
2277000	2282000	I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says,
2282000	2285000	I've changed around radio for gamers or something like that.
2285000	2286000	I forgot what I put on it.
2286000	2288000	I printed those out at work.
2288000	2292000	I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.
2292000	2295000	It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.
2295000	2297000	Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.
2297000	2301000	I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.
2301000	2303000	And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year,
2303000	2306000	you guys have got to give me some good promos.
2306000	2310000	So it looks impressive than the shit that I have.
2310000	2316000	But anyway, this has been Chris at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
2316000	2318000	This has been your Roaming Lesbian.
2318000	2320000	Back to you, Rob.
2320000	2321000	Back to you, Jamie.
2321000	2322000	Back to you, Matt.
2322000	2325000	Max Rule, asshole.
2325000	2326000	There you go, Chris.
2326000	2328000	Semi-live at ASEN there.
2328000	2330000	You've got to love Chris.
2330000	2331000	She's so fine.
2331000	2335000	I love that she's kind of adopted the title of the Roaming Lesbian of OLR.
2335000	2336000	It's great.
2336000	2337000	And Max Rule, asshole.
2337000	2338000	Did you catch that in the end?
2338000	2341000	I did.
2341000	2342000	I did.
2342000	2343000	I hate their commercials, too.
2343000	2344000	Because now he's like,
2344000	2347000	See, the commercials said they're better, so they are.
2347000	2349000	I'm like, fucking A.
2349000	2350000	Great, here come 10 e-mails next week.
2350000	2351000	Why does Lucky hate Max?
2351000	2352000	Why does he hate Max?
2352000	2354000	Your show is on iPods.
2354000	2356000	You should respect Max more.
2356000	2358000	Freedom of speech, what can we say?
2358000	2360000	He's allowed to hate Max if he wants.
2360000	2363000	Dark Soccer and I, we love the Max.
2363000	2365000	They're like the Volkswagen Beetle.
2365000	2367400	This little fucking cars is what they are.
2367400	2368520	All right, ASEN.
2368520	2369480	ASEN, please.
2369480	2371120	Can we talk a little bit about ASEN?
2371120	2373400	I heard some of our listeners actually did some,
2373400	2375400	like some folks randomly ran into each other.
2375400	2378440	Like it seems like Rob D and Misty, two of our chatters,
2378440	2380160	it sound like they were chatting earlier.
2380160	2381220	So that's kind of cool.
2381220	2382720	I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN.
2382720	2385220	And who knows, maybe next year, if it's in the OLR budget,
2385220	2385920	we'll go.
2385920	2387960	But for now, we have Fond of May to look forward to.
2387960	2390960	Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area,
2390960	2392040	you got to go to Fond of May.
2392040	2393600	It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend.
2393600	2395080	OLR is going to be there Saturday.
2395080	2398440	And since we're only doing one panel this year,
2398440	2400200	it's in the works.
2400200	2401840	This won't be live, boys and girls.
2401840	2407640	But we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
2407640	2412960	Friday night at the Super Secret Suite
2412960	2414600	that OLR will be at Friday night.
2414600	2415720	The Super Secret Suite?
2415720	2417480	The Super Secret.
2417480	2420760	Yes, it's our Super Secret Suite 16.
2420760	2423280	That's not the actually sweet number, whatever sweet it is.
2423280	2425480	The biggest, the most number of drunk,
2425480	2426440	because it's going to be at a con.
2426440	2427760	So everybody's going to be there.
2427760	2429560	The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
2429560	2431560	I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just
2431560	2433520	don't have the equipment to make that happen.
2433520	2435240	I could take my Mac out there, but look,
2435240	2436900	you would find a way to fuck it all up.
2436900	2437600	So there you go.
2437600	2439880	I can take my non-Mac.
2439880	2440480	All right.
2440480	2441000	So we'll see.
2441000	2441280	We'll see.
2441280	2442720	Well, we're going to tape it one way or another.
2442720	2445280	And that's going to be half the show you get that week.
2445280	2447160	So we're going to flag it somehow.
2447160	2448520	It's not a usual show.
2448520	2451760	It'll be like the OLR special edition.
2451760	2455200	The OLR live from the minibar.
2455200	2456840	Live at Fond of May and live at minibars.
2456840	2457360	There you go.
2457360	2458740	We will be at Fond of May, though.
2458740	2461600	And the real show will be probably hung over
2461600	2463240	on Saturday at 2 PM.
2463240	2464720	So we're looking forward to that.
2464720	2466960	By the way, unfortunately, that won't be live either.
2466960	2468220	We won't be live that weekend.
2468220	2470320	But you can come see us tape live in person.
2470320	2471200	That's pretty awesome.
2471200	2473280	And we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again.
2473280	2475120	We had some really good questions last year.
2475120	2478040	Someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac-hating thing.
2478040	2479120	That's always a good time.
2479120	2479720	I don't care.
2479720	2481000	OK, I don't care.
2481000	2485080	I don't even really hate them anymore.
2485080	2485960	I don't like them.
2485960	2486800	I wouldn't buy them.
2486800	2488600	I don't care if you like them.
2488600	2489120	Great.
2489120	2490020	Good for you.
2490020	2490960	I really don't care.
2490960	2492400	You've become a poster child.
2492400	2494480	Stop asking me why I don't like them,
2494480	2496760	because I don't have legitimate reasons.
2496760	2499440	I don't like them.
2499440	2500960	It's I'm racist against Mac.
2500960	2502420	She doesn't like the color yellow.
2502420	2503240	You don't like Macs.
2503240	2503760	Exactly.
2503760	2505200	I'm racist against Macs.
2505200	2506480	I have no reason for it.
2506480	2509240	There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.
2509240	2510680	I think they're crappy computers.
2510680	2513760	But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.
2513760	2515560	That's your opinion, awesome.
2515560	2518040	I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them.
2518040	2518560	Either way.
2518560	2520520	Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?
2520520	2521880	Thank you.
2521880	2528920	Anyways, so yeah, this is not very surprising at all.
2528920	2532320	But apparently, Playboy's coming to Second Life.
2532320	2534360	I would say, what took them so long?
2534360	2537860	Since I want to say that most of Second Life anyways
2537860	2541040	is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.
2541040	2543280	Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.
2543280	2547040	But yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life.
2547040	2549900	And no real word of what's going to happen.
2549900	2552440	But apparently, you're going to be able to participate either
2552440	2556720	as a centerfold or as somebody staring at centerfolds.
2556720	2559240	Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?
2559240	2559920	Possibly.
2559920	2560840	I don't know.
2560840	2562840	Microsoft also entered Second Life.
2562840	2564880	I want to say Final Fantasy VII's
2564880	2567720	been recreated in Second Life.
2567720	2569240	You know, I hate to sound morbid,
2569240	2571320	but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.
2571320	2572820	I mean, he's not getting any younger.
2572820	2576080	I'm so interested to see how CNN is going
2576080	2578040	to handle it when he passes.
2578040	2582480	You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?
2582480	2587120	Hugh is an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.
2587120	2587800	I don't know.
2587800	2591520	Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.
2591520	2593000	Seven chicks at one time.
2593000	2596080	Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.
2596080	2598000	That's the fountain of youth.
2598000	2600160	Suddenly, all the young kids still want to do you.
2600160	2602960	You know, if there's one person that in this world
2602960	2605440	needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.
2605440	2605960	No, no.
2605960	2606680	I take that back.
2606680	2607840	Bob Barker.
2607840	2610600	But if they can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.
2610600	2612720	We have the Hugh Bot and the Bob Bot.
2612720	2613640	Bob Barker.
2613640	2614560	He cannot die.
2614560	2615720	The Barker Bot.
2615720	2616960	He's retiring this year.
2616960	2617560	It's happening.
2617560	2618840	Ah!
2618840	2619340	I know.
2619340	2620120	I'm sad, too.
2620120	2620680	No.
2620680	2622040	Robot.
2622040	2624160	Somebody kill him before he decides to retire,
2624160	2625560	and we'll resurrect him as a robot,
2625560	2627120	and he'll never know the difference.
2627120	2630680	He will think it's his first year doing the show.
2630680	2631840	He will not be tired of it.
2631840	2632340	You know.
2632340	2635080	He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.
2635080	2637440	Rumor is, because Rosie's leaving The View,
2637440	2641400	Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.
2641400	2643160	Yeah.
2643160	2643660	No.
2646560	2649160	It's like, come on down.
2649160	2650320	No, you're going to eat me.
2650320	2651760	We need to wing Martindale.
2651760	2653840	Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?
2653840	2655120	Didn't Wing Martindale die?
2655120	2655620	No.
2655620	2657120	Is he still alive?
2657120	2658560	Some famous game show host died.
2658560	2660800	It was the one from Pressure Luck.
2660800	2663200	Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.
2663200	2665000	Whatever his name, Peter DeMarken.
2665000	2666680	He was in a plane wreck or something.
2666680	2668680	Boy, this show's getting morbid.
2668680	2670720	Let's open up the phone, shall we?
2670720	2672880	If you want to give us a call and comment on anything
2672880	2673440	from the show tonight.
2673440	2675120	Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.
2675120	2678120	1-877-GAME-OLR.
2678120	2679600	1-877-GAME-OLR.
2679600	2682360	Or remember, that number is only toll free in the US.
2682360	2683600	What about Lamar Burton?
2683600	2684720	And Levar Burton.
2684720	2685680	Levar Burton, yeah.
2685680	2686520	Levar Burton?
2686520	2687640	I don't know his name.
2687640	2692120	Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.
2692120	2692760	Why him?
2692760	2695280	I've never seen him hosting a show.
2695280	2696600	Reading Rainbow, come on.
2696600	2697920	Not a live show.
2697920	2699360	I mean, of course, Reading Rainbow,
2699360	2700860	but not a live show with an audience.
2700860	2702760	Who said he'd even want to do it?
2702760	2704760	Force him.
2704760	2705680	Why would I do that?
2705680	2707040	He doesn't have a say in this.
2707040	2708160	What?
2708160	2709840	All right, let's go to the phones.
2709840	2711520	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
2711520	2712640	Who's this?
2712640	2713800	Legend of Saku.
2713800	2714600	Hi, Legend of Saku.
2714600	2715360	Chewbacca.
2715360	2717720	He could totally host a show.
2717720	2722360	It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000.
2722360	2724560	I want to play that yodeling game.
2724560	2725880	Yes, I love the yodeling game.
2725880	2726600	The game's fucking right.
2726600	2728680	You know I want to see The Price is Right live a couple years
2728680	2729240	ago.
2729240	2732360	We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there.
2732360	2734480	And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork.
2734480	2736440	I know you have something you want to say, Saku,
2736440	2737800	but I'm going to talk for a minute.
2737800	2738440	Yeah, go ahead.
2738440	2739960	About nothing game related.
2739960	2743200	I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy
2743200	2746360	and gets away with it in public, nonetheless.
2746360	2747840	She wore that fucking swan dress.
2747840	2748720	But here's the thing.
2748720	2752680	When I saw her at Coachella, this is what, 2002 or 2003,
2752680	2754720	I want to say, is when we went.
2754720	2757520	She wore a Venus fly trap outfit.
2757520	2760560	And it was awesome because it was closed for most of it.
2760560	2762640	But then during one of her songs, it opened up,
2762640	2764600	and she was like a Venus fly trap.
2764600	2766000	She's so fucking hardcore.
2766000	2767640	I mean, that was the best weekend ever.
2767640	2771160	It was Bjork in a Venus fly trap outfit, and Price is Right.
2771160	2772440	It was a great weekend.
2772440	2773160	I had a good time.
2773160	2773680	Sorry, Saku.
2773680	2776360	You had something gaming related you want to mention?
2776360	2778680	Just pulling through Digg right now.
2778680	2783880	I see that Sony is about to announce a new PS3 firmware
2783880	2784920	update.
2784920	2786320	A new PS3 firmware update?
2786320	2788200	Wait, this is on Digg right now?
2788200	2788720	Yeah.
2788720	2789680	Right this second?
2789680	2790400	Wait, wait, wait.
2790400	2791160	Don't be fooled.
2791160	2792840	It's an announcement of announcements.
2792840	2795160	So.
2795160	2797040	That's what, yeah, Loki's right.
2797040	2797720	I'm looking.
2797720	2799400	This is from psu.com.
2799400	2801880	Isn't that their official underground site?
2801880	2803280	Oh, I don't know.
2803280	2804640	There's too, you know what?
2804640	2806520	There's too damn many game blogs out there
2806520	2807400	on the internet right now.
2807400	2808640	We need to somehow put a cap.
2808640	2810040	I mean, don't get me wrong.
2810040	2811000	I love the indies.
2811000	2813880	I love the homebrew and stuff, but there's just so many.
2813880	2815680	And like, we have room to talk.
2815680	2818480	But you know, just damn, we need to streamline some of these,
2818480	2820440	because I can't keep track of all of them.
2820440	2822520	I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are
2822520	2826440	basically, they're biased towards either console.
2826440	2830920	You see one, you see Kotaku's more anti-Sony at certain
2830920	2833160	times, and then, I don't know.
2833160	2835000	Joystick is almost the same thing.
2835000	2835920	I mean, actually, no.
2835920	2839080	Joystick is more pro Nintendo, if I recall correctly.
2839080	2841360	Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though,
2841360	2843080	because they tried to screw them over,
2843080	2845840	because Kotaku was saying something legitimate.
2845840	2848320	And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff
2848320	2849640	we don't want you to.
2849640	2851440	You're banned from everything now.
2851440	2853200	Mm-hmm.
2853200	2856240	But that was all the principles.
2856240	2856800	I don't know.
2856800	2858560	Yeah, like a certain other business
2858560	2861440	I'm thinking of in Namco, but we won't go there.
2861440	2862840	Anyhow.
2862840	2863340	Yeah.
2863340	2864480	Whoops.
2864480	2865480	Oh, well.
2865480	2868160	Just adding up that, I don't know, should have been there,
2868160	2871680	but I could see why they left it out initially,
2871680	2875360	probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboy saying,
2875360	2878760	oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.
2878760	2882160	OK, well, fucking A, you started off with a firmware update.
2882160	2884480	Now we're talking about warring cyber blogs.
2884480	2885760	What's up with the new update?
2885760	2888000	What is actually going to be on this?
2888000	2892200	You could access the XMB from the in-game,
2892200	2895000	like how you could access the dashboard on 360 in-game
2895000	2895680	as well.
2895680	2898040	OK.
2898040	2898560	Let me see.
2898560	2903080	They said stuff about in-game music as well,
2903080	2905560	for sleep mode.
2905560	2907120	I mean, I could link you right now,
2907120	2908280	but it's a whole bunch of settings that are up.
2908280	2910880	I tried pulling it up on Digg, but obviously everybody's
2910880	2912160	hammering the sites was broken.
2912160	2915480	But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.
2915480	2918920	What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.
2918920	2921000	There's an equalizer in the music.
2921000	2924480	There's photo settings, PlayStation 2 settings,
2924480	2927040	RSS channel settings is now an option.
2927040	2930720	So now I'll be hopping to OR on your PS3.
2930720	2932800	More slideshow stuff for the photos,
2932800	2935600	more visualization for music.
2935600	2938160	Looks like you can do some other things with video.
2938160	2941880	You can do some zoom ins and stuff.
2941880	2944040	Cross media bar is now accessible during gameplay,
2944040	2945240	like you said.
2945240	2946800	RSS channel is added as a feature.
2946800	2947560	That's pretty cool.
2947560	2949880	That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3
2949880	2950560	pretty soon.
2950560	2952240	You can now have multiple chat sessions,
2952240	2954280	and you can select an image to use as your avatar
2954280	2957120	from the photo.
2957120	2959560	So it sounds like a pretty big update, that's pretty cool.
2959560	2960120	I don't know.
2960120	2962080	It's catching up to 360.
2962080	2965400	I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.
2965400	2966840	It's funny you phrase it that way.
2966840	2969120	It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?
2969120	2970200	It's not even there.
2970200	2976720	It's not at the tip, the leading edge of where 360's at right
2976720	2979000	now.
2979000	2981880	I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.
2981880	2983960	Does that even exist?
2983960	2986580	Like the custom soundtracks, like an Xbox 360?
2986580	2987160	I don't know.
2987160	2987920	I don't own a PS3.
2987920	2988440	Does it?
2988440	2989240	Can you do custom sound?
2989240	2989960	You can't, right?
2989960	2990440	Maybe.
2990440	2991560	I don't think so.
2991560	2992880	Depends on the game.
2992880	2994440	I think it depends on the game.
2994440	2996920	Interesting.
2996920	2999400	Folks in chat are saying no.
2999400	3002840	Yeah, I mean once Sony has a lot of work
3002840	3009040	to do in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.
3009040	3012400	I mean, they have to add rumble, lower the price,
3012400	3016040	get some really good games out because right now not
3016040	3017640	to say that they're the only ones,
3017640	3019920	but the Wii's also in a drought right now.
3019920	3023560	They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.
3023560	3024360	Right, that's true.
3024360	3026440	That's exactly what I said.
3026440	3028560	A price cut would do just that.
3028560	3029200	All right.
3029200	3030040	Anything else, Zaku?
3030040	3031700	We've got to get going to another call.
3031700	3034280	But any other last stuff you want to get in here?
3034280	3035000	That's about it.
3035000	3036540	I'm cutting my throat's kind of sore.
3036540	3039160	I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.
3039160	3039680	All right.
3039680	3040440	See you soon, buddy.
3040440	3042280	Less than a month before I come to New York.
3042280	3042800	All right.
3042800	3043720	All right, later, dude.
3043720	3044680	Bye-bye.
3044680	3047080	I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup
3047080	3050880	because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo
3050880	3053320	World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.
3053320	3055800	Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.
3055800	3057680	Maybe the Dave and Buster's thing,
3057680	3059200	although I don't think everybody can get in there.
3059200	3060000	So I don't know.
3060000	3061320	Maybe pizza?
3061320	3062480	I don't know.
3062480	3063460	I'm up for ideas.
3063460	3065160	Let's start a forum thread or something.
3065160	3066580	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3066580	3067240	Who's this?
3067240	3068160	Hey, what's up, guys?
3068160	3068880	It's the Rob D.
3068880	3071200	Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?
3071200	3071720	Not too much.
3071720	3073720	I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.
3073720	3074560	Ah, of course.
3074560	3075800	How was ASEN?
3075800	3076600	Oh, lots of fun.
3076600	3077680	I had a blast.
3077680	3079080	I watched a lot of anime.
3079080	3081120	I played a lot of games.
3081120	3085640	Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.
3085640	3087280	One guy who was dressed up was Frank West.
3087280	3089000	He was carrying a servbot head.
3089000	3090680	That's awesome.
3090680	3093560	He had his girlfriend, who was also wearing a servbot head.
3093560	3097340	He held her hand the whole time, and she didn't move unless he
3097340	3099080	dragged her.
3099080	3100480	That's great.
3100480	3101920	And two zombies with servbot heads
3101920	3103880	were chasing them the whole way through.
3103880	3104720	That's pretty awesome.
3104720	3105960	I like when people go all out with the game,
3105960	3108400	because you know, I'm not really all about the anime.
3108400	3111080	I mean, obviously, we have a lot of folks here in studio
3111080	3112680	that are really into anime.
3112680	3115680	And I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.
3115680	3117440	So I really like when people bring
3117440	3119160	more of the gaming into the anime cons
3119160	3120400	through the cosplay and stuff.
3120400	3123400	That's always cool.
3123400	3125000	Some interesting things happened, too.
3125000	3126880	I went to a couple of the programming panels,
3126880	3129440	like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness.
3129440	3133120	And at one point, 1,000 people were singing the Segata Sanchiro
3133120	3134800	theme song.
3134800	3136560	Wow.
3136560	3138960	You can get that many nerds in one place?
3138960	3140920	Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell,
3140920	3143840	which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials,
3143840	3145360	bad anime, that sort of thing.
3145360	3147400	Or just like whacking commercials.
3147400	3151120	So they played like a full four minutes Segata Sanchiro theme
3151120	3152960	song with subtitles.
3152960	3155000	So it's kind of an easy core to sing.
3155000	3157520	So everyone started joining in the second, third,
3157520	3159440	and fourth times they played it.
3159440	3160880	Wow, nerds, all of you.
3160880	3163760	Hey, what types of game room setups did they have?
3163760	3166320	Because I notice no anime con is complete without a game room.
3166320	3168720	They had a pretty big game room in the basement floor.
3168720	3170760	They actually had Beat Mania 2DX down there.
3170760	3172160	I didn't get a chance to play it,
3172160	3175480	but it looked like some people were having some fun with that one.
3175480	3178920	Like the real game, like the arcade game, or home port?
3178920	3180440	I think it was a home port.
3180440	3181480	Yeah, it was a home port.
3181480	3183320	That's all right, it's still cool.
3183320	3186120	They had a HDTV set up for just about, I think,
3186120	3188000	every single set up they had around there.
3188000	3190920	A lot of console games, mostly anime-based games or fighting
3190920	3192120	games, that sort of thing.
3192120	3192620	Right.
3192620	3193920	King of Fighters 11.
3193920	3198440	You're not really going to find Navno 8 at an anime con?
3198440	3198940	Exactly.
3198940	3201000	And for the Para Para machine, it was great.
3201000	3203440	There were probably about 15 people
3203440	3207520	behind doing the motions themselves as people
3207520	3208600	were playing the machine.
3208600	3209240	It was great.
3209240	3210360	How many of them were dudes?
3213240	3216200	Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.
3216200	3218080	You know, it's funny because there
3218080	3220880	used to be hella guys in Northern California
3220880	3223160	that were into Para Para.
3223160	3224840	There was teams and everything.
3224840	3228120	And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really
3228120	3229400	do Para Para dancing.
3229400	3231360	And then all those teams just fell apart,
3231360	3233000	like instantly vaporized.
3233000	3235240	It was something else.
3235240	3239600	I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff
3239600	3241960	and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.
3241960	3244520	But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.
3244520	3245100	Exactly.
3245100	3245800	Rock on, Sky.
3245800	3248880	But anyway, there were a lot of tournaments.
3248880	3250680	Tournaments for just about every fighting game,
3250680	3252120	every anime fighting game.
3252120	3254240	There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3,
3254240	3258960	Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.
3258960	3260000	I got killed in that one.
3260000	3261360	Wow.
3261360	3264040	So I entered like five of them, somewhere around there.
3264040	3266080	A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players.
3266080	3267120	But people are still having fun.
3267120	3267920	There weren't too many people that
3267920	3269920	were completely arrogant or cocky, which
3269920	3273440	unfortunately can't happen.
3273440	3276960	I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chat room.
3276960	3277860	Awesome.
3277860	3279640	Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.
3279640	3282280	It was a lot of fun.
3282280	3285880	It's funny, never mind, I won't tell that story.
3285880	3287880	I'll just say that some of my friends
3287880	3289600	actually found a stranger in their hotel room
3289600	3290960	when they woke up the next day.
3290960	3293280	I'll leave it at that.
3293280	3299520	Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.
3299520	3301240	Interesting.
3301240	3302880	All right, well, we'll leave it at that.
3302880	3307080	Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Faname.
3307080	3308680	If you're an anime fan, I got to say
3308680	3309920	it's a great place to go to.
3309920	3312640	If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan,
3312640	3314720	you should probably go to that, because there are
3314720	3316000	a lot of people that know how to play the games,
3316000	3317760	and you'll get a lot of good matches there.
3317760	3318880	All right.
3318880	3321440	If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.
3321440	3324280	I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.
3324280	3325000	Awesome.
3325000	3326200	Well, thanks for the wrap up, and I'm
3326200	3328040	glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.
3328040	3330120	You guys should call in next time with your report,
3330120	3332000	because obviously, Chris had a hard time finding you guys,
3332000	3335000	or her cell phone wasn't working, or something.
3335000	3336040	All right, we'll do.
3336040	3336640	See you guys later.
3336640	3337840	All right, take care, buddy.
3337840	3338840	Thanks for the call.
3338840	3340840	Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons
3340840	3342840	where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?
3342840	3344400	Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?
3344400	3345200	I always do.
3345200	3345680	Really?
3345680	3347360	The first place I go to is the NASA
3347360	3348440	reports because I do cosplay.
3348440	3349120	Really?
3349120	3349640	Yes.
3349640	3349960	All right.
3349960	3351960	It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements
3351960	3354720	on there and stuff.
3354720	3356800	Dude, I'm going to do that at Fonami.
3356800	3358920	Well, no, the big thing is, at least this
3358920	3361400	has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer,
3361400	3362640	especially doing something from something
3362640	3364600	you know other people are going to be doing,
3364600	3367080	you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.
3367080	3369320	Oh, like the pictures that they all do.
3369320	3369820	Exactly.
3369820	3370320	Oh, OK.
3370320	3372120	And there's also other groups meeting,
3372120	3375080	like YaliCon had a bunch of doll fee collectors getting
3375080	3377280	together, and that type of thing.
3377280	3379920	The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards.
3379920	3381000	Or the site forums.
3381000	3383380	So once we find out Rama's room number,
3383380	3385760	we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that
3385760	3388720	says, naked twister at 9 PM in this room.
3388720	3390800	No.
3390800	3393200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3393200	3394200	Raven's dolphin.
3394200	3396880	Hello, Raven's dolphin.
3396880	3399560	What's on your mind, Raven's dolphin?
3399560	3401400	The we in the lake story.
3401400	3403440	The we in the lake story, yes.
3403440	3406640	Well, I know many guys have taken a we in the lake
3406640	3408720	once or twice in their lives, but oh, yes,
3408720	3409960	the Nintendo we in the lake.
3409960	3410960	What's up with that?
3410960	3412800	What do you have to say about that?
3412800	3414160	You know, I agree with the guy.
3414160	3415480	Divorce is imminent.
3415480	3417960	I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water
3417960	3421120	and get my we.
3421120	3423840	Are you single, Raven's dolphin?
3423840	3424320	Yeah.
3424320	3425000	Call it a hunch.
3425000	3426500	How are we going to remain that way?
3426500	3428800	Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.
3428800	3433640	God, I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.
3433640	3436240	That's true.
3436240	3438240	I'm hearing an echo, Raven's dolphin.
3438240	3439160	You need to fix that echo.
3439160	3440820	You've called in this show enough time.
3440820	3442280	Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.
3442280	3444280	Yeah, so is that this guy's problem?
3444280	3445640	Is that maybe he should have just
3445640	3447720	married somebody who understood the game thing a little more
3447720	3448040	in the first place?
3448040	3449320	He should have married a gamer.
3449320	3450680	Yeah, I agree with him.
3450680	3452720	And so is that what you're doing, Raven's dolphin?
3452720	3456440	You're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?
3456440	3456920	I am.
3456920	3460080	I just want her to understand about me and my gaming
3460080	3460600	edition.
3460600	3462040	And she throws the we out.
3462040	3462960	It's over.
3462960	3463880	You know what, though?
3463880	3465720	People do stupid things when they fight.
3465720	3468200	I mean, people smash car windows.
3468200	3471560	They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.
3471560	3473880	I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.
3473880	3477720	And it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not.
3477720	3479600	Because if she knew, like, hey, this
3479600	3481680	is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.
3481680	3484400	You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.
3484400	3486400	You know, that's what she's going to do.
3486400	3487480	So that's true.
3487480	3488880	You just have to marry someone who
3488880	3491000	can keep their temper in check.
3491000	3491760	That's true.
3491760	3492440	You're right.
3492440	3493360	Oh, one more thing?
3493360	3493880	Of course.
3493880	3495760	What's up?
3495760	3497400	This is a little old, but I thought
3497400	3500320	that the Situa Wada thing was hilarious when you went,
3500320	3502760	like, Reggie, you're not selling enough.
3502760	3504360	Damn it, sell more.
3504360	3505560	I'm not following.
3505560	3506440	What was this news?
3506440	3508240	It's been a while.
3508240	3511200	Well, he said it was about the brain age.
3511200	3513280	And he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.
3513280	3515520	And you're up to sell 30,000.
3515520	3518360	Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 brain
3518360	3520840	age or 30,000 versus Europe?
3520840	3524840	And I find it hilarious, like, wow, he's pissed.
3524840	3528240	Well, you know, even though they are these public figure
3528240	3531040	heads that we see, you know, they still have a job to do.
3531040	3533160	And ultimately, you know, when the game
3533160	3535280	doesn't sell the way they expected it,
3535280	3538480	the big, big bosses want to know why and what happened
3538480	3540040	and who's head's got to roll, who's
3540040	3543000	got to get fired because of it.
3543000	3544120	Reggie ain't going to get fired.
3544120	3546440	I know Reggie ain't going to get fired.
3546440	3549120	Reggie's invincible.
3549120	3551360	Reggie is a god among men.
3551360	3554320	Reggie's invincible, but Iwata does have the power
3554320	3557200	if he wanted to, you know, bust some Reggie heads.
3557200	3559320	I mean, if the only, think about it,
3559320	3561680	the only person in the entire world who
3561680	3564280	gets to yell at Reggie, actually there's
3564280	3567740	two people in the world who get to yell at Reggie, his wife
3567740	3569240	and Iwata.
3569240	3569840	That's true.
3569840	3571080	That's it.
3571080	3572320	Sorry for that thing.
3572320	3573040	That's all right.
3573040	3574880	I had the microphone too high.
3574880	3576080	Life goes on.
3576080	3578440	Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks for the call, as always.
3578440	3579080	Of course, bye.
3579080	3581640	Have a good one, buddy.
3581640	3582760	Let's go to another call.
3582760	3584180	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3584180	3585640	Who's this?
3585640	3587360	Hey, it's Aronimo.
3587360	3588520	What's up, everyone?
3588520	3589160	Hey, Jamie.
3589160	3589680	What's up?
3589680	3590320	Hi.
3590320	3593040	Hey, Naked Twister, 9 o'clock, right?
3593040	3596900	OK, before we start, there will be a $5 cover
3596900	3598920	charge for the Drunk Show.
3598920	3602000	Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.
3602000	3604920	If you get in before the Editor Drunk Show,
3604920	3607080	you can still qualify for Naked Twister.
3607080	3609200	There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.
3609200	3610480	That is not happening, Rama.
3610480	3612320	That's a joke, OK?
3612320	3614000	I'm just going to say that right here.
3614000	3618240	There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room, anyway.
3618240	3620600	Oh, like I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.
3623360	3625560	You know what's actually really funny about Fonomé?
3625560	3627200	Did I talk about this on last week's show?
3627200	3628080	I'm not sure if it was on the show,
3628080	3630720	if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.
3630720	3634960	But my boyfriend wants to go to Fonomé,
3634960	3639720	which is funny because, well, not just,
3639720	3641280	Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.
3641280	3642320	That's why it's funny.
3642320	3643680	That has nothing to do with it.
3643680	3647960	No, but the reason why is because he's never really,
3647960	3649360	he watches Fonomé.
3649360	3650480	He's familiar with Fonomé.
3650480	3652440	He probably knows more about it than I do.
3652440	3655320	In fact, he had a Doraemon book in his car, and I'm like,
3655320	3656160	oh, it's Doraemon.
3656160	3658440	He's like, how in the hell did you know who that was?
3658440	3660360	He always jokes that I'm more Asian than he is.
3660360	3661480	Doraemon.
3661480	3662800	Whatever.
3662800	3664840	See, I'm not that Asian, apparently.
3664840	3666720	But anyway, where was I going with this?
3666720	3669840	Oh, yeah, he doesn't really like, he doesn't go to the,
3669840	3672600	he wouldn't have no idea what to expect at the convention.
3672600	3674680	He's like, you mean people dress up?
3674680	3676240	I'm like, yeah, I'm like, you know,
3676240	3677960	big girls like to dress up like Sailor Moon.
3677960	3678800	It's fun.
3678800	3681520	And he says, so I can go as Tuxedo Mask?
3681520	3684160	They mistaken the whole Sailor Moon part
3684160	3687440	as actually not being moon sized, you know.
3687440	3688280	Anyhow, so.
3688280	3689720	I'm dressing up this year.
3689720	3692840	If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show
3692840	3694400	and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's
3694400	3697200	going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?
3697200	3699240	I have to, I have to have my skirt made.
3699240	3700680	What do you, what do you cosplay as?
3700680	3703960	I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.
3703960	3704960	What?
3704960	3705560	That's cute.
3705560	3706120	I like that.
3706120	3708640	I have to get my wig finished, though.
3708640	3710400	Is there a rest of the posse?
3710400	3711160	Is there?
3711160	3712680	No, but Rob, you could cosplay.
3712680	3713760	You could be the hero.
3713760	3714920	I could.
3714920	3715440	Why not?
3715440	3716040	It'll be fun.
3716040	3717360	And then I'll have to whip you.
3717360	3720400	And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.
3720400	3721760	I actually have a full bullet.
3721760	3724520	I'm not dressing up like a goblin.
3724520	3725120	Please do.
3725120	3726480	That would be funny.
3726480	3728800	So does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume
3728800	3729640	this year?
3729640	3731240	No, no black mage costume.
3731240	3732440	I had fun with that, though.
3732440	3735000	Hey, Rama, can I borrow a mage costume?
3735000	3736160	Sure, I'll pack it.
3736160	3737040	Rad.
3737040	3737880	OK.
3737880	3739200	Sorry.
3739200	3741160	Because I have the red hair and all.
3741160	3743280	SSJ100Matt in our chat room suggests
3743280	3745040	that Loki should cosplay as Tingle.
3745040	3746480	I am not dressing up like Tingle.
3746480	3747360	Fuck no.
3747360	3748240	All right, sorry Rama.
3748240	3749920	What the hell would you call in for, anyway?
3749920	3753200	Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.
3753200	3755840	Wait, like the movie, the first one?
3755840	3757800	Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.
3761000	3761520	Really?
3761520	3764080	OK, now spoiler free, please, because Miklotov and I both
3764080	3765040	want to see this, but.
3765040	3768120	Trust, do you have a strong stomach?
3768120	3770240	I want to see it, because I love the undead.
3770240	3771640	I mean, load the undead.
3771640	3775360	Miklotov and I both scream like girls at bad violence,
3775360	3777240	but that's part of the fun in going.
3777240	3778160	You're going to scream.
3778160	3779300	That's all I got to say.
3779300	3779800	Really?
3779800	3782560	Oh, Miklotov's already putting on a pouty face.
3782560	3783920	But it's really good, though.
3783920	3787360	I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw up
3787360	3789080	stuff going on in that movie.
3789080	3790360	And that's true.
3790360	3791760	And I hate that.
3791760	3793040	It's so gross.
3793040	3794440	Rama, you know what you need to see
3794440	3796520	if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?
3796520	3797000	What?
3797000	3798680	Hot Fuzz.
3798680	3799640	That's on my list.
3799640	3801320	Well, maybe we could do it while we're out there.
3801320	3802040	Come on, now.
3802040	3803560	Yeah, that's what I just said.
3803560	3805640	We can go see Hot Fuzz.
3805640	3807600	Sorry, definitely.
3807600	3810400	I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions
3810400	3813480	where like, what more can I buy, and how many more pictures
3813480	3814560	can I be taken of?
3814560	3815920	Let's just go somewhere.
3815920	3818640	Miklotov, let's go see that movie tomorrow
3818640	3819640	when I get back from LA.
3819640	3820720	I'm going to cry.
3820720	3822480	You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow,
3822480	3823200	do you?
3823200	3825440	No, I don't want to do that.
3825440	3827160	Let's go see that movie and you can cry.
3827160	3829680	Miklotov, Miklotov, suck it up.
3829680	3830800	Dude.
3830800	3833000	OK, I don't like zombies.
3833000	3835400	I don't like that these people, even though they're not really
3835400	3836840	zombies because they're not dead,
3836840	3838480	they're people with a virus.
3838480	3842160	But they're like zombies, and they throw up blood,
3842160	3844040	and they run really fast, and it's
3844040	3845440	going to scare the crap out of me.
3845440	3847520	Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Rama,
3847520	3848720	so you understand.
3848720	3852200	Yes, taking Shane to zombie movies,
3852200	3855360	taking X to fur on roller coasters.
3855360	3859440	These are the, oh my god, it's killing me.
3859440	3860760	That was so funny.
3860760	3863080	Anyhow, sorry, these are the little pleasures in life.
3863080	3865640	This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we
3865640	3866720	can go see the movie.
3866720	3868200	Sweet.
3868200	3870920	I'm just going to miss out on playing bus to move at work.
3873600	3876800	You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers,
3876800	3878600	some of them listen to this program, right?
3878600	3879440	Why do I care?
3879440	3880520	All right, just check it.
3880520	3882240	Just want to make sure.
3882240	3885400	They can all suck it.
3885400	3886880	All thousands of listeners.
3886880	3888960	I'm sorry, I'm inflating that number a lot.
3888960	3889720	I meant dozens.
3889720	3891160	All 14 listeners.
3891160	3893520	All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.
3893520	3894120	Yeah.
3894120	3894840	Yeah.
3894840	3896320	Whatever, I don't even care anymore.
3896320	3898960	Rama, tell me something game related.
3898960	3900520	Let's see, a couple of things.
3900520	3903440	In response of last week, I have been listening
3903440	3905840	to this show for about five years.
3905840	3908600	It'll be six years in January.
3908600	3910120	How is that possible when we've only
3910120	3913920	been doing this show five years next month?
3913920	3915760	I remember, or maybe I'm off by you.
3915760	3918680	I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.
3918680	3920720	Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.
3920720	3921200	Yes.
3921200	3921700	OK.
3921700	3923200	See?
3923200	3926160	Yes, the station started in 2000.
3926160	3927880	No, yeah, the station started in 2002.
3927880	3929380	Longest train wreck ever.
3929380	3929880	Forget it.
3929880	3930460	Anyway, sorry.
3930460	3931840	What, Rama?
3931840	3933640	No, Dr. Tetsuya wanted to throw it out,
3933640	3936640	so I accepted his challenge.
3936640	3937720	Look, so, yeah, we start.
3937720	3938480	Thank you, Junami.
3938480	3939800	623 of 02 was the first live show.
3939800	3942000	Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence
3942000	3943680	Junami has.
3943680	3944960	23 is the number of coincidence.
3944960	3946520	Wait, what were you going to say, Rama,
3946520	3948680	about you've been listening to this show for five years,
3948680	3949760	and last week?
3949760	3953840	No, I think it was last week when Dr. Tetsuya called
3953840	3955280	and said about your biggest fans.
3955280	3956720	You said it was me and Misty.
3956720	3958240	I'm just trying to figure out how many years we've
3958240	3959640	been listening.
3959640	3962640	You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR
3962640	3965280	Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show
3965280	3966600	last week.
3966600	3968520	Yeah, because I am sure about it.
3968520	3971440	She missed her, and I totally know.
3971440	3973480	They all love you and miss you a lot, you know?
3973480	3975040	I know, she kind of just disappeared.
3975040	3976920	But I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life
3976920	3978960	and stuff, and she's doing her thing.
3978960	3981320	But that happens, is folks sometimes,
3981320	3983560	they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore.
3983560	3985720	But we hope you'll always remember us,
3985720	3989080	and blah, blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.
3989080	3990840	All right.
3990840	3992840	The Rob D in chat says, Rama is such a fan
3992840	3994960	that he's been listening to you since before you've
3994960	3996160	been on the air.
3996160	3998200	It means he was listening to Under Station.
3998200	4000240	I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it
4000240	4001840	by saying you were listening to Under Station Live.
4001840	4003600	And I think that's how Dr. Tetsuya gets away with it,
4003600	4006040	because I think he was listening to Under Station Live.
4006040	4009240	Dr. Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest
4009240	4010200	appearances.
4010200	4011240	Crazy.
4011240	4012480	And I filled in for people.
4012480	4015040	I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.
4015040	4016440	Crazy times, old school.
4016440	4018040	Anyway, sorry, Rama.
4018040	4019640	Anything else you want to share with us?
4019640	4019920	We're getting all this thought.
4019920	4021360	I want to finish it off by saying,
4021360	4022920	in case you guys haven't heard yet,
4022920	4025320	we have a new video gamer in the world.
4025320	4026480	Oh.
4026480	4028280	You IMed me the other day.
4028280	4029120	Yep.
4029120	4031920	A new video, who's this?
4031920	4034480	My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy
4034480	4035680	last Wednesday.
4035680	4037360	Aw, what's the boy's name?
4037360	4039040	Isn't bouncing unhealthy for babies?
4039040	4042440	Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?
4042440	4042960	Stop.
4042960	4045040	Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller
4045040	4046720	and started playing Street Fighter.
4046720	4047360	That's awesome.
4047360	4049560	On the first or second bounce.
4049560	4050840	First.
4050840	4052000	That's really awesome.
4052000	4054520	You need to talk more on this program.
4054520	4056880	All right, sorry, Rama, what's the kid's name?
4056880	4058800	Gabriel Henley.
4058800	4059920	Gabriel.
4059920	4061400	Why are you laughing?
4061400	4063600	Like Gabriel Knight, right?
4063600	4064760	I believe so.
4064760	4066880	Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?
4066880	4067640	Is that?
4067640	4068160	No.
4068160	4069920	OK, all right.
4069920	4070640	I like that name.
4070640	4072040	Thank you for spoiling, Rob.
4072040	4073000	There's.
4073000	4074080	That's not a spoiler.
4074080	4075480	I didn't spoil a god damn thing.
4075480	4076280	It's not a spoiler.
4076280	4076800	All right.
4076800	4077920	That's just his real name.
4077920	4079840	Like Siler, somebody's going to be named Siler.
4079840	4081680	Maybe if you could like watch the show.
4081680	4083760	I work with somebody named Mileena.
4083760	4085120	Is that Siler?
4085120	4087120	No, but she's named after a video game
4087120	4088360	character from Mortal Kombat.
4088360	4089840	Really, I work with someone named Katana.
4089840	4090600	That's great.
4090600	4091680	No, I lied.
4091680	4093640	All right, Rama, we're going to let you go now,
4093640	4096480	because your phone calls derail our show too much.
4096480	4097880	Hey, it gets the attention.
4097880	4099400	It gets people happy in the chat.
4099400	4100240	I did my job.
4100240	4103240	Bye.
4103240	4104280	One more call.
4104280	4107520	Oop, did I miss this one?
4107520	4108040	Damn it.
4108040	4111240	All right, whoever was trying to call, call again.
4111240	4113560	Somebody from an 805 area code is trying to call in.
4113560	4116040	I don't recognize that number, so try calling back.
4116040	4117160	I won't say the whole number on the air.
4117160	4119480	Call back, because I just barely missed the call.
4119480	4121280	And that phone number's been hammering us for a little bit,
4121280	4122680	so I wanted to get to it.
4122680	4123640	There it is.
4123640	4125020	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4125020	4126760	Who's this?
4126760	4128320	Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.
4128320	4129440	Hey, DJ Tyrant.
4129440	4131240	What's on your mind, buddy?
4131240	4132120	Hey, not much.
4132120	4135040	Just wanted to say off of your rant
4135040	4137960	there about the gold spam in WoW.
4137960	4141560	I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened,
4141560	4146800	not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.
4146800	4150120	What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?
4150120	4152240	They're not going to do anything about it.
4152240	4158600	2.1, they're supposed to change some of the reporting of users
4158600	4160160	and stuff like that.
4160160	4162320	That's not going to do anything, because these are just
4162320	4165600	those people taking advantage of the 10-day free trials.
4165600	4168200	And you can make as many of those as you want.
4168200	4170480	That's all it is.
4170480	4172520	So I don't know what they can do except take away
4172520	4174440	the 10-day free trials.
4174440	4175960	Yeah.
4175960	4178880	Or just have it like, OK, how hard would this be?
4178880	4181760	You can message.
4181760	4182360	How about this?
4182360	4184160	You can message a person, but then you
4184160	4186520	have to wait a minute before you can
4186520	4187680	message a different person.
4187680	4192040	Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.
4192040	4194680	Yeah, throttle it somehow that way
4194680	4198120	so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.
4198120	4199960	I don't know.
4199960	4201000	Hopefully they'll do that.
4201000	4203120	And have you seen Blizzard's updates?
4203120	4205400	They're announcing their new progress
4205400	4208320	on Friday or Saturday, I believe.
4208320	4210000	It was the 19th, right?
4210000	4212720	Yeah, I remember the news story about the fact
4212720	4215080	that there's going to be an announcement on the 19th.
4215080	4217520	But now, yeah, Blizzard, I did remember catching that.
4217520	4218960	Blizzard has updated their website
4218960	4220240	with their little timeline.
4220240	4225080	Like, first we brought you Warcraft I,
4225080	4229520	then Warcraft II and Diablo, and now who knows what's next?
4229520	4232040	So it's kind of interesting.
4232040	4233880	Speaking of WoW, is it OK if I promote
4233880	4236720	some of my other little projects I have on the side?
4236720	4238600	I suppose.
4238600	4239800	OK.
4239800	4242520	Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website,
4242520	4246080	WoW.stratics.com, and we are having a developer chat
4246080	4248360	on Tuesday.
4248360	4252920	So submit your questions through the IRC channel there.
4252920	4254920	It's WoW.stratics.com.
4254920	4256840	And it's been announced on the WoW web page,
4256840	4259360	so check it out if you're interested in asking
4259360	4262280	the developers about the game or whatever.
4262280	4263120	Awesome.
4263120	4266200	And trying to make BlizzCon happen.
4266200	4267740	I got to watch the moneys, but I want
4267740	4269440	to go to BlizzCon really bad.
4269440	4271280	Yeah, it'll be fun.
4271280	4274280	WoW was a blast, and we'll probably
4274280	4278040	see whatever they're going to announce this week there.
4278040	4278880	We'll see.
4278880	4279640	All right, buddy.
4279640	4282080	We've got to let you go, but have a great one, OK?
4282080	4282720	Thanks a lot.
4282720	4283840	No problem.
4283840	4285600	Bye-bye.
4285600	4287480	Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyran.
4287480	4290320	Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU,
4290320	4292360	which airs Thursday nights on this very network,
4292360	4294240	but not for the next couple of weeks.
4294240	4295440	They're taking a little bit of a break
4295440	4296640	because we all need a break once in a while,
4296640	4299120	but they'll be back pretty soon with more episodes.
4299120	4300580	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4300580	4301920	Who's this?
4301920	4305160	This is your mother, Rob.
4305160	4306840	Hi, Mom.
4306840	4309680	I didn't know you were listening to the program.
4309680	4311640	What's on your mind?
4311640	4314520	You didn't call me for Mother's Day.
4314520	4316040	You're a terrible son.
4316040	4317600	I wish I never had you.
4317600	4320600	Well, I don't know if Alzheimer's
4320600	4322040	said in early or something, but you
4322040	4326160	might recall I actually took you out to lunch yesterday.
4326160	4327560	That was yesterday.
4327560	4330600	It's Mother's Day today.
4330600	4332800	God, I'll tell you this right now
4332800	4334640	in front of all your listeners.
4334640	4337640	You were adopted.
4337640	4338880	What?
4338880	4339880	I was adopted?
4339880	4342600	You were adopted.
4342600	4346720	You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?
4346720	4348640	Yes.
4348640	4352240	Who's my real mother?
4352240	4355760	Well, I don't know because I traded you
4355760	4360400	with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes
4360400	4363400	and a bottle of vodka.
4363400	4366720	Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.
4366720	4369760	What's wrong with you?
4369760	4372680	I used to.
4372680	4374800	Did you smoke while you were pregnant?
4374800	4375320	I hope not.
4375320	4375960	Wait, no.
4375960	4376520	Never mind.
4376520	4378440	I was adopted.
4378440	4380160	Did they smoke while I was pregnant?
4380160	4382840	Yeah, but you didn't pay enough attention in school.
4382840	4384720	That's why you're my least favorite son.
4387840	4389760	I don't really know what else to say, Mom.
4389760	4391920	You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners,
4391920	4393280	and I'm crying.
4393280	4395320	By the way, what video games have you
4395320	4398120	been playing this week, Mom?
4398120	4403080	Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me,
4403080	4408440	but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.
4408440	4410960	The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.
4413880	4415720	Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
4415720	4421200	Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360.
4421200	4421760	What is that?
4421760	4424360	One of those things that chinks like a disk
4424360	4426800	because it's 360 degrees?
4426800	4427680	Something like that.
4427680	4429760	I'll have to explain it to you later.
4429760	4434600	Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.
4434600	4437040	I begrudgingly love you, Rob.
4437040	4441480	I love you, too, prank caller impersonating my mother.
4441480	4443480	All right.
4443480	4446760	What the fuck are our listeners smoking?
4446760	4448920	Cocaine, Rob.
4448920	4450380	And of course, now the chat room is
4450380	4452880	ringing up Cooking Mama because there was the Wii there.
4455520	4458000	I really don't know how to respond to that.
4458000	4461600	You should respond by hanging up quicker.
4461600	4462560	I guess so.
4465360	4465840	All right.
4465840	4468080	Anyway, that's definitely going to do it
4468080	4469160	for the Skype line tonight.
4469160	4470280	Congratulations, everybody.
4470280	4472120	That call ruined it for the rest of you.
4472120	4474280	We're going to go around and wrap up the show now
4474280	4477880	by first off asking if there's any last minute stories here
4477880	4479000	in the room.
4479000	4480720	Any last minute stories?
4480720	4481960	I have a last minute story.
4481960	4483240	Rob, your mom's cool.
4483240	4484040	What's that?
4484040	4486520	I have two last minute stories.
4486520	4491280	First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally.
4491280	4493360	After five months of being broken, that's a story.
4493360	4494320	What took so long?
4494320	4495500	Laziness.
4495500	4499120	And I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.
4499120	4502000	I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes
4502000	4503760	out, I can play it.
4503760	4506520	And then my last minute story is my Magikarp
4506520	4508960	evolved into a Gyarados.
4508960	4509800	Congratulations.
4509800	4510320	Thank you.
4510320	4513600	You know, this is completely inappropriate.
4513600	4515640	But I feel like after that phone call,
4515640	4518360	I have no choice but to do this.
4518360	4520360	So we'll just give it a moment here.
4520360	4521120	Oh, god.
4521120	4527000	Hello?
4527000	4527560	Hey, Dad.
4527560	4529080	It's Rob.
4529080	4529600	Yeah.
4529600	4531160	Hey, how you doing?
4531160	4532240	Good, how are you doing?
4532240	4532880	Where you at?
4532880	4533380	Good.
4533380	4535800	I'm doing a radio program on the internet right now.
4535800	4538960	You know the one that embarrasses you that I do?
4538960	4540540	Yeah, I am.
4540540	4541240	Yeah.
4541240	4542680	All right.
4542680	4544680	Is mom around?
4544680	4545200	Yeah.
4545200	4546960	Can you put her on real quick?
4546960	4547840	Just a second.
4547840	4550480	All right.
4550480	4551720	Live radio, boys and girls.
4551720	4552920	Have I mentioned that before?
4556400	4557840	Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
4557840	4560800	Live radio while we wait.
4560800	4562600	I'll play some music.
4562600	4564760	I don't know what's going on.
4564760	4565360	Hello?
4565360	4567000	Hello, Mom?
4567000	4567600	Yes.
4567600	4569240	Hi, how are you?
4569240	4570480	Hello?
4570480	4571360	Hi.
4571360	4572560	Can you hear me?
4572560	4573120	Yeah.
4573120	4574040	All right.
4574040	4577440	Yeah, I'm live on the radio doing the internet program.
4577440	4579560	And Jamie and Matt are here too.
4579560	4580120	OK.
4580120	4580640	Hi.
4580640	4583260	And I was calling first off to say Happy Mother's Day
4583260	4584520	officially.
4584520	4585160	Thank you.
4585160	4588760	But we had a caller just call in and impersonate you
4588760	4591000	and said a lot of really mean things to me,
4591000	4592920	like they were impersonating being my mom
4592920	4594360	and really criticizing me.
4594360	4596280	So I just called.
4596280	4597720	Why were they impersonating me?
4597720	4598640	They don't know me.
4598640	4601020	I know, because some people are really mean on the internet,
4601020	4601520	Mom.
4601520	4603400	I don't know.
4603400	4606720	But they were calling and saying that I know people are rude.
4606720	4610040	I shouldn't take those things so seriously, huh?
4610040	4611560	What did they say?
4611560	4612600	What were they saying?
4612600	4613720	They were saying that, oh.
4613720	4615800	That you were trading for vodka and cigarettes.
4615800	4618440	Yes, that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.
4618440	4621040	Is that true?
4621040	4622000	No.
4622000	4624240	And I wasn't adopted?
4624240	4625200	No.
4625200	4627660	OK, just making sure.
4627660	4630040	My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.
4630040	4632320	Well, hey, Mom, I want to ask you.
4632320	4635080	You know, when I was growing up, what did you think?
4635080	4638240	I played a lot of video games when I was growing up, huh?
4638240	4639000	Tons.
4639000	4640800	Tons.
4640800	4644800	Why did you let me play so many video games?
4644800	4648520	Because I was an idiot.
4648520	4652760	Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this,
4652760	4654960	where I would have a radio program on the internet
4654960	4658640	with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years
4658640	4660360	talking about games?
4660360	4662560	Not in my weirdest dreams.
4662560	4663600	I know, it's kind of weird.
4663600	4666480	How come you never played video games with me?
4666480	4668960	I don't like games.
4668960	4669480	Why not?
4669480	4672440	What did the games do to you?
4672440	4675320	I don't know, they're boring.
4675320	4676200	So they're boring?
4676200	4677800	I used to play card games with you.
4677800	4681560	Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.
4681560	4686520	Well, video games are too fast paced or something.
4686520	4688560	There's something.
4688560	4690480	I don't have the coordination.
4690480	4692400	Well, you know, but if you played them more often,
4692400	4694480	you could build up the coordination.
4694480	4696400	Maybe, but why would I want to do that?
4696400	4697040	All right.
4697040	4699640	Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangelandradio.com,
4699640	4701600	they're really liking you, Mom.
4701600	4704160	JV Monn says she is awesome.
4704160	4706880	DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.
4706880	4710800	The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.
4710800	4711680	Oh, really?
4711680	4712460	Yeah.
4712460	4713340	So you're popular.
4713340	4715600	You should come on the show sometime.
4715600	4718720	I have been on it before, remember?
4718720	4720240	When I told the whole world about you
4720240	4722600	wearing the pink bunny suit?
4722600	4725360	Actually, that was a different show
4725360	4727000	that I did before Orange Lounge Radio.
4727000	4728880	But thanks so much for resharing that story.
4728880	4732120	I appreciate it.
4732120	4734000	All right, so well, that's it.
4734000	4737800	I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not
4737800	4738560	really my mother.
4738560	4741400	You really had a mother, and you didn't hatch out of an egg.
4741400	4743520	Exactly, exactly.
4743520	4747040	We have other theories about how Rob came to be.
4747040	4749800	Well, when he was four years old,
4749800	4752480	he was like a little old man.
4752480	4754600	And then when he got to high school,
4754600	4756600	he reverted back to childhood.
4756600	4758600	What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when
4758600	4760080	I was four years old?
4760080	4760640	You were.
4760640	4762160	You were like a little old man.
4762160	4765320	You used to order everybody around.
4765320	4766920	You were like the boss.
4766920	4769360	I still do that.
4769360	4773560	You were the boss of me when you were four.
4773560	4776640	Did video games make me that way?
4776640	4782920	You were just really, you know, you were in an adult world.
4782920	4785400	You didn't have a lot of other children around.
4785400	4787920	Let's not get into the family drama here on the internet,
4787920	4791400	where lots of people are listening.
4791400	4794160	So you kind of were old for your age.
4794160	4795560	How do I say it?
4795560	4797840	And then when you got into high school, it was like,
4797840	4799040	what did I miss?
4799040	4802640	And then so you started being a child,
4802640	4806920	dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.
4806920	4810280	You do know this is a radio program about video games,
4810280	4810800	right?
4810800	4812520	And to clarify for the listeners,
4812520	4815040	that was the lip sync contest I entered once.
4815040	4819080	I'm so glad we have a new story to talk about now.
4819080	4820080	I already knew that one.
4820080	4821240	No, that's a new one.
4821240	4822480	Yeah, and the lips excited.
4822480	4823760	And everyone can forget about the story
4823760	4825840	my mom talked about me being a smart ass.
4825840	4832800	Look, suddenly Irene has appeared out of nowhere.
4832800	4835840	I heard lip syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you.
4835840	4837520	So I have to open it on this.
4837520	4838560	Jesus.
4838560	4842320	When I was in high school, we participated
4842320	4844080	in this lip sync contest.
4844080	4845960	And it was me and my two friends.
4845960	4848080	And we did Hole by Violet.
4848080	4850200	You know, go on, take everything.
4850200	4852000	And I dressed up like Courtney Love.
4852000	4854480	And my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.
4854480	4857000	And my other friend dressed up like Drag Queen.
4857000	4859920	And we all went out there and sang this song.
4859920	4863600	And we came in last place because my school
4863600	4866880	was dominated by Mormons and other religious
4866880	4867560	fundamentalists.
4867560	4868920	And they just didn't get it.
4868920	4869600	But we had fun.
4869600	4871400	Maybe you were just terrible at it.
4871400	4874200	And I smoked a cigarette on stage, and my wig fell off.
4874200	4875480	It was awesome.
4875480	4876360	That's the best part.
4876360	4877480	Did you film this at all?
4877480	4878480	Did anyone have to do?
4878480	4880040	I think it was on public access.
4880040	4881520	I need to see this.
4881520	4883880	But I really actually need to go, so bye.
4883880	4884800	All right, bye.
4884800	4885840	Anyway, sorry, mom.
4885840	4887240	Thanks, mom, for bringing that up.
4887240	4888040	I appreciate that.
4888040	4889880	Oh, OK.
4889880	4892160	What about all the good things I did?
4892160	4894640	Would you be one thing?
4894640	4897800	Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.
4897800	4899800	Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio
4899800	4903840	was in the newspaper and on the local news?
4903840	4904480	Uh-huh.
4904480	4905560	Good.
4905560	4906640	Very.
4906640	4910120	She sounds so convinced.
4910120	4912120	All right, mom, I appreciate you calling.
4912120	4914480	I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really
4914480	4916080	like, so there you go.
4916080	4921240	Well, she's like a female rob.
4921240	4923520	So a rob.
4923520	4925120	Shut up, Shane.
4925120	4927240	All right, mom, thanks so much for playing along.
4927240	4928240	I appreciate it.
4928240	4930520	You always know on Mother's Day or something
4930520	4933120	to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.
4933120	4934400	I love you.
4934400	4936720	I was waiting for you to call, actually.
4936720	4938000	I love you.
4938000	4939520	And so do all the chatters.
4939520	4940120	All right.
4940120	4940800	All right, take care.
4940800	4941600	Happy Mother's Day.
4941600	4942120	Bye.
4942120	4942880	Bye, friends.
4942880	4944360	Bye.
4944360	4947000	Did she say, bye, friend?
4947000	4947760	I think she did.
4947760	4949440	I think she's like, bye, friend.
4949440	4950560	She said, friends.
4950560	4951640	Oh, bye, friends.
4951640	4952360	Yeah.
4952360	4953480	That had nothing to do with you.
4953480	4953680	I like your mom.
4953680	4953920	I know.
4953920	4954560	She's funny.
4954560	4956120	I've met your mom in person.
4956120	4957960	I like your mom, too, because of the whole.
4957960	4959720	Why don't we call my mom next week?
4959720	4961120	Well, we just might have to.
4961120	4963280	Or maybe, you know, who knows, it
4963280	4964760	might be her birthday or something.
4964760	4966160	My mom's birthday's in November.
4966160	4967400	Oh, it's a ways off.
4967400	4968000	We'll see.
4968000	4968760	Anyway, sorry.
4968760	4973640	My mom's going to be 49, no, 48.
4973640	4976000	My mom's going to be 49.
4976000	4976960	I keep forgetting.
4976960	4978520	This is actually part of the podcast,
4978520	4981320	so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?
4981320	4983520	However, I would like to see, I do have a request.
4983520	4986600	Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviews rejected
4986600	4989600	last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss
4989600	4990400	or whatever it was.
4990400	4992440	Like, iTunes was rejecting the word piss.
4992440	4995000	Maybe you guys want to say, this show
4995000	4998280	is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.
4998280	4998840	I don't know.
4998840	4999720	That would be great.
4999720	5000480	My mom would like that.
5000480	5001200	I could show it to her.
5001200	5002200	And she'd be like, what?
5002200	5003280	I don't get it.
5003280	5004320	So there you go.
5004320	5004840	All right.
5004840	5006200	Anyhow, we got to wrap it up.
5006200	5007560	Any last minute stories for real?
5010600	5011560	No.
5011560	5013560	All right, nothing for you, Logie?
5013560	5015120	I'm surprised.
5015120	5016640	He's distracted by the interwebs.
5016640	5017120	I know.
5017120	5019280	What are you doing on the internet?
5019280	5020320	Stuff.
5020320	5021200	All right.
5021200	5023840	Crisis Corps coming out in Japan September 13.
5023840	5024360	There you go.
5024360	5025160	There you go.
5025160	5027120	All right, well, then let's go around and get
5027120	5028400	everybody's final thoughts.
5028400	5030400	Shane, thank you for being on the show,
5030400	5031520	even though you never say anything.
5031520	5034320	But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.
5034320	5035440	It's always funny.
5035440	5037160	All right, so your final thought, Shane?
5040440	5042000	I don't know.
5042000	5042800	All right, thanks.
5042800	5043720	Thanks for sharing.
5043720	5047280	All right, Logie, your final thought?
5047280	5051640	Stupid postage is going up to $0.41 tomorrow.
5051640	5054760	My final thought is zombie movie, Shane.
5054760	5056240	We're going to be fun.
5056240	5057600	DarkSakura, your final thought?
5060600	5065720	I have ice cream at home that's low sugar, and I can eat it.
5065720	5068600	I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday
5068600	5071440	because I was having a bad day, and I didn't eat that.
5071440	5072560	But it was really good.
5072560	5074640	So don't point at my fat.
5074640	5075600	All right.
5075600	5077280	I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run
5077280	5078320	when it's in the theater.
5078320	5079120	All right.
