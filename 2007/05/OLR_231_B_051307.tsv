15461	19085	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19690	20251	Thanks for watching!
38112	40994	So let's get right back into some video game news.
41214	42255	Loki, take it away.
68132	70274	That, you know, that's not surprising.
71575	76439	Especially since, you know, Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think, and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.
76600	83966	Here's the problem I would have with the Zune marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present, I don't know a single person with a Zune.
84807	86849	I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.
86869	87749	Well, here's the thing, though.
88170	91012	Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to, like, the Zune.
91032	95056	They just limit it to, you know, just not just the Zune, but, like,
95410	96190	Microsoft products.
96610	105073	Microsoft, either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your... I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.
105433	106933	I want to say I read something about this.
106953	113995	I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee...
114560	128669	I think something like, in the story it says something like if you pay a type of subscription fee and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have, but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.
128789	129910	Like Napster, it's like Napster.
130030	134753	I love this, they're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months.
134953	136934	Because, you know, there's a price break after three months.
137134	137875	Wait, no, there isn't.
138115	139195	There's not a price break at all.
139215	140016	Yeah.
141169	143170	But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.
143350	150854	It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever per thing, or do, like, a subscription.
150874	151594	The Napster model.
151774	152035	Yeah.
152835	153935	They should do a virtual console.
154476	154876	Interesting.
155896	156237	I don't know.
156777	161659	I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.
162820	163360	But they're trying.
163640	164641	They've made a lot of improvements.
164661	167402	Can you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?
169963	170324	I don't know.
170344	170824	Would that work?
171408	172749	Well, it might be a good competition for Netflix.
172769	176350	Well, actually, that's funny that you mention Netflix.
176530	182733	I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft Marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.
183553	184033	Interesting.
184533	188535	That you're going to be able to download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.
188895	200040	Well, I heard a rumor that my cousin's sister's friend's uncle's person who works for Microsoft said that he sucked.
203991	212214	All right, anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live Marketplace as well.
212754	215735	I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.
216276	218316	Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?
218636	219097	Oh, yes, I have.
219117	220597	It is fucking disturbing.
220677	222838	I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted.
223978	225138	Happy Tree Friends False Alarm
250479	251160	with Death Lovely
271997	273278	Vintage Collection for the Xbox 360 that
301412	304856	among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.
304976	311944	So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Ages for the PlayStation 2?
313225	321274	And not to mention also that they later found out that it, or it's confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.
321794	323216	Goddamn internet liars!
324572	330314	What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Ages compilation, like the Sega Ages 2900.
330354	332075	Because, you know, I've got a few of those games.
333215	334896	How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?
335356	338517	I wouldn't mind something like that, if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.
338537	342078	Then, yeah, something like what you said there, where you could just have all of them on one disc.
342678	345479	Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.
345579	346120	Well, a lot.
346300	347600	And I want Planet Harrier.
348040	348760	A good chunk of them.
349241	350041	Planet Harrier.
350481	353082	And they could just release the game, and they could call it this.
353874	355515	Remember when Sega was good?
356716	358297	And that's what they could call the game.
358637	359998	And it would sell millions of copies.
360018	362159	Because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.
362599	363220	Sega ages.
363620	364000	There you go.
365321	366342	That's the selling point right there.
366362	367482	Remember when Sega was good?
369644	369984	Yes.
370584	373266	But I do remember when Crackdown was good.
373606	374406	And it was good today.
375007	376928	And that's because I had the new download pack.
377488	378169	And it's awesome.
378709	383512	But there were some complications as there normally is with a lot of these download packs.
384130	387731	Where it was resetting some of the game's progress.
388311	394872	And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.
394912	397152	You might find out that your save game's gone.
397513	398013	Whoopsie.
398573	400953	But they're working on a fix for it right now.
401373	406814	However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.
406894	407474	It's real quick.
407815	410295	All you have to do is get the brand new update.
410851	411732	Which will be coming out.
411832	413993	And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crash.
414053	415954	It's the update to the game.
416895	420297	Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.
420317	423378	And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.
423578	425680	And just reboot it, and you're good to go.
426020	429342	So, I recommend doing that.
429422	431883	Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.
432444	434965	But the download content is fucking awesome.
435485	436386	Free or paid.
437466	438347	Either way, you've got to get it.
439051	442552	I don't think I have ever played Crackdown Co-op, so I should be okay, right?
443112	444072	You should be fine.
444212	448073	But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.
448153	449453	And then go back into it and you can play it again.
451033	459114	And I played a co-op on the Keys to the City mode, actually the land, so that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.
459655	461795	So that you're probably safe on.
461855	468376	But just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.
468871	481763	But what they really, really, really need to release now is like an instant replay saver or something like that where you can create your own movies because with all this extra crap that they threw in there, there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.
483044	483424	All right.
484045	488248	Ross Steele, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemonster.com says, Crackdown Co-op is overrated.
488609	490170	You don't even have to really play together.
490190	491671	What do you think?
491691	492252	What do you say to that?
493075	493836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
513274	513754	BOMBERMAN ACT 0
537284	538104	DeathJunior, BrookTown, and...
563308	564929	Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo
590089	592370	I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.
592550	595132	Was that after Bomberman 94?
596872	598193	On a turbo?
598473	599054	I do believe so.
599094	603696	Bomberman 94 was really good, but it was still, I think, the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.
605257	608558	With the multi-tap.
608919	612440	So just take that and make it online playable.
612560	612841	The end.
614301	616883	No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?
617303	619624	Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.
621308	624990	However, and you know, it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.
625691	627011	God, I hate ads!
627952	631074	Stop putting Flash ads on your site, you stupid buttheads.
631214	632375	Well, they gotta make money somehow.
633536	634076	Delete.
635197	636017	Crapheads.
636378	637598	Anyway.
638539	647185	In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.
649119	654801	And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.
655241	656141	At least that's what I've heard.
656521	659982	But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.
660923	666905	You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.
666925	669846	Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?
670286	670466	Yes.
670946	671726	Well, there you go.
672666	674587	No point in me downloading this because I don't have that.
674912	677052	I don't know, I'll give it a try, because I've been interested in it.
677453	679713	I played the Xbox 360 demo.
680053	682814	But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.
683454	685394	So, let's hope.
686315	688195	Yes.
688875	693076	And unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June, Spore.
693276	696657	Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.
697410	723583	apparently the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA and of course their fiscal year ends March 31st 2008 so gotta wait more for this game but you know what though I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up
724210	726872	Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.
727232	728793	It didn't look like that much more to go.
728813	729953	It looked pretty cool to me.
729973	740459	The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.
741600	748344	And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.
751008	751709	DarkSakura, start us off.
775536	783698	A few of the wheat goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which, for anyone who's on into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.
784758	790140	It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it pops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.
792960	793320	Loki.
794541	801382	Uh, I'm pissed off at... I don't know, at the fact that Grantha thought a four's not out yet.
802103	803343	That makes me sad, but...
805557	826781	My FU of the week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft I hope you all die in a fire Like I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it and it hasn't been doing a damn thing Spammers are still getting through with all their tells I hope they all die a lot I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs Miklatov, anything you have for FU of the week?
828422	834863	I was going to FU to drama but I'm actually just going to say no I have nothing
836371	838732	So you're saying FU without saying FU?
839932	841453	Kind of, but not so much.
841493	844053	I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.
844234	844594	All right.
845914	847074	Very cryptic there.
848735	851596	That was a short FU of the week segment.
852196	853697	I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight.
853737	854977	Everybody seems to be pretty happy.
856465	860508	Alright, well, this is some interesting news here.
861449	870155	And I should clarify this, is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story, so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.
870796	877621	There was a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.
878802	879983	So in other words, you know, and then
880686	888388	Then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, you know, well, the Elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
888688	895630	But to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data, and not even the newest data.
896150	897450	So, there you have it.
897710	904392	But of course, this is just going to say, you know, about, this is a whole price war that's going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
905072	905992	So, there you go.
907073	907433	That's it.
907793	908293	That's all I got.
911516	913276	Question things that you read on the internet.
913897	915737	I question everything that I read on the internet.
916017	918098	And I question what the intelligence of this is.
918998	923299	They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360.
923719	925639	Which, first of all, it looks stupid.
926399	928580	I hate the color yellow so damn much.
929160	935622	And by the way, if I wanted Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.
936682	936962	Why?
936982	937042	Why?
937327	938707	I don't know, I thought it looked kind of neat.
938887	940708	I mean, nobody else has one.
940928	953450	Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah, to tie in with the Simpsons movie released on July 27th.
953630	957991	Yeah, whatever.
958451	959412	But you're a collector.
959492	960592	Don't you want one of these anyway?
960612	962252	I collect things that don't suck ass.
964073	964473	Fine.
965593	966333	See if I care.
967818	969899	If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.
970779	976200	Well, this, of course, is all tied into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.
976980	979501	And the game looks fucking awesome.
979561	981301	It's on pretty much every platform.
982362	986102	Of course, all the next-gen platforms or current-gen, however you want to call them.
986202	990964	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2, and PSP.
991764	994564	And it's just pretty awesome.
994744	997025	It's basically the storyline revolves around them
997660	998521	Thanks for watching!
1017901	1021423	Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?
1021803	1024585	It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.
1024625	1027586	They're like episodes, basically, so there's 16 levels in the game.
1028047	1034150	There were some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.
1034770	1043915	For example, there were posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island, stuff like that.
1043935	1046317	That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.
1047065	1047806	It'll be neat.
1047966	1049166	I think it's going to be pretty awesome.
1049827	1050748	Also, two-player co-op.
1052228	1053689	That's going to go over live?
1055811	1062675	I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system, but I think you might be able to do it over live as well.
1062736	1068680	GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead, but that's made by Activision.
1070301	1071081	Medal of Homer.
1072702	1074724	Might get me to play one of those war games finally, though.
1074784	1075084	Medal of Homer.
1075104	1075384	Medal of Homer.
1076114	1103572	of course the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial you might remember back in the day when it was first out like those shirts that said eat my shorts that were banned from school and stuff well of course always a source of controversy is the game ratings system and the ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings and 85% use them regularly when buying games
1104413	1108216	That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.
1108777	1110498	So kind of interesting there.
1111459	1111899	There you go.
1111999	1118064	I mean, but of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game's safe for me.
1118104	1119585	And the parent just kind of listens to that.
1120045	1120585	So I don't know.
1120706	1124649	Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.
1124989	1126290	90% of parents know about the system.
1127531	1130933	The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.
1131454	1131734	I don't know.
1132981	1137124	Well, there's one thing, though, between, you know, knowing about it and understanding how it's used.
1137304	1137584	True.
1138625	1141607	But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.
1143289	1156779	And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.
1157720	1159581	And that means that, you know,
1160123	1163125	Somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.
1164747	1165888	Was that you, Miklatov?
1165908	1166548	Did you do that?
1166929	1172173	Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?
1174595	1175916	Yes, because I live in Europe.
1179959	1182781	I just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.
1182841	1183422	It's healthy.
1183462	1188586	Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say, and that time was one of them.
1188976	1190257	Go back to playing with Hellmonkey.
1190577	1191218	Hellmonkey.
1192198	1192519	Alright.
1194640	1199884	I was going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1200244	1205048	They have a list of features that it's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.
1205568	1208791	Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.
1209831	1212353	You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.
1212854	1215215	Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.
1216116	1216957	And it looks pretty awesome.
1217437	1217537	So.
1218220	1222483	Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.
1222824	1228007	And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already friggin' even talked about already.
1228027	1231570	30 days after the date, when it comes out, and I don't know.
1232211	1232571	Interesting.
1233071	1233712	Well, hooray!
1233752	1236114	You can rate me with microtransactions and Bomberman.
1236154	1236894	I'm so excited.
1237535	1238155	Awesome!
1238836	1242378	Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.
1243159	1247042	There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that
1247950	1252152	You know, Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.
1253813	1255875	And, uh, I don't know.
1255895	1262078	This is coming from a, uh, forum post to, uh, this website, Eacoustics.
1263239	1268602	And, um, it's, I guess, uh, 2chan in, uh, Japan.
1269282	1269602	I don't know.
1270363	1270443	Um...
1271684	1275467	Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?
1275928	1277269	Yes, but here's the thing, though.
1277369	1283374	They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.
1283394	1289038	They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.
1289359	1294082	They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.
1294623	1300648	Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so...
1301277	1302298	Not gonna happen yet.
1303198	1307882	And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.
1308122	1313346	Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war, because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player.
1313366	1314267	That's gonna make me sad.
1314887	1317309	It's just like Betamax before, people bought Betamax.
1318230	1320211	It must run in my family, my parents had a Betamax.
1320251	1320792	Laser discs?
1321472	1322893	That I didn't have, but she had it.
1323994	1325275	I still have them, I still watch them.
1325902	1329965	You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.
1330025	1330766	That's right.
1331306	1333347	That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.
1333868	1337611	You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point.
1337651	1338931	I believe it's been confirmed since then.
1338951	1344055	But when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it.
1344075	1345476	I've got to buy an HD DVD player.
1345796	1347378	I want one for the exact same reason.
1347458	1348598	I don't care about anything else.
1348699	1353262	I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.
1353542	1357863	and AnswerRawSteelUT in chat who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.
1358123	1358663	There you go.
1358743	1359483	Heroes.
1360163	1361084	HD DVD won the war.
1361284	1362764	I had to have Heroes in HD.
1363144	1365445	Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.
1366725	1367645	What am I going to do all summer?
1367665	1368505	It's awesome.
1368525	1369285	Watch Battlestar?
1369525	1372626	Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.
1373406	1374106	It did for me.
1374607	1375427	But that's one person.
1375487	1376507	It might come out on Blu-ray later.
1376789	1382013	Well, Laserdisc didn't win the war either, so... Well, fuck you, Advent... Fuck you!
1382453	1383714	Advent Children's coming out.
1383754	1386076	The Director's Cut's coming out on Blu-ray only.
1386456	1389218	So... Advent Children?
1389879	1391980	Okay, I care because... It's fucking awesome.
1392000	1393682	Little Spirits Within Me coming out too.
1393742	1394362	Whoopee!
1394522	1395503	No, I don't care about that.
1395523	1397425	Laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market.
1398285	1399146	So it didn't necessarily die.
1399166	1399606	Of nerds.
1400007	1401768	No, and they're actually still releasing Laserdiscs.
1402388	1402648	Really?
1403249	1403429	Yeah.
1404050	1404550	Two companies are.
1404721	1411726	You know how they had, like, that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this, Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars?
1412146	1416889	Can you imagine what would happen, the kind of damage you could do with a laser disc if you threw it at somebody?
1417429	1417750	Yeah.
1418230	1420591	But dead platforms still get support all the time.
1420631	1424814	Like, one of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.
1425074	1426215	5200, I think.
1426315	1427156	Or is it 5200?
1427196	1427576	Yeah.
1427916	1428877	Whatever.
1428977	1431679	Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.
1431959	1433240	Well, I have some happy news.
1433360	1433620	All right.
1434653	1438854	For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.
1439474	1453719	And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days, was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.
1453959	1458940	And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.
1459000	1459340	And so it
1461502	1466664	I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.
1468124	1469064	Fangirlgasm.
1469905	1471505	Not necessarily, I just think it's good quality work.
1471525	1471865	A little bit.
1471885	1476466	The only disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.
1477407	1477667	True.
1478307	1479027	That was disappointing.
1480188	1484969	Hell, they should just do some original animation, you know, just release some actual stuff.
1486328	1495572	Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies and the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.
1496633	1498414	Video game purists will probably hate it.
1499214	1508078	The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel.
1508738	1508978	Hell no!
1511284	1516665	Funny enough, Kira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role, and both of them passed.
1517025	1523126	But Jessica Biel, because, you know, she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.
1523146	1524327	At least they got the sex right.
1526327	1528767	Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.
1530228	1532788	What's her face from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?
1533588	1536589	Oh, um, um, Zhang Ji?
1536749	1537009	Yeah.
1537029	1537209	Yeah.
1538294	1541016	Why don't they just have her play, like, fucking Cammy or something?
1541056	1542418	At least that would make sense.
1542678	1544019	Well, keep in mind, this is just a rumor.
1544039	1545240	Kylie Minogue, he's a player again!
1545660	1546041	Again?
1546061	1548323	She did, in the old... I know, I know.
1548343	1550364	No, she played, um, Cammy?
1550605	1551065	Yeah.
1551125	1551365	Okay.
1551385	1553247	But you know who should play Chun-Li?
1553387	1553667	Who?
1554028	1554748	Ching Chong.
1555889	1556290	What?
1557891	1563035	He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays, like, the... No, I'm just making a rake.
1563936	1565838	No, that's Chao Chang, stupid!
1566505	1571109	Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie City Hunter was more accurate than Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.
1590387	1602311	Granted, I'm not going to say that, you know, Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, you know, scantily clad, you know, would not be a draw for me to see his movie, but... What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene, like in the Japanese one?
1602411	1604612	That would never happen, but that'd be hot.
1604812	1609354	I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.
1609414	1613255	TigerClaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.
1613575	1617336	I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
1617977	1618657	You know that chick?
1621173	1621733	That was her name.
1621753	1622293	Yeah, exactly.
1623555	1625136	Actdeft says Kylie Minogue rocks.
1625196	1625656	That's true.
1626917	1629780	SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?
1630160	1632622	And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alba, Keira Knightley.
1632962	1636865	They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.
1636945	1638567	I can never pronounce that guy's name.
1638967	1639387	Jeter.
1639487	1646373	You know what would be really awful is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for the movie.
1646393	1647354	It would just be awful.
1649892	1678975	We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la Around the world, street fighting, la la la la Maybe I should play Chun-Li RuPaul as Chun-Li I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere Wison Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass
1683221	1686903	JV Mon says Rob could be E-Honda Are you saying I'm fat?
1686923	1687724	What are you trying to say?
1689044	1710737	DJ DarkNate says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3 Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li It could be Sanjaya from American Idol And GS68, as long as Loki is Tingle As long as Loki plays Tingle Anyways
1712324	1713445	Back to Guitar Hero.
1714205	1739880	Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the 80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer, July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister, I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist, not covers, Round and Round, as made famous by R.A.T.,
1741164	1756381	I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow Mental Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio And the Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia
1757506	1763070	How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're Not Gonna Take It?
1763351	1764131	How do you do that?
1764211	1765172	It could be an Unlocked song.
1765292	1778702	Or even the song, remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly, yeah, Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're gonna burn in hell!
1779583	1780404	That was awesome.
1781224	1781885	Anyway, sorry.
1782445	1785728	But yeah, why that random-ass Twisted Sister song?
1785808	1787149	These are only, you know...
1788467	1789848	7 songs that have been announced yet.
1789888	1793971	I mean, come on, it's going to be, you know, there's going to be more songs in there.
1794651	1800815	In case you're wondering, it is only going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, at least as a disc.
1800835	1802776	360, get ready for another download!
1802996	1803577	Woohoo!
1803597	1805038	Do you have the facts to back that up?
1806058	1806659	That's a rumor.
1807599	1810221	It's only coming out on PlayStation 2, as a disc.
1810721	1811762	Okay, alright.
1811822	1814324	So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.
1815124	1816025	Or just unannounced.
1816505	1817686	Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.
1818311	1819411	No, but it's going to be a download pack.
1845963	1873531	or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap as much as I hate ACDC I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell I can't stand that fucking guy's voice never did like it alright but a game I could stand was Saints Row that was actually kind of fun and if you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row sucks to be you it just got canned but there is a silver lining to the story Saints Row 2 is in development right now and it's coming out on the Playstation 3
1874338	1875478	and the Xbox 360.
1876038	1878319	And they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.
1878959	1882220	I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.
1882460	1885881	Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.
1886141	1891582	The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment into a larger installed base next year.
1891882	1893582	That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.
1894062	1896563	So in other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1
1897233	1899115	And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.
1899175	1901678	I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it.
1901818	1905863	Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or Crackdown.
1905903	1906183	Exactly.
1906424	1911209	Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.
1912230	1914493	Unless it sucks, in which case it'll come out right afterwards.
1915854	1917116	It's actually not a bad decision, though.
1917717	1918017	All right.
1918519	1922740	Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.
1922780	1933583	You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com and DarkSakura likes to dive into the mail bag head first and land on pavement apparently and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1934463	1937664	So, DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?
1937824	1938704	Fuck everybody.
1938724	1940365	I haven't got a single damn email.
1940965	1941845	So, fuck it.
1942580	1949205	I should say, just, there was some spam, and there was a couple... The spam is squishy, and we had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.
1949245	1954549	And there were, like, a couple random emails that were, like, other types of inquiries that aren't really suitable for on-air.
1954609	1955990	But other than that, nothing!
1956230	1958552	Like, Rob, what color are your underwear?
1959933	1962815	No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on-air, probably.
1963355	1964556	Yeah, Dark Tansy has said it.
1964576	1965177	Pool's closed.
1965977	1966598	And, uh, green.
1967498	1969520	What the... Okay, whatever.
1970721	1970901	What?
1971676	1972979	I'm married, butthead.
1974362	1976607	What, are they just starting to ask questions in chat?
1977669	1977890	All right.
1978382	1979343	I'm doing some chat booting.
2006085	2012209	But ever since January of 2005, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting a readable email.
2012869	2014030	It's very strange, isn't it?
2015751	2020134	Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one in French.
2020994	2023796	Well, you know the good news is now, I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.
2023996	2025337	Someone email me in French.
2025817	2026117	All right.
2027018	2028239	All right, here we go.
2028799	2030540	That was my best French impersonation, by the way.
2031161	2031641	All right, well.
2031661	2032461	That was horrible.
2032481	2034283	Thank you, as most of my accents are.
2034723	2034983	All right.
2035721	2037882	Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.
2037982	2039763	Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.
2039903	2040804	What?
2041204	2042244	Okay, this is kind of stupid.
2042284	2045046	My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.
2046166	2053750	So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our birthday party next month, right?
2054330	2056392	Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?
2057152	2059493	No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.
2063375	2064696	I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock.
2065874	2068655	and I'm going to dress as a police constable and go around arresting my co-workers.
2069456	2069776	Lovely.
2070956	2071637	Did you have fun with that?
2071737	2072717	Or has it happened yet?
2072997	2073657	No, it's next month.
2073778	2074298	Pics, please.
2075418	2075658	All right.
2076159	2080200	Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.
2080240	2082301	We had a phone call on our Skype line.
2082721	2086683	Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live.
2086703	2088104	And we'll take your calls in a minute here.
2088784	2092686	But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.
2092986	2095127	Chris Amegzi went to ASIN.
2095558	2100280	and Megzi actually had an artist table because some folks actually asked saying like, hey, I never found Chris and Megzi.
2100340	2101320	Where were they at the con?
2101340	2103621	Megzi is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.
2103661	2105021	Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.
2105422	2105702	Yeah.
2105942	2106682	And she had an artist table.
2106722	2107362	Megzi had an artist table.
2107382	2107642	Yeah, she did.
2107802	2109223	So that's where she spent most of the con.
2109243	2113805	So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the art room, that's how you missed it.
2113825	2114665	And Chris was doing it too.
2115005	2120747	Yeah, so Chris apparently went around and whored out the show, but she says that in her voice message, which we're going to listen to right now.
2120787	2123108	Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.
2124474	2132721	Hello Rob, Jamie, and Matt, this is Chris over at ASIN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
2133521	2137644	And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well.
2138085	2149133	Due to time constraints, a lot, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.
2150995	2153617	The pimping out has not been going according to plan.
2154526	2158087	Um, so I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.
2158728	2163850	Um, I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did, my phone kept dying.
2164130	2168251	Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including a game room.
2169192	2171833	Um, both of which, my cell phone reception did not work.
2172133	2177715	So, obviously, this entire trip has been one big mess of blah for me.
2178055	2179456	Plus, I'm now losing my voice.
2179816	2183017	So, but I think I should give you guys the scope anyway.
2183844	2189167	Those of you who are interested in going to ASUN in 2000... Oops, messed up.
2189787	2194710	Those of you who are interested at all going to ASUN and are looking for games, there's lots of things to do here.
2194750	2198532	The dealer room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.
2198812	2202034	There's a lot of... What are those things called?
2202374	2205756	You know, the dating sims.
2205836	2206797	There's a lot of those.
2207117	2209058	And a lot of yaoi weapons for those fine girls.
2209460	2215604	A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which again, I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.
2215945	2217025	I just haven't had the time.
2218527	2221128	There's also card games for people.
2221228	2226272	There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters and all that fun stuff.
2227073	2231956	And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.
2232336	2234558	This entire trip actually was paid for me.
2235083	2235963	Thanks for watching!
2264952	2267993	My Live Journal at Disney Punk 10.
2268833	2270833	Or you can try to get a hold from DarkSakura.
2271313	2273814	But other than that, I have tried.
2273854	2275934	I've been pimping out your show, I swear.
2276574	2284776	I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says Orange Lounge Radio for Gamers or something like that.
2284796	2285636	I forgot what I put on it.
2286516	2287697	I printed those out at work.
2288257	2292598	I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.
2292678	2294678	It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.
2295242	2297023	Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.
2297163	2300785	I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.
2300865	2305728	And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year, you guys got to give me some good promos.
2306228	2308690	So, you know, it looks impressive than the shit that I have.
2309250	2315433	So, but anyway, this has been Chris at ASUN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.
2315954	2317375	This has been your Roaming Lesbian.
2317815	2318935	Back to you, Rob.
2319496	2320496	Back to you, Jamie.
2320756	2321717	Back to you, Matt.
2322137	2323358	Matt's role, asshole.
2324929	2327591	There you go, Chris, semi-live at ASEN there.
2328832	2330113	You gotta love Chris, she's so fine.
2330134	2334878	I love that she's adopted, she's kind of adopted the title of the roving lesbian of OLR, it's great.
2335518	2336959	And Max Rule, asshole, did you catch that?
2336979	2338180	They rule the land of sucking.
2341023	2341523	Great.
2341563	2345987	I hate their commercials too, because now he's like, see, the commercials said they're better, so they are.
2346648	2346888	Like,
2347728	2348629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2364716	2367140	Pompous little fucking cars is what they are
2380523	2381163	That's kind of cool.
2381183	2385546	I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN and who knows, maybe next year if it's in the OLR budget, we'll go.
2385946	2387867	But for now, we have Fonamay to look forward to.
2387927	2391990	Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area, you've got to go to Fonamay.
2392010	2395011	It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend and OLR is going to be there Saturday.
2395271	2399254	And since we're only doing one panel this year, it's in the works.
2400254	2406298	This won't be live, boys and girls, but we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
2407719	2408359	Friday night,
2408977	2415321	at the secret, super secret suite that OLR will be at Friday night.
2415381	2417282	The super secret suite?
2417502	2420144	Yes, it's our super secret suite 16.
2420804	2422945	That's not the actually suite number, whatever suite it is.
2423345	2427468	The biggest, the most number of drunk, because it's going to be at a con, so everybody's going to be there.
2427808	2429509	The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.
2429609	2433051	I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just don't have the equipment to make that happen.
2433571	2437033	I could take my Mac out there, but Loki would find a way to fuck it all up, so there you go.
2437614	2438114	I could take my
2438713	2439173	Non-MAC.
2465109	2480682	by the way unfortunately that won't be live either we won't be live that weekend but you can come see us tape live in person that's pretty awesome and we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again we had some really good questions last year someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac hating thing that's always a good sign I don't care okay I don't care
2482436	2484337	I don't even really hate them anymore.
2484537	2485878	I don't like them.
2485958	2486699	I wouldn't buy them.
2486819	2488260	I don't care if you like them.
2488640	2489040	Great.
2489120	2489860	Good for you.
2490041	2490741	I really don't care.
2492422	2496684	Stop asking me why I don't like them because I don't have legitimate reasons.
2496784	2497505	I don't like them.
2499496	2500977	I'm racist against Max.
2501017	2502377	She doesn't like the color yellow.
2502417	2503158	You don't like Max.
2503238	2503758	Exactly.
2503818	2505119	I'm racist against Max.
2505179	2506399	I have no reason for it.
2506439	2508940	There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.
2509240	2510581	I think they're crappy computers.
2510661	2513282	But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.
2513702	2515483	That's your opinion, awesome.
2515583	2518464	I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them, either way.
2518524	2519784	Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?
2519804	2520225	Thank you.
2521905	2523426	Anyways, so...
2525167	2526448	Uh, yeah.
2526828	2528508	This is not very surprising at all.
2528948	2531329	But, um, apparently Playboy's coming to Second Life.
2532349	2534150	I would say, well, what took them so long?
2534470	2540692	Since, um, you know, I want to say that most of Second Life anyways is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.
2541092	2542852	Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.
2543352	2550174	But, um, yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life and, uh, no real word of what's going to happen.
2550214	2553415	But apparently you're going to be able to participate either as a centerfold or
2554426	2555867	Somebody's staring at centerfolds.
2556747	2558708	Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?
2559308	2560348	Possibly, I don't know.
2560889	2562709	Microsoft also entered Second Life.
2562869	2566451	I want to say Final Fantasy VII's been recreated in Second Life.
2567791	2571232	You know, I hate to sound morbid, but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.
2571272	2572553	I mean, he's not getting any younger.
2573093	2577375	I'm so interested to see how CNN's going to handle it when he passes.
2578015	2580436	You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?
2582472	2586554	He was an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.
2587114	2587394	I don't know.
2587794	2590956	Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.
2591596	2592977	Seven chicks at one time.
2593037	2596018	Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.
2596058	2596978	That's the fountain of youth.
2598059	2599800	Suddenly all the young kids still want to do you.
2600140	2605042	You know, if there's one person that in this world needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.
2605482	2606423	No, no, I take that back.
2606703	2607183	Bob Barker.
2607883	2610404	But if you can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.
2610424	2612045	We have the Hugh bot and the Bob bot.
2612859	2614460	Bob Barker, he cannot die.
2614560	2615180	The Barker Bot.
2615760	2616861	He's retiring this year.
2616981	2617481	It's happening.
2617601	2619322	I know.
2619382	2620062	I'm sad too.
2620202	2620442	No.
2620743	2621303	Robot.
2622083	2626865	Someone kill him before he decides to retire and we'll resurrect him as a robot and he'll never know the difference.
2627125	2629246	He will think it's his first year doing the show.
2630687	2631667	He will not be tired of it.
2631827	2632188	You know.
2632308	2634969	He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.
2635129	2637230	Rumor is because Rosie's leaving The View.
2637450	2639871	Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.
2641440	2643861	Yeah, uh, no.
2646542	2648923	It's like, come on down!
2649264	2650824	No, you're gonna eat me!
2651745	2653305	Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?
2653826	2654786	Didn't Wing Martindale die?
2655126	2655847	No, is he still alive?
2655967	2656107	Oh.
2657147	2658668	Some famous game show always dies.
2658748	2660169	It was the one from Pressure Lock.
2660869	2662049	Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.
2662069	2664390	Yeah, uh, whatever his name, Peter DeMarkin.
2665011	2666291	He was in a plane wreck or something.
2666691	2667812	Boy, this show's getting morbid.
2668669	2670189	Let's open up the phones, shall we?
2670709	2673370	If you want to give us a call and comment on anything from the show tonight.
2673390	2676551	Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.
2676571	2682272	1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR Or, remember that number is only toll free in the US.
2682332	2683292	What about Lamar Burton?
2684012	2684752	Lamar Burton?
2684772	2685472	Lamar Burton, yeah.
2685732	2686452	Lamar Burton?
2686532	2688113	I don't know his name.
2688273	2691693	Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.
2692134	2692654	Why him?
2692754	2694134	I've never seen him hosting a show.
2695029	2696790	He didn't have a say in this.
2696810	2697010	What?
2697030	2698371	Alright, let's go to the phones.
2698431	2699292	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
2699312	2699512	Who's this?
2712642	2739471	Legend of Saku Hi, Legend of Saku Chewbacca, he could totally host the show It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000 I've never played that yodeling game Yes, I love the yodeling game, the game's fucking right You know, I went to see The Price is Right live a couple years ago We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork I know you have something you want to say, Zaku, but I'm going to talk for a minute Yeah, go ahead About nothing game-related
2739949	2745596	I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy and gets away with it, like, in public, nonetheless.
2746117	2748440	Like, she wore that fucking swan dress, but here's the thing.
2748460	2752225	When I saw her at Coachella, like, this was, what, like, 2002 or 2003, I want to say, is when we went.
2754801	2764227	She wore a Venus flytrap outfit, and it was awesome, because, like, it was closed for most of it, but then during one of her songs, it opened up, and she was like a Venus flytrap.
2764628	2765989	She's so fucking hardcore.
2766209	2767570	I mean, that was, like, the best weekend ever.
2767590	2770612	It was Bjork in a Venus flytrap outfit, and Price is Right.
2771152	2772093	It was a great weekend.
2772413	2772953	I had a good time.
2772973	2775175	Sorry, Zaku, you had something gaming-related you wanted to mention?
2776176	2777757	Uh, just pulling through Dick right now.
2778437	2784101	Um, I see that, uh, that Sony's about to announce a new PS3 firmware update.
2784918	2786279	A new PS3 firmware update.
2786299	2787500	Wait, this is on Dig right now?
2788260	2788621	Yeah.
2788641	2789381	Right this second?
2789461	2790162	Wait, wait, wait.
2790402	2791083	Don't be fooled.
2791183	2796747	It's an announcement of announcements, so... That's what... Yeah, Loki's right.
2797007	2799309	I'm looking... Oh, this is from PSU.com.
2799369	2800870	Isn't that their official underground site?
2800930	2802771	Or is this a... Oh, I don't know.
2803251	2804612	There's too... You know what?
2804632	2807334	There's too damn many game blogs out there on the internet right now.
2807374	2808555	We need to somehow put a cap.
2808635	2809536	I mean, don't get me wrong.
2810034	2814435	I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are basically, they're biased towards either console.
2814475	2818716	You see Kotaku's more anti-Sony, you know, at certain times, and then, I don't know, Joystick is almost the same thing.
2835000	2835901	I mean, actually, no.
2835921	2838803	Joystick is more pro-Nintendo, if I recall correctly.
2839083	2845828	Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though, because they tried to screw them over because Kotaku was saying something, you know, legitimate.
2845908	2849251	And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff we don't want you to.
2849671	2851352	You're banned from everything now.
2856276	2856656	I don't know.
2856696	2860780	Yeah, like a certain other business I'm thinking of, a Namco, but we won't go there.
2861480	2861860	Anyhow.
2862881	2863462	Yeah.
2863502	2863762	Whoops.
2864528	2870991	They've just added stuff that, I don't know, should have been there, but I can see why they left it out initially.
2871631	2876633	Probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboys saying, oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.
2876673	2879094	You could access the XMB in-game.
2892209	2895290	Like how you can access the dashboard on 360 in-game as well.
2895610	2895930	Okay.
2898070	2898490	Let me see.
2898530	2900591	They said stuff about in-game music as well.
2904172	2904972	Sleep mode.
2905512	2908373	I mean, I can link you right now, but it's a whole bunch of settings.
2908393	2912094	I tried pulling it up on Dig, but obviously everybody's hammering the site, so it's broken.
2912114	2914894	But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.
2915414	2918395	What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.
2918888	2920889	There's an equalizer in the music.
2920969	2926573	There's photo settings, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 settings, RSS channel settings is now an option.
2926913	2929415	So now I'll be hopping to OLR on your PS3.
2930775	2935578	More slideshow stuff for the photos, more visualization for music.
2935638	2938120	Looks like you can do some other things with video.
2938160	2939661	You can do some zoom-ins and stuff.
2941802	2944684	The cross-media bar is now accessible during gameplay, like you said.
2945299	2946840	RSS Channel is added as a feature.
2946860	2947460	That's pretty cool.
2947480	2950201	That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3 pretty soon.
2950501	2954984	You can now have multiple chat sessions and you can select an image to use as your avatar from the photo.
2957104	2958285	So it sounds like a pretty big update.
2958305	2958845	That's pretty cool.
2959526	2959886	I don't know.
2959946	2961807	It's catching up to 360.
2962027	2964068	I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.
2965388	2966749	It's funny you phrase it that way.
2966789	2968990	It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?
2972070	2980876	I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.
2981857	2982858	Does that even exist?
2983959	2986300	Like the custom soundtracks like on Xbox 360?
2986601	2986921	I don't know.
2986941	2987801	I don't own a PS3.
2988422	2989223	Can you do custom soundtracks?
2989243	2989823	You can't, right?
2989843	2990183	Maybe.
2990363	2991864	I don't think so.
2992845	2993826	I think it depends on the game.
2994446	2996568	Interesting.
2996868	2997929	Folks in chat are saying no.
2999406	3008333	Yeah, I mean, once Sony, you know, Sony has a lot of work to do in order to win, in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.
3009033	3014978	I mean, they have to add Rumble, lower the price, get some really good games out because right now they're in a drought.
3015838	3019801	Not to say that they're the only ones, but, you know, the Wii is also in a drought right now.
3019921	3022763	They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.
3023724	3024325	Right, that's true.
3024365	3026386	That's exactly what I said.
3026406	3028208	A price cut would do just that.
3028528	3028788	All right.
3029201	3030001	Anything else, Zaku?
3030021	3033123	We've got to get going to another call, but any other last stuff you want to get in here?
3034243	3034904	That's about it.
3035024	3036264	My throat's kind of sore.
3036284	3038626	I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.
3039166	3039466	All right.
3039726	3040386	See you soon, buddy.
3040426	3041647	Less than a month before I come to New York.
3042267	3042948	All right.
3042968	3043368	Later, dude.
3043668	3043988	Bye-bye.
3044648	3052572	I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.
3053333	3055774	Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.
3055814	3056234	Maybe the
3056792	3059534	Dave and Buster's thing, although I don't think everybody can get in there, so I don't know.
3059974	3060695	Maybe pizza?
3061295	3061635	I don't know.
3062456	3063216	I'm up for ideas.
3063416	3064737	Let's start a forum thread or something.
3065137	3066438	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3066458	3066819	Who's this?
3067519	3068099	Hey, what's up, guys?
3068119	3070421	It's the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?
3071181	3071602	Not too much.
3071642	3073563	I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.
3073843	3074443	Ah, of course.
3074523	3075144	How was ASEN?
3075824	3076525	Oh, lots of fun.
3076825	3077505	I had a blast.
3077525	3079006	I watched a lot of anime.
3079046	3079987	I played a lot of games.
3081528	3084610	Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.
3085632	3086893	One guy was dressed up as Frank West.
3087253	3088354	He was carrying a surfboard head.
3088954	3090436	That's awesome.
3090456	3093518	He had his girlfriend who was also wearing a surfboard head.
3093618	3097761	He held her hand the whole time and she didn't move unless he dragged her.
3099042	3099822	That's great.
3100503	3103045	And two zombies with surfboard heads were chasing them the whole way through.
3103845	3104566	That's pretty awesome.
3104586	3109189	I like when people go all out with the game because I'm not really all about the anime.
3109269	3111891	Obviously we have a lot of folks here in studio that are really into anime.
3113110	3115511	and I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.
3115551	3120154	So I really like when people bring more of the gaming into the anime cons through the cosplay and stuff.
3120194	3120775	That's always cool.
3123477	3124577	Some interesting things happened too.
3124798	3133684	I went to a couple of the programming panels like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness and at one point a thousand people were singing the Segata Sanchiro theme song.
3134805	3135065	Wow.
3135085	3138227	You can get that many nerds in one place.
3139076	3144978	Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell, which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials, bad anime, that sort of thing.
3145338	3145598	That's right.
3145618	3146659	Or just, like, bad commercials.
3147439	3152761	So they played, like, the full four minutes, Sega Tatsushiro, or theme song, with subtitles.
3153001	3158403	So it's kind of an easy core thing, so everyone started joining in the second, third, and fourth times they played it.
3159523	3160623	Wow, nerds, all of you.
3160943	3163684	Hey, what types of, like, game room setups did they have?
3163704	3165785	Because I noticed no anime con is complete without a game room.
3166377	3166497	Right.
3166517	3167077	King of Fighters 11.
3193919	3197260	You're not really going to find Nadno8 at an anime con.
3198520	3198880	Exactly.
3198960	3200881	And for the Parapara machine, it was great.
3201021	3208423	There were probably about 15 people behind doing the motions themselves as people were playing the machine.
3208603	3209083	It was great.
3209303	3210423	How many of them were dudes?
3213404	3215825	Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.
3216245	3220586	You know, it's funny because there used to be hella guys in Northern California who
3221053	3232935	And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really do Parapara dancing, and then all those teams just fell apart, like instantly vaporized.
3232975	3234395	It was something else.
3235336	3241557	I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff, and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.
3241937	3243757	But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.
3244557	3245697	Exactly, rock on, Sky.
3247058	3247978	There were a lot of tournaments...
3249312	3251613	Turnips for just about every fighting game, every anime fighting game.
3252094	3257937	There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.
3258938	3259738	I got killed in that one.
3260019	3260299	Wow.
3261419	3263481	So I entered five of them, somewhere around there.
3264001	3267063	A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players, but people were still having fun.
3267083	3270925	There weren't too many people that were completely arrogant or cocky, which unfortunately can't happen.
3272346	3276689	I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chatroom.
3277029	3277289	Awesome.
3277878	3279359	Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.
3279539	3280200	It was a lot of fun.
3282322	3282762	It's funny.
3284644	3284944	Never mind.
3285004	3285845	I won't tell that story.
3286045	3290529	I'll just say that some of my friends actually found a stranger in their hotel room when they woke up the next day.
3293371	3297775	Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.
3297915	3300097	Interesting.
3301258	3301458	All right.
3301478	3302439	Well, we'll leave it at that.
3302879	3305361	Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Fanameh.
3307168	3309850	If you're an anime fan, I've got to say it's a great place to go to.
3309890	3315975	If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan, you should probably go to that because there are a lot of people that know how to play the games.
3315995	3317256	You'll get a lot of good matches there.
3317776	3318077	All right.
3318937	3321259	If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.
3321419	3323401	I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.
3324341	3324602	Awesome.
3325002	3328024	Well, thanks for the wrap-up, and I'm glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.
3328044	3333889	You guys should call in next time with your report because obviously Chris had a hard time finding you guys or her cell phone wasn't working or something.
3335050	3335330	All right.
3336464	3337726	All right, take care, buddy.
3337806	3338387	Thanks for the call.
3338827	3342812	Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?
3342852	3343934	Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?
3344474	3345015	I always do.
3345235	3345816	Really?
3345936	3348319	The first place I go to is the message boards because I do cosplay.
3348480	3348780	Really?
3349100	3349321	Yes.
3349561	3349881	All right.
3349981	3352665	It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements on there and stuff.
3353393	3356034	Dude, I'm going to do that at Fanime.
3356754	3366976	Well, no, the big thing is, at least this has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer, especially doing something from something you know other people are going to be doing, you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.
3367276	3369197	Oh, like the pictures that they all do.
3369217	3369817	Exactly.
3369837	3369997	Okay.
3370137	3375358	And there's also other groups meeting, like YaliCon had a bunch of Dolphy collectors getting together.
3376064	3377025	and that type of thing.
3377285	3380947	The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards or the site forums.
3381067	3388711	So once we find out Ranma's room number, we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that says Naked Twister at 9pm in this room.
3390772	3391813	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3391853	3392253	Who's this?
3393193	3393954	Raven's Dolphin!
3394194	3395354	Hello, Raven's Dolphin!
3396855	3397416	What's on your mind?
3397456	3398096	Raven's Dolphin!
3399517	3400857	The We in the Lake story.
3401378	3403059	The We in the Lake story, yes.
3403439	3405440	Well, I know many guys have taken a We in the Lake
3405931	3407793	Wee in the Lake once or twice in their lives.
3408393	3410074	Oh yes, the Nintendo Wee in the Lake.
3410154	3410795	What's up with that?
3410935	3411716	What do you have to say about that?
3412817	3414138	You know, I agree with the guy.
3414158	3415319	Divorce is imminent.
3415499	3418801	I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water and get my wee.
3421123	3422484	Are you single, Raven Stolfen?
3423905	3425046	Yeah.
3425987	3427849	Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.
3427869	3432232	I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.
3433593	3433894	That's true.
3436189	3439111	I'm hearing an echo, Ravenstaff, and you need to fix that echo.
3439131	3440472	You've called into this show enough times.
3440572	3441733	Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.
3442333	3448117	Yeah, so is that this guy's problem is that maybe he should have just married somebody who understood the game thing a little more in the first place?
3448137	3450058	He should have married a gamer.
3450258	3450838	Yeah, I agree with that.
3451039	3454801	And so is that what you're doing, Ravenstaff, and you're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?
3456482	3456822	I am.
3456902	3461986	I just want her to understand about me and my gaming addiction, and she throws the Wii out.
3462046	3462406	It's over.
3463123	3463683	You know what, though?
3463723	3465584	People do stupid things when they fight.
3465764	3468105	I mean, people smash car windows.
3468205	3471467	They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.
3471527	3473468	I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.
3473988	3481331	And, you know, they'll do – I mean, it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not because if she knew, like, hey, this is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.
3481671	3484353	You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.
3484393	3485473	You know, that's what she's going to do.
3486834	3487314	That's true.
3487654	3490135	You just have to marry someone who can keep their temper in check.
3491015	3491556	That's true.
3491736	3492116	You're right.
3492463	3493183	Oh, one more thing?
3493383	3494203	Of course, what's up?
3495764	3499865	This is a little old, but I thought that the Situawada thing was hilarious.
3500705	3502065	Reggie, you're not selling enough.
3502766	3503746	Damn it, sell more.
3504526	3505486	I'm not following.
3505526	3506186	What was this news?
3506427	3507067	It's been a while.
3508287	3512728	Well, he said it was about the Brain Age, and he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.
3512748	3513428	In Europe, they sold 30,000.
3513988	3515889	Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 Brain Age or 30,000 in Europe?
3521025	3521726	Reggie's Invincible
3549127	3551087	Reggie is a god among men.
3551387	3552128	Reggie's invincible.
3552188	3556888	But Iwata does have the power if he wanted to bust some Reggie heads.
3557188	3558869	I mean, think about it.
3559349	3563770	The only person in the entire world who gets to yell at Reggie.
3563830	3565930	Actually, there's two people in the world that get to yell at Reggie.
3565990	3568250	His wife and Iwata.
3569210	3569691	That's true.
3569811	3570211	That's it.
3571131	3571951	Sorry for that thing.
3572291	3572871	That's all right.
3573031	3574671	I had the microphone too high.
3574911	3575612	Life goes on.
3576052	3577752	Well, Raven Stauffen, thanks for the call as always.
3578430	3578951	Of course, bye.
3579091	3579691	Have a good one, buddy.
3581574	3582415	Let's go to another call.
3582755	3584137	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3584157	3584577	Who's this?
3585598	3587340	Hey, it's Ranma.
3587360	3588481	What's up, everyone?
3588522	3589062	Hi, Jamie.
3589222	3590003	What's up?
3590023	3592386	Hey, naked twister, 9 o'clock, right?
3593038	3598541	Okay, before we start, there will be a $5 cover charge for the Drunk Show.
3598881	3601922	Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.
3602043	3606845	If you get in before the end of the Drunk Show, you can still qualify for Naked Twister.
3607085	3609146	There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.
3609166	3610447	That is not happening, Ranma.
3610467	3611747	That's a joke, okay?
3612288	3613648	I'm just going to say that right here.
3614008	3617550	There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room anyway.
3618251	3620572	I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.
3623376	3625478	You know what's actually really funny about Fanime?
3625498	3627139	Did I talk about this on the last week's show?
3627159	3629981	I'm not sure if it was on the show or if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.
3630801	3634004	But my boyfriend wants to go to Fanime.
3634965	3641229	Which is funny because... Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.
3641249	3641990	That's why it's funny.
3642030	3643371	That has nothing to do with it.
3643731	3649075	No, but the reason why is because he watches anime.
3649375	3650496	He's familiar with some of it.
3650516	3651797	He probably knows more about it than I do.
3652375	3653556	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3681542	3686484	The mistake in the whole Sailor Moon part is actually not being moon-sized, you know.
3687524	3689505	Anyhow, so... I'm dressing up this year.
3690026	3696448	If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?
3697148	3698789	I have to have my skirt made.
3699189	3700250	What are you cosplaying as?
3700270	3702150	I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.
3703971	3704311	What?
3704912	3705472	That's cute.
3705552	3705992	I like that.
3706192	3708173	I have to get my wig finished, though.
3708673	3709994	Is there a rest of the posse?
3710434	3710674	Is there...
3711224	3712525	No, but Rob, you could cosplay.
3712625	3713385	You could be the hero.
3713765	3714165	I could.
3714906	3715286	Why not?
3715346	3715846	It would be fun.
3715986	3716827	And then I'll have to whip you.
3717047	3719248	And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.
3719308	3721649	I actually have a full bullwhip.
3721769	3723030	I'm not dressing up like a goblin.
3724570	3725091	Please do.
3725131	3725711	That would be funny.
3726591	3729133	So, does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume this year?
3729733	3731254	No, no black mage costume.
3731314	3732274	I had fun with that, though.
3732314	3734495	Hey, Ranma, can I borrow a mage costume?
3735075	3735756	Sure, I'll pack it.
3736356	3736836	Rad.
3737096	3737377	Okay.
3737937	3738757	Sorry.
3739137	3740318	Because I have the red hair and all.
3741295	3744939	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room suggests Loki should cosplay as Tingle.
3745059	3746420	I am not dressing up like Tingle.
3746560	3747261	Fuck no.
3747361	3748202	Alright, sorry Ranma.
3748242	3749583	What the hell did you call in for anyway?
3749903	3752245	Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.
3753246	3754147	Wait, like the movie?
3754307	3754828	The first one?
3755869	3757750	Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.
3761073	3761314	Really?
3761374	3764977	Okay, now spoiler free please, because Mikkelsof and I both want to see this.
3765097	3766999	Trust, um, do you have a strong stomach?
3768181	3770222	I want to see it because I love the undead.
3770282	3771182	I mean, load the undead.
3771703	3776645	Miklatov and I both scream like girls at bad violence, but that's part of the fun in going.
3777245	3778125	You're going to scream.
3778166	3779086	That's all I got to say.
3779346	3779666	Really?
3780026	3782147	Oh, Miklatov's already putting on a pouty face.
3782567	3783608	But it's really good, though.
3783948	3788930	I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw-up stuff going on in that movie.
3789671	3790271	Yeah.
3790351	3791411	And I hate that.
3791751	3792752	It's so gross.
3793052	3795933	Ranma, you know what you need to see if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?
3796594	3796794	What?
3797034	3797514	Hot fuzz.
3798632	3799533	That's on my list.
3799613	3801274	Well, maybe we can do it while we're out there.
3801334	3801814	Come on now.
3802034	3803395	Yeah, that's what I just said.
3803415	3804856	We can go see Hot Fuzz.
3805616	3806036	Sorry.
3806116	3806717	Definitely.
3807657	3814321	I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions where like, what more can I buy and how many more pictures can I be taken of?
3814521	3815322	Let's just go somewhere.
3815342	3817663	And we need to get chicken.
3817843	3819504	Let's go see that movie tomorrow when I get back from LA.
3819544	3820545	I'm gonna cry.
3820745	3822606	You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow, do you?
3823248	3823548	No.
3823769	3824990	Why would I want to do that?
3825410	3826991	Let's go see that movie and you can cry.
3828552	3829033	Suck it up.
3829053	3830434	Dude.
3830814	3831115	Okay.
3831535	3832676	I don't like zombies.
3833016	3845406	I don't like that these people, even though they're not really zombies because they're not dead, they're people with a virus, but they're like zombies and they throw up blood and they run really fast and it's going to scare the crap out of me.
3845486	3848249	Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Ranma, so you understand.
3848709	3848909	Yes.
3849109	3851131	Taking Shane to zombie movies.
3852232	3858296	Taking Extifer on Roller Coasters Oh my god, it's killing me!
3859397	3860278	That was so funny.
3860798	3861599	Anyhow, sorry.
3861899	3863020	These are the little pleasures in life.
3863060	3866282	This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we can go see the movie.
3866762	3867623	Sweet.
3868243	3871205	I'm just going to miss out on playing Bus to Move at work.
3873627	3878350	You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers, some of them listen to this program, right?
3878650	3879251	Why do I care?
3879431	3880271	Alright, just check it.
3880312	3880972	Just want to make sure.
3882230	3883230	They can all suck it.
3885391	3886632	All thousands of listeners.
3886912	3887492	I'm sorry.
3887532	3888933	I'm inflating that number a lot.
3888973	3889893	I meant dozens.
3889933	3891114	All 14 listeners.
3891174	3893474	All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.
3893514	3894315	Yeah.
3894835	3895255	Whatever.
3895275	3896256	I don't even care anymore.
3896296	3898176	Ranma, tell me something game related.
3898937	3899717	Let's see.
3899737	3900377	A couple of things.
3900497	3905739	In response of last week, I have been listening to this show for about five years.
3905779	3907260	It'll be six years in January.
3908663	3912546	How is that possible when we've only been doing this show five years next month?
3913906	3918189	I remember, maybe I'm off by you, I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.
3918669	3920591	Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.
3920691	3920871	Yes.
3921151	3921351	Okay.
3921611	3923553	See?
3923633	3927435	The station started in 2000, no, yeah, the station started in 2002.
3927535	3929296	Longest train wreck ever.
3929396	3929777	Forget it.
3929837	3930937	Anyway, sorry, what, Ranma?
3931858	3934840	No, DarkTetsu wanted to throw down, so I accepted his challenge.
3936700	3938321	Look, thank you, Drew Nami.
3938341	3939762	6-23 of 02 was the first live show.
3939782	3942483	Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence Drew Nami has.
3944044	3945104	23 is the number of coincidence.
3945124	3956330	Wait, what were you going to say, Ranma, about you've been listening to the show for five years, and last week... No, I think it was last week when Dr. Zacon said about your biggest fans, you said it was me and Misty.
3956950	3958731	I was trying to figure out how many years we've been listening.
3959659	3965922	You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show last week.
3966562	3968463	Yeah, because I EM'd her about it.
3968503	3973006	She said you guys missed her, and I told her, no, they all love you and miss you a lot.
3973106	3973406	I know.
3973886	3977268	She kind of just disappeared, but I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life and stuff.
3977648	3978629	She's doing her thing.
3979089	3980429	And that happens.
3980489	3988053	Folks, sometimes they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore, but we hope you'll always remember us and blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.
3989074	3989474	Definitely.
3990949	3995371	Rob D in chat says, Ranma is such a fan that he's been listening to you since before you've been on the air.
3996292	3998053	That means he was listening to Under Sedation.
3998193	4005216	I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it by saying you were listening to Under Sedation live, and I think that's how Dark Tetsuya gets away with it, because I think he was listening to Under Sedation live.
4006056	4009778	Dark Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest appearances.
4010218	4010558	Crazy.
4011219	4012419	And I filled in for people.
4012459	4014380	I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.
4015040	4015601	Crazy times.
4015941	4016341	Old school.
4016421	4016621	Anyway.
4017051	4019031	Sorry Ranma, anything else you want to share with us?
4019512	4024653	I want to finish it off by saying, in case you guys haven't heard yet, we have a new video gamer in the world.
4025433	4025553	Oh.
4026493	4027633	You IM'd me the other day.
4027653	4028533	Yep.
4029133	4030234	A new video, who's this?
4031894	4035135	My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy last Wednesday.
4036415	4037295	Aww, what's the boy's name?
4037335	4038975	Is it bouncing unhealthy for babies?
4039016	4041476	Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?
4042316	4042756	Stop.
4042836	4046297	Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller and started playing Street Fighter.
4046684	4047304	That's awesome.
4047364	4048845	On the first or second bounce.
4049566	4049926	First.
4050827	4051908	That's really awesome.
4051948	4053569	You need to talk more on this program.
4054489	4054709	All right.
4054729	4055190	Sorry, Ranma.
4055210	4055890	What's the kid's name?
4056871	4058032	Gabriel Henley.
4058852	4059273	Gabriel.
4059993	4061194	Why are you laughing?
4061394	4062515	Like Gabriel Knight, right?
4063656	4064436	I believe so.
4064776	4066818	Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?
4066878	4067178	Is that?
4067658	4067999	No.
4068239	4068539	Okay.
4068739	4069039	All right.
4069960	4070400	I like that.
4070420	4071801	Thank you for spoiling, Rob.
4072001	4074163	That's not a spoiler.
4074183	4075464	I didn't spoil a goddamn thing.
4075484	4076044	It's not a spoiler.
4076417	4077838	That's just his real name.
4077898	4079539	Somebody's going to be named Siler.
4079559	4081480	Maybe if you could watch the show.
4081500	4082861	I work with somebody named Melina.
4083781	4084542	Is that Siler?
4085182	4088084	No, but she's named after a video game character from Mortal Kombat.
4088104	4088364	Really?
4088384	4089665	I work with someone named Katana.
4089805	4090525	That's great.
4090605	4091126	No, I lied.
4091666	4095748	Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go now because your phone calls derail our show too much.
4096909	4097850	It gets the attention.
4097870	4099150	It gets people happy in the chat.
4099391	4100211	I did my job.
4100231	4101012	Bye.
4103293	4103813	One more call.
4104294	4105054	Oop, did I miss this one?
4107523	4108844	Hey, DJ Tyrant, what's on your mind, buddy?
4131209	4131989	Hey, not much.
4132069	4137392	Just wanted to say off your rant there about the gold spam in WoW.
4137612	4137932	Yeah.
4137992	4144475	I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened, not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.
4146856	4149397	What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?
4150058	4152639	They're not going to do anything about it.
4152719	4159322	They're supposed to change some of the reporting of users and stuff like that.
4159915	4160916	Yeah, I don't know.
4160976	4162638	Or just have it, like, okay, how hard would this be?
4162658	4163239	You can message...
4181669	4182169	How about this?
4182250	4187492	You can message a person, but then you have to wait a minute before you can message a different person.
4187812	4191493	Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.
4192054	4197636	Yeah, like limit that, like throttle it somehow that way so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.
4198076	4198396	I don't know.
4198716	4200137	Yeah, that would be nice.
4200237	4200937	Hopefully they'll do that.
4200997	4202998	And have you seen Blizzard's web page?
4203098	4208260	They're announcing their new product on Friday or Saturday, I believe.
4208300	4209341	It was the 19th, right?
4209461	4209621	Yeah.
4209977	4213259	Speaking of WoW, is it okay if I promote some of my other little projects I have on the side?
4213279	4213359	Okay.
4239758	4247521	Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website, wow.stratix.com, and we are having a developer chat on Tuesday.
4248341	4254443	So submit your questions through the IRC channel there, wow.stratix.com.
4255123	4261606	And it's been announced on the WOW webpage, so check it out if you're interested in asking the developers about the game or whatever.
4262406	4262766	Awesome.
4263246	4265687	And trying to make BlizzCon happen.
4266247	4268788	I've got to watch the monies, but I want to go to BlizzCon really bad.
4269434	4271235	Yeah, it'll be fun.
4271255	4277256	We'll probably see whatever they're going to announce this week there.
4277636	4278377	All right, we'll see.
4278877	4279377	All right, buddy.
4279577	4281678	We've got to let you go, but have a great one, okay?
4282038	4282618	Thanks a lot.
4282738	4283258	No problem.
4283798	4284298	Bye-bye.
4285599	4287419	Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyron.
4287459	4293461	Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU, which airs Thursday nights on this very network, but not for the next couple weeks.
4294241	4297082	They're taking a little bit of a break because we all need a break once in a while, but they'll be back.
4297788	4299229	This is your mother, Rob!
4299249	4302250	You didn't call me for Mother's Day!
4302290	4303490	You're a terrible son!
4303510	4306011	I wish I never had you!
4326161	4327282	That was yesterday.
4327542	4328903	It's Mother's Day today.
4330585	4334168	God, I should tell you this right now in front of all your listeners.
4334608	4335629	You were adopted.
4337671	4337991	What?
4338892	4339873	I was adopted?
4339893	4340954	You were adopted.
4342595	4345257	You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?
4346779	4347620	Yes.
4348640	4349741	Who's my real mother?
4352223	4353725	Well, I don't know.
4354656	4362162	Because I traded you with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes and a bottle of vodka.
4363463	4366185	Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.
4366705	4367666	What's wrong with you?
4369787	4370748	I used to.
4372690	4374751	Did you smoke while you were pregnant?
4374791	4375212	I hope not.
4375232	4375652	Oh, wait, no.
4375992	4376372	Never mind.
4376412	4376993	I was adopted.
4378464	4384908	Did they smoke while I was pregnant?
4387889	4389690	I don't really know what else to say, Mom.
4389711	4392672	You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners and I'm crying.
4393313	4396695	By the way, did you have anything... What video games have you been playing this week, Mom?
4398095	4406000	Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me, but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.
4408427	4410888	The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.
4413868	4415189	Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
4415749	4418029	Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360?
4418069	4421490	What is that?
4421650	4423911	One of those things that chink like a disc?
4424371	4426371	Because it's 360 degrees?
4426851	4427612	Something like that.
4427792	4429152	I'll have to explain it to you later.
4429712	4433333	Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.
4434613	4436514	I begrudgingly love you, Rob.
4437134	4437814	I love you, too.
4439215	4440756	You should respond by hanging up quicker I guess so
4465450	4469112	All right, anyway, that's definitely going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
4469152	4470252	Congratulations, everybody.
4470292	4471552	That call ruined it for the rest of you.
4472113	4478655	We're going to go around and wrap up the show now by first off asking if there's any last-minute stories here in the room.
4479036	4480116	Any last-minute stories?
4480756	4481817	I have a last-minute story.
4481837	4482697	Rob, your mom's cool.
4483277	4483717	What's that?
4484078	4485398	I have two last-minute stories.
4486599	4492541	First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally after five months of being broken.
4492581	4493281	That's a story.
4493401	4494122	What took so long?
4494382	4494922	Laziness.
4495549	4498671	and I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.
4499152	4502734	I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes out I can play it.
4503795	4508098	And then my other last minute story is my Magikarp evolved into a Gyarados.
4508999	4509779	Congratulations.
4509819	4510239	Thank you.
4510299	4517244	You know, this is completely inappropriate, but I feel like after that phone call I have no choice but to do this.
4518405	4519606	So we'll just give it a moment here.
4520427	4520967	Oh god.
4526311	4530334	Hello Hey dad, it's Rob Yeah Hey, how you doing?
4531134	4531955	Good, how are you doing?
4531975	4532595	Where are you at?
4532655	4538079	Good, I'm doing a radio program on the internet right now You know the one that embarrasses you that I do?
4538959	4543402	Yeah, I know, yeah Alright, is mom around?
4544663	4546224	Yeah Can you put her on real quick?
4546924	4552488	Just a second Alright Live radio boys and girls, have I mentioned that before?
4556553	4558014	Happy Mother's Day officially.
4584520	4585000	Thank you.
4585220	4586581	Why were they impersonating me?
4586621	4587641	They don't know me.
4587661	4588341	It's a joke.
4588762	4589162	What'd they say?
4611770	4612530	What were they saying?
4612570	4618374	They were saying that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.
4618414	4619055	Is that true?
4621277	4621757	No.
4621997	4623018	And I wasn't adopted?
4624419	4625019	No.
4625319	4626480	Okay, just making sure.
4627881	4629623	My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.
4629943	4635027	Well, hey, mom, I wanted to ask you, you know, when I was growing up, what did you think?
4635107	4637048	I played a lot of video games when I was growing up, huh?
4638249	4638609	Tons.
4639010	4639350	Tons.
4639370	4639450	Tons.
4641118	4643099	Why did you let me play so many video games?
4644761	4645942	Because I was an idiot.
4650105	4659412	Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this where I would have a radio program on the internet with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years talking about games?
4660433	4662354	Not in my weirdest dreams.
4662774	4665557	How come you never played video games with me?
4666497	4667318	I don't like games.
4668949	4669429	Why not?
4669469	4670530	What did the games do to you?
4671570	4672930	I just, I don't know.
4672990	4673611	They're boring.
4675351	4675971	So they're boring.
4675991	4677432	They play card games with you.
4677792	4679913	Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.
4681553	4686435	Well, video games are too fast-paced or something.
4686455	4689876	There's something, I just, I don't have the coordination.
4690516	4693717	Well, you know, but if you played them more often, you could build up the coordination.
4694497	4696018	Maybe, but why would I want to do that?
4697028	4701350	Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangeonsradio.com They're really liking you, Mom.
4701610	4703211	JV Mon says she is awesome.
4704172	4706793	DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.
4706833	4709094	The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.
4710815	4711435	Oh, really?
4711655	4711995	Yeah.
4712475	4713276	So you're popular.
4713316	4714416	You should come on the show sometime.
4715617	4717418	I have been on it before, remember?
4718718	4721459	When I told the whole world about you wearing the pink bunny suit?
4722700	4724541	Actually, that was a different show.
4725350	4728811	That I did before Orange Lounge Radio, but thanks so much for resharing that story.
4728851	4729671	I appreciate it.
4732112	4734492	All right, so, well, that's it.
4734813	4738153	I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not really my mother.
4738173	4740514	You really had a mother and you didn't hatch out of an egg.
4741454	4742695	Exactly, exactly.
4743535	4745775	We have other theories about how Rob came to be.
4747016	4751757	Well, he was, when he was four years old, was like a little old man, you know.
4752452	4756554	And then when he got to high school, he reverted back to childhood.
4756594	4759616	What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when I was four years old?
4760036	4760536	You were.
4760676	4762057	You were like a little old man.
4762097	4764118	You used to order everybody around.
4765338	4766299	You were like the boss.
4766939	4767780	I still do that.
4769360	4773522	You were the boss of me when you were four.
4773542	4774963	Did video games make me that way?
4776664	4778625	You were just really...
4779744	4782825	Well, you know, you were in an adult world.
4782865	4784765	You didn't have a lot of other children around.
4784865	4789887	Well, let's not get into the family drama here on the Internet where lots of people are listening.
4791387	4793608	So you kind of were old for your age.
4793768	4794868	How do I say it?
4795568	4798689	And then when you got into high school, it was like, what did I miss?
4799029	4805491	And then so you started being a child, you know, dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.
4806894	4808195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4832819	4837441	I heard lip-syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you, so I have to open in on this.
4837521	4848026	Jesus, when I was in high school, we participated in this lip-sync contest, and it was me and my two friends, and we did Hole by Violet.
4848046	4849967	You know, go on, take everything.
4850207	4854069	And I dressed up like Courtney Love, and my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.
4854551	4856632	Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen
4883837	4884457	Alright, bye.
4884778	4885818	Anyway, sorry mom.
4885838	4886939	Thanks mom for bringing that up.
4887159	4887779	I appreciate that.
4888079	4889300	Oh, okay.
4889880	4891241	What about all the good things I did?
4892101	4893122	Which would be what, one thing?
4894663	4897584	Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.
4897804	4902927	Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local news?
4903748	4904088	Uh-huh.
4905508	4905949	Very.
4906669	4908170	She sounds so convinced.
4910257	4910697	All right.
4910777	4912438	Mom, I appreciate you calling.
4912458	4915400	I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like, so there you go.
4916081	4919623	Well, she's like a female Rob.
4921304	4922024	So a Rob.
4923645	4924646	Shut up, Shane.
4925106	4925366	All right.
4925686	4927167	Mom, thanks so much for playing along.
4927207	4927968	I appreciate it.
4928268	4932390	You always know on Mother's Day or something to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.
4932491	4932891	Uh-huh.
4933191	4933831	I love you.
4933851	4934352	I was just waiting.
4934392	4936473	I was waiting for you to call, actually.
4936753	4937674	I love you.
4937994	4938874	And so do all the chatters.
4938894	4939235	I love you, too.
4939495	4939775	All right.
4940120	4940760	Alright, take care.
4940780	4941421	Happy Mother's Day.
4941441	4941701	Bye.
4941721	4942721	Bye, friend.
4942741	4943482	Bye.
4944342	4945503	Did she say, bye, friend?
4946984	4947544	I think she did.
4947584	4948824	I think she's like, bye, friend.
4949445	4950145	She said, friends.
4950545	4951266	Oh, bye, friends.
4951606	4951706	Yeah.
4951726	4952806	That had nothing to do with me.
4952846	4953627	I like your mom.
4953687	4954347	I know, she's funny.
4954507	4955848	I've met your mom in person.
4956068	4959250	I like your mom, too, because the whole... Why don't we call my mom next week?
4960130	4961051	We just might have to.
4961191	4963132	Or maybe, you know... Who knows?
4963152	4964352	It might be her birthday or something.
4964853	4965913	My mom's birthday's in November.
4966113	4966814	Oh, it's a ways off.
4967334	4967594	We'll see.
4968010	4968732	My mom's going to be 49.
4968772	4968812	No, 48.
4968852	4969393	My mom's going to be 49.
4976150	4980971	I keep forgetting, this is actually part of the podcast, so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?
4981311	4983452	However, I would like to see, I do have a request.
4983492	4991954	Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviewed, rejected last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss or whatever it was, like iTunes was rejecting the word piss.
4992454	4998036	Maybe you guys want to say, this show is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.
4998236	4998556	I don't know.
4998756	4999336	That would be great.
4999676	5000416	My mom would like that.
5000436	5001997	I could show it to her and she'd be like, what?
5002017	5002617	I don't get it.
5003237	5003597	So there you go.
5004298	5004558	All right.
5004838	5006119	Anyhow, we've got to wrap it up.
5006179	5007480	Any last-minute stories for real?
5010582	5010722	No.
5011522	5011782	All right.
5011842	5012623	Nothing from you, Loki?
5013503	5014084	I'm surprised.
5015084	5016545	He's distracted by the interwebs.
5016605	5016825	I know.
5016845	5018206	What are you doing on the Internet?
5019367	5019927	Stuff.
5020327	5020648	All right.
5021188	5023129	Crisis Core coming out in Japan September 13th.
5023229	5024090	There you go.
5024290	5024590	There you go.
5025137	5028018	All right, well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5028439	5031420	Shane, thank you for being on the show, even though you never say anything.
5031460	5033741	But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.
5034281	5035342	It's always funny.
5035422	5036743	All right, so your final thoughts, Shane?
5040404	5040845	I don't know.
5041985	5042505	All right, thanks.
5042685	5043226	Thanks for sharing.
5043686	5045227	All right, Loki, your final thought?
5047368	5049889	Stupid postage is going up to 41 cents tomorrow.
5051658	5054679	My final thought is zombie movie Shane.
5054699	5055899	We're going to be fun.
5056219	5057339	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5060600	5064120	I have ice cream at home that's low sugar and I can eat it.
5065741	5070782	I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday because I was having a bad day and I didn't eat that.
5071362	5072282	But it was really good.
5072562	5073742	So don't point at my fat.
5074602	5074862	All right.
5075062	5077943	I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run when it's in the theater.
5078263	5078583	All right.
