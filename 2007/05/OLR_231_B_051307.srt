3
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:19,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

5
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:40,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's get right back into some video game news.

6
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:42,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, take it away.

7
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:10,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That, you know, that's not surprising.

8
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since, you know, Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think, and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the problem I would have with the Zune marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present, I don't know a single person with a Zune.

10
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:26,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.

11
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:27,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing, though.

12
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to, like, the Zune.

13
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:35,056
[SPEAKER_02]: They just limit it to, you know, just not just the Zune, but, like,

14
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft products.

15
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your... I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.

16
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say I read something about this.

17
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:53,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee...

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:08,669
[SPEAKER_15]: I think something like, in the story it says something like if you pay a type of subscription fee and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have, but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.

19
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Napster, it's like Napster.

20
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this, they're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months.

21
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:16,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, there's a price break after three months.

22
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:17,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, no, there isn't.

23
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a price break at all.

24
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

25
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.

26
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever per thing, or do, like, a subscription.

27
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: The Napster model.

28
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:32,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

29
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:33,935
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do a virtual console.

30
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

31
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:36,237
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

32
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:41,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,360
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're trying.

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,641
[SPEAKER_15]: They've made a lot of improvements.

35
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:47,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?

36
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:50,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

37
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:50,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that work?

38
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:52,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it might be a good competition for Netflix.

39
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, that's funny that you mention Netflix.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft Marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.

41
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:04,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

42
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:08,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're going to be able to download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.

43
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:20,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I heard a rumor that my cousin's sister's friend's uncle's person who works for Microsoft said that he sucked.

44
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:32,214
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live Marketplace as well.

45
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.

46
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?

47
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, I have.

48
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:40,597
[SPEAKER_15]: It is fucking disturbing.

49
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:42,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted.

50
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy Tree Friends False Alarm

51
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,160
[SPEAKER_15]: with Death Lovely

52
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Vintage Collection for the Xbox 360 that

53
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:04,856
[SPEAKER_06]: among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.

54
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Ages for the PlayStation 2?

55
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:21,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to mention also that they later found out that it, or it's confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.

56
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Goddamn internet liars!

57
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:30,314
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Ages compilation, like the Sega Ages 2900.

58
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I've got a few of those games.

59
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,896
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?

60
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:38,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't mind something like that, if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

61
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:42,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, yeah, something like what you said there, where you could just have all of them on one disc.

62
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.

63
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, a lot.

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want Planet Harrier.

65
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,760
[SPEAKER_15]: A good chunk of them.

66
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Planet Harrier.

67
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,082
[SPEAKER_15]: And they could just release the game, and they could call it this.

68
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember when Sega was good?

69
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,297
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what they could call the game.

70
00:05:58,637 --> 00:05:59,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would sell millions of copies.

71
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.

72
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Sega ages.

73
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,000
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

74
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:06,342
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the selling point right there.

75
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember when Sega was good?

76
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:09,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

77
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do remember when Crackdown was good.

78
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was good today.

79
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because I had the new download pack.

80
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's awesome.

81
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:23,512
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were some complications as there normally is with a lot of these download packs.

82
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it was resetting some of the game's progress.

83
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.

84
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find out that your save game's gone.

85
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopsie.

86
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're working on a fix for it right now.

87
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:46,814
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.

88
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:47,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real quick.

89
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:50,295
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is get the brand new update.

90
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:51,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will be coming out.

91
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:53,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crash.

92
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:55,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the update to the game.

93
00:06:56,895 --> 00:07:00,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.

94
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:03,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.

95
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And just reboot it, and you're good to go.

96
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I recommend doing that.

97
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.

98
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:14,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But the download content is fucking awesome.

99
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Free or paid.

100
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, you've got to get it.

101
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:22,552
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I have ever played Crackdown Co-op, so I should be okay, right?

102
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:24,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be fine.

103
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:28,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.

104
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And then go back into it and you can play it again.

105
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:39,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played a co-op on the Keys to the City mode, actually the land, so that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.

106
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you're probably safe on.

107
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:48,376
[SPEAKER_02]: But just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.

108
00:07:48,871 --> 00:08:01,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they really, really, really need to release now is like an instant replay saver or something like that where you can create your own movies because with all this extra crap that they threw in there, there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.

109
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:03,424
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

110
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:08,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Ross Steele, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemonster.com says, Crackdown Co-op is overrated.

111
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,170
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't even have to really play together.

112
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,671
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think?

113
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,252
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you say to that?

114
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

115
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:33,754
[SPEAKER_15]: BOMBERMAN ACT 0

116
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:58,104
[SPEAKER_15]: DeathJunior, BrookTown, and...

117
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:24,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.

119
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that after Bomberman 94?

120
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,193
[SPEAKER_15]: On a turbo?

121
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe so.

122
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:03,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomberman 94 was really good, but it was still, I think, the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.

123
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:08,558
[SPEAKER_06]: With the multi-tap.

124
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So just take that and make it online playable.

125
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,841
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

126
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,883
[SPEAKER_15]: No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?

127
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.

128
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,990
[SPEAKER_06]: However, and you know, it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.

129
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,011
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I hate ads!

130
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:31,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop putting Flash ads on your site, you stupid buttheads.

131
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they gotta make money somehow.

132
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Delete.

133
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Crapheads.

134
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:37,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

135
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:47,185
[SPEAKER_06]: In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.

136
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:54,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.

137
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,141
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's what I've heard.

138
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,982
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.

139
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:06,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.

140
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?

141
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

142
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:11,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there you go.

143
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,587
[SPEAKER_15]: No point in me downloading this because I don't have that.

144
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'll give it a try, because I've been interested in it.

145
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I played the Xbox 360 demo.

146
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:22,814
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.

147
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:25,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's hope.

148
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:28,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

149
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:33,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June, Spore.

150
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.

151
00:11:37,410 --> 00:12:03,583
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA and of course their fiscal year ends March 31st 2008 so gotta wait more for this game but you know what though I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up

152
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.

153
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,793
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't look like that much more to go.

154
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:09,953
[SPEAKER_15]: It looked pretty cool to me.

155
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.

156
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.

157
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:31,709
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, start us off.

158
00:12:55,536 --> 00:13:03,698
[SPEAKER_06]: A few of the wheat goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which, for anyone who's on into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.

159
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:10,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it pops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.

160
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

161
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:21,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm pissed off at... I don't know, at the fact that Grantha thought a four's not out yet.

162
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:23,343
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes me sad, but...

163
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:46,781
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU of the week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft I hope you all die in a fire Like I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it and it hasn't been doing a damn thing Spammers are still getting through with all their tells I hope they all die a lot I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs Miklatov, anything you have for FU of the week?

164
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:54,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to FU to drama but I'm actually just going to say no I have nothing

165
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:58,732
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're saying FU without saying FU?

166
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of, but not so much.

167
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.

168
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:04,594
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

169
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cryptic there.

170
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:11,596
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a short FU of the week segment.

171
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,697
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight.

172
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody seems to be pretty happy.

173
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:20,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, this is some interesting news here.

174
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:30,155
[SPEAKER_15]: And I should clarify this, is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story, so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.

175
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:37,621
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.

176
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:39,983
[SPEAKER_15]: So in other words, you know, and then

177
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:48,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, you know, well, the Elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

178
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:55,630
[SPEAKER_15]: But to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data, and not even the newest data.

179
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,450
[SPEAKER_15]: So, there you have it.

180
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:04,392
[SPEAKER_15]: But of course, this is just going to say, you know, about, this is a whole price war that's going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

181
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:05,992
[SPEAKER_15]: So, there you go.

182
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:07,433
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

183
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:08,293
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I got.

184
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Question things that you read on the internet.

185
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I question everything that I read on the internet.

186
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And I question what the intelligence of this is.

187
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:23,299
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360.

188
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, first of all, it looks stupid.

189
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the color yellow so damn much.

190
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, if I wanted Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.

191
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:36,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

192
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:37,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

193
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:38,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, I thought it looked kind of neat.

194
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, nobody else has one.

195
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:53,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah, to tie in with the Simpsons movie released on July 27th.

196
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, whatever.

197
00:15:58,451 --> 00:15:59,412
[SPEAKER_15]: But you're a collector.

198
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you want one of these anyway?

199
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:02,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I collect things that don't suck ass.

200
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:04,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

201
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:06,333
[SPEAKER_15]: See if I care.

202
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:09,899
[SPEAKER_15]: If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.

203
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this, of course, is all tied into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.

204
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game looks fucking awesome.

205
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on pretty much every platform.

206
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, all the next-gen platforms or current-gen, however you want to call them.

207
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:30,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2, and PSP.

208
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:34,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just pretty awesome.

209
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the storyline revolves around them

210
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

211
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?

212
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.

213
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,586
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like episodes, basically, so there's 16 levels in the game.

214
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.

215
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there were posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island, stuff like that.

216
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,317
[SPEAKER_15]: That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.

217
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:27,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be neat.

218
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be pretty awesome.

219
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, two-player co-op.

220
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:33,689
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to go over live?

221
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:42,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system, but I think you might be able to do it over live as well.

222
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:48,680
[SPEAKER_15]: GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead, but that's made by Activision.

223
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Medal of Homer.

224
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:54,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Might get me to play one of those war games finally, though.

225
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Medal of Homer.

226
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:55,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Medal of Homer.

227
00:17:56,114 --> 00:18:23,572
[SPEAKER_15]: of course the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial you might remember back in the day when it was first out like those shirts that said eat my shorts that were banned from school and stuff well of course always a source of controversy is the game ratings system and the ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings and 85% use them regularly when buying games

228
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:28,216
[SPEAKER_15]: That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.

229
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,498
[SPEAKER_15]: So kind of interesting there.

230
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:31,899
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

231
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:38,064
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, but of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game's safe for me.

232
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And the parent just kind of listens to that.

233
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:40,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know.

234
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:44,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.

235
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,290
[SPEAKER_15]: 90% of parents know about the system.

236
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:50,933
[SPEAKER_15]: The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.

237
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:51,734
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

238
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:57,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's one thing, though, between, you know, knowing about it and understanding how it's used.

239
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:57,584
[SPEAKER_15]: True.

240
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,607
[SPEAKER_06]: But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.

241
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:16,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.

242
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that, you know,

243
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:23,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.

244
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that you, Miklatov?

245
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:26,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you do that?

246
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:32,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?

247
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:35,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, because I live in Europe.

248
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,781
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.

249
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,422
[SPEAKER_15]: It's healthy.

250
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:48,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say, and that time was one of them.

251
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:50,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Go back to playing with Hellmonkey.

252
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Hellmonkey.

253
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:52,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

254
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

255
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:05,048
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a list of features that it's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.

256
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:08,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.

257
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:12,353
[SPEAKER_02]: You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.

258
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.

259
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:16,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks pretty awesome.

260
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:17,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

261
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.

262
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:28,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already friggin' even talked about already.

263
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,570
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 days after the date, when it comes out, and I don't know.

264
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:32,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

265
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:33,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hooray!

266
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:36,114
[SPEAKER_15]: You can rate me with microtransactions and Bomberman.

267
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:36,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so excited.

268
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

269
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.

270
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,042
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that

271
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.

272
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know.

273
00:20:55,895 --> 00:21:02,078
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from a, uh, forum post to, uh, this website, Eacoustics.

274
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:08,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's, I guess, uh, 2chan in, uh, Japan.

275
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:09,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

276
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:10,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

277
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:15,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?

278
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but here's the thing, though.

279
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:23,374
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.

280
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:29,038
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.

281
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,082
[SPEAKER_02]: They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.

282
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:40,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so...

283
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:42,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Not gonna happen yet.

284
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.

285
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:53,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war, because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player.

286
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:54,267
[SPEAKER_15]: That's gonna make me sad.

287
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Betamax before, people bought Betamax.

288
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,211
[SPEAKER_15]: It must run in my family, my parents had a Betamax.

289
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:00,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Laser discs?

290
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,893
[SPEAKER_15]: That I didn't have, but she had it.

291
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have them, I still watch them.

292
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:09,965
[SPEAKER_11]: You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.

293
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:10,766
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

294
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,347
[SPEAKER_11]: That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.

295
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:17,611
[SPEAKER_15]: You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point.

296
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,931
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it's been confirmed since then.

297
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:24,055
[SPEAKER_15]: But when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it.

298
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,476
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to buy an HD DVD player.

299
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I want one for the exact same reason.

300
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care about anything else.

301
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:33,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.

302
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:37,863
[SPEAKER_15]: and AnswerRawSteelUT in chat who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.

303
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:38,663
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

304
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:39,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Heroes.

305
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:41,084
[SPEAKER_15]: HD DVD won the war.

306
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:42,764
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to have Heroes in HD.

307
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.

308
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:47,645
[SPEAKER_15]: What am I going to do all summer?

309
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:48,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

310
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:49,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Watch Battlestar?

311
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:52,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.

312
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,106
[SPEAKER_15]: It did for me.

313
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's one person.

314
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:56,507
[SPEAKER_15]: It might come out on Blu-ray later.

315
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:02,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Laserdisc didn't win the war either, so... Well, fuck you, Advent... Fuck you!

316
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Advent Children's coming out.

317
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:06,076
[SPEAKER_02]: The Director's Cut's coming out on Blu-ray only.

318
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,218
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Advent Children?

319
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I care because... It's fucking awesome.

320
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Little Spirits Within Me coming out too.

321
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopee!

322
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:15,503
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't care about that.

323
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:17,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market.

324
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:19,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So it didn't necessarily die.

325
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:19,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Of nerds.

326
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and they're actually still releasing Laserdiscs.

327
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:22,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

328
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:23,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

329
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Two companies are.

330
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they had, like, that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this, Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars?

331
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:36,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine what would happen, the kind of damage you could do with a laser disc if you threw it at somebody?

332
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:37,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

333
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,591
[SPEAKER_15]: But dead platforms still get support all the time.

334
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:44,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, one of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.

335
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,215
[SPEAKER_15]: 5200, I think.

336
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is it 5200?

337
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:47,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

338
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:48,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

339
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.

340
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have some happy news.

341
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,620
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

342
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:58,854
[SPEAKER_06]: For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.

343
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:13,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days, was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.

344
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:18,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.

345
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it

346
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:26,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.

347
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Fangirlgasm.

348
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily, I just think it's good quality work.

349
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

350
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:36,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The only disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.

351
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

352
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:39,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That was disappointing.

353
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, they should just do some original animation, you know, just release some actual stuff.

354
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:55,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies and the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.

355
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Video game purists will probably hate it.

356
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:08,078
[SPEAKER_15]: The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel.

357
00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:08,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell no!

358
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:16,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Funny enough, Kira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role, and both of them passed.

359
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:23,126
[SPEAKER_15]: But Jessica Biel, because, you know, she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.

360
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,327
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they got the sex right.

361
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.

362
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: What's her face from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?

363
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:36,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, um, um, Zhang Ji?

364
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

365
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

366
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:41,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they just have her play, like, fucking Cammy or something?

367
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,418
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that would make sense.

368
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:44,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind, this is just a rumor.

369
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Kylie Minogue, he's a player again!

370
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

371
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,323
[SPEAKER_06]: She did, in the old... I know, I know.

372
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:50,364
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she played, um, Cammy?

373
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:51,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

374
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:51,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

375
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,247
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know who should play Chun-Li?

376
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:53,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Who?

377
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Ching Chong.

378
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:56,290
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

379
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:03,035
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays, like, the... No, I'm just making a rake.

380
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,838
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Chao Chang, stupid!

381
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:11,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie City Hunter was more accurate than Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.

382
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:42,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I'm not going to say that, you know, Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, you know, scantily clad, you know, would not be a draw for me to see his movie, but... What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene, like in the Japanese one?

383
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That would never happen, but that'd be hot.

384
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:49,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.

385
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:53,255
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.

386
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:57,336
[SPEAKER_15]: I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

387
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:58,657
[SPEAKER_15]: You know that chick?

388
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That was her name.

389
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.

390
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft says Kylie Minogue rocks.

391
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:05,656
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

392
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,780
[SPEAKER_15]: SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?

393
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alba, Keira Knightley.

394
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:16,865
[SPEAKER_15]: They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.

395
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I can never pronounce that guy's name.

396
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:19,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeter.

397
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:26,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would be really awful is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for the movie.

398
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:27,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be awful.

399
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:58,975
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la Around the world, street fighting, la la la la Maybe I should play Chun-Li RuPaul as Chun-Li I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere Wison Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass

400
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:06,903
[SPEAKER_15]: JV Mon says Rob could be E-Honda Are you saying I'm fat?

401
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:07,724
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you trying to say?

402
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:30,737
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ DarkNate says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3 Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li It could be Sanjaya from American Idol And GS68, as long as Loki is Tingle As long as Loki plays Tingle Anyways

403
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:33,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Guitar Hero.

404
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the 80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer, July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister, I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist, not covers, Round and Round, as made famous by R.A.T.,

405
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow Mental Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio And the Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia

406
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:23,070
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're Not Gonna Take It?

407
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:24,131
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you do that?

408
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,172
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be an Unlocked song.

409
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:38,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Or even the song, remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly, yeah, Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're gonna burn in hell!

410
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,404
[SPEAKER_15]: That was awesome.

411
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:41,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry.

412
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:45,728
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, why that random-ass Twisted Sister song?

413
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,149
[SPEAKER_02]: These are only, you know...

414
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,848
[SPEAKER_02]: 7 songs that have been announced yet.

415
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, it's going to be, you know, there's going to be more songs in there.

416
00:29:54,651 --> 00:30:00,815
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you're wondering, it is only going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, at least as a disc.

417
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,776
[SPEAKER_02]: 360, get ready for another download!

418
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:03,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Woohoo!

419
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have the facts to back that up?

420
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:06,659
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a rumor.

421
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only coming out on PlayStation 2, as a disc.

422
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, alright.

423
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:14,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.

424
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:16,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Or just unannounced.

425
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:17,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.

426
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,411
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's going to be a download pack.

427
00:30:45,963 --> 00:31:13,531
[SPEAKER_15]: or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap as much as I hate ACDC I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell I can't stand that fucking guy's voice never did like it alright but a game I could stand was Saints Row that was actually kind of fun and if you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row sucks to be you it just got canned but there is a silver lining to the story Saints Row 2 is in development right now and it's coming out on the Playstation 3

428
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,478
[SPEAKER_15]: and the Xbox 360.

429
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,319
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.

430
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:22,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.

431
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.

432
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:31,582
[SPEAKER_15]: The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment into a larger installed base next year.

433
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,582
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.

434
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:36,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So in other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1

435
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.

436
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:41,678
[SPEAKER_15]: I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it.

437
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or Crackdown.

438
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

439
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:51,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.

440
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it sucks, in which case it'll come out right afterwards.

441
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:57,116
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually not a bad decision, though.

442
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:58,017
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

443
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.

444
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:13,583
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com and DarkSakura likes to dive into the mail bag head first and land on pavement apparently and pull out some of her favorite emails.

445
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:17,664
[SPEAKER_15]: So, DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?

446
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck everybody.

447
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:20,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't got a single damn email.

448
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck it.

449
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:29,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I should say, just, there was some spam, and there was a couple... The spam is squishy, and we had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.

450
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:34,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were, like, a couple random emails that were, like, other types of inquiries that aren't really suitable for on-air.

451
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, nothing!

452
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Rob, what color are your underwear?

453
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,815
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on-air, probably.

454
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:44,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Dark Tansy has said it.

455
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:45,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Pool's closed.

456
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:46,598
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, green.

457
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,520
[SPEAKER_06]: What the... Okay, whatever.

458
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:50,901
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

459
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:52,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm married, butthead.

460
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:56,607
[SPEAKER_15]: What, are they just starting to ask questions in chat?

461
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,890
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

462
00:32:58,382 --> 00:32:59,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing some chat booting.

463
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:32,209
[SPEAKER_15]: But ever since January of 2005, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting a readable email.

464
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,030
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very strange, isn't it?

465
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:40,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one in French.

466
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know the good news is now, I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.

467
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone email me in French.

468
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,117
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

469
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:48,239
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, here we go.

470
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,540
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my best French impersonation, by the way.

471
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:51,641
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well.

472
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:52,461
[SPEAKER_15]: That was horrible.

473
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, as most of my accents are.

474
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:54,983
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

475
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.

476
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.

477
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:00,804
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

478
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is kind of stupid.

479
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:05,046
[SPEAKER_06]: My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.

480
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:13,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our birthday party next month, right?

481
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?

482
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:19,493
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.

483
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock.

484
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,655
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm going to dress as a police constable and go around arresting my co-workers.

485
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:29,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Lovely.

486
00:34:30,956 --> 00:34:31,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have fun with that?

487
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:32,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Or has it happened yet?

488
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:33,657
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's next month.

489
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:34,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Pics, please.

490
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:35,658
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

491
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.

492
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,301
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a phone call on our Skype line.

493
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:46,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live.

494
00:34:46,703 --> 00:34:48,104
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll take your calls in a minute here.

495
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:52,686
[SPEAKER_15]: But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.

496
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:55,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Chris Amegzi went to ASIN.

497
00:34:55,558 --> 00:35:00,280
[SPEAKER_15]: and Megzi actually had an artist table because some folks actually asked saying like, hey, I never found Chris and Megzi.

498
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Where were they at the con?

499
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzi is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.

500
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.

501
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:05,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

502
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:06,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And she had an artist table.

503
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:07,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Megzi had an artist table.

504
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:07,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she did.

505
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:09,223
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where she spent most of the con.

506
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:13,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the art room, that's how you missed it.

507
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:14,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And Chris was doing it too.

508
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:20,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so Chris apparently went around and whored out the show, but she says that in her voice message, which we're going to listen to right now.

509
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.

510
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:32,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Rob, Jamie, and Matt, this is Chris over at ASIN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

511
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:37,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well.

512
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to time constraints, a lot, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.

513
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:53,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The pimping out has not been going according to plan.

514
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:58,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.

515
00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did, my phone kept dying.

516
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including a game room.

517
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:11,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, both of which, my cell phone reception did not work.

518
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:17,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So, obviously, this entire trip has been one big mess of blah for me.

519
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I'm now losing my voice.

520
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:23,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I think I should give you guys the scope anyway.

521
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you who are interested in going to ASUN in 2000... Oops, messed up.

522
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:34,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you who are interested at all going to ASUN and are looking for games, there's lots of things to do here.

523
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The dealer room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.

524
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:42,034
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of... What are those things called?

525
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:45,756
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the dating sims.

526
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:46,797
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of those.

527
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:49,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of yaoi weapons for those fine girls.

528
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,604
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which again, I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.

529
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't had the time.

530
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,128
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also card games for people.

531
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:06,272
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters and all that fun stuff.

532
00:37:07,073 --> 00:37:11,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.

533
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:14,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This entire trip actually was paid for me.

534
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

535
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:47,993
[SPEAKER_04]: My Live Journal at Disney Punk 10.

536
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can try to get a hold from DarkSakura.

537
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:53,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, I have tried.

538
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pimping out your show, I swear.

539
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says Orange Lounge Radio for Gamers or something like that.

540
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:05,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what I put on it.

541
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:07,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I printed those out at work.

542
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:12,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.

543
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.

544
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.

545
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:20,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.

546
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year, you guys got to give me some good promos.

547
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it looks impressive than the shit that I have.

548
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but anyway, this has been Chris at ASUN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

549
00:38:35,954 --> 00:38:37,375
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been your Roaming Lesbian.

550
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to you, Rob.

551
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:40,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to you, Jamie.

552
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to you, Matt.

553
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's role, asshole.

554
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,591
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go, Chris, semi-live at ASEN there.

555
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,113
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta love Chris, she's so fine.

556
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:54,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that she's adopted, she's kind of adopted the title of the roving lesbian of OLR, it's great.

557
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:56,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And Max Rule, asshole, did you catch that?

558
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: They rule the land of sucking.

559
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:01,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

560
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:05,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate their commercials too, because now he's like, see, the commercials said they're better, so they are.

561
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

562
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:08,629
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

563
00:39:24,716 --> 00:39:27,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Pompous little fucking cars is what they are

564
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:41,163
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of cool.

565
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:45,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN and who knows, maybe next year if it's in the OLR budget, we'll go.

566
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:47,867
[SPEAKER_15]: But for now, we have Fonamay to look forward to.

567
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area, you've got to go to Fonamay.

568
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,011
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend and OLR is going to be there Saturday.

569
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:59,254
[SPEAKER_15]: And since we're only doing one panel this year, it's in the works.

570
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:06,298
[SPEAKER_15]: This won't be live, boys and girls, but we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

571
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Friday night,

572
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:15,321
[SPEAKER_15]: at the secret, super secret suite that OLR will be at Friday night.

573
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,282
[SPEAKER_15]: The super secret suite?

574
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's our super secret suite 16.

575
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:22,945
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not the actually suite number, whatever suite it is.

576
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:27,468
[SPEAKER_15]: The biggest, the most number of drunk, because it's going to be at a con, so everybody's going to be there.

577
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:29,509
[SPEAKER_15]: The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

578
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just don't have the equipment to make that happen.

579
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:37,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I could take my Mac out there, but Loki would find a way to fuck it all up, so there you go.

580
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:38,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I could take my

581
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:39,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-MAC.

582
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:20,682
[SPEAKER_15]: by the way unfortunately that won't be live either we won't be live that weekend but you can come see us tape live in person that's pretty awesome and we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again we had some really good questions last year someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac hating thing that's always a good sign I don't care okay I don't care

583
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even really hate them anymore.

584
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:25,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

585
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't buy them.

586
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you like them.

587
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

588
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

589
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:30,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care.

590
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:36,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop asking me why I don't like them because I don't have legitimate reasons.

591
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:37,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them.

592
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm racist against Max.

593
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:42,377
[SPEAKER_15]: She doesn't like the color yellow.

594
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't like Max.

595
00:41:43,238 --> 00:41:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

596
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm racist against Max.

597
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:46,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no reason for it.

598
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,940
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.

599
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're crappy computers.

600
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:53,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.

601
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,483
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your opinion, awesome.

602
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:58,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them, either way.

603
00:41:58,524 --> 00:41:59,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?

604
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:00,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

605
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:03,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so...

606
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.

607
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not very surprising at all.

608
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:11,329
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, apparently Playboy's coming to Second Life.

609
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, well, what took them so long?

610
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Since, um, you know, I want to say that most of Second Life anyways is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.

611
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:22,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.

612
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life and, uh, no real word of what's going to happen.

613
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently you're going to be able to participate either as a centerfold or

614
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's staring at centerfolds.

615
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:38,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?

616
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly, I don't know.

617
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft also entered Second Life.

618
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:46,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say Final Fantasy VII's been recreated in Second Life.

619
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:51,232
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I hate to sound morbid, but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.

620
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:52,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he's not getting any younger.

621
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:57,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so interested to see how CNN's going to handle it when he passes.

622
00:42:58,015 --> 00:43:00,436
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?

623
00:43:02,472 --> 00:43:06,554
[SPEAKER_15]: He was an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.

624
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:07,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

625
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.

626
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven chicks at one time.

627
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:16,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.

628
00:43:16,058 --> 00:43:16,978
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the fountain of youth.

629
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:19,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Suddenly all the young kids still want to do you.

630
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if there's one person that in this world needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.

631
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:26,423
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I take that back.

632
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:27,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Barker.

633
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.

634
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:32,045
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Hugh bot and the Bob bot.

635
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Barker, he cannot die.

636
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The Barker Bot.

637
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,861
[SPEAKER_02]: He's retiring this year.

638
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:37,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening.

639
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:39,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

640
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:40,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad too.

641
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

642
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Robot.

643
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:46,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone kill him before he decides to retire and we'll resurrect him as a robot and he'll never know the difference.

644
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,246
[SPEAKER_02]: He will think it's his first year doing the show.

645
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:51,667
[SPEAKER_02]: He will not be tired of it.

646
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:52,188
[SPEAKER_15]: You know.

647
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:54,969
[SPEAKER_02]: He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.

648
00:43:55,129 --> 00:43:57,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Rumor is because Rosie's leaving The View.

649
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.

650
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, uh, no.

651
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, come on down!

652
00:44:09,264 --> 00:44:10,824
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're gonna eat me!

653
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:13,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?

654
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:14,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't Wing Martindale die?

655
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:15,847
[SPEAKER_15]: No, is he still alive?

656
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:16,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

657
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:18,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Some famous game show always dies.

658
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:20,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one from Pressure Lock.

659
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.

660
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:24,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, uh, whatever his name, Peter DeMarkin.

661
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:26,291
[SPEAKER_15]: He was in a plane wreck or something.

662
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:27,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Boy, this show's getting morbid.

663
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's open up the phones, shall we?

664
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,370
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to give us a call and comment on anything from the show tonight.

665
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.

666
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:42,272
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR Or, remember that number is only toll free in the US.

667
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:43,292
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Lamar Burton?

668
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:44,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamar Burton?

669
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:45,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamar Burton, yeah.

670
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:46,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Lamar Burton?

671
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:48,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know his name.

672
00:44:48,273 --> 00:44:51,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.

673
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:52,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Why him?

674
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:54,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never seen him hosting a show.

675
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,790
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't have a say in this.

676
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,010
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

677
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

678
00:44:58,431 --> 00:44:59,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

00:44:59,312 --> 00:44:59,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

680
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:39,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Legend of Saku Hi, Legend of Saku Chewbacca, he could totally host the show It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000 I've never played that yodeling game Yes, I love the yodeling game, the game's fucking right You know, I went to see The Price is Right live a couple years ago We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork I know you have something you want to say, Zaku, but I'm going to talk for a minute Yeah, go ahead About nothing game-related

681
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:45,596
[SPEAKER_15]: I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy and gets away with it, like, in public, nonetheless.

682
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:48,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, she wore that fucking swan dress, but here's the thing.

683
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,225
[SPEAKER_15]: When I saw her at Coachella, like, this was, what, like, 2002 or 2003, I want to say, is when we went.

684
00:45:54,801 --> 00:46:04,227
[SPEAKER_15]: She wore a Venus flytrap outfit, and it was awesome, because, like, it was closed for most of it, but then during one of her songs, it opened up, and she was like a Venus flytrap.

685
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,989
[SPEAKER_15]: She's so fucking hardcore.

686
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:07,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that was, like, the best weekend ever.

687
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,612
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Bjork in a Venus flytrap outfit, and Price is Right.

688
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:12,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great weekend.

689
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:12,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a good time.

690
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:15,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Zaku, you had something gaming-related you wanted to mention?

691
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:17,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just pulling through Dick right now.

692
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:24,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see that, uh, that Sony's about to announce a new PS3 firmware update.

693
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:26,279
[SPEAKER_15]: A new PS3 firmware update.

694
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:27,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, this is on Dig right now?

695
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

696
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:29,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Right this second?

697
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:30,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait.

698
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:31,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be fooled.

699
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:36,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an announcement of announcements, so... That's what... Yeah, Loki's right.

700
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,309
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking... Oh, this is from PSU.com.

701
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that their official underground site?

702
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is this a... Oh, I don't know.

703
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:44,612
[SPEAKER_15]: There's too... You know what?

704
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:47,334
[SPEAKER_15]: There's too damn many game blogs out there on the internet right now.

705
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:48,555
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to somehow put a cap.

706
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:49,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

707
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:54,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are basically, they're biased towards either console.

708
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:58,716
[SPEAKER_15]: You see Kotaku's more anti-Sony, you know, at certain times, and then, I don't know, Joystick is almost the same thing.

709
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, actually, no.

710
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:18,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Joystick is more pro-Nintendo, if I recall correctly.

711
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:25,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though, because they tried to screw them over because Kotaku was saying something, you know, legitimate.

712
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:29,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff we don't want you to.

713
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:31,352
[SPEAKER_11]: You're banned from everything now.

714
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:36,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

715
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:40,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like a certain other business I'm thinking of, a Namco, but we won't go there.

716
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow.

717
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:43,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

718
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:43,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoops.

719
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:50,991
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just added stuff that, I don't know, should have been there, but I can see why they left it out initially.

720
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:56,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboys saying, oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.

721
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,094
[SPEAKER_00]: You could access the XMB in-game.

722
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:15,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how you can access the dashboard on 360 in-game as well.

723
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:15,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

724
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:18,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

725
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,591
[SPEAKER_00]: They said stuff about in-game music as well.

726
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:24,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep mode.

727
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:28,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can link you right now, but it's a whole bunch of settings.

728
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:32,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried pulling it up on Dig, but obviously everybody's hammering the site, so it's broken.

729
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:34,894
[SPEAKER_15]: But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.

730
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:38,395
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.

731
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,889
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an equalizer in the music.

732
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:46,573
[SPEAKER_15]: There's photo settings, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 settings, RSS channel settings is now an option.

733
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I'll be hopping to OLR on your PS3.

734
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:55,578
[SPEAKER_15]: More slideshow stuff for the photos, more visualization for music.

735
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:58,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks like you can do some other things with video.

736
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,661
[SPEAKER_15]: You can do some zoom-ins and stuff.

737
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:04,684
[SPEAKER_15]: The cross-media bar is now accessible during gameplay, like you said.

738
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:06,840
[SPEAKER_15]: RSS Channel is added as a feature.

739
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,460
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

740
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,201
[SPEAKER_15]: That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3 pretty soon.

741
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:14,984
[SPEAKER_15]: You can now have multiple chat sessions and you can select an image to use as your avatar from the photo.

742
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:18,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So it sounds like a pretty big update.

743
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:18,845
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty cool.

744
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:19,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

745
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:21,807
[SPEAKER_00]: It's catching up to 360.

746
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:24,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.

747
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:26,749
[SPEAKER_15]: It's funny you phrase it that way.

748
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,990
[SPEAKER_15]: It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?

749
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:40,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.

750
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:42,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that even exist?

751
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:46,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the custom soundtracks like on Xbox 360?

752
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:46,921
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

753
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:47,801
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't own a PS3.

754
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:49,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you do custom soundtracks?

755
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:49,823
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't, right?

756
00:49:49,843 --> 00:49:50,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

757
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so.

758
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:53,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it depends on the game.

759
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:56,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

760
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Folks in chat are saying no.

761
00:49:59,406 --> 00:50:08,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, once Sony, you know, Sony has a lot of work to do in order to win, in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.

762
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:14,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have to add Rumble, lower the price, get some really good games out because right now they're in a drought.

763
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that they're the only ones, but, you know, the Wii is also in a drought right now.

764
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:22,763
[SPEAKER_15]: They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.

765
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:24,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, that's true.

766
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:26,386
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I said.

767
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,208
[SPEAKER_00]: A price cut would do just that.

768
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:28,788
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

769
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:30,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else, Zaku?

770
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:33,123
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to get going to another call, but any other last stuff you want to get in here?

771
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:34,904
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.

772
00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:36,264
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's kind of sore.

773
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.

774
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:39,466
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

775
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:40,386
[SPEAKER_15]: See you soon, buddy.

776
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:41,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Less than a month before I come to New York.

777
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:42,948
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

778
00:50:42,968 --> 00:50:43,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Later, dude.

779
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:43,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye-bye.

780
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:52,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.

781
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.

782
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:56,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the

783
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:59,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave and Buster's thing, although I don't think everybody can get in there, so I don't know.

784
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe pizza?

785
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:01,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

786
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:03,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm up for ideas.

787
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's start a forum thread or something.

788
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:06,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

789
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:06,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

790
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:08,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, guys?

791
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:10,421
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Rob D. Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?

792
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:11,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much.

793
00:51:11,642 --> 00:51:13,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.

794
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:14,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, of course.

795
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:15,144
[SPEAKER_15]: How was ASEN?

796
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:16,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, lots of fun.

797
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:17,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a blast.

798
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:19,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a lot of anime.

799
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:19,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of games.

800
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:24,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.

801
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy was dressed up as Frank West.

802
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:28,354
[SPEAKER_01]: He was carrying a surfboard head.

803
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:30,436
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

804
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:33,518
[SPEAKER_01]: He had his girlfriend who was also wearing a surfboard head.

805
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:37,761
[SPEAKER_01]: He held her hand the whole time and she didn't move unless he dragged her.

806
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:39,822
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

807
00:51:40,503 --> 00:51:43,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And two zombies with surfboard heads were chasing them the whole way through.

808
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:44,566
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty awesome.

809
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:49,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I like when people go all out with the game because I'm not really all about the anime.

810
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:51,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously we have a lot of folks here in studio that are really into anime.

811
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,511
[SPEAKER_15]: and I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.

812
00:51:55,551 --> 00:52:00,154
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really like when people bring more of the gaming into the anime cons through the cosplay and stuff.

813
00:52:00,194 --> 00:52:00,775
[SPEAKER_15]: That's always cool.

814
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:04,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Some interesting things happened too.

815
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:13,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a couple of the programming panels like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness and at one point a thousand people were singing the Segata Sanchiro theme song.

816
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:15,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

817
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:18,227
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get that many nerds in one place.

818
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:24,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell, which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials, bad anime, that sort of thing.

819
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:25,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

820
00:52:25,618 --> 00:52:26,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just, like, bad commercials.

821
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:32,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So they played, like, the full four minutes, Sega Tatsushiro, or theme song, with subtitles.

822
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:38,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of an easy core thing, so everyone started joining in the second, third, and fourth times they played it.

823
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, nerds, all of you.

824
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:43,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what types of, like, game room setups did they have?

825
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:45,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I noticed no anime con is complete without a game room.

826
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:46,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

827
00:52:46,517 --> 00:52:47,077
[SPEAKER_01]: King of Fighters 11.

828
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:17,260
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not really going to find Nadno8 at an anime con.

829
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

830
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the Parapara machine, it was great.

831
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:28,423
[SPEAKER_01]: There were probably about 15 people behind doing the motions themselves as people were playing the machine.

832
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:29,083
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

833
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:30,423
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of them were dudes?

834
00:53:33,404 --> 00:53:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.

835
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:40,586
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's funny because there used to be hella guys in Northern California who

836
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:52,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really do Parapara dancing, and then all those teams just fell apart, like instantly vaporized.

837
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:54,395
[SPEAKER_15]: It was something else.

838
00:53:55,336 --> 00:54:01,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff, and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.

839
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,757
[SPEAKER_15]: But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.

840
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:05,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, rock on, Sky.

841
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:07,978
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of tournaments...

842
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Turnips for just about every fighting game, every anime fighting game.

843
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:17,937
[SPEAKER_01]: There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.

844
00:54:18,938 --> 00:54:19,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I got killed in that one.

845
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:20,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

846
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:23,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So I entered five of them, somewhere around there.

847
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:27,063
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players, but people were still having fun.

848
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:30,925
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't too many people that were completely arrogant or cocky, which unfortunately can't happen.

849
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:36,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chatroom.

850
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

851
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.

852
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:40,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.

853
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:42,762
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.

854
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:44,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

855
00:54:45,004 --> 00:54:45,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't tell that story.

856
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:50,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say that some of my friends actually found a stranger in their hotel room when they woke up the next day.

857
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:57,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.

858
00:54:57,915 --> 00:55:00,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

859
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:01,458
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

860
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:02,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll leave it at that.

861
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:05,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Fanameh.

862
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:09,850
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an anime fan, I've got to say it's a great place to go to.

863
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:15,975
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan, you should probably go to that because there are a lot of people that know how to play the games.

864
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:17,256
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a lot of good matches there.

865
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:18,077
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

866
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:21,259
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.

867
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:23,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.

868
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:24,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

869
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:28,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thanks for the wrap-up, and I'm glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.

870
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:33,889
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys should call in next time with your report because obviously Chris had a hard time finding you guys or her cell phone wasn't working or something.

871
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,330
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

872
00:55:36,464 --> 00:55:37,726
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, take care, buddy.

873
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:38,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the call.

874
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:42,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?

875
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:43,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?

876
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I always do.

877
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:45,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

878
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:48,319
[SPEAKER_06]: The first place I go to is the message boards because I do cosplay.

879
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

880
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

881
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:49,881
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

882
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements on there and stuff.

883
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I'm going to do that at Fanime.

884
00:55:56,754 --> 00:56:06,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, the big thing is, at least this has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer, especially doing something from something you know other people are going to be doing, you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.

885
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, like the pictures that they all do.

886
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:09,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

887
00:56:09,837 --> 00:56:09,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

888
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:15,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also other groups meeting, like YaliCon had a bunch of Dolphy collectors getting together.

889
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:17,025
[SPEAKER_06]: and that type of thing.

890
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards or the site forums.

891
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:28,711
[SPEAKER_15]: So once we find out Ranma's room number, we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that says Naked Twister at 9pm in this room.

892
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:31,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

893
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:32,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

894
00:56:33,193 --> 00:56:33,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Raven's Dolphin!

895
00:56:34,194 --> 00:56:35,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin!

896
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:37,416
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on your mind?

897
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:38,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Raven's Dolphin!

898
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,857
[SPEAKER_15]: The We in the Lake story.

899
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:43,059
[SPEAKER_15]: The We in the Lake story, yes.

900
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:45,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I know many guys have taken a We in the Lake

901
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:47,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Wee in the Lake once or twice in their lives.

902
00:56:48,393 --> 00:56:50,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, the Nintendo Wee in the Lake.

903
00:56:50,154 --> 00:56:50,795
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up with that?

904
00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:51,716
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you have to say about that?

905
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:54,138
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I agree with the guy.

906
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:55,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Divorce is imminent.

907
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:58,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water and get my wee.

908
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:02,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you single, Raven Stolfen?

909
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:05,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

910
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:07,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.

911
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:12,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.

912
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:13,894
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

913
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:19,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hearing an echo, Ravenstaff, and you need to fix that echo.

914
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:20,472
[SPEAKER_15]: You've called into this show enough times.

915
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:21,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.

916
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:28,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so is that this guy's problem is that maybe he should have just married somebody who understood the game thing a little more in the first place?

917
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:30,058
[SPEAKER_15]: He should have married a gamer.

918
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:30,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I agree with that.

919
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And so is that what you're doing, Ravenstaff, and you're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?

920
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:36,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

921
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:41,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want her to understand about me and my gaming addiction, and she throws the Wii out.

922
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:42,406
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over.

923
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:43,683
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, though?

924
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: People do stupid things when they fight.

925
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:48,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, people smash car windows.

926
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:51,467
[SPEAKER_15]: They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.

927
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:53,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.

928
00:57:53,988 --> 00:58:01,331
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, they'll do – I mean, it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not because if she knew, like, hey, this is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.

929
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:04,353
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.

930
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:05,473
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's what she's going to do.

931
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:07,314
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

932
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,135
[SPEAKER_15]: You just have to marry someone who can keep their temper in check.

933
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:11,556
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

934
00:58:11,736 --> 00:58:12,116
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

935
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:13,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one more thing?

936
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:14,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, what's up?

937
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:19,865
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a little old, but I thought that the Situawada thing was hilarious.

938
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie, you're not selling enough.

939
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:23,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, sell more.

940
00:58:24,526 --> 00:58:25,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not following.

941
00:58:25,526 --> 00:58:26,186
[SPEAKER_15]: What was this news?

942
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:27,067
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while.

943
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:32,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he said it was about the Brain Age, and he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.

944
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:33,428
[SPEAKER_08]: In Europe, they sold 30,000.

945
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 Brain Age or 30,000 in Europe?

946
00:58:41,025 --> 00:58:41,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie's Invincible

947
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:11,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Reggie is a god among men.

948
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:12,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Reggie's invincible.

949
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:16,888
[SPEAKER_15]: But Iwata does have the power if he wanted to bust some Reggie heads.

950
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:18,869
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, think about it.

951
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:23,770
[SPEAKER_15]: The only person in the entire world who gets to yell at Reggie.

952
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, there's two people in the world that get to yell at Reggie.

953
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:28,250
[SPEAKER_15]: His wife and Iwata.

954
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:29,691
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

955
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:30,211
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

956
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:31,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for that thing.

957
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:32,871
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

958
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the microphone too high.

959
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:35,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Life goes on.

960
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Raven Stauffen, thanks for the call as always.

961
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:38,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, bye.

962
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:39,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one, buddy.

963
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:42,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to another call.

964
00:59:42,755 --> 00:59:44,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

965
00:59:44,157 --> 00:59:44,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

966
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:47,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's Ranma.

967
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,481
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, everyone?

968
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:49,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Jamie.

969
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:50,003
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up?

970
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:52,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, naked twister, 9 o'clock, right?

971
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:58,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, before we start, there will be a $5 cover charge for the Drunk Show.

972
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.

973
01:00:02,043 --> 01:00:06,845
[SPEAKER_12]: If you get in before the end of the Drunk Show, you can still qualify for Naked Twister.

974
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:09,146
[SPEAKER_15]: There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.

975
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,447
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not happening, Ranma.

976
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:11,747
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a joke, okay?

977
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to say that right here.

978
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:17,550
[SPEAKER_15]: There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room anyway.

979
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:20,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.

980
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,478
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what's actually really funny about Fanime?

981
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I talk about this on the last week's show?

982
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:29,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if it was on the show or if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.

983
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:34,004
[SPEAKER_15]: But my boyfriend wants to go to Fanime.

984
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:41,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is funny because... Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.

985
01:00:41,249 --> 01:00:41,990
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why it's funny.

986
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,371
[SPEAKER_15]: That has nothing to do with it.

987
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:49,075
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but the reason why is because he watches anime.

988
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,496
[SPEAKER_15]: He's familiar with some of it.

989
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,797
[SPEAKER_15]: He probably knows more about it than I do.

990
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

991
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:26,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The mistake in the whole Sailor Moon part is actually not being moon-sized, you know.

992
01:01:27,524 --> 01:01:29,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, so... I'm dressing up this year.

993
01:01:30,026 --> 01:01:36,448
[SPEAKER_15]: If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?

994
01:01:37,148 --> 01:01:38,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to have my skirt made.

995
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:40,250
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you cosplaying as?

996
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.

997
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:44,311
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

998
01:01:44,912 --> 01:01:45,472
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cute.

999
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:45,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1000
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to get my wig finished, though.

1001
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:49,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a rest of the posse?

1002
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:50,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there...

1003
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:52,525
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but Rob, you could cosplay.

1004
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: You could be the hero.

1005
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:54,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I could.

1006
01:01:54,906 --> 01:01:55,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1007
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:55,846
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be fun.

1008
01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:56,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll have to whip you.

1009
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,248
[SPEAKER_15]: And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.

1010
01:01:59,308 --> 01:02:01,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a full bullwhip.

1011
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:03,030
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not dressing up like a goblin.

1012
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Please do.

1013
01:02:05,131 --> 01:02:05,711
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be funny.

1014
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,133
[SPEAKER_12]: So, does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume this year?

1015
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,254
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no black mage costume.

1016
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:12,274
[SPEAKER_12]: I had fun with that, though.

1017
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:14,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Ranma, can I borrow a mage costume?

1018
01:02:15,075 --> 01:02:15,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I'll pack it.

1019
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:16,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Rad.

1020
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:17,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1021
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:18,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1022
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:20,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have the red hair and all.

1023
01:02:21,295 --> 01:02:24,939
[SPEAKER_15]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat room suggests Loki should cosplay as Tingle.

1024
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not dressing up like Tingle.

1025
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck no.

1026
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, sorry Ranma.

1027
01:02:28,242 --> 01:02:29,583
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell did you call in for anyway?

1028
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:32,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.

1029
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:34,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, like the movie?

1030
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:34,828
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one?

1031
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:37,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.

1032
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:41,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1033
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:44,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, now spoiler free please, because Mikkelsof and I both want to see this.

1034
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:46,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust, um, do you have a strong stomach?

1035
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see it because I love the undead.

1036
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:51,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, load the undead.

1037
01:02:51,703 --> 01:02:56,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Miklatov and I both scream like girls at bad violence, but that's part of the fun in going.

1038
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:58,125
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to scream.

1039
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,086
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I got to say.

1040
01:02:59,346 --> 01:02:59,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1041
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Miklatov's already putting on a pouty face.

1042
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:03,608
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's really good, though.

1043
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:08,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw-up stuff going on in that movie.

1044
01:03:09,671 --> 01:03:10,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1045
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hate that.

1046
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:12,752
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so gross.

1047
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:15,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, you know what you need to see if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?

1048
01:03:16,594 --> 01:03:16,794
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1049
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:17,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot fuzz.

1050
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:19,533
[SPEAKER_12]: That's on my list.

1051
01:03:19,613 --> 01:03:21,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe we can do it while we're out there.

1052
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:21,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on now.

1053
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:23,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I just said.

1054
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:24,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go see Hot Fuzz.

1055
01:03:25,616 --> 01:03:26,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1056
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:26,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely.

1057
01:03:27,657 --> 01:03:34,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions where like, what more can I buy and how many more pictures can I be taken of?

1058
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:35,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just go somewhere.

1059
01:03:35,342 --> 01:03:37,663
[SPEAKER_15]: And we need to get chicken.

1060
01:03:37,843 --> 01:03:39,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go see that movie tomorrow when I get back from LA.

1061
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:40,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna cry.

1062
01:03:40,745 --> 01:03:42,606
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow, do you?

1063
01:03:43,248 --> 01:03:43,548
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1064
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:44,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would I want to do that?

1065
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go see that movie and you can cry.

1066
01:03:48,552 --> 01:03:49,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Suck it up.

1067
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:50,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude.

1068
01:03:50,814 --> 01:03:51,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1069
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:52,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like zombies.

1070
01:03:53,016 --> 01:04:05,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like that these people, even though they're not really zombies because they're not dead, they're people with a virus, but they're like zombies and they throw up blood and they run really fast and it's going to scare the crap out of me.

1071
01:04:05,486 --> 01:04:08,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Ranma, so you understand.

1072
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:08,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1073
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:11,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Taking Shane to zombie movies.

1074
01:04:12,232 --> 01:04:18,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Taking Extifer on Roller Coasters Oh my god, it's killing me!

1075
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,278
[SPEAKER_11]: That was so funny.

1076
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:21,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, sorry.

1077
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,020
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the little pleasures in life.

1078
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,282
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we can go see the movie.

1079
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:27,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Sweet.

1080
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:31,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to miss out on playing Bus to Move at work.

1081
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:38,350
[SPEAKER_15]: You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers, some of them listen to this program, right?

1082
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do I care?

1083
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:40,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, just check it.

1084
01:04:40,312 --> 01:04:40,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Just want to make sure.

1085
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,230
[SPEAKER_11]: They can all suck it.

1086
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:46,632
[SPEAKER_15]: All thousands of listeners.

1087
01:04:46,912 --> 01:04:47,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1088
01:04:47,532 --> 01:04:48,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm inflating that number a lot.

1089
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:49,893
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant dozens.

1090
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:51,114
[SPEAKER_11]: All 14 listeners.

1091
01:04:51,174 --> 01:04:53,474
[SPEAKER_15]: All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.

1092
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1093
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:55,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

1094
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:56,256
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even care anymore.

1095
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:58,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma, tell me something game related.

1096
01:04:58,937 --> 01:04:59,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1097
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:00,377
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of things.

1098
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:05,739
[SPEAKER_12]: In response of last week, I have been listening to this show for about five years.

1099
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:07,260
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be six years in January.

1100
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:12,546
[SPEAKER_15]: How is that possible when we've only been doing this show five years next month?

1101
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:18,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember, maybe I'm off by you, I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.

1102
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:20,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.

1103
01:05:20,691 --> 01:05:20,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1104
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1105
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:23,553
[SPEAKER_12]: See?

1106
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:27,435
[SPEAKER_15]: The station started in 2000, no, yeah, the station started in 2002.

1107
01:05:27,535 --> 01:05:29,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Longest train wreck ever.

1108
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:29,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Forget it.

1109
01:05:29,837 --> 01:05:30,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry, what, Ranma?

1110
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:34,840
[SPEAKER_12]: No, DarkTetsu wanted to throw down, so I accepted his challenge.

1111
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, thank you, Drew Nami.

1112
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:39,762
[SPEAKER_15]: 6-23 of 02 was the first live show.

1113
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:42,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence Drew Nami has.

1114
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:45,104
[SPEAKER_06]: 23 is the number of coincidence.

1115
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:56,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, what were you going to say, Ranma, about you've been listening to the show for five years, and last week... No, I think it was last week when Dr. Zacon said about your biggest fans, you said it was me and Misty.

1116
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:58,731
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to figure out how many years we've been listening.

1117
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:05,922
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show last week.

1118
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because I EM'd her about it.

1119
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:13,006
[SPEAKER_12]: She said you guys missed her, and I told her, no, they all love you and miss you a lot.

1120
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:13,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1121
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:17,268
[SPEAKER_15]: She kind of just disappeared, but I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life and stuff.

1122
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:18,629
[SPEAKER_15]: She's doing her thing.

1123
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:20,429
[SPEAKER_15]: And that happens.

1124
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:28,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Folks, sometimes they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore, but we hope you'll always remember us and blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.

1125
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:29,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.

1126
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:35,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob D in chat says, Ranma is such a fan that he's been listening to you since before you've been on the air.

1127
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That means he was listening to Under Sedation.

1128
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:45,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it by saying you were listening to Under Sedation live, and I think that's how Dark Tetsuya gets away with it, because I think he was listening to Under Sedation live.

1129
01:06:46,056 --> 01:06:49,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest appearances.

1130
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:50,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Crazy.

1131
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:52,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And I filled in for people.

1132
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:54,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.

1133
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Crazy times.

1134
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:56,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Old school.

1135
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:56,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1136
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry Ranma, anything else you want to share with us?

1137
01:06:59,512 --> 01:07:04,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to finish it off by saying, in case you guys haven't heard yet, we have a new video gamer in the world.

1138
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:05,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1139
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:07,633
[SPEAKER_12]: You IM'd me the other day.

1140
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:08,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1141
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:10,234
[SPEAKER_15]: A new video, who's this?

1142
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,135
[SPEAKER_12]: My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy last Wednesday.

1143
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:17,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Aww, what's the boy's name?

1144
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:18,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it bouncing unhealthy for babies?

1145
01:07:19,016 --> 01:07:21,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?

1146
01:07:22,316 --> 01:07:22,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

1147
01:07:22,836 --> 01:07:26,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller and started playing Street Fighter.

1148
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:27,304
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

1149
01:07:27,364 --> 01:07:28,845
[SPEAKER_11]: On the first or second bounce.

1150
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:29,926
[SPEAKER_12]: First.

1151
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:31,908
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really awesome.

1152
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:33,569
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to talk more on this program.

1153
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:34,709
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1154
01:07:34,729 --> 01:07:35,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Ranma.

1155
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:35,890
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the kid's name?

1156
01:07:36,871 --> 01:07:38,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Gabriel Henley.

1157
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:39,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Gabriel.

1158
01:07:39,993 --> 01:07:41,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are you laughing?

1159
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:42,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Gabriel Knight, right?

1160
01:07:43,656 --> 01:07:44,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe so.

1161
01:07:44,776 --> 01:07:46,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?

1162
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:47,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that?

1163
01:07:47,658 --> 01:07:47,999
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1164
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:48,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1165
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:49,039
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1166
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

1167
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:51,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for spoiling, Rob.

1168
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a spoiler.

1169
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:55,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't spoil a goddamn thing.

1170
01:07:55,484 --> 01:07:56,044
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a spoiler.

1171
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:57,838
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just his real name.

1172
01:07:57,898 --> 01:07:59,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's going to be named Siler.

1173
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe if you could watch the show.

1174
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with somebody named Melina.

1175
01:08:03,781 --> 01:08:04,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that Siler?

1176
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:08,084
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but she's named after a video game character from Mortal Kombat.

1177
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:08,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1178
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I work with someone named Katana.

1179
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:10,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1180
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:11,126
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I lied.

1181
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:15,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Ranma, we're going to let you go now because your phone calls derail our show too much.

1182
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:17,850
[SPEAKER_12]: It gets the attention.

1183
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,150
[SPEAKER_12]: It gets people happy in the chat.

1184
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:20,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I did my job.

1185
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:21,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1186
01:08:23,293 --> 01:08:23,813
[SPEAKER_15]: One more call.

1187
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:25,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Oop, did I miss this one?

1188
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:28,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, DJ Tyrant, what's on your mind, buddy?

1189
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:51,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, not much.

1190
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:57,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to say off your rant there about the gold spam in WoW.

1191
01:08:57,612 --> 01:08:57,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1192
01:08:57,992 --> 01:09:04,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened, not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.

1193
01:09:06,856 --> 01:09:09,397
[SPEAKER_15]: What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?

1194
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:12,639
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to do anything about it.

1195
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:19,322
[SPEAKER_09]: They're supposed to change some of the reporting of users and stuff like that.

1196
01:09:19,915 --> 01:09:20,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know.

1197
01:09:20,976 --> 01:09:22,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just have it, like, okay, how hard would this be?

1198
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,239
[SPEAKER_11]: You can message...

1199
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:42,169
[SPEAKER_15]: How about this?

1200
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:47,492
[SPEAKER_15]: You can message a person, but then you have to wait a minute before you can message a different person.

1201
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:51,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.

1202
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:57,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like limit that, like throttle it somehow that way so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.

1203
01:09:58,076 --> 01:09:58,396
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1204
01:09:58,716 --> 01:10:00,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would be nice.

1205
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:00,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they'll do that.

1206
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:02,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And have you seen Blizzard's web page?

1207
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:08,260
[SPEAKER_09]: They're announcing their new product on Friday or Saturday, I believe.

1208
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,341
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the 19th, right?

1209
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:09,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1210
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:13,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of WoW, is it okay if I promote some of my other little projects I have on the side?

1211
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:13,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1212
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:47,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website, wow.stratix.com, and we are having a developer chat on Tuesday.

1213
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: So submit your questions through the IRC channel there, wow.stratix.com.

1214
01:10:55,123 --> 01:11:01,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been announced on the WOW webpage, so check it out if you're interested in asking the developers about the game or whatever.

1215
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:02,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

1216
01:11:03,246 --> 01:11:05,687
[SPEAKER_15]: And trying to make BlizzCon happen.

1217
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:08,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to watch the monies, but I want to go to BlizzCon really bad.

1218
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:11,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it'll be fun.

1219
01:11:11,255 --> 01:11:17,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably see whatever they're going to announce this week there.

1220
01:11:17,636 --> 01:11:18,377
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we'll see.

1221
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:19,377
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, buddy.

1222
01:11:19,577 --> 01:11:21,678
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to let you go, but have a great one, okay?

1223
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:22,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks a lot.

1224
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:23,258
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

1225
01:11:23,798 --> 01:11:24,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye-bye.

1226
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:27,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyron.

1227
01:11:27,459 --> 01:11:33,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU, which airs Thursday nights on this very network, but not for the next couple weeks.

1228
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:37,082
[SPEAKER_15]: They're taking a little bit of a break because we all need a break once in a while, but they'll be back.

1229
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:39,229
[SPEAKER_15]: This is your mother, Rob!

1230
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:42,250
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't call me for Mother's Day!

1231
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:43,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a terrible son!

1232
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:46,011
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I never had you!

1233
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:07,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That was yesterday.

1234
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:08,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mother's Day today.

1235
01:12:10,585 --> 01:12:14,168
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I should tell you this right now in front of all your listeners.

1236
01:12:14,608 --> 01:12:15,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You were adopted.

1237
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:17,991
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1238
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:19,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I was adopted?

1239
01:12:19,893 --> 01:12:20,954
[SPEAKER_15]: You were adopted.

1240
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:25,257
[SPEAKER_15]: You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?

1241
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:27,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1242
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's my real mother?

1243
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

1244
01:12:34,656 --> 01:12:42,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I traded you with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes and a bottle of vodka.

1245
01:12:43,463 --> 01:12:46,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.

1246
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:47,666
[SPEAKER_15]: What's wrong with you?

1247
01:12:49,787 --> 01:12:50,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to.

1248
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:54,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you smoke while you were pregnant?

1249
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:55,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope not.

1250
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:55,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wait, no.

1251
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:56,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

1252
01:12:56,412 --> 01:12:56,993
[SPEAKER_15]: I was adopted.

1253
01:12:58,464 --> 01:13:04,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they smoke while I was pregnant?

1254
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:09,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really know what else to say, Mom.

1255
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:12,672
[SPEAKER_15]: You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners and I'm crying.

1256
01:13:13,313 --> 01:13:16,695
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, did you have anything... What video games have you been playing this week, Mom?

1257
01:13:18,095 --> 01:13:26,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me, but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.

1258
01:13:28,427 --> 01:13:30,888
[SPEAKER_15]: The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.

1259
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1260
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:38,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360?

1261
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:41,490
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that?

1262
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those things that chink like a disc?

1263
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:46,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's 360 degrees?

1264
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:47,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Something like that.

1265
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have to explain it to you later.

1266
01:13:49,712 --> 01:13:53,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.

1267
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:56,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I begrudgingly love you, Rob.

1268
01:13:57,134 --> 01:13:57,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you, too.

1269
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:00,756
[SPEAKER_15]: You should respond by hanging up quicker I guess so

1270
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:29,112
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, anyway, that's definitely going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1271
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:30,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, everybody.

1272
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:31,552
[SPEAKER_15]: That call ruined it for the rest of you.

1273
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:38,655
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go around and wrap up the show now by first off asking if there's any last-minute stories here in the room.

1274
01:14:39,036 --> 01:14:40,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Any last-minute stories?

1275
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:41,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a last-minute story.

1276
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:42,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, your mom's cool.

1277
01:14:43,277 --> 01:14:43,717
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?

1278
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two last-minute stories.

1279
01:14:46,599 --> 01:14:52,541
[SPEAKER_11]: First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally after five months of being broken.

1280
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:53,281
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a story.

1281
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:54,122
[SPEAKER_15]: What took so long?

1282
01:14:54,382 --> 01:14:54,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Laziness.

1283
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:58,671
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.

1284
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:02,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes out I can play it.

1285
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:08,098
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my other last minute story is my Magikarp evolved into a Gyarados.

1286
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:09,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1287
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:10,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1288
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:17,244
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this is completely inappropriate, but I feel like after that phone call I have no choice but to do this.

1289
01:15:18,405 --> 01:15:19,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll just give it a moment here.

1290
01:15:20,427 --> 01:15:20,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh god.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1300
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Why were they impersonating me?

1301
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:27,641
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't know me.

1302
01:16:27,661 --> 01:16:28,341
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a joke.

1303
01:16:28,762 --> 01:16:29,162
[SPEAKER_15]: What'd they say?

1304
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:52,530
[SPEAKER_15]: What were they saying?

1305
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:58,374
[SPEAKER_15]: They were saying that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.

1306
01:16:58,414 --> 01:16:59,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that true?

1307
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:01,757
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:03,018

[SPEAKER_15]: My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.

1312
01:17:09,943 --> 01:17:15,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hey, mom, I wanted to ask you, you know, when I was growing up, what did you think?

01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:19,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Tons.

1317
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:23,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Why did you let me play so many video games?

1318
01:17:24,761 --> 01:17:25,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was an idiot.

1319
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:39,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this where I would have a radio program on the internet with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years talking about games?

1320
01:17:40,433 --> 01:17:42,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in my weirdest dreams.

1321
01:17:42,774 --> 01:17:45,557
[SPEAKER_15]: How come you never played video games with me?

1322
01:17:46,497 --> 01:17:47,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like games.

1323
01:17:48,949 --> 01:17:49,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1324
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:50,530
[SPEAKER_15]: What did the games do to you?

1325
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't know.

1326
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:53,611
[SPEAKER_05]: They're boring.

1327
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:55,971
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're boring.

1328
01:17:55,991 --> 01:17:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: They play card games with you.

1329
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.

1330
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:06,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, video games are too fast-paced or something.

1331
01:18:06,455 --> 01:18:09,876
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something, I just, I don't have the coordination.

1332
01:18:10,516 --> 01:18:13,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, but if you played them more often, you could build up the coordination.

1333
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:16,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, but why would I want to do that?

1334
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:21,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangeonsradio.com They're really liking you, Mom.

1335
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,211
[SPEAKER_15]: JV Mon says she is awesome.

1336
01:18:24,172 --> 01:18:26,793
[SPEAKER_15]: DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.

1337
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,094
[SPEAKER_15]: The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.

1338
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:31,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1339
01:18:31,655 --> 01:18:31,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1340
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,276
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're popular.

1341
01:18:33,316 --> 01:18:34,416
[SPEAKER_15]: You should come on the show sometime.

1342
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:37,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been on it before, remember?

1343
01:18:38,718 --> 01:18:41,459
[SPEAKER_05]: When I told the whole world about you wearing the pink bunny suit?

1344
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, that was a different show.

1345
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,811
[SPEAKER_15]: That I did before Orange Lounge Radio, but thanks so much for resharing that story.

1346
01:18:48,851 --> 01:18:49,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

1347
01:18:52,112 --> 01:18:54,492
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so, well, that's it.

1348
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:58,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not really my mother.

1349
01:18:58,173 --> 01:19:00,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You really had a mother and you didn't hatch out of an egg.

1350
01:19:01,454 --> 01:19:02,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly, exactly.

1351
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:05,775
[SPEAKER_06]: We have other theories about how Rob came to be.

1352
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:11,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was, when he was four years old, was like a little old man, you know.

1353
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:16,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when he got to high school, he reverted back to childhood.

1354
01:19:16,594 --> 01:19:19,616
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when I was four years old?

1355
01:19:20,036 --> 01:19:20,536
[SPEAKER_05]: You were.

1356
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:22,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like a little old man.

1357
01:19:22,097 --> 01:19:24,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You used to order everybody around.

1358
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:26,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like the boss.

1359
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:27,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do that.

1360
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,522
[SPEAKER_05]: You were the boss of me when you were four.

1361
01:19:33,542 --> 01:19:34,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Did video games make me that way?

1362
01:19:36,664 --> 01:19:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: You were just really...

1363
01:19:39,744 --> 01:19:42,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you were in an adult world.

1364
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:44,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have a lot of other children around.

1365
01:19:44,865 --> 01:19:49,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's not get into the family drama here on the Internet where lots of people are listening.

1366
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of were old for your age.

1367
01:19:53,768 --> 01:19:54,868
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I say it?

1368
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:58,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you got into high school, it was like, what did I miss?

1369
01:19:59,029 --> 01:20:05,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so you started being a child, you know, dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.

1370
01:20:06,894 --> 01:20:08,195
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1371
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:37,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard lip-syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you, so I have to open in on this.

1372
01:20:37,521 --> 01:20:48,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus, when I was in high school, we participated in this lip-sync contest, and it was me and my two friends, and we did Hole by Violet.

1373
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:49,967
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, go on, take everything.

1374
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:54,069
[SPEAKER_15]: And I dressed up like Courtney Love, and my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.

1375
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:56,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen Drag Queen

1376
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:24,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, bye.

1377
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:25,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry mom.

1378
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:26,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks mom for bringing that up.

1379
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:27,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

1380
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1381
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,241
[SPEAKER_15]: What about all the good things I did?

1382
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:33,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be what, one thing?

1383
01:21:34,663 --> 01:21:37,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.

1384
01:21:37,804 --> 01:21:42,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio was in the newspaper and on the local news?

1385
01:21:43,748 --> 01:21:44,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

1386
01:21:45,508 --> 01:21:45,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Very.

1387
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:48,170
[SPEAKER_05]: She sounds so convinced.

1388
01:21:50,257 --> 01:21:50,697
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1389
01:21:50,777 --> 01:21:52,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Mom, I appreciate you calling.

1390
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really like, so there you go.

1391
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:59,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she's like a female Rob.

1392
01:22:01,304 --> 01:22:02,024
[SPEAKER_15]: So a Rob.

1393
01:22:03,645 --> 01:22:04,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up, Shane.

1394
01:22:05,106 --> 01:22:05,366
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1395
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:07,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Mom, thanks so much for playing along.

1396
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:07,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

1397
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:12,390
[SPEAKER_15]: You always know on Mother's Day or something to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.

1398
01:22:12,491 --> 01:22:12,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

1399
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:13,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

1400
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:14,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just waiting.

1401
01:22:14,392 --> 01:22:16,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I was waiting for you to call, actually.

1402
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:17,674
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you.

1403
01:22:17,994 --> 01:22:18,874
[SPEAKER_15]: And so do all the chatters.

1404
01:22:18,894 --> 01:22:19,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, too.

1405
01:22:19,495 --> 01:22:19,775
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1406
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care.

1407
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:21,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy Mother's Day.

1408
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:21,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1409
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, friend.

1410
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:23,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1411
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:25,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Did she say, bye, friend?

1412
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:27,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I think she did.

1413
01:22:27,584 --> 01:22:28,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I think she's like, bye, friend.

1414
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,145
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, friends.

1415
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:31,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, bye, friends.

1416
01:22:31,606 --> 01:22:31,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1417
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:32,806
[SPEAKER_15]: That had nothing to do with me.

1418
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:33,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I like your mom.

1419
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:34,347
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, she's funny.

1420
01:22:34,507 --> 01:22:35,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met your mom in person.

1421
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:39,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I like your mom, too, because the whole... Why don't we call my mom next week?

1422
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,051
[SPEAKER_15]: We just might have to.

1423
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:43,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe, you know... Who knows?

1424
01:22:43,152 --> 01:22:44,352
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be her birthday or something.

1425
01:22:44,853 --> 01:22:45,913
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom's birthday's in November.

1426
01:22:46,113 --> 01:22:46,814
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's a ways off.

1427
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:47,594
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

1428
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:48,732
[SPEAKER_15]: My mom's going to be 49.

1429
01:22:48,772 --> 01:22:48,812
[SPEAKER_06]: No, 48.

1430
01:22:48,852 --> 01:22:49,393
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom's going to be 49.

1431
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:00,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I keep forgetting, this is actually part of the podcast, so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?

1432
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,452
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I would like to see, I do have a request.

1433
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:11,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviewed, rejected last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss or whatever it was, like iTunes was rejecting the word piss.

1434
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:18,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you guys want to say, this show is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.

1435
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:18,556
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1436
01:23:18,756 --> 01:23:19,336
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be great.

1437
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:20,416
[SPEAKER_15]: My mom would like that.

1438
01:23:20,436 --> 01:23:21,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I could show it to her and she'd be like, what?

1439
01:23:22,017 --> 01:23:22,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get it.

1440
01:23:23,237 --> 01:23:23,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So there you go.

1441
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:24,558
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1442
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, we've got to wrap it up.

1443
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:27,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Any last-minute stories for real?

1444
01:23:30,582 --> 01:23:30,722
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1445
01:23:31,522 --> 01:23:31,782
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1446
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:32,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing from you, Loki?

1447
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:34,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised.

1448
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:36,545
[SPEAKER_06]: He's distracted by the interwebs.

1449
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:36,825
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1450
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,206
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you doing on the Internet?

1451
01:23:39,367 --> 01:23:39,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.

1452
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:40,648
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1453
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:43,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Crisis Core coming out in Japan September 13th.

1454
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1455
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:44,590
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1456
01:23:45,137 --> 01:23:48,018
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1457
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:51,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Shane, thank you for being on the show, even though you never say anything.

1458
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,741
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.

1459
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:55,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always funny.

1460
01:23:55,422 --> 01:23:56,743
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so your final thoughts, Shane?

1461
01:24:00,404 --> 01:24:00,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1462
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:02,505
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thanks.

1463
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:03,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for sharing.

1464
01:24:03,686 --> 01:24:05,227
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Loki, your final thought?

1465
01:24:07,368 --> 01:24:09,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid postage is going up to 41 cents tomorrow.

1466
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:14,679
[SPEAKER_15]: My final thought is zombie movie Shane.

1467
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:15,899
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to be fun.

1468
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:17,339
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1469
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I have ice cream at home that's low sugar and I can eat it.

1470
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:30,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday because I was having a bad day and I didn't eat that.

1471
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:32,282
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was really good.

1472
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:33,742
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't point at my fat.

1473
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:34,862
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1474
01:24:35,062 --> 01:24:37,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run when it's in the theater.

1475
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:38,583
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1476
01:24:39,096 --> 01:24:42,078
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, that's going to do it for another week here of Orange Lounge Radio.
