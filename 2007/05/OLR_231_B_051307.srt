00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this May 13, 2007.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Remember, Orange Lounge Radio is distributed in two parts.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So if you're thinking, it's not May 13, that's because we record live and we get a whole chat room filled with people over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And then we break the show up into two parts and take it to our audio archive throughout the week.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's get right back into some video game news.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Take it away.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And this shouldn't come to a surprise to anybody, but there's a rumor that music downloads are coming to Xbox Live Marketplace.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, I could totally see that happening since, well, they have the Zune Marketplace right now

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that has songs that you can download to your Zune that use the Microsoft Point.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How easy would it be to put these on Xbox Live Marketplace?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's going to happen sooner or later.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So that's not surprising, especially since Sony's talking about doing the same thing, I think,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and they've already got the success with the video marketplace.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Here's the problem I would have with the Zune Marketplace is, seriously, besides your Christmas present,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know a single person with a Zune.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know a single person with a Zune anywhere.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, here's the thing, though.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Imagine, if you will, they don't limit it to the Zune.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They just limit it to not just the Zune, but like...

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Microsoft products.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, Microsoft.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Either the 360, you can download music to the 360 and play it, or even have a way to offload it to your...

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't know if they would do actual MP3s.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to say I read something about this.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know if it was the same story or what, but actually the model that they were considering setting up

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
was something like Napster, where you would pay a subscription fee.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think something like, in the story, it says something like if you type a subscription fee,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and you would have access to all of the Xbox songs, all the songs they have,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
but you have to pay some outrageous monthly fee for it, but you could put all the songs on your Zune.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Like Napster.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I love this.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They're all roughly $15 for one month and $45 for three months,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
because, you know, there's a price break after three months.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wait, no, there isn't.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's not a price break at all.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But, you know, they offer the same kind of thing with the Zune.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's, you know, where you can do that, where you can either download one song, you know, whatever, per thing,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or do, like, a subscription.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Napster model.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It should be a virtual console.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Interesting.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I mean, I thought the video marketplace was okay, although they need more offerings, especially in HD.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But they're trying.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They've made a lot of improvements.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you imagine if they did a subscription model with the video marketplace?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Would that work?

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It might be a good competition for Netflix.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, actually, that's funny that you mentioned Netflix.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I heard a rumor that they're going to be using the Microsoft marketplace or whatever for Netflix downloads.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Interesting.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That you were going to be able to, you know, download with your Netflix, I guess, account or something.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, I heard a rumor that, you know, my cousins, you know, who, sisters, you know, friends, uncles,

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
person who works for, you know, Microsoft said that you suck.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Very uninterested.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Anyhow, let's get into another completely different type of story, although this does involve the Xbox Live marketplace as well.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to talk about Happy Tree Friends.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Have you ever seen the cartoon Happy Tree Friends?

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, yes, I have.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It is fucking disturbing.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I saw it in Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted animation festival or whatever it's called.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I remember, look, you got me a Happy Tree Friend for Christmas a couple years ago.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't they have a show on G4 or something now?

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's basically episodes from the cartoon series.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's got to be a watered down version, though, isn't it?

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, it's not.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's the exact same thing.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, wow, because that stuff was pretty gruesome.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, this is great because Happy Tree Friends is actually now going to be in a digitally distributed PC and Xbox Live arcade game.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm buying it.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Happy Tree Friends False Alarm.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's being developed by Stainless Games and will be published by Sega and should be coming out in fall of 2007.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They're calling it an action puzzle game.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
With death.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can either be Flippy the Bear, Lumpy the Moose, or Handy the Amputee Beaver.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lovely.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I like games with cute things dying.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think that's fantastic.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll play it.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sure Jamie is going to be all over this game.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is Cooking Mama 07 right here.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is it.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's so awesome.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, something else that's fairly awesome, at least as far as rumor-y things, is there's a rumor posted at an Xbox 360 site in the Netherlands that Sega is working on a vintage collection for the Xbox 360 that among them would be Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, and a few other games.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I think that would be kind of cool if it happens, but didn't we already get the Sega Aegis for the PlayStation 2?

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And not to mention also that they later found out that it was confirmed by Sega later on that it was fake.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Goddamn internet liars.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What I would like them to do, though, is a Sega Aegis compilation, like the Sega Aegis 2900, because I've got a few of those games. How long did we sit playing Fantasy Zone?

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I wouldn't mind something like that if not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then, yeah, something like what you said there where you could just have all of them on one disk.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, not all of them, because they've done quite a lot of them in Japan.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, a lot.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I want Planet Harrier.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A good chunk of them.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Planet Harrier.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And they could just release the game and they could call it this. Remember when Sega was good?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And that's what they could call the game.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And it would sell millions of copies because people would go, yeah, I remember when Sega was good.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sega Aegis.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There you go.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's the selling point right there. Remember when Sega was good?

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, but I do remember when Crackdown was good, and it was good today.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And that's because I had the new download pack, and it's awesome.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But there were some complications, as there normally is with a lot of these download packs,

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
where it was resetting some of the game's progress.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And you might have a problem if you played the co-op mode online and went back to your single player game.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You might find out that your save game's gone.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Whoopsie.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But they're working on a fix for it right now.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
However, if you really want to be able to play the co-op stuff, there is a simple step that you've got to do.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just real quick.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
All you have to do is get the brand new update, which will be coming out.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it's not the download content that's actually causing the crashes, the update to the game.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Get the update, start a single player game, and then quit out of it.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And when you quit out of it, it will save your game, and then you'll be good.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And just reboot it, and you're good to go.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I recommend doing that.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Otherwise, they're going to be releasing the patch later on.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But the download content is fucking awesome.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Free or paid.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Either way, you've got to get it.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't think I have ever played Crackdown co-op, so I should be okay, right?

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You should be fine.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But either way, just go in the game, quit out, save it, you're done.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And then go back into it and you can play it again.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I played a co-op on the keys to the city mode, actually the land.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So that doesn't affect anything because that doesn't save your game at all.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So that you're probably safe on.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And just be on the safe side, save it, and then go back to it again.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But what they really, really, really need to release now is an instant replay saver

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or something like that where you can create your own movies

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
because with all this extra crap that they threw in there,

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
there's got to be an easier way to make YouTube videos.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All right.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ross Deal, UT, in our chat room, chat.orangemanstrategy.com says,

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Crackdown co-op is overrated.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You don't even have to really play together.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you think? What do you say to that?

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Exactly. You don't have to play together, but it's still fun.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And it's not really fun to actually play together to try to beat missions and stuff.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's just fun to fuck around.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's the whole fun about it.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, some evidence has come to light this week

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
of a new Xbox Live game in development.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's Bomberman Live on the Xbox 360.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And the evidence to support this game's release is that

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the Australian government's Office of Film and Literature

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
actually has already raided this game.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Not only that, but a screenshot showed up earlier this week as well.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So it does look like Bomberman will be making its way to the Xbox Live arcade.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
As to when, who knows.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But certainly this game is certain to get a lot better reception

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
than Bomberman Act Zero did on the Xbox 360,

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
which you might recognize as the worst Xbox 360 title out there in existence.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Not only that, they have a trailer for it, too, out there.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look at that now.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So it's official, and it is old-school Bomberman.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank God.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know what my only problem with this game would be?

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because that's being developed by Backbone,

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
according to everything that I've seen online.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What else has Backbone done?

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Death Junior.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And Brooktown.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And a lot of really crappy games.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I have no hope for this.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
All right.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They're going to suck.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How can you fuck up Bomberman, though?

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, wait.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Bomberman Act Zero.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bomberman Act Zero.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Good point.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It looked like classic Bomberman.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's no way.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Just seriously, don't change anything.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just make it playable on the internet.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The end.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's it.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The last really good Bomberman was Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I mean, that was the pinnacle of Bomberman playing.

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Was that after Bomberman 94 on a Turbo?

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I do believe so.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Bomberman 94 was really good,

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but it was still I think the best version to date was Super Bomberman 2.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
With the multi-tap.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So just take that and make it online playable.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The end.

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No reason to screw something up that wasn't broken already, right?

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, there's plenty of ways to screw something up.

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
However, and it would be really fantastic if this ad wasn't in the way of what I'm trying to read.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
God, I hate ads.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Stop putting flash ads on your site, you stupid butt heads.

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, they got to make money somehow.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Delete crap heads.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Anyway.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In other news, we do have information that the Lost Planet demo will be available for PC download on Tuesday, May 15th.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that way people can see if it's supposed to be all the hot shit everyone said it's going to be.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
At least so I'd have heard.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But you have to have DirectX 10 in a high resolution.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can play it with DirectX 9, but they suggest very highly that you have a little bit better than that.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Isn't DirectX 10 Vista only, if I'm not mistaken?

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, there you go.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No point me downloading this because I don't have that.

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know. I'll give it a try because I've been interested in it.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I play the Xbox 360 demo.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But they're saying the full PC version will be available in June.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So, let's hope.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And, unfortunately, one game that will not be available in June.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Spore.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, it may be available in June next year, but definitely not this year.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Apparently, the game has been delayed to the following fiscal year for EA.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And, of course, their fiscal year ends March 31st, 2008.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So, got to wait more for this game.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But you know what, though? I'd rather them take the time to get it correct and release a really awesome game than to fucking release it now and have it be all fucked up.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Honestly, though, when we saw it at E3, it looked done to me.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It didn't look like that much more to go. It looked pretty cool to me.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The thing, though, is with a game of that scope, though, where you're going to have so much user-created content that's being downloaded and stuff and streamed into your game, I would rather them get it correct.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I'm sure they're not just waiting to release it to the next fiscal year, the kind of sandbagged numbers.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know, though. News about games I'm really looking forward to getting delayed.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It really makes me angsty.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And when I get angsty, people die, and we have to do this little segment on the program called the FUs of the Week.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Dark Sakura, start us off.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A few of the week goes toward the connective tissue around my occiput, which for anyone who has gone into anatomy, that's like the very back of your head toward the top of your neck.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It hurts a lot, and it's very stiff, and every time I move my neck, it hops, so I'm very upset at my connective tissue.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Loki.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm pissed off at the fact that Grent thought of course not out yet. That makes me sad.

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My FU of the Week goes to Spammers in World of Warcraft. I hope you all die in a fire.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I got this thing Spam Sentry or whatever that's supposed to help with it, and it hasn't been doing a damn thing.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The Spammers are still getting through with all their tells. I hope they all die a lot.

242
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I hope they get thrown in a girl crater and eaten by dinosaurs.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Niklotov, anything you have for FUs of the Week?

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was going to say FU to Drama, but I'm actually just going to say no, I have nothing.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So you're saying FU without saying FU?

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Kind of, but not so much. I'm just going to get over all the crap right now.

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
All right. Very cryptic there.

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That was a short FU of the Week segment. I'm kind of impressed with this group tonight. Everybody seems to be pretty happy.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right. Well, this is some interesting news here, and I should clarify this is that there was a lot of kind of updates going on to this story,

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
so kind of you can view us reporting on this as kind of like an advisory thing.

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There's a story put out earlier this week that says the Xbox 360 costs over $500 less to make than a PlayStation 3.

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So in other words, and then this is kind of used in all that comparison about, well, the elite is actually ripping you off way more than a PlayStation 3 is,

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and blah, blah, blah, blah, but to make a long story short, the entire argument was based off of old data and not even the newest data.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So there you have it.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But of course, this is just going to say about this whole price war is going on about the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So there you go. That's it. That's all I got.

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Question things that you read on the Internet.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I question everything that I read on the Internet and I question what the intelligence of this is.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They're making a limited edition Simpsons movie, Xbox 360, which, first of all, it looks stupid.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I hate the color yellow so damn much.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And by the way, if I wanted like Simpsons decals on my Xbox 360, I can go into Photoshop and make skin.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why?

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know. I thought it looked kind of neat.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I mean, nobody else has one.

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, at any rate, they're making 100 limited edition versions of this with, quote, special events and promotions, blah,

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
to tie in with the Simpsons movie release on July 27th.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, whatever.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But you're a collector. Don't you want one of these?

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I collect things that don't suck ass.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Fine. See if I care.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If one of our listeners ends up getting one, I want to know.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, this is, of course, is all tying into the Simpsons movie being released this summer and the game being released this fall.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And the game looks fucking awesome.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's on pretty much every platform.

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course, all the next gen platforms or current gen, however you want to call them,

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, PS2 and PSP.

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And it's just pretty awesome.

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's basically the storyline revolves around them being put into an actual game.

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And then they realize that they're stuck in a video game, kind of almost a little bit like Bart's nightmare, I guess.

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But it's just awesome.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And the whole game looks kind of cel-shaded.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Reminds me a little bit of the 3D that's actually in like Futurama or something like that.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Very cool looking, though.

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Awesome.

285
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is this a parody of an existing game like a lot of recent Simpsons games have been?

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's going to be, sort of, because each level is kind of themed.

287
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They're like episodes, basically.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So there's 16 levels in the game.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And there was some rumors that they're going to be kind of parodying other games, including some of EA's own franchises.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
For example, there was posters for Bartman Begins, Medal of Homer, NeverQuest, Grand Theft Scratchy, Blood Island types, stuff like that.

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That should be interesting to cram all that into one game.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It'll be neat.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think it's going to be pretty awesome.

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Also, two-player co-op.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's going to go over live on Xbox, maybe?

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know if it's over live, but I know they're doing it definitely on one system.

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I think you might be able to do it over live as well.

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
GS191 says, I would like to play Medal of Homer, but I would rather have Call of Homer instead.

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But that's made by Activision.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Medal of Homer.

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Might get me to play one of those war games, finally, though.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Medal of Homer.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Of course, the Simpsons used to be something that was very controversial, you might remember, back in the day when it was first out.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like those shirts that said, Eat My Shorts, that were banned from school and stuff.

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, of course, always a source of controversy is the game ratings system.

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The ESRB put out a new study recently that showed that 90% of American parents are aware of game ratings.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And 85% use them regularly when buying games.

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's up from 84% and 73% from previous studies.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, kind of interesting there.

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There you go.

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, of course, we always hear those stories about kind of how the kid tells the parent in the gaming store, oh, yeah, this game is safe for me.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And the parent just kind of listens to that.

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So, I don't know.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Interesting, though, the ESRB has those studies to back it up there.

315
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
90% of parents know about the system.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The other 10% probably just don't have a video game system in their house, I would think.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, there's one thing, though, between knowing about it and understanding how it's used.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
True.

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But speaking of which, you know, they've got the same thing overseas.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And they've actually had to pull copies of Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP because the BBFC stamp, which is like our ESRB rating, while it was on the case, it was not on the UMD.

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And that means that, you know, somebody at Konami is going to end up shoved in a locker with a broken neck.

323
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Was that you, Miklotov?

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Did you do that?

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Did you allow the UMD of Metal Gear Portable Ops to go out with no rating on it?

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes, because I live in Europe.

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'd just like to have you speak on the program once in a while.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's healthy.

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, sometimes I don't have anything to say.

330
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And that time was one of them.

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Go back to playing with Hoe Monkey.

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Hoe Monkey.

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All right.

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm going to say real quickly, kind of going back to a story, we're talking about Bomberman coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They have a list of features that's going to have, including up to eight players can play over Xbox Live.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Offline multiplayer will play up to four players at once.

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You can customize your Bomberman with 10,000 possibilities.

338
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Power-ups are also customizable in eight different arenas.

339
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And it looks pretty awesome.

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, thank you for that follow-up, because while you were reading that follow-up, I stole a handful of chips from that bag.

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I guess they're also going to have download packs, too, which they've already freaking even talked about already.

342
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Thirty days after the date when it comes out.

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know. Interesting.

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, hooray. You can rate me with microtransactions in Bomberman. I'm so excited.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Awesome.

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Anywho, so back into kind of some news here.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There's a rumor, and I'm going to definitely say this is a rumor, that Microsoft may be releasing an external Blu-ray player for the 360.

348
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And, I don't know, this is coming from a forum post to this website Ecoustics.

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And it's, I guess, 2chan in Japan. I don't know.

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, Blu-ray is a Sony product, yes?

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes, but here's the thing, though. They're not going to be retarded if it does happen to win the format war and everybody goes with Blu-ray.

352
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They're not going to be like, we're not going to carry only HD DVD.

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They will make an external Blu-ray drive if demand is out there for it.

354
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Right now, though, it's nowhere near being closely decided who's going to win the format war, so not going to happen yet.

355
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And I would be surprised if it happens within the next few years.

356
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, goddammit, I hope Blu-ray doesn't win the war because then I wasted all that money on the HD DVD player. That's going to make me sad.

357
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, it's just like Betamax before people bought Betamax.

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It must run in my family. My parents had a Betamax.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Laser discs.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That I didn't have, but she had it.

361
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I still have them. I still watch them.

362
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know you're not going to be sad about the HD DVD thing because you'll have Heroes on HD DVD.

363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's right.

364
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's worth the $200 you spent on the thing.

365
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You do realize when I read that rumor, it wasn't even confirmed at that point. I believe it's been confirmed since then,

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but when I read the rumor that Heroes Season 1 was going to be on HD DVD, I said, that's it, I've got to buy an HD DVD player.

367
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want one for the exact same reason. I don't care about anything else.

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I will buy Heroes on HD DVD even if I don't have the player yet because Heroes is that awesome.

369
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And to answer Ross, SteelUT, and Chad who says, I shouldn't buy next-gen formats before the war is decided.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
There you go, Heroes. HD DVD won the war. I had to have Heroes on HD.

371
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Even though I've seen all the episodes, I want to see it again.

372
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What am I going to do all summer?

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Just because it came out on HD DVD doesn't mean that HD DVD won the war.

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It did for me.

375
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But that's one person.

376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
They might come out on Blu-ray later.

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But laserdisc didn't win the war either, so nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, fuck you, Advent Children.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Fuck you.

380
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Advent Children is coming out. The director's cut is coming out on Blu-ray only.

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Advent Children? Okay, I care because little spirits within me coming out too.

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't care about that.

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But laserdiscs also still have an avid collector's market, so it didn't necessarily die.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Of nerds.

385
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, and they're actually still releasing laserdiscs.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Really?

387
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

388
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Two companies are.

389
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I remember how they had that really crappy movie, and I can't believe I'm going to even reference this.

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Three Ninjas, where they were using CDs as ninja stars.

391
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Can you imagine what would happen?

392
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The kind of damage you could do with laserdisc if you threw it at somebody?

393
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

394
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But dead platforms still get support all the time.

395
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
One of the stories that didn't make our cut this week is Adventure 2 is coming out on the Atari 2600.

396
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
5200, I think.

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Or is it 5200?

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Whatever.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Obviously not a system you hear much news about these days.

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, I have some happy news.

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
For everyone who's known me through the show for a while, everyone knows how much I love gorillas.

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And the studio that did a lot of their videos that came out with the last album, Demon Days,

404
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
was actually done by Passion Pictures, who's actually done a lot of really good quality work.

405
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And one of the last things they did was the Guitar Hero 2 ad for the Xbox 360.

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And so I have to say it's really fantastic, really cool, and just about as well as anything I've expected from them.

407
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Fangirlgasm.

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Not necessarily. I just think it's good quality work.

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
A little disappointment that I had with that is the fact that that wasn't the actual opening movie for the game.

410
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
True.

411
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That was disappointing.

412
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hell, they should just do some original animation.

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Just release some actual stuff.

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well, speaking of eye candy, I'm sure many of the straight men and some of the ladies in the ladies who are out there listening to the program will really like this news.

415
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Video game purists will probably hate it.

416
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The rumor is, rumor, rumor, but this rumor is all over the place, is that in the Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li will be played by Jessica Biel will actually be playing the role.

417
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Funny enough, Keira Knightley and Jessica Alba also both offered the role and both of them passed.

418
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But Jessica Biel, because she's so Chinese, she's apparently been offered the role.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
At least they got the sex right.

420
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Chun-Li will be played by Ron Jeremy.

421
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What's your face from Crouching Tiger or Hidden Dragon?

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Zhang Ji?

423
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

424
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Why don't they just have her play like fucking Cammy or something? At least that would make sense.

425
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, keep in mind this is just a rumor.

426
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I leave it out because he's a player again.

427
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Again?

428
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
She did, in the old movie.

429
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I know, I know.

430
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
She played Cammy?

431
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah.

432
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Okay.

433
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But you know who should play Chun-Li?

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Who?

435
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Ching Chong.

436
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What?

437
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
He's talking about the chick from fucking Harry Potter who plays like the...

438
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No, I'm just making a reaction.

439
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No, that's Chow Chang, stupid.

440
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I know Chow Chang, I'm just saying that's what Nelly calls her.

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think it was great though that she was Scottish.

442
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Here's the thing.

443
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This Asian girl with this thick Scottish accent.

444
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It was great.

445
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Jackie Chan dressed up like Chun-Li in the movie.

446
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He was a good Chun-Li too.

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
In the movie, City Hunter was more accurate than fucking Jessica Biel playing Chun-Li.

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Granted, I'm not going to say that Chun-Li or Jessica Biel, scantily clad, would not

449
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
be a draw for me to see his movie.

450
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What if there was a topless scene, like a topless fighting scene like in the Japanese

451
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
one?

452
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That would never happen, but that'd be hot.

453
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'd watch it on YouTube, but I wouldn't see the movie.

454
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Tigerclaw agrees the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon would be perfect as Chun-Li.

455
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I like how she doesn't have a name, she's just the chick from Crouching Tiger Hidden

456
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Dragon.

457
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You know that chick?

458
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Zhang Ziyi, that was her name.

459
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, exactly.

460
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
ActDeaf says Kylie Minogue rocks.

461
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's true.

462
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
SSJ100Matt says, what do all those girls have in common?

463
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And names to the list I named off there, Jessica Alva, Kiera Knightley.

464
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They were all pounded by Derek Jeter.

465
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I can never pronounce that guy's name.

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Jeter.

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You know what would be really awful?

468
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Is if they did get Kylie Minogue back and then she could do the title theme song for

469
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the movie.

470
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That would be awful.

471
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We're gonna go street fighting, la la la la la la, around the world, street fighting,

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,240
la la la la.

473
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,000
Maybe I should play Chun-Li.

474
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,920
RuPaul is Chun-Li.

475
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,000
I do think RuPaul should be in the movie somewhere.

476
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Girl, I'm gonna beat your ass.

477
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Girl, I'm gonna put my boo up your ass.

478
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
JVMon says Rob could be E. Honda.

479
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Are we saying I'm fat?

480
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What are we trying to say?

481
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
DJ Darknite says RuPaul could be that girl from Street Fighter 3.

482
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Blaze brings up the name Sanjaya.

483
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That could be a possible candidate to play Chun-Li.

484
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It could be Sanjaya from American Idol.

485
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And GS68, as long as Loki plays Tingle.

486
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Anyways, back to Guitar Hero.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Of course, as we talked about previously, Guitar Hero 80s edition, or I guess Rock the

488
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
80s is what it's being officially called now, has been announced coming out this summer,

489
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
July, and will feature at least these seven songs, including I Wanna Rock by Twisted Sister,

490
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, and those are both by the original artist NotCovers, Rounded

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Round, as made famous by RAT, I Want Candy, also made famous by Bow Wow Wow, and Mental

492
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Health, as made famous by Quiet Riot, Holy Diver, as made famous by Dio, that's pretty

493
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
cool, and The Heat of the Moment, as made famous by Asia.

494
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
How do you put Twisted Sister in a video game like this and not put in the song We're

495
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Not Gonna Take It?

496
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
How do you do that?

497
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It could be an unlocked song.

498
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Or even the song Remember in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, that's my favorite scene in the

499
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
whole movie when they're doing the chase through the lot, and then just so randomly

500
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Twisted Sister's singing that song, Don't you play no evil, cause I'm free, you're

501
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
gonna burn in hell.

502
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That was awesome.

503
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anyway, sorry.

504
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But yeah, why that random ass Twisted Sister song?

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
These are only, you know, seven songs that have been announced yet.

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I mean, come on, it's gonna be, you know, there's gonna be more songs in there.

507
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
In case you're wondering, it is only gonna be coming out on Playstation 2, at least as

508
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
a disc.

509
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
360, get ready for another download!

510
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Woohoo!

511
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Do you have the facts to back that up?

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's a rumor.

513
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's only coming out on Playstation 2, as a disc.

514
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, okay.

515
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Alright.

516
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So if it is coming out on 360, it's a download pack.

517
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Or just unannounced.

518
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Maybe they're waiting to see how it does on PS2.

519
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No, but it's gonna be a download pack.

520
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Alright.

521
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're very insistent about that.

522
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Let's see, RawsteelUT seems to think they're gonna stick We're Not Gonna Take It in one

523
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
of those shitty download packs.

524
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There you go.

525
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's see, a couple people in chat, Drewnami and SSJ100matt both are asking, where's Come

526
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
On Feel the Noise?

527
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
These are only the first seven songs announced yet, folks!

528
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean, come on!

529
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's gonna be another, like, 27 songs, at least.

530
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Man, I still want Highway to Hell.

531
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Our dirty deed's done dirt cheap.

532
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
As much as I hate ACDC, I would enjoy a little bit of Highway to Hell.

533
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I can't stand that fucking guy's voice.

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Never did like it.

535
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Alright.

536
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But a game I could stand was Saints Row.

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That was actually kind of fun.

538
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you're a Sony fan who's been holding out for the Playstation 3 version of Saints Row,

539
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
sucks to be you.

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It just got canned.

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But there is a silver lining to the story.

542
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Saints Row 2 is in development right now, and it's coming out on the Playstation 3 and

543
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the Xbox 360, and they're both coming out sometime in the year 2008.

544
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I have a quote from the CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell.

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Quote, we've done great things for our brands by putting them in the right time frame.

546
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The most important thing for the Saints Row franchise is to have a simultaneous shipment

547
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
into a larger installed base next year.

548
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's what we're looking for for Saints Row 2.

549
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In other words, they think it's probably too late for Saints Row 1.

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I think that's actually probably a smart decision.

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I think most of the people who wanted to buy this game already had it through.

552
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Because most people on 360 just bought it to hold them over until Grand Theft Auto or

553
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Crackdown.

554
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Exactly.

555
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Translation, let's wait and release this far, far away from Grand Theft Auto 4.

556
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Unless it sucks, in which case it will come out right afterwards.

557
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's actually not a bad decision though.

558
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Alright.

559
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, this is the part of the show where we like to open up the email bag.

560
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You guys send us emails every week at mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And Dark Soccer likes to dive into the mailbag head first.

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And land on pavement apparently.

563
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And pull out some of her favorite emails.

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So Dark Soccer, what's in the email bag this week?

565
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Fuck everybody.

566
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I haven't got a single damn email.

567
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So fuck it.

568
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I should say just there was some spam and there was a couple.

569
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The spam is squishy.

570
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We had to scrape that out with, you know, a flamethrower.

571
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And there were like a couple random emails that were like other types of inquiries that

572
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
aren't really suitable for on air.

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But other than that, nothing.

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like Rob, what color are your underwear?

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No, that would have been one that you would have actually read on air probably.

576
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah, Dark Tazzy has said it.

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Pool's closed.

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And Green.

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What the?

580
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay, whatever.

581
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
What?

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm married, butthead.

583
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What, are now they just starting to ask questions in chat?

584
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Alright.

585
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm doing some chat booting.

586
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Alright.

587
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, in lieu of a mail bag segment this week, by the way, if you want to send us an email,

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
mailbagatorangelaundry.com.

589
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That is very odd though.

590
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We've been doing this show for, you know, well, we've been doing a mail bag segment

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in our show, I should say, since we were doing a podcast, which was what, January of 05?

592
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because when we were doing the old show, the three hour program about like DDR, we didn't

593
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
really do an email bag segment.

594
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It was pretty much chat comments or nothing because you had to listen to the show live

595
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
or you didn't hear it at all, right?

596
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So we didn't really have an email bag segment.

597
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But ever since January of 05, I don't think we've ever got a single week without getting

598
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
a readable email.

599
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's very strange, isn't it?

600
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, I want one that's like done in, I want one, I want one in French.

601
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, you know, the good news is now I'm sure next week there'll be plenty of emails.

602
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Someone email me in French.

603
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Alright.

604
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Alright, here we go.

605
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That was my best French impersonation, by the way.

606
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Alright, well.

607
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That was horrible.

608
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Thank you.

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
As most of my accents are.

610
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Right.

611
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Folks are sending emails right now, actually, in chat.

612
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh, Rob, you might find this funny.

613
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What?

614
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay, this is kind of stupid.

615
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
My company that I work for, you know, we were bought by a British bank.

616
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Uh-huh.

617
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So they're doing this retarded, everyone, you know, do this big British thing for our

618
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
birthday party next month, right?

619
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Did you enjoy some tea and crumpets?

620
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
No, so I told them that I'm taking my break at 11 o'clock.

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm going to take my lunch at 11 o'clock and I'm going to dress as a police constable and

622
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
go around arresting my coworkers.

623
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Lovely.

624
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Did you have fun with that?

625
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Or has that happened yet?

626
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No, it's next month.

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Picks, please.

628
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Alright.

629
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Anyhow, in lieu of a mailbag segment tonight, we have something pretty interesting.

630
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We had a phone call on our Skype line.

631
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Of course, you can always call us 1-877-GAME-OLR even when we're not live and we'll take your

632
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
calls in a minute here.

633
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But we actually had a report from Chris, one of the OLR lesbians.

634
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Chris and Meg Z went to ASEN and Meg Z actually had an artist's table.

635
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Because some folks are actually saying, like, hey, I never found Chris and Meg Z.

636
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where were they at the con?

637
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Meg Z is cosplaying Bill Dandy from Oh My Goddess.

638
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Well, it's done now, so it doesn't matter.

639
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah.

640
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And she had an artist's table.

641
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Meg Z had an art table.

642
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah, she did.

643
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So that's where she spent most of the con.

644
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So if you are not an art person, if you're more of a gamer and forgot to check out the

645
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
art room, that's it.

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And Chris was doing it too.

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Chris apparently went around and hoarded out the show, but she says that in her voice message,

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
which we're going to listen to right now.

650
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Let's go to the voicemail from Chris at ASEN.

651
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Hello, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

652
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This is Chris over at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

653
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And I am here pimping out your show, which is actually not working very well due to time

654
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
constraints, a lot of confusion, and very poorly done.

655
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Probably done promo things by me, which I printed out at work before I left.

656
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The pimping out has not been going according to plan.

657
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So I apologize for that, but hopefully you'll get some new listeners.

658
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I also have not been able to do any really good interviews, and the ones that I did,

659
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
my phone kept dying.

660
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Plus, we're in a warehouse, which is where most of the stuff is taking place, including

661
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
a game room, both of which my cell phone reception did not work.

662
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So obviously, this entire trip has been one big mass of blah for me.

663
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Plus, I'm now losing my voice.

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But I think I should give you guys a scope anyway.

665
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Those of you who are interested in going to ASEN 2000, oops, messed up.

666
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Those of you who are interested at all going to ASEN and are looking for games,

667
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
there's lots of things to do here.

668
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The deal room is just packed full with merchandise, game stuff.

669
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
There's a lot of, what are those things called, you know, the dating sims.

670
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
There's a lot of those.

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And a lot of Yowie ones for those fangirls.

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
A lot of people have been cosplaying characters, which, again,

673
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I was trying to get interviews with, but unfortunately my phone has been going in and out.

674
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I just haven't had the time.

675
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There's also card games for people.

676
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There's a whole other game room for the card players and the RPG characters

677
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and all that fun stuff.

678
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And overall, it's just been an interesting convention, to say the least.

679
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
This entire trip actually was paid for me due to the fact that I had no money.

680
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It was part of my birthday present for my wonderful girlfriend, Maggie,

681
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
who's been selling her art.

682
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And other than that, it's more focused on anime, obviously, than games.

683
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But I don't discount the fact that they do give a lot of props to the gamers,

684
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and there have been a lot of them.

685
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I just, unfortunately, due to many different circumstances,

686
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I haven't been able to get any good interviews.

687
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But I do have pictures for anyone who's interested.

688
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
They will be up on my website, my live channel at Disneypunk10.

689
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Or you can try to get ahold from Dark Sakura.

690
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But other than that, I have tried.

691
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I've been pimping out your show, I swear.

692
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I have on little tabs of paper with absolutely nothing on them that says,

693
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I've changed around radio for gamers or something like that.

694
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I forgot what I put on it.

695
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I printed those out at work.

696
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I've been trying really hard, but it's just been kind of a weird convention.

697
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's my first, so people need to be nice to me.

698
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Anyway, I will check back with you guys later.

699
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I hope that you've gotten some new listeners from my efforts.

700
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And next year when I come back, and I will be coming back next year,

701
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
you guys have got to give me some good promos.

702
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So it looks impressive than the shit that I have.

703
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But anyway, this has been Chris at ASEN 2007 in Chicago, Illinois.

704
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This has been your Roaming Lesbian.

705
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Back to you, Rob.

706
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Back to you, Jamie.

707
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Back to you, Matt.

708
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Max Rule, asshole.

709
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
There you go, Chris.

710
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Semi-live at ASEN there.

711
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You've got to love Chris.

712
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
She's so fine.

713
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I love that she's kind of adopted the title of the Roaming Lesbian of OLR.

714
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's great.

715
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And Max Rule, asshole.

716
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Did you catch that in the end?

717
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I did.

718
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I did.

719
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I hate their commercials, too.

720
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Because now he's like,

721
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
See, the commercials said they're better, so they are.

722
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm like, fucking A.

723
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Great, here come 10 e-mails next week.

724
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Why does Lucky hate Max?

725
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Why does he hate Max?

726
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Your show is on iPods.

727
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You should respect Max more.

728
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Freedom of speech, what can we say?

729
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
He's allowed to hate Max if he wants.

730
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Dark Soccer and I, we love the Max.

731
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
They're like the Volkswagen Beetle.

732
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,400
This little fucking cars is what they are.

733
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,520
All right, ASEN.

734
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,480
ASEN, please.

735
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,120
Can we talk a little bit about ASEN?

736
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,400
I heard some of our listeners actually did some,

737
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
like some folks randomly ran into each other.

738
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,440
Like it seems like Rob D and Misty, two of our chatters,

739
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,160
it sound like they were chatting earlier.

740
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,220
So that's kind of cool.

741
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,720
I'm glad you guys had a good time at ASEN.

742
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,220
And who knows, maybe next year, if it's in the OLR budget,

743
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,920
we'll go.

744
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,960
But for now, we have Fond of May to look forward to.

745
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Those of you on the West Coast, especially in the Bay Area,

746
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,040
you got to go to Fond of May.

747
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,600
It's going to be in San Jose Memorial Day weekend.

748
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,080
OLR is going to be there Saturday.

749
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,440
And since we're only doing one panel this year,

750
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,200
it's in the works.

751
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,840
This won't be live, boys and girls.

752
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,640
But we will have the biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

753
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,960
Friday night at the Super Secret Suite

754
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,600
that OLR will be at Friday night.

755
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,720
The Super Secret Suite?

756
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,480
The Super Secret.

757
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,760
Yes, it's our Super Secret Suite 16.

758
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,280
That's not the actually sweet number, whatever sweet it is.

759
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,480
The biggest, the most number of drunk,

760
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,440
because it's going to be at a con.

761
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,760
So everybody's going to be there.

762
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,560
The biggest drunk show OLR has ever seen.

763
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I'm just sad it won't be live, because we just

764
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,520
don't have the equipment to make that happen.

765
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,240
I could take my Mac out there, but look,

766
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,900
you would find a way to fuck it all up.

767
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,600
So there you go.

768
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,880
I can take my non-Mac.

769
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,480
All right.

770
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,000
So we'll see.

771
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,280
We'll see.

772
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,720
Well, we're going to tape it one way or another.

773
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,280
And that's going to be half the show you get that week.

774
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,160
So we're going to flag it somehow.

775
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,520
It's not a usual show.

776
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,760
It'll be like the OLR special edition.

777
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,200
The OLR live from the minibar.

778
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,840
Live at Fond of May and live at minibars.

779
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,360
There you go.

780
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,740
We will be at Fond of May, though.

781
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,600
And the real show will be probably hung over

782
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,240
on Saturday at 2 PM.

783
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,720
So we're looking forward to that.

784
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,960
By the way, unfortunately, that won't be live either.

785
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,220
We won't be live that weekend.

786
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,320
But you can come see us tape live in person.

787
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,200
That's pretty awesome.

788
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,280
And we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge live again.

789
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,120
We had some really good questions last year.

790
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,040
Someone called out Loki live on the whole Mac-hating thing.

791
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,120
That's always a good time.

792
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,720
I don't care.

793
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,000
OK, I don't care.

794
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,080
I don't even really hate them anymore.

795
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,960
I don't like them.

796
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
I wouldn't buy them.

797
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,600
I don't care if you like them.

798
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,120
Great.

799
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,020
Good for you.

800
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,960
I really don't care.

801
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,400
You've become a poster child.

802
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,480
Stop asking me why I don't like them,

803
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,760
because I don't have legitimate reasons.

804
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,440
I don't like them.

805
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,960
It's I'm racist against Mac.

806
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,420
She doesn't like the color yellow.

807
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,240
You don't like Macs.

808
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,760
Exactly.

809
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm racist against Macs.

810
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,480
I have no reason for it.

811
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,240
There's no legitimate reason other than I don't like them.

812
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,680
I think they're crappy computers.

813
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,760
But if you like them, you think they're great, awesome.

814
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,560
That's your opinion, awesome.

815
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm not going to knock you for hating them or liking them.

816
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,560
Either way.

817
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,520
Can we move on with the rest of the show, please?

818
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,880
Thank you.

819
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,920
Anyways, so yeah, this is not very surprising at all.

820
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,320
But apparently, Playboy's coming to Second Life.

821
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,360
I would say, what took them so long?

822
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,860
Since I want to say that most of Second Life anyways

823
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,040
is all prostitution and naked chicks anyways.

824
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,280
Why I'm not playing Second Life is beyond me.

825
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,040
But yeah, they're opening up shop in Second Life.

826
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,900
And no real word of what's going to happen.

827
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,440
But apparently, you're going to be able to participate either

828
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,720
as a centerfold or as somebody staring at centerfolds.

829
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,240
Can I be one of Hugh Hefner's many girlfriends?

830
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,920
Possibly.

831
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,840
I don't know.

832
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Microsoft also entered Second Life.

833
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,880
I want to say Final Fantasy VII's

834
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,720
been recreated in Second Life.

835
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,240
You know, I hate to sound morbid,

836
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,320
but Hugh Hefner's days are obviously numbered.

837
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,820
I mean, he's not getting any younger.

838
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,080
I'm so interested to see how CNN is going

839
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,040
to handle it when he passes.

840
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,480
You know, how exactly are they going to say what he did?

841
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,120
Hugh is an entrepreneur who had a very controversial lifestyle.

842
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,800
I don't know.

843
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,520
Dude, maybe he's found the fountain of youth.

844
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,000
Seven chicks at one time.

845
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,080
Yes, it's called having $11 billion to your name.

846
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,000
That's the fountain of youth.

847
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,160
Suddenly, all the young kids still want to do you.

848
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,960
You know, if there's one person that in this world

849
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,440
needs to be made into a robot, it's Hugh Hefner.

850
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:25,960
No, no.

851
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,680
I take that back.

852
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,840
Bob Barker.

853
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,600
But if they can make two robots, Hugh Hefner would be a close second.

854
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,720
We have the Hugh Bot and the Bob Bot.

855
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,640
Bob Barker.

856
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,560
He cannot die.

857
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,720
The Barker Bot.

858
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,960
He's retiring this year.

859
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,560
It's happening.

860
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,840
Ah!

861
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,340
I know.

862
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm sad, too.

863
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,680
No.

864
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,040
Robot.

865
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,160
Somebody kill him before he decides to retire,

866
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,560
and we'll resurrect him as a robot,

867
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,120
and he'll never know the difference.

868
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,680
He will think it's his first year doing the show.

869
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,840
He will not be tired of it.

870
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,340
You know.

871
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,080
He will be back to sexually harassing women in no time.

872
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,440
Rumor is, because Rosie's leaving The View,

873
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,400
Rosie O'Donnell really wants that Price is Right hosting job.

874
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,160
Yeah.

875
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,660
No.

876
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,160
It's like, come on down.

877
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,320
No, you're going to eat me.

878
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,760
We need to wing Martindale.

879
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,840
Wing Martindale's awesome, but didn't he die?

880
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,120
Didn't Wing Martindale die?

881
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,620
No.

882
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,120
Is he still alive?

883
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,560
Some famous game show host died.

884
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,800
It was the one from Pressure Luck.

885
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
Oh, yeah, that guy died in a plane.

886
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Whatever his name, Peter DeMarken.

887
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,680
He was in a plane wreck or something.

888
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Boy, this show's getting morbid.

889
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,720
Let's open up the phone, shall we?

890
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,880
If you want to give us a call and comment on anything

891
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,440
from the show tonight.

892
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,120
Hugh Hefner should be the new Bob Barker.

893
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,120
1-877-GAME-OLR.

894
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,600
1-877-GAME-OLR.

895
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,360
Or remember, that number is only toll free in the US.

896
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,600
What about Lamar Burton?

897
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,720
And Levar Burton.

898
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
Levar Burton, yeah.

899
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,520
Levar Burton?

900
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,640
I don't know his name.

901
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,120
Only if he wears the glasses that he had on Star Trek.

902
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,760
Why him?

903
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,280
I've never seen him hosting a show.

904
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,600
Reading Rainbow, come on.

905
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,920
Not a live show.

906
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,360
I mean, of course, Reading Rainbow,

907
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,860
but not a live show with an audience.

908
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,760
Who said he'd even want to do it?

909
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Force him.

910
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,680
Why would I do that?

911
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,040
He doesn't have a say in this.

912
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,160
What?

913
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,840
All right, let's go to the phones.

914
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,520
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

915
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,640
Who's this?

916
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,800
Legend of Saku.

917
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,600
Hi, Legend of Saku.

918
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,360
Chewbacca.

919
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,720
He could totally host a show.

920
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,360
It's time to play Plinko, where you could win up to $25,000.

921
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,560
I want to play that yodeling game.

922
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,880
Yes, I love the yodeling game.

923
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,600
The game's fucking right.

924
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,680
You know I want to see The Price is Right live a couple years

925
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,240
ago.

926
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,360
We went to Coachella the year Bjork was there.

927
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,480
And I'll tell you what, I fucking love Bjork.

928
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,440
I know you have something you want to say, Saku,

929
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,800
but I'm going to talk for a minute.

930
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,440
Yeah, go ahead.

931
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,960
About nothing game related.

932
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,200
I fucking love Bjork because she's fucking crazy

933
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,360
and gets away with it in public, nonetheless.

934
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,840
She wore that fucking swan dress.

935
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,720
But here's the thing.

936
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,680
When I saw her at Coachella, this is what, 2002 or 2003,

937
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,720
I want to say, is when we went.

938
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,520
She wore a Venus fly trap outfit.

939
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,560
And it was awesome because it was closed for most of it.

940
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,640
But then during one of her songs, it opened up,

941
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,600
and she was like a Venus fly trap.

942
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,000
She's so fucking hardcore.

943
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,640
I mean, that was the best weekend ever.

944
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,160
It was Bjork in a Venus fly trap outfit, and Price is Right.

945
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,440
It was a great weekend.

946
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,160
I had a good time.

947
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,680
Sorry, Saku.

948
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,360
You had something gaming related you want to mention?

949
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,680
Just pulling through Digg right now.

950
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,880
I see that Sony is about to announce a new PS3 firmware

951
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,920
update.

952
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,320
A new PS3 firmware update?

953
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,200
Wait, this is on Digg right now?

954
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,720
Yeah.

955
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,680
Right this second?

956
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,400
Wait, wait, wait.

957
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,160
Don't be fooled.

958
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,840
It's an announcement of announcements.

959
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,160
So.

960
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,040
That's what, yeah, Loki's right.

961
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,720
I'm looking.

962
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,400
This is from psu.com.

963
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,880
Isn't that their official underground site?

964
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,280
Oh, I don't know.

965
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,640
There's too, you know what?

966
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,520
There's too damn many game blogs out there

967
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,400
on the internet right now.

968
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,640
We need to somehow put a cap.

969
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,040
I mean, don't get me wrong.

970
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,000
I love the indies.

971
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,880
I love the homebrew and stuff, but there's just so many.

972
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,680
And like, we have room to talk.

973
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,480
But you know, just damn, we need to streamline some of these,

974
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,440
because I can't keep track of all of them.

975
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,520
I'm kind of annoyed that Joystick and Kotaku are

976
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,440
basically, they're biased towards either console.

977
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,920
You see one, you see Kotaku's more anti-Sony at certain

978
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,160
times, and then, I don't know.

979
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,000
Joystick is almost the same thing.

980
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,920
I mean, actually, no.

981
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,080
Joystick is more pro Nintendo, if I recall correctly.

982
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,360
Kotaku has good reason to be anti-Sony, though,

983
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,080
because they tried to screw them over,

984
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,840
because Kotaku was saying something legitimate.

985
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,320
And Sony's like, no, don't speak about stuff

986
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,640
we don't want you to.

987
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,440
You're banned from everything now.

988
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,200
Mm-hmm.

989
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,240
But that was all the principles.

990
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,800
I don't know.

991
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,560
Yeah, like a certain other business

992
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,440
I'm thinking of in Namco, but we won't go there.

993
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,840
Anyhow.

994
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,340
Yeah.

995
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,480
Whoops.

996
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
Oh, well.

997
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,160
Just adding up that, I don't know, should have been there,

998
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,680
but I could see why they left it out initially,

999
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,360
probably so that you don't have the retarded fanboy saying,

1000
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,760
oh my god, they copied Xbox 360.

1001
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,160
OK, well, fucking A, you started off with a firmware update.

1002
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
Now we're talking about warring cyber blogs.

1003
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,760
What's up with the new update?

1004
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,000
What is actually going to be on this?

1005
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,200
You could access the XMB from the in-game,

1006
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,000
like how you could access the dashboard on 360 in-game

1007
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,680
as well.

1008
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,040
OK.

1009
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,560
Let me see.

1010
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,080
They said stuff about in-game music as well,

1011
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,560
for sleep mode.

1012
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,120
I mean, I could link you right now,

1013
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,280
but it's a whole bunch of settings that are up.

1014
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,880
I tried pulling it up on Digg, but obviously everybody's

1015
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,160
hammering the sites was broken.

1016
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,480
But I look at Doug Mirror to see what's going on.

1017
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,920
What I'm looking at, you can password protect user accounts.

1018
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,000
There's an equalizer in the music.

1019
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,480
There's photo settings, PlayStation 2 settings,

1020
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,040
RSS channel settings is now an option.

1021
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,720
So now I'll be hopping to OR on your PS3.

1022
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,800
More slideshow stuff for the photos,

1023
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,600
more visualization for music.

1024
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,160
Looks like you can do some other things with video.

1025
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,880
You can do some zoom ins and stuff.

1026
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,040
Cross media bar is now accessible during gameplay,

1027
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,240
like you said.

1028
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,800
RSS channel is added as a feature.

1029
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,560
That's pretty cool.

1030
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,880
That means you can download our podcast on the PlayStation 3

1031
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,560
pretty soon.

1032
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,240
You can now have multiple chat sessions,

1033
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,280
and you can select an image to use as your avatar

1034
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,120
from the photo.

1035
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,560
So it sounds like a pretty big update, that's pretty cool.

1036
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,120
I don't know.

1037
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,080
It's catching up to 360.

1038
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,400
I'm not saying it's surpassing it at this point.

1039
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,840
It's funny you phrase it that way.

1040
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,120
It definitely is catching up in some respects, right?

1041
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,200
It's not even there.

1042
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,720
It's not at the tip, the leading edge of where 360's at right

1043
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,000
now.

1044
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,880
I'm not sure about in-game music on the PS3.

1045
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,960
Does that even exist?

1046
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,580
Like the custom soundtracks, like an Xbox 360?

1047
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,160
I don't know.

1048
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't own a PS3.

1049
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,440
Does it?

1050
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,240
Can you do custom sound?

1051
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,960
You can't, right?

1052
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,440
Maybe.

1053
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,560
I don't think so.

1054
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,880
Depends on the game.

1055
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,440
I think it depends on the game.

1056
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,920
Interesting.

1057
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,400
Folks in chat are saying no.

1058
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,840
Yeah, I mean once Sony has a lot of work

1059
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:09,040
to do in order to basically win my dollars for PS3.

1060
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,400
I mean, they have to add rumble, lower the price,

1061
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,040
get some really good games out because right now not

1062
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,640
to say that they're the only ones,

1063
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,920
but the Wii's also in a drought right now.

1064
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,560
They could get my dollars by asking for less of them.

1065
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,360
Right, that's true.

1066
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,440
That's exactly what I said.

1067
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,560
A price cut would do just that.

1068
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,200
All right.

1069
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,040
Anything else, Zaku?

1070
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,700
We've got to get going to another call.

1071
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,280
But any other last stuff you want to get in here?

1072
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,000
That's about it.

1073
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,540
I'm cutting my throat's kind of sore.

1074
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,160
I'm planning to sleep a little bit early.

1075
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:39,680
All right.

1076
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,440
See you soon, buddy.

1077
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,280
Less than a month before I come to New York.

1078
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:42,800
All right.

1079
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,720
All right, later, dude.

1080
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,680
Bye-bye.

1081
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,080
I've got to plan something better for the next OLR getup

1082
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,880
because it didn't work so well last time having the Nintendo

1083
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,320
World Store, so I've got to think of something for that.

1084
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,800
Those of you New Yorkers with a suggestion, email me.

1085
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,680
Maybe the Dave and Buster's thing,

1086
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,200
although I don't think everybody can get in there.

1087
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,000
So I don't know.

1088
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,320
Maybe pizza?

1089
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,480
I don't know.

1090
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,460
I'm up for ideas.

1091
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,160
Let's start a forum thread or something.

1092
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,580
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1093
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,240
Who's this?

1094
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,160
Hey, what's up, guys?

1095
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,880
It's the Rob D.

1096
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,200
Hello, the Rob D. What's on your mind, buddy?

1097
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,720
Not too much.

1098
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,720
I just wanted to give my take on ASEN, if you don't mind.

1099
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,560
Ah, of course.

1100
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,800
How was ASEN?

1101
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,600
Oh, lots of fun.

1102
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,680
I had a blast.

1103
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,080
I watched a lot of anime.

1104
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,120
I played a lot of games.

1105
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,640
Saw some pretty cool costumes, like a full Dead Rising set.

1106
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,280
One guy who was dressed up was Frank West.

1107
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,000
He was carrying a servbot head.

1108
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,680
That's awesome.

1109
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,560
He had his girlfriend, who was also wearing a servbot head.

1110
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,340
He held her hand the whole time, and she didn't move unless he

1111
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,080
dragged her.

1112
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,480
That's great.

1113
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,920
And two zombies with servbot heads

1114
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,880
were chasing them the whole way through.

1115
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,720
That's pretty awesome.

1116
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,960
I like when people go all out with the game,

1117
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,400
because you know, I'm not really all about the anime.

1118
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,080
I mean, obviously, we have a lot of folks here in studio

1119
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,680
that are really into anime.

1120
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,680
And I respect it, but I don't really follow a lot of it.

1121
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,440
So I really like when people bring

1122
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,160
more of the gaming into the anime cons

1123
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,400
through the cosplay and stuff.

1124
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,400
That's always cool.

1125
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,000
Some interesting things happened, too.

1126
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,880
I went to a couple of the programming panels,

1127
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,440
like Anime Hell and Midnight Madness.

1128
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,120
And at one point, 1,000 people were singing the Segata Sanchiro

1129
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,800
theme song.

1130
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,560
Wow.

1131
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,960
You can get that many nerds in one place?

1132
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,920
Yeah, they showed the video during Anime Hell,

1133
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,840
which is just a bunch of random old clips of bad commercials,

1134
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,360
bad anime, that sort of thing.

1135
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,400
Or just like whacking commercials.

1136
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,120
So they played like a full four minutes Segata Sanchiro theme

1137
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,960
song with subtitles.

1138
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,000
So it's kind of an easy core to sing.

1139
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,520
So everyone started joining in the second, third,

1140
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,440
and fourth times they played it.

1141
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,880
Wow, nerds, all of you.

1142
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,760
Hey, what types of game room setups did they have?

1143
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,320
Because I notice no anime con is complete without a game room.

1144
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,720
They had a pretty big game room in the basement floor.

1145
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,760
They actually had Beat Mania 2DX down there.

1146
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,160
I didn't get a chance to play it,

1147
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,480
but it looked like some people were having some fun with that one.

1148
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,920
Like the real game, like the arcade game, or home port?

1149
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,440
I think it was a home port.

1150
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,480
Yeah, it was a home port.

1151
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,320
That's all right, it's still cool.

1152
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,120
They had a HDTV set up for just about, I think,

1153
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,000
every single set up they had around there.

1154
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,920
A lot of console games, mostly anime-based games or fighting

1155
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,120
games, that sort of thing.

1156
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,620
Right.

1157
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,920
King of Fighters 11.

1158
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,440
You're not really going to find Navno 8 at an anime con?

1159
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,940
Exactly.

1160
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,000
And for the Para Para machine, it was great.

1161
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,440
There were probably about 15 people

1162
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,520
behind doing the motions themselves as people

1163
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,600
were playing the machine.

1164
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,240
It was great.

1165
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,360
How many of them were dudes?

1166
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,200
Maybe, I don't know, probably less than half.

1167
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,080
You know, it's funny because there

1168
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,880
used to be hella guys in Northern California

1169
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,160
that were into Para Para.

1170
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,840
There was teams and everything.

1171
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,120
And then word came out of Japan that guys don't really

1172
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,400
do Para Para dancing.

1173
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,360
And then all those teams just fell apart,

1174
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,000
like instantly vaporized.

1175
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,240
It was something else.

1176
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,600
I say, let's break down those sexuality barriers and stuff

1177
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,960
and people should be able to do whatever the hell they want.

1178
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,520
But the effects of that were funny nonetheless.

1179
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,100
Exactly.

1180
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,800
Rock on, Sky.

1181
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,880
But anyway, there were a lot of tournaments.

1182
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,680
Tournaments for just about every fighting game,

1183
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,120
every anime fighting game.

1184
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,240
There were only buy-ins for Street Fighter 3,

1185
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,960
Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which I wasted $5 on, unfortunately.

1186
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,000
I got killed in that one.

1187
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,360
Wow.

1188
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,040
So I entered like five of them, somewhere around there.

1189
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,080
A lot of fun, a lot of competitive players.

1190
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,120
But people are still having fun.

1191
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,920
There weren't too many people that

1192
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
were completely arrogant or cocky, which

1193
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,440
unfortunately can't happen.

1194
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,960
I met up with Saikun and Misty from the OLR chat room.

1195
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,860
Awesome.

1196
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,640
Met up with Gav from the All Games chat room.

1197
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,280
It was a lot of fun.

1198
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,880
It's funny, never mind, I won't tell that story.

1199
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,880
I'll just say that some of my friends

1200
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,600
actually found a stranger in their hotel room

1201
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,960
when they woke up the next day.

1202
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,280
I'll leave it at that.

1203
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,520
Well, what happens at ASEN stays at ASEN.

1204
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,240
Interesting.

1205
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,880
All right, well, we'll leave it at that.

1206
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,080
Let's hope something equally awesome happens at Faname.

1207
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,680
If you're an anime fan, I got to say

1208
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,920
it's a great place to go to.

1209
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,640
If you're a video game fan, specifically a fighter fan,

1210
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,720
you should probably go to that, because there are

1211
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,000
a lot of people that know how to play the games,

1212
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,760
and you'll get a lot of good matches there.

1213
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,880
All right.

1214
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,440
If you're a fan of both, it's really a great weekend.

1215
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,280
I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot if they're near the area.

1216
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,000
Awesome.

1217
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,200
Well, thanks for the wrap up, and I'm

1218
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,040
glad to hear some OLR fans got together there.

1219
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,120
You guys should call in next time with your report,

1220
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,000
because obviously, Chris had a hard time finding you guys,

1221
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
or her cell phone wasn't working, or something.

1222
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,040
All right, we'll do.

1223
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,640
See you guys later.

1224
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,840
All right, take care, buddy.

1225
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Thanks for the call.

1226
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Don't they usually have bulletin boards at anime cons

1227
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
where you can arrange meetups and that type of thing?

1228
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,400
Yeah, but who thinks to look at that?

1229
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,200
I always do.

1230
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,680
Really?

1231
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,360
The first place I go to is the NASA

1232
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,440
reports because I do cosplay.

1233
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,120
Really?

1234
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,640
Yes.

1235
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:49,960
All right.

1236
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,960
It's fun to put, like, swinger advertisements

1237
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,720
on there and stuff.

1238
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,800
Dude, I'm going to do that at Fonami.

1239
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,920
Well, no, the big thing is, at least this

1240
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,400
has been tradition for me, is that if you are a cosplayer,

1241
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,640
especially doing something from something

1242
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,600
you know other people are going to be doing,

1243
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,080
you either post a meetup or look for other meetups.

1244
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,320
Oh, like the pictures that they all do.

1245
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:09,820
Exactly.

1246
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,320
Oh, OK.

1247
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,120
And there's also other groups meeting,

1248
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,080
like YaliCon had a bunch of doll fee collectors getting

1249
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,280
together, and that type of thing.

1250
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,920
The first place you go to is look at bulletin boards.

1251
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,000
Or the site forums.

1252
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,380
So once we find out Rama's room number,

1253
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,760
we can go to the bulletin board and paste a big sign that

1254
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,720
says, naked twister at 9 PM in this room.

1255
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,800
No.

1256
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1257
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Raven's dolphin.

1258
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,880
Hello, Raven's dolphin.

1259
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,560
What's on your mind, Raven's dolphin?

1260
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,400
The we in the lake story.

1261
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,440
The we in the lake story, yes.

1262
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,640
Well, I know many guys have taken a we in the lake

1263
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,720
once or twice in their lives, but oh, yes,

1264
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,960
the Nintendo we in the lake.

1265
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
What's up with that?

1266
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
What do you have to say about that?

1267
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,160
You know, I agree with the guy.

1268
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,480
Divorce is imminent.

1269
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,960
I would totally go like, bitch, go in the water

1270
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,120
and get my we.

1271
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,840
Are you single, Raven's dolphin?

1272
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah.

1273
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,000
Call it a hunch.

1274
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,500
How are we going to remain that way?

1275
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,800
Call it a hunch, but I think I know why.

1276
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,640
God, I'm so glad that in my house, both of us are gamers.

1277
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,240
That's true.

1278
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
I'm hearing an echo, Raven's dolphin.

1279
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,160
You need to fix that echo.

1280
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,820
You've called in this show enough time.

1281
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,280
Bad boy, bad, bad, bad.

1282
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,280
Yeah, so is that this guy's problem?

1283
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,640
Is that maybe he should have just

1284
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,720
married somebody who understood the game thing a little more

1285
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,040
in the first place?

1286
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,320
He should have married a gamer.

1287
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,680
Yeah, I agree with him.

1288
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,720
And so is that what you're doing, Raven's dolphin?

1289
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,440
You're holding out for your gaming girl of your dreams?

1290
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,920
I am.

1291
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,080
I just want her to understand about me and my gaming

1292
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,600
edition.

1293
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,040
And she throws the we out.

1294
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,960
It's over.

1295
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,880
You know what, though?

1296
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,720
People do stupid things when they fight.

1297
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,200
I mean, people smash car windows.

1298
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,560
They throw TVs and people's clothes on the lawn.

1299
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,880
I mean, when people want to fight, they fight.

1300
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,720
And it wouldn't matter if she was a gamer girl or not.

1301
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,600
Because if she knew, like, hey, this

1302
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,680
is how I'm going to get this guy's jugular.

1303
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,400
You know, I love him, but I want to kill him right now.

1304
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
You know, that's what she's going to do.

1305
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,480
So that's true.

1306
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,880
You just have to marry someone who

1307
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,000
can keep their temper in check.

1308
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,760
That's true.

1309
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,440
You're right.

1310
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,360
Oh, one more thing?

1311
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:13,880
Of course.

1312
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,760
What's up?

1313
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,400
This is a little old, but I thought

1314
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,320
that the Situa Wada thing was hilarious when you went,

1315
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,760
like, Reggie, you're not selling enough.

1316
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,360
Damn it, sell more.

1317
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,560
I'm not following.

1318
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,440
What was this news?

1319
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,240
It's been a while.

1320
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,200
Well, he said it was about the brain age.

1321
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,280
And he said, I only sold 10,000 of these.

1322
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,520
And you're up to sell 30,000.

1323
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,360
Reggie, why did you not sell 10,000 brain

1324
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,840
age or 30,000 versus Europe?

1325
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,840
And I find it hilarious, like, wow, he's pissed.

1326
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,240
Well, you know, even though they are these public figure

1327
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,040
heads that we see, you know, they still have a job to do.

1328
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,160
And ultimately, you know, when the game

1329
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,280
doesn't sell the way they expected it,

1330
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,480
the big, big bosses want to know why and what happened

1331
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,040
and who's head's got to roll, who's

1332
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,000
got to get fired because of it.

1333
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,120
Reggie ain't going to get fired.

1334
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,440
I know Reggie ain't going to get fired.

1335
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,120
Reggie's invincible.

1336
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,360
Reggie is a god among men.

1337
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,320
Reggie's invincible, but Iwata does have the power

1338
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,200
if he wanted to, you know, bust some Reggie heads.

1339
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,320
I mean, if the only, think about it,

1340
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,680
the only person in the entire world who

1341
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,280
gets to yell at Reggie, actually there's

1342
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,740
two people in the world who get to yell at Reggie, his wife

1343
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,240
and Iwata.

1344
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:29,840
That's true.

1345
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,080
That's it.

1346
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,320
Sorry for that thing.

1347
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,040
That's all right.

1348
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,880
I had the microphone too high.

1349
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,080
Life goes on.

1350
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,440
Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks for the call, as always.

1351
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,080
Of course, bye.

1352
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,640
Have a good one, buddy.

1353
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,760
Let's go to another call.

1354
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1355
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,640
Who's this?

1356
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,360
Hey, it's Aronimo.

1357
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,520
What's up, everyone?

1358
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,160
Hey, Jamie.

1359
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,680
What's up?

1360
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,320
Hi.

1361
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,040
Hey, Naked Twister, 9 o'clock, right?

1362
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,900
OK, before we start, there will be a $5 cover

1363
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,920
charge for the Drunk Show.

1364
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,000
Then there will be a $10 cover charge for Naked Twister.

1365
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,920
If you get in before the Editor Drunk Show,

1366
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,080
you can still qualify for Naked Twister.

1367
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,200
There is not going to be, seriously, Naked Twister.

1368
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,480
That is not happening, Rama.

1369
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,320
That's a joke, OK?

1370
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm just going to say that right here.

1371
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,240
There will not actually be Naked Twister in your room, anyway.

1372
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,600
Oh, like I'm going to stop it if someone calls for it.

1373
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,560
You know what's actually really funny about Fonomé?

1374
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,200
Did I talk about this on last week's show?

1375
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,080
I'm not sure if it was on the show,

1376
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,720
if I was talking about this with you in the car or something.

1377
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,960
But my boyfriend wants to go to Fonomé,

1378
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,720
which is funny because, well, not just,

1379
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,280
Shane's saying it's because he's Asian.

1380
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,320
That's why it's funny.

1381
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,680
That has nothing to do with it.

1382
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,960
No, but the reason why is because he's never really,

1383
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,360
he watches Fonomé.

1384
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,480
He's familiar with Fonomé.

1385
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,440
He probably knows more about it than I do.

1386
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,320
In fact, he had a Doraemon book in his car, and I'm like,

1387
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,160
oh, it's Doraemon.

1388
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,440
He's like, how in the hell did you know who that was?

1389
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,360
He always jokes that I'm more Asian than he is.

1390
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,480
Doraemon.

1391
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,800
Whatever.

1392
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,840
See, I'm not that Asian, apparently.

1393
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,720
But anyway, where was I going with this?

1394
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,840
Oh, yeah, he doesn't really like, he doesn't go to the,

1395
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,600
he wouldn't have no idea what to expect at the convention.

1396
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,680
He's like, you mean people dress up?

1397
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,240
I'm like, yeah, I'm like, you know,

1398
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,960
big girls like to dress up like Sailor Moon.

1399
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,800
It's fun.

1400
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,520
And he says, so I can go as Tuxedo Mask?

1401
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,160
They mistaken the whole Sailor Moon part

1402
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,440
as actually not being moon sized, you know.

1403
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,280
Anyhow, so.

1404
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,720
I'm dressing up this year.

1405
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,840
If he gets to observe all this, the drunken show

1406
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,400
and the jokes of Naked Twister, he's

1407
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,200
going to be like, Rob, what the hell do you do on Sunday nights?

1408
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,240
I have to, I have to have my skirt made.

1409
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,680
What do you, what do you cosplay as?

1410
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,960
I'm dressing as Jessica from Dragon Quest VIII.

1411
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
What?

1412
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,560
That's cute.

1413
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,120
I like that.

1414
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,640
I have to get my wig finished, though.

1415
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,400
Is there a rest of the posse?

1416
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,160
Is there?

1417
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,680
No, but Rob, you could cosplay.

1418
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,760
You could be the hero.

1419
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,920
I could.

1420
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,440
Why not?

1421
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,040
It'll be fun.

1422
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,360
And then I'll have to whip you.

1423
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,400
And Loki could be the little green goblin guy.

1424
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,760
I actually have a full bullet.

1425
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,520
I'm not dressing up like a goblin.

1426
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,120
Please do.

1427
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,480
That would be funny.

1428
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,800
So does that mean I have to bring the black mage costume

1429
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,640
this year?

1430
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,240
No, no black mage costume.

1431
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,440
I had fun with that, though.

1432
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,000
Hey, Rama, can I borrow a mage costume?

1433
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,160
Sure, I'll pack it.

1434
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,040
Rad.

1435
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,880
OK.

1436
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,200
Sorry.

1437
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,160
Because I have the red hair and all.

1438
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,280
SSJ100Matt in our chat room suggests

1439
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,040
that Loki should cosplay as Tingle.

1440
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,480
I am not dressing up like Tingle.

1441
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,360
Fuck no.

1442
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,240
All right, sorry Rama.

1443
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,920
What the hell would you call in for, anyway?

1444
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,200
Well, I wanted to say that I saw Resident Evil tonight.

1445
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,840
Wait, like the movie, the first one?

1446
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,800
Yeah, but it was called 28 Weeks Later.

1447
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,520
Really?

1448
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,080
OK, now spoiler free, please, because Miklotov and I both

1449
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,040
want to see this, but.

1450
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,120
Trust, do you have a strong stomach?

1451
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,240
I want to see it, because I love the undead.

1452
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,640
I mean, load the undead.

1453
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,360
Miklotov and I both scream like girls at bad violence,

1454
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,240
but that's part of the fun in going.

1455
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,160
You're going to scream.

1456
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,300
That's all I got to say.

1457
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,800
Really?

1458
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,560
Oh, Miklotov's already putting on a pouty face.

1459
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,920
But it's really good, though.

1460
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,360
I hear that there's a lot of bloody throw up

1461
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,080
stuff going on in that movie.

1462
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,360
And that's true.

1463
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,760
And I hate that.

1464
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,040
It's so gross.

1465
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,440
Rama, you know what you need to see

1466
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,520
if you haven't seen it yet when you're out here?

1467
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,000
What?

1468
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,680
Hot Fuzz.

1469
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,640
That's on my list.

1470
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,320
Well, maybe we could do it while we're out there.

1471
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,040
Come on, now.

1472
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,560
Yeah, that's what I just said.

1473
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,640
We can go see Hot Fuzz.

1474
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,600
Sorry, definitely.

1475
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,400
I eventually, I get to this point with anime conventions

1476
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,480
where like, what more can I buy, and how many more pictures

1477
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,560
can I be taken of?

1478
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,920
Let's just go somewhere.

1479
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,640
Miklotov, let's go see that movie tomorrow

1480
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,640
when I get back from LA.

1481
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,720
I'm going to cry.

1482
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,480
You don't really want to go back to San Francisco tomorrow,

1483
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,200
do you?

1484
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,440
No, I don't want to do that.

1485
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,160
Let's go see that movie and you can cry.

1486
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,680
Miklotov, Miklotov, suck it up.

1487
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,800
Dude.

1488
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,000
OK, I don't like zombies.

1489
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,400
I don't like that these people, even though they're not really

1490
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,840
zombies because they're not dead,

1491
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,480
they're people with a virus.

1492
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,160
But they're like zombies, and they throw up blood,

1493
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,040
and they run really fast, and it's

1494
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,440
going to scare the crap out of me.

1495
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,520
Here's some of the simple pleasures in life, Rama,

1496
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,720
so you understand.

1497
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,200
Yes, taking Shane to zombie movies,

1498
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,360
taking X to fur on roller coasters.

1499
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,440
These are the, oh my god, it's killing me.

1500
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,760
That was so funny.

1501
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,080
Anyhow, sorry, these are the little pleasures in life.

1502
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,640
This is why I'm convincing Shane to stay another day so we

1503
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,720
can go see the movie.

1504
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,200
Sweet.

1505
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,920
I'm just going to miss out on playing bus to move at work.

1506
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,800
You do know thousands of people, including your co-workers,

1507
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,600
some of them listen to this program, right?

1508
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,440
Why do I care?

1509
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,520
All right, just check it.

1510
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,240
Just want to make sure.

1511
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,400
They can all suck it.

1512
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,880
All thousands of listeners.

1513
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,960
I'm sorry, I'm inflating that number a lot.

1514
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,720
I meant dozens.

1515
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,160
All 14 listeners.

1516
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,520
All 14 listeners, four of which work at Konami.

1517
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,120
Yeah.

1518
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,840
Yeah.

1519
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,320
Whatever, I don't even care anymore.

1520
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,960
Rama, tell me something game related.

1521
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,520
Let's see, a couple of things.

1522
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,440
In response of last week, I have been listening

1523
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,840
to this show for about five years.

1524
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,600
It'll be six years in January.

1525
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,120
How is that possible when we've only

1526
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,920
been doing this show five years next month?

1527
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,760
I remember, or maybe I'm off by you.

1528
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,680
I do remember listening to you guys in 2002 or something.

1529
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,720
Well, yeah, we've been around since 2002, that's fair.

1530
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,200
Yes.

1531
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,700
OK.

1532
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,200
See?

1533
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,160
Yes, the station started in 2000.

1534
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,880
No, yeah, the station started in 2002.

1535
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,380
Longest train wreck ever.

1536
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:29,880
Forget it.

1537
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,460
Anyway, sorry.

1538
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,840
What, Rama?

1539
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,640
No, Dr. Tetsuya wanted to throw it out,

1540
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,640
so I accepted his challenge.

1541
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,720
Look, so, yeah, we start.

1542
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,480
Thank you, Junami.

1543
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,800
623 of 02 was the first live show.

1544
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,000
Hey, he's been affected by the number of coincidence

1545
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,680
Junami has.

1546
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,960
23 is the number of coincidence.

1547
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,520
Wait, what were you going to say, Rama,

1548
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,680
about you've been listening to this show for five years,

1549
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,760
and last week?

1550
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,840
No, I think it was last week when Dr. Tetsuya called

1551
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,280
and said about your biggest fans.

1552
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,720
You said it was me and Misty.

1553
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,240
I'm just trying to figure out how many years we've

1554
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,640
been listening.

1555
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,640
You know what's funny is I got an instant message from DDR

1556
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,280
Angel this week going, I heard I got brought up on the show

1557
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,600
last week.

1558
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,520
Yeah, because I am sure about it.

1559
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,440
She missed her, and I totally know.

1560
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,480
They all love you and miss you a lot, you know?

1561
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,040
I know, she kind of just disappeared.

1562
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,920
But I know she's got stuff going on in her personal life

1563
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,960
and stuff, and she's doing her thing.

1564
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,320
But that happens, is folks sometimes,

1565
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,560
they don't have time on Sunday nights anymore.

1566
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,720
But we hope you'll always remember us,

1567
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,080
and blah, blah, blah, blah, all that happy, lovey stuff.

1568
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,840
All right.

1569
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,840
The Rob D in chat says, Rama is such a fan

1570
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,960
that he's been listening to you since before you've

1571
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,160
been on the air.

1572
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,200
It means he was listening to Under Station.

1573
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,240
I was going to say, yeah, you could always get out of it

1574
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,840
by saying you were listening to Under Station Live.

1575
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,600
And I think that's how Dr. Tetsuya gets away with it,

1576
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,040
because I think he was listening to Under Station Live.

1577
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,240
Dr. Tetsuya has been there for every one of my multiple guest

1578
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,200
appearances.

1579
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,240
Crazy.

1580
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,480
And I filled in for people.

1581
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,040
I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Jessica.

1582
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,440
Crazy times, old school.

1583
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,040
Anyway, sorry, Rama.

1584
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,640
Anything else you want to share with us?

1585
01:06:59,640 --> 01:06:59,920
We're getting all this thought.

1586
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,360
I want to finish it off by saying,

1587
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,920
in case you guys haven't heard yet,

1588
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,320
we have a new video gamer in the world.

1589
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,480
Oh.

1590
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,280
You IMed me the other day.

1591
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,120
Yep.

1592
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,920
A new video, who's this?

1593
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
My sister, she gave birth to a bouncing baby boy

1594
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,680
last Wednesday.

1595
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,360
Aw, what's the boy's name?

1596
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,040
Isn't bouncing unhealthy for babies?

1597
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,440
Did she throw it on the ground to make sure it worked right?

1598
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:22,960
Stop.

1599
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,040
Yeah, as soon as he landed, he picked up the controller

1600
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,720
and started playing Street Fighter.

1601
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,360
That's awesome.

1602
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,560
On the first or second bounce.

1603
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,840
First.

1604
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,000
That's really awesome.

1605
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,520
You need to talk more on this program.

1606
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,880
All right, sorry, Rama, what's the kid's name?

1607
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,800
Gabriel Henley.

1608
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,920
Gabriel.

1609
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,400
Why are you laughing?

1610
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,600
Like Gabriel Knight, right?

1611
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,760
I believe so.

1612
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,880
Are you laughing because Gabriel is Siler's name?

1613
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,640
Is that?

1614
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,160
No.

1615
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,920
OK, all right.

1616
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,640
I like that name.

1617
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,040
Thank you for spoiling, Rob.

1618
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,000
There's.

1619
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,080
That's not a spoiler.

1620
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,480
I didn't spoil a god damn thing.

1621
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,280
It's not a spoiler.

1622
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,800
All right.

1623
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,920
That's just his real name.

1624
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,840
Like Siler, somebody's going to be named Siler.

1625
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,680
Maybe if you could like watch the show.

1626
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,760
I work with somebody named Mileena.

1627
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,120
Is that Siler?

1628
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,120
No, but she's named after a video game

1629
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,360
character from Mortal Kombat.

1630
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,840
Really, I work with someone named Katana.

1631
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,600
That's great.

1632
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,680
No, I lied.

1633
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,640
All right, Rama, we're going to let you go now,

1634
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,480
because your phone calls derail our show too much.

1635
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,880
Hey, it gets the attention.

1636
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,400
It gets people happy in the chat.

1637
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,240
I did my job.

1638
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,240
Bye.

1639
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,280
One more call.

1640
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,520
Oop, did I miss this one?

1641
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,040
Damn it.

1642
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,240
All right, whoever was trying to call, call again.

1643
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,560
Somebody from an 805 area code is trying to call in.

1644
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,040
I don't recognize that number, so try calling back.

1645
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,160
I won't say the whole number on the air.

1646
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,480
Call back, because I just barely missed the call.

1647
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,280
And that phone number's been hammering us for a little bit,

1648
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,680
so I wanted to get to it.

1649
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,640
There it is.

1650
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1651
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,760
Who's this?

1652
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,320
Hey, it's DJ Tyrant.

1653
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,440
Hey, DJ Tyrant.

1654
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,240
What's on your mind, buddy?

1655
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,120
Hey, not much.

1656
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,040
Just wanted to say off of your rant

1657
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,960
there about the gold spam in WoW.

1658
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,560
I just signed on to WoW, and the first thing that happened,

1659
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,800
not even 30 seconds after I logged in, I got messaged.

1660
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,120
What in the F is Blizzard going to do about that?

1661
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,240
They're not going to do anything about it.

1662
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:18,600
2.1, they're supposed to change some of the reporting of users

1663
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,160
and stuff like that.

1664
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,320
That's not going to do anything, because these are just

1665
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,600
those people taking advantage of the 10-day free trials.

1666
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,200
And you can make as many of those as you want.

1667
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,480
That's all it is.

1668
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,520
So I don't know what they can do except take away

1669
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,440
the 10-day free trials.

1670
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,960
Yeah.

1671
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,880
Or just have it like, OK, how hard would this be?

1672
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,760
You can message.

1673
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,360
How about this?

1674
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,160
You can message a person, but then you

1675
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,520
have to wait a minute before you can

1676
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,680
message a different person.

1677
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,040
Or if you use the 10-day free trials, you only get five tells.

1678
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,680
Yeah, throttle it somehow that way

1679
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,120
so you can't mass message people like these folks are doing.

1680
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,960
I don't know.

1681
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,000
Hopefully they'll do that.

1682
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,120
And have you seen Blizzard's updates?

1683
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,400
They're announcing their new progress

1684
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,320
on Friday or Saturday, I believe.

1685
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,000
It was the 19th, right?

1686
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,720
Yeah, I remember the news story about the fact

1687
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,080
that there's going to be an announcement on the 19th.

1688
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,520
But now, yeah, Blizzard, I did remember catching that.

1689
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,960
Blizzard has updated their website

1690
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,240
with their little timeline.

1691
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,080
Like, first we brought you Warcraft I,

1692
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:29,520
then Warcraft II and Diablo, and now who knows what's next?

1693
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,040
So it's kind of interesting.

1694
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,880
Speaking of WoW, is it OK if I promote

1695
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,720
some of my other little projects I have on the side?

1696
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,600
I suppose.

1697
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,800
OK.

1698
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,520
Well, I work for a World of Warcraft website,

1699
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,080
WoW.stratics.com, and we are having a developer chat

1700
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,360
on Tuesday.

1701
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,920
So submit your questions through the IRC channel there.

1702
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,920
It's WoW.stratics.com.

1703
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,840
And it's been announced on the WoW web page,

1704
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,360
so check it out if you're interested in asking

1705
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,280
the developers about the game or whatever.

1706
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,120
Awesome.

1707
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,200
And trying to make BlizzCon happen.

1708
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,740
I got to watch the moneys, but I want

1709
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,440
to go to BlizzCon really bad.

1710
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,280
Yeah, it'll be fun.

1711
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,280
WoW was a blast, and we'll probably

1712
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,040
see whatever they're going to announce this week there.

1713
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,880
We'll see.

1714
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,640
All right, buddy.

1715
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,080
We've got to let you go, but have a great one, OK?

1716
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,720
Thanks a lot.

1717
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,840
No problem.

1718
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,600
Bye-bye.

1719
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,480
Our resident WoW addict, DJ Tyran.

1720
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,320
Also, you can hear him on a show called STFU,

1721
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,360
which airs Thursday nights on this very network,

1722
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,240
but not for the next couple of weeks.

1723
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,440
They're taking a little bit of a break

1724
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,640
because we all need a break once in a while,

1725
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,120
but they'll be back pretty soon with more episodes.

1726
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,580
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1727
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,920
Who's this?

1728
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,160
This is your mother, Rob.

1729
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,840
Hi, Mom.

1730
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,680
I didn't know you were listening to the program.

1731
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,640
What's on your mind?

1732
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,520
You didn't call me for Mother's Day.

1733
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,040
You're a terrible son.

1734
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,600
I wish I never had you.

1735
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Well, I don't know if Alzheimer's

1736
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,040
said in early or something, but you

1737
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,160
might recall I actually took you out to lunch yesterday.

1738
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,560
That was yesterday.

1739
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,600
It's Mother's Day today.

1740
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,800
God, I'll tell you this right now

1741
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,640
in front of all your listeners.

1742
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,640
You were adopted.

1743
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,880
What?

1744
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,880
I was adopted?

1745
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,600
You were adopted.

1746
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,720
You mean just like my brother and sister, I was adopted?

1747
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,640
Yes.

1748
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,240
Who's my real mother?

1749
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,760
Well, I don't know because I traded you

1750
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,400
with some guy in a dark alley for a pack of smokes

1751
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,400
and a bottle of vodka.

1752
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,720
Mom, I didn't know you smoked and drank vodka.

1753
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,760
What's wrong with you?

1754
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,680
I used to.

1755
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,800
Did you smoke while you were pregnant?

1756
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,320
I hope not.

1757
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:55,960
Wait, no.

1758
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,520
Never mind.

1759
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,440
I was adopted.

1760
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,160
Did they smoke while I was pregnant?

1761
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,840
Yeah, but you didn't pay enough attention in school.

1762
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,720
That's why you're my least favorite son.

1763
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,760
I don't really know what else to say, Mom.

1764
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,920
You've embarrassed me in front of all the listeners,

1765
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,280
and I'm crying.

1766
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,320
By the way, what video games have you

1767
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,120
been playing this week, Mom?

1768
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:23,080
Well, I was trying to play that Wii thing you gave me,

1769
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:28,440
but there's too many damn buttons on the controller.

1770
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,960
The sad part is that really is something my mom would say.

1771
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,720
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1772
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:41,200
Maybe I should let you borrow the Xbox 360.

1773
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:41,760
What is that?

1774
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,360
One of those things that chinks like a disk

1775
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,800
because it's 360 degrees?

1776
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,680
Something like that.

1777
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,760
I'll have to explain it to you later.

1778
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,600
Well, thanks, Mom, for calling in, and happy Mother's Day.

1779
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,040
I begrudgingly love you, Rob.

1780
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,480
I love you, too, prank caller impersonating my mother.

1781
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,480
All right.

1782
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,760
What the fuck are our listeners smoking?

1783
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,920
Cocaine, Rob.

1784
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,380
And of course, now the chat room is

1785
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,880
ringing up Cooking Mama because there was the Wii there.

1786
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,000
I really don't know how to respond to that.

1787
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,600
You should respond by hanging up quicker.

1788
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,560
I guess so.

1789
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:25,840
All right.

1790
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,080
Anyway, that's definitely going to do it

1791
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,160
for the Skype line tonight.

1792
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,280
Congratulations, everybody.

1793
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,120
That call ruined it for the rest of you.

1794
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,280
We're going to go around and wrap up the show now

1795
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:37,880
by first off asking if there's any last minute stories here

1796
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,000
in the room.

1797
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,720
Any last minute stories?

1798
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,960
I have a last minute story.

1799
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,240
Rob, your mom's cool.

1800
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,040
What's that?

1801
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,520
I have two last minute stories.

1802
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,280
First, my Wii is back to Nintendo finally.

1803
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,360
After five months of being broken, that's a story.

1804
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,320
What took so long?

1805
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,500
Laziness.

1806
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,120
And I don't care about the Wii anymore whatsoever.

1807
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,000
I just wanted to start working so maybe when a good game comes

1808
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,760
out, I can play it.

1809
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,520
And then my last minute story is my Magikarp

1810
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,960
evolved into a Gyarados.

1811
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,800
Congratulations.

1812
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,320
Thank you.

1813
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,600
You know, this is completely inappropriate.

1814
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,640
But I feel like after that phone call,

1815
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,360
I have no choice but to do this.

1816
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
So we'll just give it a moment here.

1817
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,120
Oh, god.

1818
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:27,000
Hello?

1819
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,560
Hey, Dad.

1820
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,080
It's Rob.

1821
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,600
Yeah.

1822
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,160
Hey, how you doing?

1823
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,240
Good, how are you doing?

1824
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,880
Where you at?

1825
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,380
Good.

1826
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,800
I'm doing a radio program on the internet right now.

1827
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,960
You know the one that embarrasses you that I do?

1828
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,540
Yeah, I am.

1829
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,240
Yeah.

1830
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,680
All right.

1831
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,680
Is mom around?

1832
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,200
Yeah.

1833
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,960
Can you put her on real quick?

1834
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,840
Just a second.

1835
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,480
All right.

1836
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,720
Live radio, boys and girls.

1837
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,920
Have I mentioned that before?

1838
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,840
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

1839
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,800
Live radio while we wait.

1840
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,600
I'll play some music.

1841
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,760
I don't know what's going on.

1842
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,360
Hello?

1843
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,000
Hello, Mom?

1844
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,600
Yes.

1845
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,240
Hi, how are you?

1846
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,480
Hello?

1847
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,360
Hi.

1848
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,560
Can you hear me?

1849
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,120
Yeah.

1850
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,040
All right.

1851
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,440
Yeah, I'm live on the radio doing the internet program.

1852
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,560
And Jamie and Matt are here too.

1853
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,120
OK.

1854
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:20,640
Hi.

1855
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,260
And I was calling first off to say Happy Mother's Day

1856
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,520
officially.

1857
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,160
Thank you.

1858
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,760
But we had a caller just call in and impersonate you

1859
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,000
and said a lot of really mean things to me,

1860
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,920
like they were impersonating being my mom

1861
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,360
and really criticizing me.

1862
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,280
So I just called.

1863
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,720
Why were they impersonating me?

1864
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,640
They don't know me.

1865
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,020
I know, because some people are really mean on the internet,

1866
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,520
Mom.

1867
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,400
I don't know.

1868
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,720
But they were calling and saying that I know people are rude.

1869
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,040
I shouldn't take those things so seriously, huh?

1870
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,560
What did they say?

1871
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,600
What were they saying?

1872
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,720
They were saying that, oh.

1873
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,800
That you were trading for vodka and cigarettes.

1874
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,440
Yes, that you traded me for vodka and cigarettes.

1875
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,040
Is that true?

1876
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,000
No.

1877
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,240
And I wasn't adopted?

1878
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,200
No.

1879
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,660
OK, just making sure.

1880
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,040
My mom doesn't know how crazy people on the internet are.

1881
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,320
Well, hey, Mom, I want to ask you.

1882
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,080
You know, when I was growing up, what did you think?

1883
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,240
I played a lot of video games when I was growing up, huh?

1884
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,000
Tons.

1885
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,800
Tons.

1886
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,800
Why did you let me play so many video games?

1887
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,520
Because I was an idiot.

1888
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,760
Did you ever think that it would turn into something like this,

1889
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,960
where I would have a radio program on the internet

1890
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,640
with Jamie and Matt here for the past five years

1891
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,360
talking about games?

1892
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,560
Not in my weirdest dreams.

1893
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,600
I know, it's kind of weird.

1894
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,480
How come you never played video games with me?

1895
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,960
I don't like games.

1896
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,480
Why not?

1897
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,440
What did the games do to you?

1898
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,320
I don't know, they're boring.

1899
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,200
So they're boring?

1900
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,800
I used to play card games with you.

1901
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,560
Yeah, I know, but card games aren't the same thing.

1902
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,520
Well, video games are too fast paced or something.

1903
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,560
There's something.

1904
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,480
I don't have the coordination.

1905
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,400
Well, you know, but if you played them more often,

1906
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,480
you could build up the coordination.

1907
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,400
Maybe, but why would I want to do that?

1908
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,040
All right.

1909
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,640
Hey, our chat room over at chat.orangelandradio.com,

1910
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,600
they're really liking you, Mom.

1911
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,160
JV Monn says she is awesome.

1912
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,880
DDR Dollar Bill says my mom would say the exact same thing.

1913
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,800
The Rob D says she's so happy about that fact.

1914
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,680
Oh, really?

1915
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,460
Yeah.

1916
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,340
So you're popular.

1917
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,600
You should come on the show sometime.

1918
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,720
I have been on it before, remember?

1919
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,240
When I told the whole world about you

1920
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,600
wearing the pink bunny suit?

1921
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,360
Actually, that was a different show

1922
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,000
that I did before Orange Lounge Radio.

1923
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,880
But thanks so much for resharing that story.

1924
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,120
I appreciate it.

1925
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,000
All right, so well, that's it.

1926
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,800
I just wanted the world to see that that last call was not

1927
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,560
really my mother.

1928
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,400
You really had a mother, and you didn't hatch out of an egg.

1929
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,520
Exactly, exactly.

1930
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,040
We have other theories about how Rob came to be.

1931
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,800
Well, when he was four years old,

1932
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,480
he was like a little old man.

1933
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,600
And then when he got to high school,

1934
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600
he reverted back to childhood.

1935
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,600
What the hell do you mean I was a little old man when

1936
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,080
I was four years old?

1937
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:20,640
You were.

1938
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,160
You were like a little old man.

1939
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,320
You used to order everybody around.

1940
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,920
You were like the boss.

1941
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,360
I still do that.

1942
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,560
You were the boss of me when you were four.

1943
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,640
Did video games make me that way?

1944
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,920
You were just really, you know, you were in an adult world.

1945
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,400
You didn't have a lot of other children around.

1946
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,920
Let's not get into the family drama here on the internet,

1947
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,400
where lots of people are listening.

1948
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,160
So you kind of were old for your age.

1949
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,560
How do I say it?

1950
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,840
And then when you got into high school, it was like,

1951
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,040
what did I miss?

1952
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,640
And then so you started being a child,

1953
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,920
dressing up like Courtney Love and doing a dance.

1954
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,280
You do know this is a radio program about video games,

1955
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:10,800
right?

1956
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,520
And to clarify for the listeners,

1957
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,040
that was the lip sync contest I entered once.

1958
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,080
I'm so glad we have a new story to talk about now.

1959
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,080
I already knew that one.

1960
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,240
No, that's a new one.

1961
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,480
Yeah, and the lips excited.

1962
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,760
And everyone can forget about the story

1963
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,840
my mom talked about me being a smart ass.

1964
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,800
Look, suddenly Irene has appeared out of nowhere.

1965
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,840
I heard lip syncing contest, and it's a chance to embarrass you.

1966
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,520
So I have to open it on this.

1967
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,560
Jesus.

1968
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,320
When I was in high school, we participated

1969
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,080
in this lip sync contest.

1970
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,960
And it was me and my two friends.

1971
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,080
And we did Hole by Violet.

1972
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,200
You know, go on, take everything.

1973
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,000
And I dressed up like Courtney Love.

1974
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,480
And my friend dressed up like a Catholic schoolgirl.

1975
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,000
And my other friend dressed up like Drag Queen.

1976
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,920
And we all went out there and sang this song.

1977
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,600
And we came in last place because my school

1978
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,880
was dominated by Mormons and other religious

1979
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,560
fundamentalists.

1980
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,920
And they just didn't get it.

1981
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,600
But we had fun.

1982
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,400
Maybe you were just terrible at it.

1983
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,200
And I smoked a cigarette on stage, and my wig fell off.

1984
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,480
It was awesome.

1985
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,360
That's the best part.

1986
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,480
Did you film this at all?

1987
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Did anyone have to do?

1988
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,040
I think it was on public access.

1989
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,520
I need to see this.

1990
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,880
But I really actually need to go, so bye.

1991
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,800
All right, bye.

1992
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,840
Anyway, sorry, mom.

1993
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,240
Thanks, mom, for bringing that up.

1994
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,040
I appreciate that.

1995
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,880
Oh, OK.

1996
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,160
What about all the good things I did?

1997
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,640
Would you be one thing?

1998
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,800
Please tell the listeners about some good things I did.

1999
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Didn't it make you proud when Orange Lounge Radio

2000
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,840
was in the newspaper and on the local news?

2001
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,480
Uh-huh.

2002
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,560
Good.

2003
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,640
Very.

2004
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,120
She sounds so convinced.

2005
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,120
All right, mom, I appreciate you calling.

2006
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,480
I just wanted the listeners to see what my mom was really

2007
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,080
like, so there you go.

2008
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:01,240
Well, she's like a female rob.

2009
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,520
So a rob.

2010
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,120
Shut up, Shane.

2011
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,240
All right, mom, thanks so much for playing along.

2012
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,240
I appreciate it.

2013
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,520
You always know on Mother's Day or something

2014
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,120
to expect something like this, so I appreciate it.

2015
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
I love you.

2016
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,720
I was waiting for you to call, actually.

2017
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,000
I love you.

2018
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,520
And so do all the chatters.

2019
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,120
All right.

2020
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,800
All right, take care.

2021
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,600
Happy Mother's Day.

2022
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,120
Bye.

2023
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,880
Bye, friends.

2024
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,360
Bye.

2025
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,000
Did she say, bye, friend?

2026
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,760
I think she did.

2027
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,440
I think she's like, bye, friend.

2028
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,560
She said, friends.

2029
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,640
Oh, bye, friends.

2030
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,360
Yeah.

2031
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,480
That had nothing to do with you.

2032
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:33,680
I like your mom.

2033
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:33,920
I know.

2034
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,560
She's funny.

2035
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,120
I've met your mom in person.

2036
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,960
I like your mom, too, because of the whole.

2037
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,720
Why don't we call my mom next week?

2038
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,120
Well, we just might have to.

2039
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,280
Or maybe, you know, who knows, it

2040
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,760
might be her birthday or something.

2041
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,160
My mom's birthday's in November.

2042
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,400
Oh, it's a ways off.

2043
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,000
We'll see.

2044
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,760
Anyway, sorry.

2045
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,640
My mom's going to be 49, no, 48.

2046
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,000
My mom's going to be 49.

2047
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,960
I keep forgetting.

2048
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,520
This is actually part of the podcast,

2049
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,320
so folks have downloaded this show going, what the hell?

2050
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,520
However, I would like to see, I do have a request.

2051
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,600
Those of you guys that got your iTunes reviews rejected

2052
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,600
last week for, you know, it's like pissing in a sea of piss

2053
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,400
or whatever it was.

2054
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,440
Like, iTunes was rejecting the word piss.

2055
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,000
Maybe you guys want to say, this show

2056
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,280
is wonderful because Rob's mom was on it.

2057
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:18,840
I don't know.

2058
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,720
That would be great.

2059
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,480
My mom would like that.

2060
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,200
I could show it to her.

2061
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,200
And she'd be like, what?

2062
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,280
I don't get it.

2063
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,320
So there you go.

2064
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:24,840
All right.

2065
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,200
Anyhow, we got to wrap it up.

2066
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,560
Any last minute stories for real?

2067
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,560
No.

2068
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,560
All right, nothing for you, Logie?

2069
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,120
I'm surprised.

2070
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,640
He's distracted by the interwebs.

2071
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,120
I know.

2072
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,280
What are you doing on the internet?

2073
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,320
Stuff.

2074
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,200
All right.

2075
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,840
Crisis Corps coming out in Japan September 13.

2076
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,360
There you go.

2077
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,160
There you go.

2078
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,120
All right, well, then let's go around and get

2079
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,400
everybody's final thoughts.

2080
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,400
Shane, thank you for being on the show,

2081
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,520
even though you never say anything.

2082
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,320
But when you do, it's once in a while pretty funny.

2083
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,440
It's always funny.

2084
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,160
All right, so your final thought, Shane?

2085
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,000
I don't know.

2086
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,800
All right, thanks.

2087
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,720
Thanks for sharing.

2088
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,280
All right, Logie, your final thought?

2089
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,640
Stupid postage is going up to $0.41 tomorrow.

2090
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,760
My final thought is zombie movie, Shane.

2091
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,240
We're going to be fun.

2092
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,600
DarkSakura, your final thought?

2093
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,720
I have ice cream at home that's low sugar, and I can eat it.

2094
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,600
I ate a whole thing of ice cream on Friday

2095
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,440
because I was having a bad day, and I didn't eat that.

2096
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,560
But it was really good.

2097
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,640
So don't point at my fat.

2098
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,600
All right.

2099
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,280
I'm going to take you to see Run Fat Boy Run

2100
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,320
when it's in the theater.

2101
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,120
All right.

2102
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,080
All right, well, that's going to do it for another week

2103
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,120
here of Orange Lounge Radio.

2104
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,640

that allow you to rank a podcast.

2117
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,240
