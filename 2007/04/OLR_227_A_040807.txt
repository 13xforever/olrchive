Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and what you, the gamer, really want to know
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers
I like Frappuccinos
And I like the new Cinnamon Dulce one
Dulce
I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me, Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it
I thought that was wrong, I thought it was Dulce
That's like, um, Versace
I guess so, that's probably true
Nice reference to my favorite movie ever, love it
I thought you would appreciate that
Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Lounge Radio, Loki!
I'm just kidding, I don't know, I had to work in a showgirl's segue somehow
I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl, but
Well then showboy
Okay
Alright, well say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl, I'm not sure, are you gonna get topless for us tonight?
Maybe
Alright, say hello to Amanda
Hi
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?
Good, now you haven't been on the, I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long long time, right?
Very little brief snippets
Don't forget you gotta almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it
Alright, very good, very good
So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right? Have you?
Yeah
Okay
I've been out there
Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio
Like, briefly
Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners, what type of video games do you like?
I like the Wii
You like the Wii?
Wii!
I like puzzle games, that's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff
What have you been playing on your Wii lately?
Uh, WarioWare
WarioWare?
Yeah
That's a fun game
And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff
What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?
I don't know
Um, like, the Bubble Bobble, or the thing where you shoot the little marbles up at the-
Bubble Bobble, you're barely getting picked up, sweetie, you can see yourself in-
Sorry
That's right, Bubble Bobble
Bubble Bobble, yes
That's right
Sounds good
That's Puzzle Bobble
Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide-
Bust a Move
Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it
Alright
I also like bar games, like the little, like, where you put a quarter in and you get a game and you have to, like-
Oh, like the touch screen games at the bars?
Yes
There's an arcade game that's very popular that people don't talk about very often
Those little, what do they call that, the Quartermaster, what are those things called?
Touch Something?
I don't know
Touch Master, I think
Touch Master, I don't know what the hell they're called
Like the one where you have to, like, where you have to get, like, all the groups of, like, two or three or more color blocks and reduce them
I like that, like the blockus, or no, I don't know if it's blockus, something
Alright, sounds like fun
Well, welcome to the show
Thank you
You're in our-
Mega Touch
You're in our chat room under your-
Omega Touch, thank you, whoever, who said that in chat?
That was, um-
Dark Tetsuya
Yeah
Good man, Dark Tetsuya
I'm sorry, I thought it said D Teaser
I'm like, what do you, what's the D that you're teasing?
Alright, um, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on the Sunday night, chat.orangelaungeradio.com
And, uh, Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight, she'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate
As she deems appropriate
Okay
Alright, um, let's go around and talk about our gaming weeks, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
Pretty non-existent given that I was, um, doing my, uh, last few, uh, massages this week
Um, I actually did finish my final on Tuesday, and, um, however, I am getting back into, uh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance because, um, Deadpool is awesome
Um, I, uh, for anyone who has access to my live journal, I put a, uh, link up there of, like, the funniest thing ever
Um, and I've been, um, screaming at our Twilight Zone pinball machine, like, loudly, because, um, I don't know, the machine's a bastard
I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone
Rob's got tea
Sorry, I stepped out for a minute, we can do that in radio, what, I heard you lost your balls over the week?
No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag
I see
No, um, I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there, got into the zone, you know
Oh, those balls
You know, don't touch the door thing
I'd get in the zone and then drain
So, your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone
And Deadpool
Alright
I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics, too
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
Um, I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2070
God, this is gonna become the new, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week
Because it's fun and stupid
I mean, let's put it this way, there's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game, I mean, you can fly up, it's like, 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground, fine
Just, you know, like nothing happened, helicopter will land down there and do it again
Um, so I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, easy on it
Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?
You can do two player co-op
Oh, there you go
And it's a lot of fun, really the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them
And, um, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on the easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels, um, and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet
So, you can actually get one weapon, it's called the genocide gun, that does a million damage, like, to an area of like 72 meters or whatever
It's just, you really have to watch out launching that thing because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that
Unfortunately you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible
Um, other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of, what was it, um, uh, Honeycomb Beats, yeah, and that was okay, I'm not very interested in it though, not my thing
Was that why you gave me your copy?
Yes
Sweet! I got free games from Loki today
Yay!
And then, um
Now I just have to find my DS, I seriously cannot find my DS
I played, um, played Crackdown a bit, that was kind of fun, um, I played another game, which I can't talk about though right now, due to an NDA, but it wasn't as fun as it would seem
Wait a minute, when did Loki start listening to NDAs on this program? This is something, what happened?
I don't think this stuff wasn't associated with an NDA right now
Well, it's a game for the Xbox Live, um, or not the Xbox Live, the games for Windows Live Beta, they're doing that cross-
Lawsuit
Cross play thing, and there's a game you play to test it, and it's stupid, but
I don't want you to get sued
Either way though, it's neat, I guess, I was, and the leaderboards for it though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people
Should, um, come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will, cause they start doing the commentary
I like jumping, my name is Bob, and I like to jump
That's the whole theme of Crackdown by the way, is to jump everywhere you go
Wow
Jump a lot
I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like at the top of bridges and stuff
That part was fun
And then, um, I don't know, just pure killing people
I like the jumping
And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun
Looking at some comments from Chatroom, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made
Uh, JeremyTau1 says, hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers
They do have like a versus mode in that, I don't know how well that would be
Ion671 says, it is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense
And JeremyTau1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?
Too many
Alright, there you go
Um, my gaming week, I played a game called, uh, what was it?
Tidepool Explorer
Because I went to the Monterey Aquarium
Because William took me to Monterey this weekend and it surprised me with a nice little weekend thing
So we went to Monterey and um, and you know, it got me thinking like
They got these cool little educational things for kids
And it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had
Uh, like you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
Remember that, Rocky's Boots, and what were the other MECC games?
Oregon Trail, I guess
Number Munchers
Number Munchers, hell yeah
Like, oh, I'm gonna write this whole Nostalgia article for the community all-game site
Turtle
Turtle?
Oh, or what was that, what was the language? Logo?
Was that the language they made us all learn in like third grade?
We had the turtle?
Yeah
Like, drop pen, 30 north or something
Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn
Um, so yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was the little game where you walk
But it was like, it was like you had two screens
Like, they had four people playing it at once
And you had this big screen in the middle
And then you had a little screen right in front of you
Like an old, uh, picture one of those, um, what do they call them?
Tabletop, like Ms. Pac-Man?
What do they call those games back in the day when they had the, is it just tabletop?
Cocktail?
Cocktail, it was like a cocktail machine
And uh, yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the tidepools
And on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say
Um, pick up, you know, uh, so you could like pick up the shell
Or you could, you know, throw away, like if you found a trash can you could throw it away
Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to like
You know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tidepools and what you can't
So it's just kind of neat
This old stingray will stab you through the heart
Crikey! Um, but yeah, William commented, I know he was like
Oh, that looks like a DS game, and it kind of was
So, I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things
Usually when I see educational games I try to figure out how to break them, but you know
And then we saw, we saw, um, um, penguins
And that made me very happy, not a video game, like actual live penguins
That made me very happy, that's why we went to the aquarium in the first place
We need to get you like your own copy of Portable Pango
Oh, I love Pango, that's one of my favorite games, it's a good game
Alright, it's on that Konami game thing
Is it really? Sweet!
Oh wait, not Puyen, Puyen's different
Oh, maybe it's Puyen
Yeah, Puyen's way different, Puyen's like the free little pig
Puyen's like the dumb little bubble game
Yeah, I had that when I was 64
Wait, I don't know, it says on the back
Pango was a Sega game, wasn't it? I took it in my room
Wasn't Pango a Sega game?
Maybe it was
I think it was
Um, now I've got to find out
Nah
Alright, anywho, uh, let's see, what else?
Oh, but so actual games I really did play, uh, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, hello
Pango is by Sega
Thank you, um, was that from Wikipedia? Or from chat?
No, it was from Google
Alright, sweet
Um, Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the Playstation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on
So I knew to wait and not buy it on Playstation 2, so it's been a long time since I've played Guitar Hero
Because the first one kind of wore off for me
And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2, it's fun
Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did
I don't know, I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs, and there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game
But, you know, it's cool
I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child in mind
I mean, come on, like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero 2?
Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?
It does have a animation thing in the beginning, I don't know if it's the same as commercial
Where they're, like, uh, fighting off a meteor or something like that?
I'm not sure, but there's unlockable videos, I haven't unlocked them yet though
That was awesome, that actually kind of would make me want to buy the game, because it's kind of badass
I don't know
Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, Guitar Hero 2 is fun
Graphics, obviously a step up from the Playstation 2 because it supports widescreen
It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics
The controller itself works pretty good
My whammy bar seems screwy, but now I'm hearing there's a recall
So I bet you anything I got one of those guitars
I did
Did you really?
I haven't played it yet, so
Shit
We'll check mine live on air a little later
If you have one, I probably have one too, because ours came from the same place
Yeah, they basically said it was, like, two different versions of it or something
It's, like, I think it's something probably easy to fix, but, you know
I knew my whammy bar seemed screwy for some reason, but anyway
But, uh, yeah, I mean, there's lots of stuff to unlock
I like the leaderboards
I hear a lot of people saying they can't do online co-op though
They can't do online co-op because, heaven forbid, lag gets in the game
But then I'm thinking, well, DDR kind of has online co-op, and that works, even with the lag
I mean, granted, guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it
So you wouldn't be able to really, I mean, that would be the lagged part
Whereas DDR, you know, the way DDR gets away with it
Is it kind of shows you the steps with, or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag
But it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that
You're playing your own game
So I think they could do it
They just would have to get creative with how the music track plays
You know what I mean?
They obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes
When you screw up, it goes, you know, those little things
Well then they have, like, amplitude online
I have to displace those
And where you could do co-op with amplitude and stuff like that
I'm almost positive they did
Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, they had amplitude
So I'm pretty sure it can be done
I don't know
DevilKai in chat says
Hey Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version
Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.
This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way
It does seem like the pick is a little bit different
If you're getting lag, I would urge you to go into the video options
Hit start and go into the video options
And you can actually calibrate your screen
Because some HDTVs have the lag
Because of the upscaling or whatever it does
I don't know
You really shouldn't have that on an Xbox 360 though
Because it has a native HD signal
But I know either way
If you're getting screwy lag
You can go in and calibrate it
But it's a little hard to find
You wouldn't know that unless you read the manual
So check that out
Anyway, Guitar Hero 2, I do recommend it
Especially if you don't already own the PS2 version
It's good times
It's kind of expensive though
If you already own the PS2 version
You might want to question how important is it to you to have it on next gen
Because I don't know
Granted, there's a couple new songs
Some slightly prettier graphics and the whole online leaderboards
You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you
Oh, speaking of achievement points real quick
There's some really screwy ones in there
You fail a song on easy and get 10 points
You play a left-handed song and get 10 points
You beat tutorial and get 10 points
It seems like some of the scores are mis-weighted
I think if you fail a song on easy
It should be one of those ghost achievements
Kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles
Where it's just on your record
But it's zero gamer score
Or Dead or Alive has one too
I think if you lose 10 battles in a row
That goes on your gamer card
But you don't get any gamer points for it
And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other
Beat a song, perfect
Because you only get 10 points for getting a perfect 100% on a song
I think
Might have been 10 or 30
But it just seems some of the scores are mis-weighted
That's what you get for having 50 achievements in a damn game
But that's kind of cool
Because I'd rather have that than 10 achievements
That are really hard or really easy
You know what I mean?
It feels a little spread out having the 50
To me
But anyway
Alright, Mandarin
I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week
Because they already talked about games
Are there any games specifically this week you've been into?
We wound up playing doctor and nurse
Oh, you mean video games?
Video games, sweetie, video games
Tom beat Zelda finally
I watched him beat it, sort of
I was in and out of the room
Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?
Yes
Sweet
Other than that we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point
Heck yeah, I want that too
That's pretty much about it right now
Since we've just been busy with other things
Like fucking?
Like fixing my bike
My motorcycle
Fixing your bike
Yes
Do you ride a bike to work?
No, not yet
Are you going to ride a bike to work?
Once I get my license
Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?
It's something we saw at E3 a couple of years ago
It's a little exercise bike but it's a game
Where it's on the street
But the graphics were kind of horrible if I remember right
It looked like
God, what was that Sega Master System game?
I think it came with every Sega system
That was like a motorcycle game
I can't remember
Hang on?
Yes, it was Hang On
It looked like Hang On to me
Alright
DarkShyInChat says Dr. Mario and Peach Live
Is that what your house is like, Amanda?
Dr. Mario and Peach Live?
No
Alright
Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us
I'm looking at chat
Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well
chat.orangelaunchradio.com
Also talking about the achievements
Blaze says
I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements
Microsoft does regulate it to some extent
Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?
I think 50 is the max and they raised it up to 50
Did they?
Interesting
Let's see
JeremyTod1 says
I think they should have negative achievements
Where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much
That would be interesting
But I do think having the ghost achievement points is kind of cool
Like the ones that are worth nothing
That are just stuck on your gamer card
You have fallen down a hole, champagne
Alright
Let's see, anyway
Let's go to some housekeeping for tonight
I don't really have a lot
So I will just say
Please listen to our spinoff programming
DarkSakura was unable to pump up the volume this week
Because Comcast went down, right?
Yes, it did
Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem
But it turned out that it was just a temporary
Alright, so Tuesday nights
You can listen to DarkSakura take your request
7pm or 7.30?
I can never remember
7.30
7.30pm Pacific, right here on orangelauncherady.com
Wednesday nights, guys on the show
7 o'clock Pacific time
Thursday nights, STFU
Also at 7 o'clock Pacific time
Is there still a club, OLR?
There is
There is, I put new episodes up there
Or reruns
Club OLR has been getting low ratings
So we're thinking of moving it
And putting something else on Friday nights
But if you want to save Club OLR
Friday nights at 7 o'clock
Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings
We'll see
No, that's right, your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings
No, what about your shows?
Oh, that's true, one of my shows did
No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings
That's just the excuse
The first case of the Mondays
I mean, it's internet radio, people
We have low ratings anyway
We don't care
But we always use that as an excuse
The thing is, it takes a long time
To create that damn show
And wife doesn't like that
And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together
It's awesome, and unfortunately you can't broadcast it
Yeah, I was working on stuff
I was actually doing a happy hardcore one
But I stopped
For some reason
I ran out of material
Let's see what happens
Let's see, Saturday at 7 o'clock Pacific
Is Travis Donovan Live
Our old buddy from Understation Live does his own show
No, he cancelled it
I heard about that
I heard there was a really nasty April Fools joke
He had people calling in, like, crying in the whole works
It was awesome
And then he said, screw you, April Fools
What a little bastard
Listen to that little bastard, Travis Donovan
On Saturday nights at 7 Pacific
Welcome to tonight's gaming news
I'll start it off
Talking about the Xbox 360
Some information has leaked
About the spring dashboard update
And this leak comes to you
Courtesy of GameSpot
Good job, guys
Yeah, I'm sure it was really leaked
It wasn't a planned release or something
I'm totally sure that was
Well, probably the article went up a couple days before it was supposed to
I imagine
Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight
And that was going to be it
Oh wait, no, I think actually he's off because of Easter
I've been following him on Twitter
I have a Twitter account now
So I could be like Major Nelson and Gamer Andy
Because I want to be cool like them
I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something
It's kind of a stalker site
Which kind of worries me
So I don't post about things as I'm doing them
I post about things after the fact
You know what I mean?
It's really the cheesy thing
It asks, what are you doing right now?
You're supposed to type in what you're doing right now
For instance, I think the last thing I put
Is I'm listening to the new Bjork song
While I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight
You're supposed to use 140 characters or less
But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update
Or IM to update
So it's kind of interesting
It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only 150 characters
So it forces you to be quick
I don't know, it's weird
But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it
And I've been following him on there
And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite
What are you doing right now?
I'm updating my Twitter account
What are you doing right now?
I'm updating my Twitter account
Alright
It's twitter.com.sky
How did we get on that?
The spring dashboard update
Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?
No
Because I bet you anything this is totally planned
Fucking corporate
They pay good money to leak the stories
I mean, I say this
The corporate website does not leak stories, okay?
It's not a leak
It's a fucking planned PR thing
That's disguised as a leak
Because there's...no
I'm sorry
I don't know
I want to say you corporate fuckers
Even though GameSpot's okay and all
It just irritates me
It's still news
So the update is supposed to come May 7th
And Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated
Some of you know this is MSM Messenger
So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360
So if you have people who aren't on
Xbox Live
You can still communicate to them through MSM Messenger
Because they know most people use AIM
So they're trying to really take a step up
I think with MSM Messenger
And what was interesting about that
Is I saw in the video that they had posted
That you can actually push the button
And use Messenger during a game
Like you could be playing a game
And you know how like right now you can bring up the sidebar
And send messages on Xbox Live and all that
Well you can bring up like a little chat window
And chat with people right in the middle of the game
So that's kind of interesting
Sorry I could be winning my game
But instead I got a pop-up coming
I'm talking to you
But that could be, I don't know
That could be kind of fun for some of those
I don't know, little arcade games and stuff
That you play, that you take turns
I don't know
You know how they call it blades
When you're going across the 360 menu
Marketplace will now have its own blade
Users are now getting inline achievement updates
Supposedly you're going to be able to see
How many points the achievement was
What the achievement is
It's like you know how right now it says achievement unlock
Little sound comes up right
You can actually now know what it is you're getting
Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get
Especially when we did something stupid
I fell in a manhole five times
Why did that unlock an achievement
Low power download mode
And auto shutdown
For those long movie downloads
You can also watch partially downloaded movies
Now you don't have to wait for the whole thing to download
And again that messenger
Will work with up to six friends
At once and other little tweaks
On the user interface
So that is the big spring dashboard update
Information leaked to the internet
Sounds kind of fun
I wish I knew people that actually used MSN
Messenger
But as it is everybody owns AIM
You use it?
Every once in a while
I have a few contacts that are primarily
On there and I just kind of keep it open
With a trillion
But don't use too many people on there
Would you want to talk to me on
Xbox while I'm playing Halo
Would you like to send me messages like you suck at Halo
Rob
You suck at Halo Rob
No one needs to actually tell you that don't you already know
Sadly yes
I do know
It's not a fucking joke people
I really suck at Halo
Supposedly
In MSN Messenger
You're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo
It's going to tell you what game I'm playing
So you can stalk me more
Don't you want to stalk me Mandarin?
She's giving me a funny look
Anyway there you go spring dashboard update
Awesome
Now if you're thinking about possibly buying
One of those Xbox 360 elite systems
There's a few things you might want to know
About the HDMI
First off that it will ship with
HDMI version 1.2
As opposed to latest version 1.3
Now what does that mean
For you
Well not too much as far as
Video is concerned however
Audio though if you want some
Really cool audio you're not going to be able to use
Dolby TrueHD
And DTS HD
Master audio streams
It's not really a problem I think for most people
Most people who I use the HDMI for
You know the video
And then you know digital out
For audio I mean really it's not that big
A difference but
I mean if you really want to get down to it
That's a problem for some people I guess
But anyways
Other differences include
They actually have this
New audio lip sync technology
I don't really know
Where that would come to play with games
Better transfer speeds
And of course if you were
Outputting above 1080p
Which you're not going to be doing right now
At least not anytime soon
Audio lip sync technology would that be like
You know how like in Kingdom Hearts
Because they didn't bother to resync the lips
From the Japanese version
The lips are all off sync with the English words
Like is that maybe what they're talking about
Like maybe you can sync that better
Maybe
Just audio is really the issue right now
I don't know
I don't really think that's a big deal
I mean
Like I
Optical is awesome I mean unless you really
Are spending the big money for you know
Your system or something
I don't really think that would be a huge deal
But then again you watch it next week
There will be a press release from Sony
Saying well we support true HD audio
We're the fucking next generation
You guys are not
I mean I can't wait to see
The press release because I know what's going to happen
Sony is more HD than your mom
There's the press release right there
Um
Yeah
So guess what there's some sad news
Sniff
Apparently
Our friends
At Rooster Teeth
Which as far as
I understand was supposed to originally be called
Cockbite
Rooster Teeth
That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite
Um
They are um
Stopping at uh
Episode 100 for Red vs Blue
They posted it on their
On their forum
But you want to know what
I call bullshit because it was posted on April 1st
Ah
But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week
It has and I don't see
Um
I've been looking through the whole thing and I don't see
Any type of uh
Disclaimer
Hmm
But I still call bullshit
They're just going to move on to Halo 3 and do a new
Either relaunch Red vs Blue
Or do something else
It's like you're ending one series and another's beginning
It's like you know
The end of Star Trek
And the beginning of Star Trek The Next Generation
There you go that's a good analogy
Very very nerdy of you
You get kudos
But think about this guys
In iTunes seriously like if you look up Video Game Podcast
Which would you download first
The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio
Or the podcast called Cockbite
Cockbite Radio
I don't know
It's tempting
For five years we might have to change our name
We should just call our show
The Naked Lesbian Boobs
Rock Music
And Drug Show
It's called Games Games Games
I think there already is a show called
Games Games Games
There's so many
I remember when we started podcasting
There were maybe like five video game shows
We should call it Look Boobies
There were like five video game
Mandarin did you just show your boobs at studio?
There were like maybe five video game
Podcasts and all and now there's like five hundred
All right
She flashed her abdomen at you
All right anyway
Sigh
Anyway
Going on to the marketplace
Why isn't there more
Red vs Blue downloadable in the marketplace
I thought they were going to do all these viral videos
And things like they have this whole section
Of marketplace for viral videos
But I can't get Lonely Girl
I can't get Alanis's My Humps
I can't get any of that YouTube
Stuff on
Microsoft Marketplace
In charge of the backwards compatibility updates
Aha touche
Good job
Well what they will have on marketplace pretty soon
Is the Forza 2 demo
There were rumors this week
That a downloadable demo will be coming
The timing though
Is still unknown
So supposedly though the game
Is coming out in May
If the information is supposed to be confirmed
Soon
The demo should be like end of April
Right ish early May
Maybe
I've been hearing that their official
Release has been the 15th
So
Mid April
Well probably I'd say late April
Cause I was just thinking
I can't think of any racing
Games on the Xbox 360
So I'm really excited to hear
That's a joke
Cause there's like 50
If you want a demo of
The second Forza
Just play Project Gotham Racing 3
More or less
Alright
MotoGP
Anyways
So as we mentioned earlier
Red Octane
And actually they have admitted to it now
But apparently there's been some issues
With the whammy bars on some of the
Guitar Hero 2 controllers
Now I personally haven't experienced this yet
Since my game is still in the shrink wrap
But you know I have picked up
The guitar and the
Whammy bar feels a little cheap
Anyhoo so
Apparently the
One's affected by
There's two skews actually
That are defective
The first one is
Let's see here
I believe it's like a 95055
And then the other one is 95065
And apparently
You can see
I'm sitting back in the room and I have my explorer controller
What'd you say now? What am I looking for?
95055 or 95065
Fuck!
I have a 95065
Ha ha! God damn you Loki
Ha ha! You stole me
This broke as fuck
Xbox 360 explorer
I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar
I'm just gonna take mine apart
Take it back
Cause you know what I wanna do?
I wanna get mad props on the internet
And get a distortion pedal
Since it can't be that hard to figure out how to
Fuck you know
That distortion pedal works
This is just a damn
What is it? Ethernet cord there?
Anyways
So yeah that's what's up
Apparently they want you to return
Your guitar
And get a new one
That's not one of those two models
They didn't really say what's defective
But if it's giving you crap
If you got it from Red Octane
You can contact them to get them RMA
Or if you purchase it
Elsewhere you may need to go bitch them out
But either way
It's stupid
Don't they test this stuff?
Shouldn't they test these batches?
If there's four different types of guitars
Made obviously there were some issues
Why revise the product?
It's the whammy bar
I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar
And when I'm playing the game it feels like the whammy bar
Has noticed it
It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one
I could tell
It works! It's not completely broken
But it doesn't do the wah wah wah
Very easily
It's either on or it's off
That's what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar
So yeah
Thank you for selling me a bum
Xbox 360
Hey it's not my fault
It's all the launch ones I think are like that
This is what I'm saying though
Why revise the designs on some product?
I mean why revise the design four times?
I mean seriously
What's the big deal?
Unless these are coming from four different production factories
Or something like that
One in China, one in Malaysia
One in Hong Kong
And two of those are fucked up or something
I don't believe
That two would be broken in an exact same way
But
I don't know
Yeah, Sycoon is wondering in our chat room
Why are there four different guitars anyway?
Kyle Snyder says
Why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?
How about
Test your product and if it's effective
Don't send out hundreds of thousands of them
SSJ100Matt says
Smash it
Video tape it and throw it on the OLR YouTube
Maybe
I'll tell you this
If I can unlock all 1000 achievement points
Or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero
Then I'll smash my controller
There's going to be tons of download content though
We'll see
When is some new DDR content coming up?
Because there's just one song pack
Don't hold your breath
Alright
Anyhow
At least I can say this
I'll say something nice about Red Octane
Because I do like Guitar Hero
At least they acted on this quickly
They realized they screwed up
And within a week of the game's release they're acting on it
So yay for them
It makes me very angsty that I have one of those crappy guitars
GS68 says
Convert your guitar to a machine gun
I'm going to have it implanted on my leg
Like Rose McGowan
Dude that's hot
What's also hot is hell
In our Effies of the Week
My Effie of the Week
Goes to
The line at Marie Callender's this morning
When I was standing in it
You stood between me and my ex Benedict bitches
Lowkey
Your Effie of the Week
Effie of the Week goes to
The movie Premonition
Because I knew it sucked
But yet I went to see it because the wife wanted to see it
Now
That movie is so horrible
I hate Sandra Bullock so much
But I got to admit
I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie
The way the character dies
At the end is so like stupid
Oh man
I just couldn't stop laughing
I was going to go into the theater and do that shit
Thanks for the spoilers by the way
Don't see it, it's a horrible movie
My Effie of the Week
Goes to the movie Babble
Bab-el? Bab-el?
Although I actually really like the movie
That was way too many pussy shots
For one movie
And it was the same pussy every time
Like I know that girl's vagina
Inside and out
In glorious HD
High definition DVD
Thanks to my player in Netflix
Wow!
Alright
Mantrin, do you have any FUs of the Week?
Yes, I'd like to say FU
To the speakers who stole our most
Motorcycle, not that we started
Fixing it
Because we have to go out
And essentially get new bearings
Because you rip the pegs
Off of that actual
Half of the bike properly
So, screw you
Don't steal shit people
Try the same fuckers who broke into my car
Like 50 times
Alright
Well
Back to some gaming news
Maybe
If I feel like it
FU to Dark Sakura for being a bitch
Hey, you know what?
People love my bitchiness
Anyway
Marvel Ultimate Alliance has 8
Downloadable characters on Xbox 360
I don't know about anything else
Which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one
But I don't care
The downloadable characters
Effective April 10th
Are Hulk, Hawkeye which makes me happy
Cyclops, Nightcrawler
Another one of my favorites
Dr. Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth and Venom
Venom is cool
Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360
Has all their abilities
Costumes, dialogue
Conversations, achievement points
But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool
If you haven't bought the game yet
And you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360
I'd wait until next month
Because they're going to do
Just like the Call of Duty 3
Characters packed in
Save yourself like 10 bucks
Or just play it on PS3
Or buy it used
Or don't buy it at all
That'd be my preference
Or come over to my house and bring controllers
Because we need more people to play with me
Alright
But no Wonder Woman
That's DC Comics, dummy
I learned that last week the hard way
I just felt like fucking with you
Alright
I learned that last week the hard way
I just felt like fucking with you
When we told you over and over again
That Knights is coming out to the Wii
And I don't know, somehow that got confirmed again
Like blogs were rerunning the story
Knights is confirmed yet again
Journey into Dreams
Or no, Journey of Dreams
And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?
But one thing we didn't hear that was new this week
Is that it's going to use
Wii Connect 24 functionality
Are you listening, Loki?
However
It's going to use the forecast channel
To bring you the real world seasons
So it's going to actually use the forecast channel
I'm assuming
If it's snowing outside
Then it'll be snowing in game
If it was snowing at midnight
You mean
Then it'll be snowing in game
Because that forecast channel doesn't update ever
It's going to suck if you live in Jamaica
And it's sunny all the time
Well then maybe you can set it
I mean, you can probably turn forecast channel
On or off, I imagine, in the game
And if it's off, it's just randomized
That's what I'm going to do when they have Animal Crossing come out
I'm just going to set mine to Antarctica
Or something like that
Why is it snowing in summer?
Because it's cold
That's what the forecast channel says
Anyways
As if this is a big surprise
I know
New colors of the Wiimote and Nunchucks
Are supposedly coming out soon
Yeah, big shocker there
It's going to be funny though
Apparently
It comes from a retailer list
According to GoNintendo.com
And some of the colors available
Silver, blue, and pearl pink
Both
Pink
And I bet you anything
The console colors are coming as well
But my question is though
Is this
The controllers aren't out there anyways now
What's it matter if they're in different colors as well
You still can't get them
People are going to be
Silver is such a weird color too
For a controller
Mandarin, you did a little
Jerk off motion when you heard this story
What are your thoughts on the Nunchucks and remotes
And different colors
I have a remote skin
Like the most rubbery things
Once I heard about all the remotes
Flying off because of sweaty hands
I went out and got one and it cuts down
So I have a pink remote
Just like Nelly does
But it does look like your wiimote is wearing a condom
I mean I just put that out there
Yeah what can I say I like to play safe
And to kind of
And your wiimote has not gotten AIDS
So good job
To clarify this also this is coming from a European
Retail list apparently
According to that
It will be shipping on
June 29th in the UK
So not of course
An official confirmation but come on
Of course Nintendo is going to do different colored
Remotes and stuff
I don't know the
Silver, blue, and pink that's kind of a weird
Combo of colors there
Isn't that all the colors of the DS?
There's no silver in this
Yeah there is the original one was silver
Silver-y
Silver-ish
Those are all DS colors
Oh sorry gray
Silver
Well we can all call it what we want to
But that doesn't necessarily make it true
Well
Something that I think is really stupid
You know we weren't really supposed to talk about this
You know situation again
But um
The uh we all remember the
Woman that drank all the water
And you know
Pretty much killed herself
How could we forget we freaking live here
It was all over the news for like months
Well um
Basically they um
Are not filing any
Criminal charges against
The radio station
Um
The district attorney
Basically is quoted saying
Jennifer Strange was an adult
Who voluntarily participated
In the radio contest
She knew what the contest
Involved when she entered it
And had the option to stop or discontinue her participation
In the radio contest at any time
However the civil suit is still
In a process
And um
That morning show though still cancelled
The staffers were fired
And they still haven't replaced it by the way
I think they're still doing that cheesy
Make your own playlist
And come in and DJ for the morning
Like they're trying to get people off the street
To fill in cause they like seriously no one will touch
That radio station with a ten foot pole right now
I would if I could play my own music but unfortunately
I actually was going to send in an entry
For it but you have to join their little
Online club but maybe I should do that
I mean wouldn't that be kind of funny
We should all send in a playlist
And just put Beyonce
My chemical romance I don't know just put all the top
40 crap on there and get in there
And do it wouldn't that be fun
No not really cause I don't listen to that station
But you know
I don't entirely agree with that statement
I think that you know she
Wasn't fully they didn't fully disclose
The risks involved with it
I mean yes she is an adult if she was
Feeling sick or whatever she could bow out
But you know I don't think
They fully explain the risks to them
As far as you know what
What's involved and what could possibly happen
And that's all going to come out in this civil lawsuit
To be honest it's no surprise
To me that a criminal charge
Wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying
They were set out to kill someone
Like they were
Going into this contest thinking hey
You know what we should do for ratings let's kill someone
Well
I don't think that would work
We thought about it but you know
I don't know
But still I still think they can
Get them on negligence just you know
For not disclosing this stuff I mean hell
If they can get Pete like McDonald's on that
Disclosing that coffee's hot
I mean they should be able to get that's a civil lawsuit
The owner of McDonald's did not go
To jail for a year because the coffee was hot
They should cause their fries suck sometimes
And they keep hiring
These people that don't speak any English
And they always fuck up my orders
That station will get sued for
Eleveny billion dollars it's coming
And they will get sold and change their name
It's counting down till the day
Till that radio station has to change their name
And then we will see the headline
On the news is at the end of
The end
Wah wah
They're saving that like headline
Saving it
Ahh love it
Alright
Well um
While we wait for more information
On the Jennifer Strange
Lawsuit stuff cause I know you just
You love and thrive on all that
Information
Yeah I know
I was being facetious
I have release dates
See what I was doing was I was buying time
While I was pulling up the Japanese release dates
Cause I was lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance
So let me tell you about all these great games coming out
To the Japanese market
And you can also horribly
Listen to me horribly horribly
Butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles
Of which it actually does not seem like
There's a whole lot coming out over in Japan
This week um for Playstation 2
There's a game called
Grim Grimoire
Which is coming out and also
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double agent
On the Playstation 2 finally gets its way
In Japan
It's coming out
There's a couple titles on the DS
Including some Disney franchises
Chicken Little and The Little Mermaid
Make its way to Japan
Which by the way
You have to hear at some point in your life
The Little Mermaid stage from Kingdom Hearts
In Japanese
Makes me cry
Makes me cry from laughing so hard
Watashi no Relaxuma
Is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS
Relaxuma sounds cool
Relaxuma
And Jamie maybe you'd like this
Doesn't it look like little bears massaging each other
Or something
It does
It looks like the old bear is reading
And the little bear is walking on his back
Some folks used to do that
To massage
That bear is going to murder the other bear
With that little pointy red flag
He's going to play with his
I
I call this land in the name of France
And stab them through the temple
So really not an exciting week in Japan
Sorry
Well if you're looking for excitement
In the United States
Well
You better wait until next week
Although there is one good game coming out this week
Super Paper Mario
On the Wii
That's about it
There's a couple PSP games coming out
None worth mentioning
That is your week
Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii
Ha
Ha
But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC
That game looks awesome
Wasn't that supposed to come out last week
I don't know I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week
Yeah it's
It's just a really
Really sad week
Well it's really not looking much better
For the UK
We have
Well Fears coming out that's a good game
And the Godfather the Dawns edition
On PS3
Gurumin A Monstrous Adventure
On the PSP Harvest Moon DS
Hotel Dusk Room 215
Pokemon Ranger and Wing Island
On Wii
Maybe Hotel Dusk
Room 215 will do better like in Europe
You know how like sometimes with music
There's like bands that do way better
In Europe that like flop here even though
They might be really good
I don't know things like Robbie Williams
He's big everywhere but people here
Don't bat an eyelash at him right
Maybe Hotel Dusk 215 will like
Catch like wildfire
Or maybe you're just saying
Yeah cause you're a bitch
Hey Rob
Guess what
You know it's kind of random
This is completely random here but you know a game
I saw a video for that kind of made it look
Fun to play
Cabela's African Safari
They have it like where you can go into bullet time
As you freaking
You're diving towards
You know I guess a lion
Or something like that and you can snipe
Lions in the head
Africa
Although they already said in Africa
You're not gonna be hunting animals
Which is like the one reason I would
Buy the game
It'd be awesome if like it's resistance in Africa
And you're just blowing crap up
Africa
Alright well
Speaking of games
We won't be seeing anytime soon
Cause I don't know about you I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa
Since E3
Here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon
Mother 3
And just to pour salt in the wounds
Guess what Nintendo did this week
Nintendo posted the soundtrack
On iTunes
And no, not the Japanese store
You can actually get
The Mother 3 soundtrack in the US
Store
And download some of the songs from Mother 3
Wait, what's this
Mandarin? You have a game release?
Sam & Max episode 5
Is gonna be released Thursday
Wasn't that already out?
I thought episode 5 came out
I thought it did too
Oh it already released on Thursday
Cause GameTap
Does roll out their new games on Thursday
And I had a friend
Who was playing it but I think
This friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do
On GameTap
Cause he's special
You getting told?
Alright well anyway
If you are waiting for Sam & Max
Or just don't have GameTap
And you want to download some music from Mother 3
You can download such gems as
We Miss You
Music
Slow jams of Earthbound
Lame
I don't know why anyone would be interested in that stupid game
Because there are rabid
Fucking Mother fans out there
On the internet that will
Download anything that remotely has to do
With Mother
We used to have a little cluster from some
There was some website dedicated to Mother
And the Earthbound series
But there was a period of time
When there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show
Don't you remember that?
Nope
Well god, you don't care about our listeners do you?
Well then fine, new story
Anyways
Starman.net, that was it
Miyamoto
Of course inspired by
PlayStation Home
Wants to expand the world
Of the Miis
In other words
Wants to do more things with them
Including
Have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them
How about you start
By
Giving third party companies
Access to put Miis in their game
Would be a good way to expand the experience
Or
I don't know, how about
Do something a little bit more
Than just have them wandering around their little
White existence in there
But yeah
He plans on seeing
A vast virtual world
With the Miis
Not starting too well with the
Vote for your favorite
Mii channel that's supposed to be coming out
Eventually
A Mare Mii can idol
We're Sanjaya Mii
Okay
Well
Anyway
Anyway
This makes me kind of sad
Because
Our dear
Hero
Nomura Tetsuya
Is not affiliated
With the
New Kingdom Hearts
Coming out
Wait, but we saw that trailer last week right?
For some type of
Or at least it was tacked on at the end of
Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix or whatever
So they're going on without them or what?
What he's basically telling
Dengeki Playstation is
And this is a quote
First it's not Kingdom Hearts 3
Of course because we're calling it a new series
It won't be Kingdom Hearts 3
Also it's a series so it won't
Be just one title
Um
He's saying that basically he's working
On a different story
I don't know
Not the next Kingdom Hearts
It's a spinoff of the Kingdom Hearts series
Online, MMO
Dude that would be hot
I would totally quit World of Warcraft
For that
I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series
Without Disney
But why?
That's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts
In the first place
Now we have to play it for the
Roxas
And Axl
Fuck that
Well we'll see what happens
Dustcap2 makes it funny in chat
Kingdom Hearts X1
Like Mega Man
Get it
Laugh
Well this is also leaving
A lot of people with a huh kind of look
Is that Resident Evil 4
Has been confirmed for the Wii
Um now yes that's Resident Evil
4 the game that you could already
Play with your GameCube
Backwards compatibility
Will now be coming out on the Wii
This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube
Games they could easily redo them for the Wii
With the new functionality
Well here it is in motion right here
Uh you're gonna now be able to
Um you know obviously you use the Wii
Controls as part of the game
It'll have widescreen support although I believe the old one had
Widescreen support as well but I guess now you can get
Progressive Scan and all that good stuff
Um well couldn't the old one do
Progressive Scan as well? Could it?
I don't remember. I thought so. Interesting
So they really aren't changing a lot of it then
Well the Wii Mode is gonna be used for close range
Attacks uh the speaker will be used
For the reload sound effect the one that's in the
Little Wii Mode there um if an enemy
Approaches you give the Wii Mode a little shake
And you can do a close range attack
With the knife um otherwise
The game has also been modified to take
Um the Wii into the account um
Some interactive event scenes use the Wii
Buttons you have to shake the Wii Mode and part
Of it um the producer of the Wii
Version uh was talking to Famitsu
Magazine and said that uh
They want to allow families who play the
Wii together to experience Resident Evil
So in other words
No more chainsaw your face off
I guess I guess they're gonna have to do something about that
But there are gonna be easy and amateur
Difficulty settings to make the game a little
Bit easier
Also the bonus elements from the Playstation 2
Will be in the Wii release so you can do
The add a um sequence
The another order sequence
So that's I guess something
That you didn't have on your backwards compatibility
I can't
They're gonna have to do something about uh
Chainsaw man taking off your head though
For the family play they're gonna really
Need to do something like that about that
Oh man that's funny
Anyway instead he gives you
He gives you flowers
Resident Evil Family Edition
Anyways
So yeah I think it's funny that
They were saying that you know you can
Redo some of the old GameCube games cause I think
Most of the games that have come out recently
Especially by Ubisoft um are just
Old GameCube games that have been ported
Over to the Wii
Super Paper Mario to some extent is that I mean
Granted they went back and reworked it
Twilight Princess is a perfect example
Prince of Persia 2 no
Hot damn when do you think we're gonna get
A Wii game that was actually made for the Wii
What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube
Game they were thinking about too
I don't know
That I think they were probably actually doing you know
For the Wii but like
Prince of Persia Rival Swords
Like you have a lot of the
You know stuff that's been out
Binacle Heroes that's coming out that was a GameCube title
Open Season a lot of the movie tie in stuff
I don't know it's just bad
Anyways
Some of our chat room by the way is coming up with new slogans
And commercials for Resident Evil 4
Like you know that
We would like to play
Bandit has come up with some new taglines
Including
We die together
And we would like to kill you
So there you go
Free marketing
Anyways
There's a rumor
That mass shortage
Or mass storage
Is coming to the Wii
Although
Unfortunately I think this rumor has been squashed
Because
It had to do with a press release by a company called
ESOL Middleware
They have basically
A fat driver
For the file system
And there's another driver for USB host stuff
Which apparently
Is already being implemented into the Wii
So
This is probably not the case
For right now
It is for the
I believe the little
Flash card you can put in there
So
Sorry no mass storage for you
I'm sure they have to at some point
You know do that
Poor babies
Alright well
DarkSakura might use that mass storage device
To save her favorite websites
When she's surfing the internet
Because she likes to surf the internet a lot
And she finds her favorite websites
And brings them to you in a special statement
We call DarkSakura's website of the week
Today's website of the week
Is one that Rob
Frequences often
Because I got the idea from him
Pornotube.com
Home of pterodactyl porn
It needs nothing
It's pornotube.com
Pterodactyl porn
You know
You want pterodactyl porn
Adult only
It does not count mental state of adult
What's been up with your website of the week lately
They've all been like x-rated
I have no idea
Because it's like
Someone's been thinking about
Sex
No
Someone's been um
Busy
Psycoon says why don't we just make this Rob's website
Of the week
Oh okay I will think of an original website of the week next week
Alright
I promise
Well DarkSakura frequents the pornotube
She's not afraid to get down with the pornotube
Alright
Well speaking of
We talked about GameTap earlier in the show
I guess Mandarin clarified
That it was on the private server
The new Sam & Max
Like this Thursday
So that's cool
Something else that's there hidden away
Apparently some Sega Saturn games
Are in there
There's a game called Bug
Which was lame by the way
Well nevertheless it was on the Sega Saturn
And it's there in GameTap
And apparently there's some Easter Egg
Games
It's part of a promotion GameTap is doing
I haven't logged into GameTap in a while
I haven't used it in a while
Apparently there's some other games hidden away too
But those haven't come to light yet
But
Something that some sharp eyed
Folks have noticed is that if you
Look at the controls in the game
The controls actually mention the shift key
So is it possible this is
Just a PC version of Bug that's
Tucked away
Don't know yet if this means that there are actually
Saturn games coming
But nevertheless it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega
Has been a big supporter of
GameTap because you know you have a lot of Genesis
Games and Master System games and hell you
Have Dreamcast games in there
So why not Saturn
Makes sense
SSJ100mad in chat says
I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD
Sega in chat says
GameTap has included the
Sega Saturn emulator so you'll get more
Saturn games later
GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator
Oh there you go
Cool
Well speaking of
Emulating stuff
A game called Piano Hero
On the PC
Some guys making it
And it's basically a freeware open source
Project that lets people with
MIDI capable keyboards
Play any MIDI file as if it were
Like a Guitar Hero
Style track
Or think back to I don't know keyboard mania
However
Activision has now
Sent a cease and desist order
To the guy
Behind it
Nicholas looks like he had a
Peach done
Well basically the only thing he has
To do which is not too bad
Is he has to change the name
Because they want to make sure that people
Aren't getting confused
That it's an actual
Official Activision product
Or something like that
So he can keep on making the game as long as he names it
As something else
I don't know that's not bad
You know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though
I don't know
Does he really have to change the name?
Yeah
Basically they've sent a cease and desist
Well no no no I'm not saying based on cease and desist
But do they really have the legal right to make him change the name?
I don't know
Maybe unless they have something
You know
Coming out
It says among the various
Products Activision publishes
Are
Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2
Video games
Activision is the owner of certain
Intellectual property rights including
Guitar Hero franchise
Including but not limited to
The trademark Guitar Hero
And says
Let's see here
I'm trying to see exactly what it is
It says it comes to attention that you've been using
The name Piano Hero in connection with your game
That you designed
For Halite Studios
Where enclosed they print out of your
Website showing such
In our opinion your use of
The name Piano Hero constitutes
At least
Trademark infringement
Delusion and unfair competition
With the respect to the trademark
Guitar Hero
I don't know
It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get
Named similarly all the time
Especially
When it comes to a lot of puzzle games
I don't know
There's a perfect example
There's a movie studio out there that does
Knock off movies like Snakes on a Train
Or for the new
Transformers movie
Transmorphers
There you go
Landmine Fairy
Suggests Keyboard Villain
As a possible name to replace
Can they already license Guitar Villain?
Not officially
It's been licensed but there's no game out on the market yet
Which by the way that's one of my favorite chat room names ever
Is Landmine Fairy
Also Bandit makes a good suggestion
Go to Guitar Hero.com
It's a site for action figures not associated
With Activision
They should sue Activision ASAP
I agree
Turn about the fair play right?
Or how about
I don't know
The fact that I would say it's infringing more on
Keyboard Mania
Than you know
The game itself
Alpha
Canongram suggests a name that will
Probably sell more copies of the game
Piano Porno Star
Piano Porno Star
Piano Porno Star is a pretty awesome name
Piano Cockbite
And on that note
We're going to bring part A to a close here
Oh real quick
Mandarin you wanted to give a special shout out right?
Seggman anyway
I just want to give a special shout out to
Segg in the chat room
He's a friend of mine currently in Boston
He was working at Emerson
Emerson College
He just got a job at Telltale Games
Out in San Rafael
He's going to be
Being the new build engineer
For all the Sam & Max episodes
From this point
Once he starts there from this point forward
And I believe he starts next week or
Didn't we see
Something a while back about
Sam & Max they were trying to hire people
To port it to Xbox Live or something
There was a job posting on the internet
Did your friend get that job?
Kinda?
Something like it?
Interesting
He will have to come on the show later if he can
There might be NDA's at the wazoo
Get your friend to come
To our show because Sam & Max is pretty cool
Also
Part B tonight we're bringing back an old favorite
We're going to play some match game
In Part B tonight
So that means we need to get some contestants during the break
So we'll take one on the skype line later
Don't call yet, we'll take one on the skype line
We have to do the game, but we need a chat room contestant
So to find a chat room contestant we always
Ask a trivia question live here on the program
Here is tonight's trivia question
We're going to be talking about
A new game in Part B
Tonight called Rock Band
Of course a lot of you guys have heard about this
But Rock Band was not the first game
That would allow you to put together a full band
There was actually an arcade series
And I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program
For a long time now
You know these games very well
There used to be three games
That would all session together
To form your own band
So you could play games at the arcade
Name them
First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat
Send a message to Sky in the chat room
With the name of the three games
To form your own band with in the arcade previously
It can all be made
Alright so we're going to take a break
And we'll see you guys in Part B
