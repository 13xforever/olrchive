14145	19787	Tonight, April 15th, 2007, the 360 is set to get a new keyboard for its spring update.
20087	22227	Is Parappa the Rapper set to get another sequel?
22487	23968	And would you mount for a mount?
27228	31249	The answer is no, but we'll get to that later in the show.
35875	37856	Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
37916	42618	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
43058	44118	My name is Rob Roberts.
44338	47240	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47880	48260	Money.
49140	50341	That's what I want.
50641	53142	No, that's what I just spent a whole bunch of.
53542	53802	Really?
53922	54282	On what?
55543	57304	On one of our giggling lesbians.
57684	58144	I see.
58984	59324	All right.
59765	61465	Well, can I have a loan?
62486	62646	Ask...
63954	69295	Ask my accountant Uncle Scrooge, is Uncle Scrooge your accountant?
69755	75837	No Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki Hello How you doing, Loki?
76437	78558	Good, so far So far?
78918	83779	Yeah But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?
84379	92701	I need food, I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet Angry Loki needs food badly I'm not angry, I'm just hungry
93926	94927	Don't shoot food.
95888	96528	Exactly.
96648	97769	Unless it's into my mouth.
98470	100291	Not Angry Loki is about to die.
101892	102653	I love Gauntlet.
102973	104614	But seriously, they overdid Gauntlet.
104934	106876	Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.
107256	110279	Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet.
110299	112020	Then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet.
112060	113561	Then we had, you know, it was overdone.
113921	115162	Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.
115462	118765	It should have been like Gauntlet Legends and, you know,
119383	120824	Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome.
120844	122786	I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.
123026	125048	Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.
125168	125428	Yeah.
126549	127290	Alright, well, anyway.
128431	133255	Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week.
133295	137379	We tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
137859	141182	Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday.
141222	142683	So I would be heading into your sixth year.
143063	146086	Our fifth birthday is coming up in June.
146306	147167	That's going to be exciting.
148694	150255	We're hoping to have a big show for that one.
150595	158058	I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.
159518	160459	I would make a suggestion.
160719	162679	It's all over the floor.
164580	165981	You've probably got enough for a corpse.
166741	172323	It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lingerie kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.
173061	178363	and as much as I'd like to have like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.
178443	192868	So we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like somewhere else, like at Golfland or I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese, I don't give a shit.
192928	194169	I have a grill at my house.
194209	194649	It's not here.
195029	196570	Want to go to your house, have a barbecue?
196670	197550	We can have a barbecue at my house.
197570	198391	Orange Lounge Barbecue?
198411	200291	Let's do an Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.
200471	202192	So you don't care if strangers come to your house?
203220	204680	I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.
204780	205301	Alright, there you go.
206381	208241	Hide Shermie.
208261	209882	Shermie will hide herself.
210062	210302	Alright.
211182	213242	Anyhow, so more details on that to come.
213503	214663	That'll be coming up in a couple months.
214703	216123	Alright, let's get to it.
216323	217664	We'll start off with how was your gaming week?
218504	220064	DarkSakura.
221545	224745	I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.
225586	229246	And that's actually... I played a lot of Cooking Mama while waiting at the bank.
230507	231427	Things I do for us.
232813	233954	The sacrifices I make.
235055	236876	I learned how to make tonkatsu.
237357	239298	Have you not played Cooking Mama on the Wii yet?
239738	240679	No, I'm broke.
240859	242000	You really should at some point.
242040	244382	Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.
244722	247024	It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.
247825	248025	Ever.
248545	248906	Yuck.
249666	250187	Well, wait.
250887	252829	Resident Evil, then Cooking Mama.
254670	256712	I hope that is not Chris's blood.
258793	261115	You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.
261816	262116	Right.
264933	265574	Or do you?
266114	267735	I don't know.
267755	272018	You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.
272499	275701	I don't even know where the hell that... The Resident Evil porn thing.
275721	276842	Yeah, somebody sent me that.
276942	278543	It was like a Resident Evil voice acting.
278583	279564	I sent it to you.
279924	281345	Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.
282125	282366	Bitch.
282486	285007	I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.
285748	287809	Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.
288330	289891	So I have to have a big pink button.
290481	291122	No, I don't.
291862	292783	I send you awesome.
293864	294264	So is that it?
294304	295285	Cooking Mom, what was your gaming week?
297066	300249	Oh, that and damn let the PSP battery die.
300549	301550	And I couldn't find the charger.
302150	303311	So, poo on him.
305073	306354	So that was a game you didn't play.
309256	310277	Very well done, Jamie.
311438	312078	Shut up!
313019	315321	Also, you just got back from a road trip, right?
316542	317983	Angry drivers driving?
318692	321895	just stupid people alright, that's what I thought alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
322795	347915	I played Earth Defense Force 2017 per usual so that was fun I played briefly Guitar Hero 2 and that was about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not going to be playing much of it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though I haven't really played much DDR either played Boom Boom Rocket
348573	349153	That was fun.
351354	356295	Actually, I was doing pretty good on some of the songs, but they got pretty hard.
357335	358856	And some of the achievements are actually pretty easy.
359376	362096	Like, I unlocked five after playing the first song or something.
362116	362557	It was weird.
363097	376220	And then I played Gnarly Golf, which that's an old Apple IIGS game that I played through an Apple IIGS emulator on the internet, and
376969	379131	I miss that game, except it's really crappy now.
379531	381092	Why that game of all games?
381232	382854	I don't know, it's a game I used to play a long time ago.
383554	384215	And it was fun.
384795	386156	I remembered it being a lot more fun.
386717	390820	But the emulator didn't work right, so you never lose lives.
392101	395003	So, I beat the whole game, and I was like, this is dumb.
397164	399106	Then, let's see, what else did I play?
399586	401188	I played Super Paper Mario.
402068	405511	And it has way too much dialogue.
407303	409325	20 minutes of fucking dialogue before I can play the game.
409885	410645	That's retarded.
412006	414028	But, it's okay so far.
416329	417270	What else did I play?
417290	421673	Yeah, that's about it, I think.
422573	422834	Yeah.
423894	424134	Alright.
424154	425976	Let's see.
426056	426556	My Game of Week.
427406	429567	I also play Super Paper Mario a lot.
429947	431048	I think it's great.
431168	432168	I think it's an awesome game.
433409	438251	I like the whole old school side scroller thing mixed with the role playing elements.
438911	441072	And I think that 3D thing is freaking brilliant.
441313	444314	I love the fact that you can hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3D world.
444895	445436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
467435	467835	Thanks for watching!
488311	489212	I disagree with you, Loki.
489312	490533	I think the dialogue is cool.
490893	498178	Well, the dialogue was cool, it's just I didn't really care for 20 minutes of it right in the beginning of the game, you know what I mean?
498418	499979	Why didn't you just skip the opening wedding thing?
499999	505723	Because I wanted to know the story, because obviously it's there if it's important.
506344	514089	I mean, so, I just wish they would have, like, you know, paraphrased or maybe broken it up a little bit, you know, instead of...
514690	542448	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, you get to play a little bit Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah So That's like any Final Fantasy game, seriously Final Fantasy has less fucking dialogue than this goddamn game This game just beats everything out I mean, seriously, Final Fantasy At least there's dialogue, but there's stuff happening Instead of just Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, look, it's, you know It's like the start of Final Fantasy 7 It's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Okay, run here
543188	544249	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
544349	545049	Okay, run here.
545149	549471	Hey, at least I get to fucking control my character within the first 20 minutes of the game.
550192	555674	But seriously, though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?
555774	562798	I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the Chaos Heart.
562918	564299	I mean, come on.
564319	565459	I didn't think of that.
565479	567120	It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.
567661	568741	So, whatever.
568781	569301	I'll play the game.
569341	570082	It's going to be awesome.
570722	572203	Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
572890	575071	Seriously, you need to space up the dialogue a little bit more.
575351	579693	Gotta love our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.
580874	584455	Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?
586416	589117	Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.
589778	594280	It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote the goddamn Super Paper Mario.
594380	594760	It's like...
595484	597245	And Luigi came, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
597285	603727	I mean, Stephen King just writes about nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.
603787	612171	It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden, my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm going to go down the street and find out what goes down there.
612191	614752	And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.
615012	615612	Exactly.
616273	616693	Stupid.
616773	617833	But that's all right.
618193	621115	I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.
621175	622115	Just need super...
622970	626411	Mario RPG to come to Virtual Console and we'll be all good.
626491	628251	I just bought that for $3.
629411	630391	Oh, the original cartridge, right?
630411	630591	Yep.
630911	631571	Where'd you find that?
631912	634132	Someone traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.
635092	635632	Well, lucky you.
635672	638053	I'm sure that'll be out... You think that'll come out on Virtual Console?
638193	643193	I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario... Well, actually, or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.
644774	646554	Anyway, the game's awesome.
646614	647754	Don't listen to Loki's rants.
647894	648454	It's tolerable.
648514	651555	I didn't say it wasn't awesome, I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.
651595	652335	Alright, well, great.
653807	656629	If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.
656749	657649	You just have to read.
657709	661571	I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.
661871	670394	The only thing I think is going to be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't really see it as being the type of game I'm going to go back through and play again a lot.
670755	672375	But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.
672395	678458	I don't know, Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever...
678925	679265	I don't know.
679465	682687	I kind of see it as something I'm going to play once and be done with.
682967	683408	But we'll see.
683488	683788	We'll see.
684388	685309	Ask me again when I get there.
687290	690632	But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.
692593	694174	Also, my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.
694874	700298	That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.
700338	707682	I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should have taken a picture of it because, you know, hey, it makes my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 of the leaderboards.
707947	711468	But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard, and I was like, number five, one day.
711948	715909	But, and I know you might be thinking, well, medium, well, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?
715949	726852	But I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all ten medium songs, so I was just playing, and I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main Blades page comes from.
727192	732633	So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100% perfects on all the songs.
732813	733854	So, I don't know, whatever.
734354	734914	I guess, um...
735950	740014	I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.
740354	745619	It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.
746119	749502	The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.
750063	757089	It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest of the songs, I won't want to play again.
757289	758550	I liked actually some of them.
758610	761693	There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.
762214	762494	I don't know.
763402	769754	I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad because, to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?
770356	771037	Well, fuck this shit.
771077	772079	I should just put a pad in there.
772878	776700	You know, somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad.
777060	778261	And I'm sure, I haven't tried it.
778321	779042	I think you can.
779082	779702	Why couldn't you?
779842	782283	The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.
782464	784465	There's no reason you couldn't do it.
784665	787286	Because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad or the buttons.
787586	788667	Which is actually how I do it.
788747	789347	I use both.
790188	793110	I use left on the D-pad and then the other three I use the buttons.
793130	794771	Because that allows me to have the triggers as well.
795071	796912	It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.
797212	799793	Don't do all direction or don't do all buttons.
800174	800574	Do like...
801552	804694	One or two of the arrows on the direction pad and then the other two on the buttons.
804794	807556	And if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.
808856	812659	There was one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.
813999	814239	Huh.
814840	815900	So I was like, um, okay.
816961	818602	Well, you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.
818962	821784	Well, it was up, up, and left, left.
822924	823144	Oh.
823485	826787	Well, then you probably, yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there.
826807	828608	Hit left on D-pad and left on the button.
828648	829008	I don't know, I...
829645	831967	I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.
831987	834869	Because I only played the game really for one night.
835189	836510	I played it hardcore one night.
836550	837231	I played it for hours.
837331	839533	But the songs just aren't replayable for me.
839593	843295	That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and DDR or Beatmania.
843596	846798	Let's take Beatmania, which obviously this game is hugely inspired by.
848439	851642	Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again.
852102	856486	And Konami obviously has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.
856866	858327	Granted, they license stuff.
858752	862793	but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care about anyway.
862993	863974	Well, okay, maybe a little bit.
864634	865954	Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.
866354	868075	But most of it is forgettable, right?
868335	870036	But the original in-house stuff is great.
870116	874717	You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.
874737	880739	So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable of creating music.
880759	886081	Plus they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.
886101	886321	EA Tracks.
886541	887241	EA Tracks.
887768	888349	Exactly.
888469	890411	Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?
890631	892994	Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?
893274	893514	I don't know.
893534	895296	It's because there's downloadable packs later.
895656	896177	Oh, great.
896437	905567	So, you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are, you know, not even going to be that great, I'm sure.
905807	907429	And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.
907449	908270	We'll get into that later.
912436	937368	DarkTetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose SSJ100Matt says fucking Avril DarkShy says no insult J-pop it's not all bad but come on some of it's pretty forgettable I like Mflow they're pretty cool third style for life alright anyhow let's get into some housekeeping for tonight if everyone's done with their gaming week
938018	939919	Tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.
939999	951606	I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games community site, which is something we've kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.
951666	954927	It's kind of like MySpace, but without the cam bots and whores and stuff.
955408	957109	And it's people talking about video games.
957729	958309	It's pretty awesome.
958349	962572	So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.
962912	964693	I'm on there, DarkSakura's on there, Matt's on there.
965109	972895	And I'd actually like you to check out, if you have a chance, I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time.
973595	977758	Because you might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational tide pool game.
978038	979339	And it kind of got me thinking this week.
981040	984683	What are my favorite edutainment games from yesteryear?
984703	986464	And of course, number one is The Oregon Trail.
986825	988626	But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.
988646	988986	Okay.
991684	992124	Oh, fuck.
1017096	1017737	Timeworks Inc.
1017757	1018858	made this for the Commodore 64.
1037788	1056958	and basically you went around this cave and you had to jump over rocks and you were collecting crystals and you had to avoid bats and rocks and if you messed up then you lost a bandaid well randomly in this like flash of light like like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound effects this little wizard would appear and he'd go spell
1057757	1061861	Anti-disestablishmentarianism or whatever word, because it used the voice chip in there, right?
1062181	1065624	So you'd have to spell it out and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind of sucked.
1065664	1066244	It was a competition.
1066284	1070668	Yeah, it would be like, now... It's Tricky Otomy Man!
1071449	1075732	Now spell... Uh-oh.
1076133	1078154	And if you got it right, he would give you a band-aid.
1078635	1082838	But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker.
1082958	1084820	And he'd take flashlight power from you.
1085270	1086831	DarkSakura, Loki, do you guys ever post to your blogs?
1086891	1087812	I've seen Loki post a few things.
1087872	1087952	No.
1088072	1089413	I put pictures of my cat up there.
1089433	1094216	Loki posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this week, but
1114133	1115014	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1136542	1138363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1165627	1166708	Nintendo ran out of trees?
1166728	1168230	I don't know.
1188047	1191369	It's impossible to find this stuff, and the controllers and all that stuff.
1191429	1196912	But I don't understand why these controllers are any harder to make than, say, I don't know, the classic controller or whatnot.
1197413	1201495	I mean, it's not that complicated of a piece of equipment.
1202016	1204077	So I don't understand why it's taking them so long.
1204097	1205598	Well, you don't need those cards anyway.
1205758	1206698	The cards are pointless.
1206718	1208199	You get charged tax on those cards.
1208299	1209240	Buy them online.
1209440	1209760	I understand.
1209780	1214183	You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on it.
1214203	1217545	I understand that, but, you know, there's... Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.
1218132	1223714	Some people like the cards, you know, for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards or stuff like that.
1224354	1225394	Allowance bonus thing.
1225414	1226674	Steal your mommy's wallet.
1227235	1240838	But I'm just, this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold out of right now, you know, something that should be able, and so if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.
1240858	1242459	These things should be fucking easy to make.
1243019	1243719	Same with the controllers.
1243739	1246140	The controllers aren't that complicated.
1246547	1256253	I mean, hell, even the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts in it that weren't in, say, the GameCube or something like that.
1256693	1259095	The GameCube controllers, why the fuck can't they make more of them?
1260075	1261696	Maybe they're made from magic trees.
1262237	1263778	Oh, okay, well there you go.
1264858	1266339	You know, magic trees.
1266359	1270662	Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.
1271308	1272990	That's what they're going to have in Animal Crossing.
1273030	1276593	You'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out of.
1277594	1280216	Shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.
1280657	1281958	They could just recycle.
1282819	1284120	I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.
1284400	1286923	Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.
1287023	1287383	Yes!
1288104	1289525	That's what probably happened.
1289645	1296672	Someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.
1297253	1298434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1320134	1325019	Okay, I hate to derail here, but Miklatov has joined us, and he's come in the room, and he's laughing his ass off.
1325039	1326861	And I know you guys are playing video games out there.
1327322	1332887	By the way, like, Miklatov, Extifer, and RicePrincess are all here, but none of them wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.
1333288	1336651	But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.
1336712	1337552	It's distracting.
1337753	1338854	We're trying to do a show in here.
1339695	1342618	Okay, so Christopher is playing Marble Mania.
1343588	1344830	and Coro Impa.
1344950	1346613	That was in test at my office.
1346673	1347193	You know, I saw it.
1347214	1348015	That was a really fun game.
1348055	1348716	It is really fun.
1349176	1350158	He picked the panda.
1350791	1357335	Marvel, and if people don't know about this game, every time the marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.
1357715	1359156	The panda sounds like it's farting.
1359176	1364019	And it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing ever.
1364500	1368362	And I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing so hard.
1368722	1371244	So you guys are laughing at fart noises.
1372004	1373565	And that's what's derailing this entire show.
1373605	1378929	It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.
1383446	1384067	Don't die!
1384327	1385768	It's all that eucalyptus, you know.
1386348	1387208	It's gassy shit.
1389969	1392290	Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!
1394752	1397093	Hey, this is what I get for not reading.
1399254	1400234	Bamboo, whatever!
1400454	1401094	It's gassy.
1402535	1406397	I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.
1407492	1409012	Maybe that's your problem.
1409032	1411133	You're feeding the panda eucalyptus.
1413694	1415274	Well, thank God I don't work at a zoo.
1415294	1416294	They'd be dead.
1417855	1420056	The chatroom is asking if it's... Koala Panda!
1421116	1423757	DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 420 this week?
1424257	1424777	No, we're not.
1425717	1427438	We're role models for the young kids.
1427518	1429118	We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.
1429158	1433779	That's only... Or what is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?
1434239	1435220	Winners don't use drugs.
1435320	1436160	Remember that, boys and girls.
1437718	1446122	Um, winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera browser to check out the internet with.
1446242	1448864	The final version has gone online this week.
1448904	1455347	You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because, you know, when the blue light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.
1456167	1459309	But in this case, it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.
1459329	1461470	So the full version of the internet channel is there.
1462591	1467173	The new features is, thank God, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto-hide.
1467193	1470875	You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that so you can have your YouTube's full screen.
1470895	1472917	You can also just hit one and it'll hide it.
1473357	1473637	Awesome.
1474177	1476919	You can also zoom in and out at a lot.
1477619	1483442	I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.
1483702	1489746	So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to worry about trying to get it full screen and da-da-da and all that stuff.
1490834	1495157	You can also do www.com at a click of a button because all that's in there.
1495277	1498400	And, you know, they just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover as well.
1498420	1500601	It was supposed to run a little faster, although I don't know.
1501322	1506526	I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up or the Wi-Fi, but Internet Channel is slow.
1507433	1508994	So slow.
1509074	1511475	It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.
1511995	1515457	It's faster to browse the internet on, you know, obviously a computer.
1515717	1518559	But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.
1518619	1521020	I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.
1521060	1522921	Does it just not have the power to handle or what?
1522981	1529644	Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel or forecast channel or whatever.
1530264	1532945	Any of the channels, it takes fucking forever to load up.
1533626	1535747	So it's just slow.
1537159	1540842	Am I supposed to, like, I don't know, enable some port in my router?
1541002	1550129	Like, you know how for some file share programs you're supposed to open up certain ports in your router, right, and direct them directly to one of the, you know, things that is connected to the router?
1550149	1550569	You know what I mean?
1551270	1554432	Like, maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii to make it run faster.
1554512	1554852	Who knows?
1555693	1555793	Eh.
1557574	1560056	Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.
1560356	1562398	Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.
1562758	1565640	Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves and turn it into a koala.
1566401	1566601	Well...
1567196	1568617	Here's some... Whatever.
1568637	1572320	I don't give a shit about fucking koalas.
1573882	1574782	Koalas are cute.
1574823	1577725	It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.
1577745	1580667	Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.
1581468	1591337	Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have their wheeze and are keeping up with virtual console releases, there is a...
1593598	1597841	I don't know if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on a virtual console.
1598782	1600123	We love some ActRaiser, don't we?
1600764	1601644	Not in this country.
1602385	1603506	Well, that's exactly it.
1603566	1604367	It's out in the UK.
1606489	1608130	It actually has 800 Wii Points.
1610792	1614896	And basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where you walk around and you're God.
1615796	1616977	I like walking around as God.
1616997	1617658	I do that every day.
1618828	1621610	Actraiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.
1622811	1625353	Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay.
1625593	1629697	I like smiting my enemies.
1630578	1635722	Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii Points.
1637003	1641307	Bonk's Revenge for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii Points.
1642748	1643328	Blah, blah, blah.
1643368	1644289	All I heard was Actraiser.
1644730	1645030	Honestly.
1646195	1647096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1666914	1671958	Now, Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because you can play Pac-Man on everything.
1672278	1674839	Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.
1675180	1675660	I'm sorry, 2600.
1675840	1679903	Oh yeah, the 2600 version is like... Crap!
1679963	1681084	It's like Pac-Man barf.
1681164	1682425	It's not real Pac-Man.
1682865	1684146	I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.
1684626	1685687	It's Diet Pac-Man.
1687348	1687808	Anyways...
1689588	1695373	So, other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force.
1695854	1702459	They've been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out probably Monday.
1703160	1709585	So, you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.
1710786	1714850	Rice Prince is in chat and says, Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.
1715110	1716872	Hey, maybe that's a good sign that...
1717697	1722679	You know, this, uh, um, Actraiser, or the, the UK release will mirror the release that we get.
1722699	1723860	But we already got Pac-Man, right?
1723880	1726181	I think we already got Pac-Man.
1726201	1728442	I know, not, not that I really care, because I'm not gonna go down.
1728502	1729322	Oh, maybe we'll get Ms.
1729362	1730342	Pac-Man or some bullshit.
1730783	1732043	I don't care, I just want Actraiser.
1732223	1733204	Or the fucking original games.
1734784	1736065	That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?
1736465	1737205	Originally made games?
1738086	1738506	No, we'll see.
1738686	1739246	Someday.
1739566	1741267	Alright.
1741307	1745369	Um, let's see, also, uh, speaking about Nintendo, oh, you're gonna love this story, Loki.
1746296	1748477	I know you love piracy, but Nintendo does not.
1749558	1752259	You might know that recently in the news, the U.S.
1752979	1755560	has complained to the World Trade Organization about China.
1756081	1761123	And it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.
1761923	1767686	Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support this.
1769166	1772468	Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.
1773232	1776414	What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here.
1776714	1778915	Quote, Nintendo will continue to work with the U.S.
1778955	1782376	government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo products in China.
1782937	1783817	We're pleased the U.S.
1783857	1790040	government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.
1790060	1795102	That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.
1796643	1798224	What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that, you know,
1798843	1803226	Their ROMs and their old shit still run rampant throughout the internet.
1803246	1805087	They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.
1805348	1808610	Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.
1808650	1810451	It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.
1810711	1813453	Hell, there's that one site where you can play all the video games online.
1815355	1815735	I don't remember.
1815755	1817656	It's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.
1817676	1819017	You can play them all right there in your browser.
1819798	1827203	And Nintendo certainly has an interest in old games because they're making five bucks off of every one they can sell to a virtual console user.
1828104	1828424	I don't know.
1828800	1833224	TheRobD in chat says, ROM sites don't really exist anymore, it's mostly torrents.
1833264	1835126	But still, somebody's hosting the torrents, right?
1851741	1852961	You got to host a seat file somewhere.
1853562	1855062	Depends on where it's legal or illegal.
1855282	1856843	You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.
1857423	1859324	Pirate Bay just says back and go, you guys are stupid.
1860244	1863845	Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.
1866506	1868067	So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.
1871568	1875009	Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.
1875829	1877150	The company, Daytel, has...
1878237	1886920	A program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter your Mii avatar for your PC.
1890282	1895804	It's actually £14.99 and $19.99 in the US.
1896564	1898505	But you can download it off of their site.
1899225	1900526	It's at Code Junkies.
1901466	1903687	And the website is...
1904693	1905374	WII Mod WII.com
1925680	1926640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1946897	1947938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1976854	1980996	What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there was going to be some type of functionality.
1982176	1990340	By the way, thanks to the magic of radio, I just ran out to the living room real quick, and I saw them playing Korowimpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking funny.
1991000	1992101	It really is funny.
1992141	1997583	It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.
1997964	1999805	Remember that, where it just farting noises all the time?
1999945	2002066	I have no idea what you're talking about.
2002086	2002906	Have you never seen Labyrinth?
2003362	2005184	The Rods of Eternal Stench!
2005304	2006325	Oh, God.
2006345	2007746	So bad!
2008106	2009568	The last time I saw it, I was like eight.
2010328	2011329	I was a couple months old.
2011349	2012530	We need to fix that!
2013231	2013792	I guess so.
2013852	2015233	You know Megzy hasn't seen Labyrinth.
2017955	2024561	Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.
2025462	2026123	Basically...
2026835	2039405	Their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super Paper Mario is not in the store street date by 2 p.m., then you get $20 in a gift card.
2039865	2044709	Well, the problem was someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario was sold out.
2046251	2052115	But see, the thing was they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore they don't get $20.
2052636	2054097	It's kind of like, well, we had it.
2054775	2055695	But you just weren't here.
2056155	2058916	What was to stop them from telling everybody that?
2059476	2059737	Nothing.
2061777	2062477	Nothing at all.
2063258	2063598	Aha!
2064418	2065298	So it was a scam.
2065838	2066078	Yes.
2066279	2070100	Did he call the Better Business Bureau or did he just post his angry... Angry?
2071600	2072781	Sorry, I'm thinking about the farting panda.
2073781	2076782	Is he posting his angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it?
2077422	2079463	Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.
2079783	2084124	Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau instead of dig...
2084634	2086436	Actdeft and Charmus is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.
2113717	2116559	Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?
2116599	2118740	You don't know any better walking into the store.
2119500	2126845	You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, Oh, well, we sold out.
2127205	2128346	There was a line.
2128906	2129526	It's crazy.
2130807	2132288	Yep, no gift card for you.
2133128	2138011	Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?
2138131	2147976	The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements, there's a little bit of small print that you gotta read, and that's, you know, the offers can change, you know, without notice, so... Ha!
2148076	2152298	They can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super Paper Mario.
2152338	2153759	They don't have to, you know, follow that.
2154139	2155280	They can just say, fuck you, bitch.
2155880	2156801	I ain't doing shit.
2157641	2159322	So, could we post a big ad...
2159887	2165011	on the internet somewhere that says, Orange Lounge Radio gives free blowjobs.
2165231	2167673	And then, like, in little fine print, lie.
2168934	2169634	This is a lie.
2170235	2170875	What, Rice Princess?
2171536	2172957	But that would be true on your behalf.
2173037	2173217	Oh, yeah.
2173577	2173918	I'm sorry.
2173978	2178181	Rice Princess actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our... But on your behalf.
2178201	2179161	It's your slut.
2180583	2180803	Oops.
2180883	2181523	I mean, hi.
2182444	2186187	Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo-chugga-chugga-choo.
2186267	2188529	This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.
2188589	2188869	Thank you.
2188889	2189149	Hey, shut up.
2189969	2191150	Thank you for ruining our program.
2191550	2192050	I'm going to go now.
2192210	2193130	So, hi, everyone, and bye.
2194931	2195231	All right.
2195311	2196332	Wow.
2198313	2200854	Raven's Dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.
2205196	2207037	Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.
2207757	2208717	You should have heard what she yelled.
2209518	2209898	Anyhow.
2210418	2210858	Wait, wait, wait.
2210898	2211579	Let me simulate it.
2211819	2212039	Oh, what?
2213099	2213360	Ew!
2214060	2214600	How was that?
2214620	2215020	That was good.
2215400	2215761	That was good.
2217041	2218802	A little less angry next time, though.
2221149	2223811	Ah, well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?
2224551	2243702	Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th, and it was this woman making a post there saying, Hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.
2244283	2246364	In return, you can mount me.
2247423	2255731	You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000 gold before we do anything.
2256051	2258373	We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.
2259334	2265180	So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 Night Elf Druid and would prefer someone who is into roleplaying.
2265360	2266421	I have a costume.
2267355	2292966	But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal So other words Prostitution Short translation I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much And I don't even know where to go with this It's prostitution Pretty much
2293737	2296158	But she gets away with it because, A, it's on the Internet.
2296218	2297679	I'm assuming she doesn't live in Nevada.
2297779	2300720	I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on, but I don't think it was Vegas.
2301220	2303341	And anyway, it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.
2303401	2312746	So it was probably illegal, but she gets away with it because it's the Internet and it's not real money.
2313326	2315047	It's offering sex for services.
2315587	2318048	Would you give amount for amount?
2319989	2320389	No, Rob.
2321974	2334278	Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman, and, you know, obviously her picture was all over the Internet because, you know, you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you know, you kind of see her and, you know, she ain't all that.
2335759	2336859	No, not at all.
2337939	2339140	So, but this is the thing.
2339200	2341941	Just a couple days later, there was a follow-up post.
2342541	2349263	Hi, I'd just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my picture all over the Internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.
2349665	2351865	I got my epic mount in about an hour.
2352225	2358227	That was very enjoyable for both parties, while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds of hours farming for yours or don't even have them.
2358747	2364968	I won't be revealing my name or his, but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll be killing you 280% faster.
2366148	2367168	That's a little wow joke there.
2367888	2373109	Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.
2374129	2376910	She said it twice and capitalized it both times, so I was reading it that way.
2377515	2379697	Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.
2380618	2382620	I'm planning to meet him again later this week.
2382921	2384863	He's getting double value for his gold.
2385323	2386785	So talk all the trash you want.
2386905	2392851	I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can ever hope for.
2393792	2394753	Well, she does make a point.
2396194	2397616	As long as she's got a good attitude about it.
2398117	2398998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2419056	2425157	Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about, 5,000 gold I think equals about $600 in real money.
2425277	2431079	Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that route.
2431399	2434099	Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.
2434139	2435780	Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.
2436140	2436740	You okay with it?
2436900	2438600	I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.
2440261	2440781	Seriously.
2441921	2443101	No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.
2443261	2444641	I think I got a 20 in my wallet.
2446522	2446802	No.
2446822	2446862	No.
2447768	2448188	and DarkSakura.com.
2471348	2471728	DarkSakura.com
2487901	2501808	But I don't know, I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy, you know, I don't care, but yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my finger on it.
2502608	2505550	Like, you just kind of, like, go, eh, that's just not right.
2506490	2507311	That's not right.
2507611	2509152	To put out for WoW?
2509172	2510472	It is sad.
2510492	2511633	For WoW, Jamie.
2511673	2513894	People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii's, so...
2516994	2528296	I'm not saying that it's sad, I think, that someone is desperate enough, but honestly, more power to her.
2528816	2536298	If she says, you know what, I have no problem with giving it up a little bit for a mountain.
2536338	2543159	I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.
2544113	2549077	I mean, I would think that... I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything to actually earn it.
2549598	2549898	You know?
2550598	2552220	Like, in-game, like everybody else does.
2553441	2558125	But... But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG-type websites and all that.
2558205	2558505	Anyway.
2559326	2560407	Right?
2560527	2561928	It's pretty much the same thing.
2562765	2566806	For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.
2567086	2572488	It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.
2572508	2575349	Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?
2575389	2575669	I don't know.
2575689	2582631	It doesn't matter, though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly older chick, and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair.
2583852	2585252	But anyways, hey, great.
2585272	2587093	I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview.
2587133	2587933	Well, so much for that.
2587993	2588973	Loki ruined those chances.
2589294	2589674	That's fine.
2589694	2590194	I'll talk to her.
2593553	2595073	Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.
2595894	2598075	I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?
2598856	2604218	GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's enjoying it.
2604238	2606059	I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.
2606179	2608821	No, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.
2610012	2611713	So let's do it for free, whores get paid.
2611733	2612373	So she was being a whore.
2612393	2613374	She was being a whore.
2613434	2615034	It was a world of whorecraft.
2615355	2617055	She wasn't a slut, she was a whore, big difference.
2617516	2623599	But again... I don't know if GSCC might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone care?
2623659	2625299	There's male prostitutes, they're whores.
2626320	2626880	Well, I know that.
2626900	2628621	There's people who give up the butt love for money.
2628641	2630402	I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?
2630722	2631422	I know that!
2631442	2634304	I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.
2636118	2637399	I get it for free, okay?
2637700	2645150	I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with Sauce over AIM, which I'm not on.
2645431	2646132	Nobody IM me.
2646673	2646873	Okay.
2650134	2650855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2672731	2674332	I mean, if not this, then what?
2674692	2675732	She could have been a stripper.
2676092	2677152	She would have stripped for cash.
2677593	2679733	Just use the cash to buy the gold from IGE.
2679853	2680333	There you go.
2680474	2682334	All she's doing, she's cutting out the middleman.
2682374	2685815	She's going straight from stripping to her mount.
2685955	2690037	It's the same difference of saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help me get my mount.
2691537	2692677	It's an exchange of services.
2693338	2697619	It's just bringing it from... Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.
2697859	2698919	She could have done stripping.
2700380	2700400	I...
2701492	2703533	I say it was her choice to do it.
2704593	2710715	If anyone's going to judge her, look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can afford to judge somebody else.
2710735	2711315	That's what I say.
2711455	2712496	Okay, put it this way.
2712676	2714316	Let me lay it out to you straight here.
2715317	2720959	She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.
2721639	2722159	So is she.
2722259	2725380	I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.
2725400	2726040	What's your point?
2726521	2727821	Yeah, but you don't have sex with...
2728638	2731439	Fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.
2733540	2736480	Well, she has sex with Dan, and he buys her games.
2736700	2738621	I mean... Yeah, but I married him.
2740742	2742362	That's why Jamie has... Wait!
2742562	2743523	I'm not 31 yet.
2744863	2746884	That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.
2747784	2748084	No.
2748744	2749464	I'm just teasing.
2749584	2750885	Obviously, there's a big difference.
2750965	2751925	No, that's wrong.
2752245	2752705	I know it is.
2752845	2753986	I'm not 31 yet, by the way.
2754006	2755346	Okay, well, there you go.
2755406	2756327	I have four days!
2757247	2757747	Stop it!
2758900	2760121	I have 2 a.m.
2760201	2761602	on Thursday, so just be nice to me.
2761662	2764084	I wonder if this chick's got, like, fucking kids and stuff.
2764144	2766526	I mean, because... Mommy, what are you doing?
2766546	2768708	Oh, yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.
2770289	2771110	At least I got my mouth.
2771410	2772991	All right, this topic's gone on way too long.
2773812	2775253	We can bring it up in Skype line again later.
2775413	2777094	Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.
2777254	2777535	Please.
2778075	2779656	In fact, you've been eating all the fucking Pocky.
2780737	2781298	It's good.
2782058	2782418	I know.
2782518	2785681	I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's a cookies and cream.
2786482	2786762	Anyway...
2788035	2793138	So all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?
2794058	2794498	Right?
2796639	2797300	No, I'm just kidding.
2797320	2799161	Actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.
2799201	2800161	I really like it.
2800181	2807325	You can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.
2808125	2809706	So it's 500 points.
2810266	2813828	The three packs, or pack one is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of Spades.
2814622	2841120	Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar Which for me, the top of all of those was Pack 1 for me You know, at least two good songs in there But you're basically playing about two bucks a song And the interesting thing that was You know, they're going to keep having these packs on here If they're going to be that much, you're going to end up actually spending a whole lot of money To get some of these extra songs for packs of three
2843007	2847228	Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?
2847589	2847989	Go ahead.
2848749	2850230	Um, this is bullshit!
2851010	2854491	Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?
2854651	2857592	Like, 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?
2857632	2858292	Guitar and game?
2858332	2859633	No, maybe 69, I don't remember.
2859793	2860633	Yeah, it was pretty expensive.
2860673	2870497	Regardless, it was not $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the songpacks at this price, you will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.
2872537	2872997	That's hot.
2873478	2876480	This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.
2897830	2901793	Because they know it's going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloadable backs.
2902153	2902534	Right.
2903094	2905656	Yeah, they're really just jumping ship.
2905696	2907037	You know what I mean.
2907217	2915844	They're totally not going to milk the franchise by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for it.
2915904	2917545	This works for Harmonix, though.
2917826	2921368	If you think about it, Loki, they ripped themselves off with Guitar Freaks.
2921388	2922469	Guitar Freaks is what?
2922569	2924291	It's Amplitude with a guitar controller.
2925752	2926092	Kind of.
2926877	2928378	Guitar Hero, yeah.
2953442	2958483	I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and they're easy to copy over.
2958703	2959644	Well, then they should be cheap.
2960424	2965145	Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges like 99 cents a song.
2965165	2967265	And those songs are way better produced.
2967666	2972767	Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2973047	2977448	But still, for $2, I know you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.
2978536	2982817	Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.
2983157	2985258	Why can't you throw some of those?
2986198	2987378	Throw a classic pack up.
2987659	2989099	Why even do the packs at all?
2989639	2991540	Some of those songs kind of suck, and I don't want them.
2992000	2992420	Exactly.
2992440	2993440	That's why they're doing packs.
2993460	2995721	I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.
2995741	2996001	Exactly.
2996681	2997962	The Red Hot Chili Peppers one, it's...
3024082	3026644	or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.
3027344	3029346	TheRobD is making some interesting points in our chat.
3029466	3033889	Chat.Orangelandradio.com I think that rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.
3034790	3036491	There's just not much you can do about it.
3036731	3038452	It's not like you can innovate a guitar.
3038572	3039773	It's Tony Hawk syndrome.
3040974	3043276	Well, but in a way, in a way...
3043999	3048680	Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as the Guitar Freaks guitar.
3049020	3050321	And you sort of saw it coming.
3050401	3052762	Like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games a long time.
3053102	3057703	Remember, Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks, because what did they do before they made games?
3057763	3066446	They were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income off of music games, like Konami's Beatmania series and all the songs there.
3067466	3071427	They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons.
3071994	3073755	and everybody always asks, why did they put five?
3073775	3075015	Because Guitar Freaks only has three.
3075476	3077597	And everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?
3077617	3077777	Why?
3078017	3087201	And everybody speculated, oh, Guitar Freaks, like Super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation 2, their Super Duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows that.
3087682	3089963	Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.
3090383	3094065	Well, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed off about.
3094585	3100608	I don't know if, some people may have seen this in the forums, and I mentioned a little on top of the show, how I built my own
3101138	3104321	Guitar Hero effects pedal.
3104961	3111767	Basically the thing, which is going to be yet another purchase, is just a fucking push-button switch.
3112268	3122096	It's something very simple that, I mean, shit, I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're going to have to buy, and that's going to be in addition to the guitar and everything.
3122156	3126580	So say they sell it for ten bucks, there's another ten bucks you're paying for a fucking button!
3127225	3130989	for something that, granted, is probably not necessary, but here are the songpacks.
3131289	3133631	And yet it's something extra that you're going to be buying.
3134632	3136694	So, there you go.
3136914	3137455	Wonderful.
3138576	3141939	And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game.
3142099	3142540	But it works.
3143040	3146944	I know that for a fact.
3146964	3150227	I do agree that other music game series are becoming stagnant as well.
3150247	3151468	You know, I love DDR.
3151588	3152149	I really do.
3152642	3153523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3168695	3172779	A while ago, my idea, and granted, you don't have to use this idea, this is just an idea.
3173159	3181628	You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole Dance Magic mode from DDR Disney and Battle Mode in Supernova.
3181888	3184631	Battle Mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.
3184691	3187914	It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever.
3188034	3189836	And in The Groove, same thing.
3189916	3191217	It had a similar mode in there.
3191237	3192298	It was just kind of an afterthought.
3193169	3202817	Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select and, you know, I don't know, this whole, like, you got served kind of atmosphere there.
3203117	3206419	And there could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive.
3206780	3208361	And that's a way you could innovate DDR.
3208461	3209141	But I don't know.
3209362	3214506	If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, what DDR Supernova was one of the top 25 selling games last year.
3214866	3220270	If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess why bother innovating?
3220290	3221571	It costs money to innovate.
3222692	3222852	Meh.
3223274	3224955	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
3251001	3251682	Quake 3 Quake 3 Quake 3
3270376	3274098	because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.
3274158	3276799	No, I'll actually literally throw up on you.
3276819	3278340	That's right, you get the motion sickness thing.
3279440	3281161	How long can you play before you start getting sick?
3282301	3284542	Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.
3285483	3287044	Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?
3287064	3287664	About five minutes.
3287984	3288604	All right, well, good.
3288744	3290485	Five minutes, I can get five frags on you at least.
3290505	3291405	I'm really good at Quake.
3291546	3292046	All right, well.
3292966	3295107	I was a pro at Gatchaman Quake.
3295747	3296708	Gatchaman Quake?
3296888	3297168	Yep.
3297568	3298369	And I can actually play the...
3299955	3301576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3329167	3334131	So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3 logically is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?
3334911	3335592	So, we'll see.
3337633	3341897	I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.
3341977	3343978	It's probably the only thing that was thought before.
3344018	3345859	Downloadable mods would be great.
3346580	3347501	Oh, that would be awesome.
3348241	3351043	That would be cool if when they release this, they put downloadable mods.
3351264	3356447	They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.
3356507	3358449	Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...
3359573	3360933	You only have a few more months for that.
3362294	3363554	Well, here's some other news, though.
3364574	3374536	For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will be available in Europe and America in June.
3377737	3385358	They were not giving too many details as far as when it will actually be available in Europe, though.
3386844	3401930	But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels.
3402410	3403231	So that's pretty cool.
3406072	3408993	But also the thing about this is that it's...
3410641	3417051	Sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying, that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.
3417212	3418453	Yeah, but that may be console, though.
3419094	3420256	Yeah, so is Gears of War.
3422359	3423862	We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.
3424833	3426814	Halo is exclusive.
3426834	3428115	Yeah, we got that on the PC as well.
3428456	3430377	It's exclusive to just be released.
3430397	3433640	It's exclusive to Microsoft's empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever.
3433760	3434581	It's their IP.
3434601	3435822	Yeah, that does make sense.
3435862	3441546	I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still a Microsoft product.
3441566	3442527	So, yeah, that makes sense.
3442547	3443928	Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.
3444309	3448592	Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.
3448632	3450033	They're not really referring to PCs.
3450314	3453156	Because I think they don't really generally...
3453916	3454716	PC Gamers and Console Gamers
3484141	3486282	Thanks for watching!
3507765	3514207	I don't know if they're going to be doing the O2 Jam thing where you can buy costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing.
3515087	3522850	But apparently you're going to be able to actually win signed stuff from actually playing the game.
3522930	3524310	So that might be kind of neat.
3525310	3527431	Or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like that.
3527691	3529291	I don't know.
3529852	3534753	That's good that it's free because I played the beta a few months ago and I'll be honest, I don't really remember it.
3534813	3536774	I reviewed it on this show but I couldn't tell you when.
3538158	3539759	and it was not something I would have paid for.
3540039	3541779	So I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free.
3542220	3545861	And sure, this whole pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that.
3545901	3546721	They'll make money from it.
3546881	3548062	Advertising, sure, what the hell.
3548942	3552703	How about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?
3552723	3554264	I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing.
3555004	3555544	Something like that.
3555624	3556004	Why not?
3557405	3559186	Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero?
3559226	3562187	Have stuff sponsored by different things.
3562267	3565688	Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.
3566249	3570572	You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who want to get out there and exposed.
3572794	3573074	I don't know.
3573915	3574756	It's still early, though.
3574856	3575737	I mean... It is.
3576097	3580500	I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2.
3580540	3583523	You know, they haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.
3583623	3585904	I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere.
3585925	3588026	Somebody was calling this Red Octane's Horse Armor.
3588587	3589507	And I could see that.
3590468	3592730	And certainly Oblivion... Actually, you know, I'll give it this...
3593686	3594006	Hopefully.
3594066	3594326	Hopefully.
3594367	3594767	Hopefully.
3624059	3628181	Um, hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.
3628321	3635944	It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but now what you think, it's the type of keyboard that actually plugs into your controller.
3636424	3639025	Um, it's that typical, um, Cordy is what they call it.
3639045	3644848	The Cordy keyboard, um, that actually plugs into the bottom of your controller so you can have it all right there in your hand.
3645308	3645488	Now,
3646024	3650405	I know what you might be thinking, is this is what I thought, is that, you know, well, why the hell do you need one of these?
3650805	3657127	Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.
3657147	3657748	It was fine.
3657888	3667090	Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something, put the, you know, keyboard back down.
3667431	3668751	This would actually be pretty quick for me.
3669031	3680316	Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since it was basically ported from the PC version and PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play the game completely on the keyboard.
3680336	3685518	The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going to be built to do that.
3685618	3688379	So you might need something like this in order to do that.
3688519	3696583	And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just typing something up in a chat window or something like that.
3697222	3700724	That's completely different to me, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.
3701185	3703526	But, you know, it's nice.
3704327	3706628	That way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.
3706668	3710031	I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.
3710971	3720958	I just hope it's not more than $20, because honestly, well, you know, we'll get into the reason this is coming out very soon, but, you know, it's just...
3722512	3723872	Hostile1 says, that looks useless to me.
3723892	3725373	Jaded suggests a keyboard mouse combo.
3750717	3758642	Funnydale says in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too long.
3760523	3763725	Oh, SSJ100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.
3764306	3767488	I'd pay to have the advantage or the mini-bosses in Guitar Hero.
3768248	3771610	Too bad most of their songs are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.
3772471	3776193	What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?
3777654	3779675	Well, maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.
3780126	3780486	DarkSakura
3808806	3813009	Who's on tap this week?
3813369	3814470	We got a bunch of crap.
3814990	3816211	Really?
3816591	3822215	First email actually is a link from Heon.
3827098	3830160	It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters.
3831000	3831601	I'm not sure.
3832581	3835463	But the point that I wanted to say was actually in the email it says,
3835885	3836866	Wanted to let you know about it.
3836926	3838046	Loki probably already knew.
3838446	3840047	Love the show, but it needs more lesbians.
3843449	3844210	Um, yeah.
3844630	3845990	Is that in our show role later on?
3846031	3846491	I don't remember.
3846551	3850493	No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.
3850753	3852054	No, it wasn't announced.
3852094	3853775	It was found on Gamefly.
3854075	3854195	Oh.
3854575	3855035	Yeah.
3855396	3855856	Oh, okay.
3856196	3859058	I'm like... It was officially leaked on Gamefly.
3859238	3859578	I see.
3861139	3864641	So... That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.
3864681	3865001	I wonder...
3866172	3869293	I wonder what tips him off.
3869594	3871835	People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.
3871915	3872595	Yes, that's true.
3875797	3880739	Anyway, we also have, actually, our friend Rob with 2B's.
3881314	3881554	No comment?
3881574	3881874	I, um... Um...
3910973	3911454	Video Game System R
3933527	3933887	PG-13, PG-13, PG-13, PG-13
3963257	3967078	Yeah, the fuck word is used, like, you know, Janine Garofalo's in it, end of story.
3967098	3968439	I love Janine Garofalo.
3968459	3968939	Who doesn't?
3968999	3972581	But the point is, is that, you know, those are very different kinds of movies.
3973001	3976762	Like, I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, okay?
3976842	3979783	A couple little, you know, fucks isn't gonna kill him.
3980904	3981444	No!
3982124	3984205	You hear the word fuck and you suddenly want to kill people.
3984925	3988987	Yeah, but, you know, I would not let them watch, you know, Terminator 2.
3989707	3990007	I would.
3990828	3992088	Well, you and I are different.
3993260	3994800	Dude, I saw Terminator 2 in the theater.
3994840	3995481	That was awesome.
3996101	3997021	Anyway, next email.
3997701	3998842	Hey guys, Seisha here.
3999502	4005383	I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft and whether it will really matter to them.
4005963	4018867	I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce games these days, so going multi-platform solves that problem.
4020681	4023762	I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.
4025062	4027102	It's just something that I heard and it makes sense.
4027642	4034084	But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multi-platform, do you think this would really affect the sales of the PS3 or would it not really matter?
4034564	4036824	I'm not so sure myself and thought I'd ask you guys.
4037104	4040665	Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in.
4041145	4042345	And a big shout to Irene.
4043445	4043725	Heart.
4045346	4045766	Oh, thank you.
4045866	4046666	That was good timing.
4047366	4048126	Yeah, she just walked in the room.
4048627	4049387	Take care, people.
4049647	4050948	Stay fooking epic.
4051068	4051568	Love, Stacia.
4051588	4054669	Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.
4054729	4055290	No, I'm kidding.
4055850	4056470	Hi, Stacia.
4057010	4057371	You're hot.
4058031	4058511	I'm going to go now.
4059211	4059351	Bye.
4060952	4062253	So, answer?
4063533	4070096	Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it does come to the 360 since more people have a 360.
4071016	4073897	But then again, I mean, I don't know.
4075458	4078359	If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that would be a
4079481	4104382	Big blow to Sony because it would give people, you know, yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3 because it's like, you know, if you don't have any exclusive games, no one's really going to want, I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive games with Microsoft and, you know, may not be something that everybody wants, but, you know, it's a lot less exclusive games than say Sony has right now and I don't know.
4105425	4111688	I think it makes perfect sense to go multi-platform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track record, though.
4112508	4114489	They're definitely ones for exclusive content.
4114569	4115389	Not necessarily.
4115810	4123873	They used to be like that, but see now, with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're releasing games on a bunch of different systems.
4124233	4134258	Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation 3 version, since they're going to make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.
4136038	4164385	why I don't know but because they haven't milked it enough yet I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple sequel thing like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy 7 although even though I think Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 5 is my favorite of the series but Final Fantasy 6 was I think their most epic but Final Fantasy 7 is the fan favorite I think that they're just trying to say let's make this the next Final Fantasy 7 and beat it into the ground probably
4165251	4166492	It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.
4167473	4168413	So, next email, huh?
4170335	4173637	This one is from Sakura Max, I guess.
4175038	4181022	By now, I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff, and I am now dead.
4181363	4182464	I have two requests.
4182984	4186707	Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.
4186727	4188568	While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.
4189429	4192631	I seriously am a dead tauren, and I will be served medium rare...
4194485	4197007	I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter of days.
4198368	4203072	Sakuramax in Dethika server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters' names?
4204052	4208356	If you want to find out the character names, go check out... Yeah, go on the forums.
4208456	4209356	Ha ha, cheap plug.
4210497	4218463	Also, as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.
4218483	4220625	I don't know if someone happens to, you know,
4221141	4223542	Have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat.
4223562	4223942	Who knows?
4224002	4224602	Maybe one day.
4224642	4228783	But I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube vid.
4229223	4231964	There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools.
4232004	4232644	Go check that out.
4233124	4237926	And as far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little clips.
4238286	4240446	And you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro.
4240466	4241587	That's the song we use for the outro.
4241887	4244127	We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permissions.
4244147	4245928	You know, copyright issues, blah, blah, blah.
4246248	4248048	And we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.
4249269	4250309	Well, next email, shall I?
4251340	4251680	Sure.
4251900	4253381	Hey, OLR, it's me, Neki.
4254321	4254722	Excuse me.
4255522	4256462	Neki's on my MySpace now.
4257223	4265107	I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.
4265407	4267088	Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.
4267148	4267808	Oh, thank you.
4268608	4274231	I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week, and I will have my diploma by the weekend.
4274751	4275171	Congrats.
4275251	4275532	Rad.
4276032	4278573	We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.
4279133	4279413	Okay.
4280014	4280594	Guitar hero.
4283375	4284516	Let me read the email!
4284596	4286598	Orange Lounge Match Game, coming soon to mobile phones.
4288499	4294484	And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they should listen to this show when you weren't there, Jamie.
4294804	4295064	What?
4295725	4300288	Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news that week.
4300668	4301409	Isn't that every week?
4301569	4302830	He was just being lazy that week.
4304151	4308014	Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week, because here's the deal.
4308610	4309650	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4338103	4342644	B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.
4343145	4343745	But it doesn't matter.
4343765	4344985	It is what it is.
4345025	4346966	I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.
4347146	4347826	It'll be good.
4349106	4352807	But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following gaming news next week.
4352888	4354868	So it's going to be the Loki show.
4356229	4359089	Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.
4359610	4362090	As you love pinball and like Lego, here's a great match.
4362650	4364371	Okay, there's apparently a pinball match.
4364892	4366593	Xbox 360 Regional Compatibility Guide
4387395	4388536	I didn't even know that was possible.
4388696	4396760	The website is at xbox-sky.com slash xbox360 underscore regional underscore compatibility underscore guide.
4397540	4406544	And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on like, are they talking about like all regions or just compatible games?
4406564	4409626	Because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.
4410946	4413828	These are all region.
4415169	4415969	Pretty interesting stuff.
4417117	4418958	A few games are multi-region.
4419038	4420639	Far Cry works on both.
4420779	4422360	Fear works on all three.
4423060	4426782	It even goes as far as listing the PAL ones as well.
4427042	4427602	That's pretty cool.
4428883	4431244	Anyway, thanks for the link.
4431324	4432305	That's weird.
4432365	4433746	Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.
4433766	4434366	That's kind of weird.
4435246	4438308	I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room.
4438708	4439709	Unless, Rob, you want to do it for me?
4439849	4440269	Sure, why not?
4440289	4440389	Okay.
4440409	4440509	Okay.
4441224	4443346	R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.
4457034	4468102	Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into it, and the USNTSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website I aforementioned.
4468522	4475847	I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making a 20 gigabyte and the announced 120 gigabyte.
4476228	4482212	Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.
4483169	4487271	My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced.
4488111	4490832	I love the phrase, being serviced.
4491333	4495835	I'm having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will be up, quote, soon.
4496035	4496875	Nice plug, by the way.
4496895	4498496	He's saying, yeah, I got my site in.
4499216	4500457	Anyways, bye, Neki.
4502038	4504118	I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.
4504419	4504679	No.
4504979	4505579	I like Neki.
4505639	4506139	Neki's cool.
4507740	4508480	Last email.
4508540	4509561	Dun, dun, dun.
4510922	4527834	Hey guys, love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered, I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school, work, convention, or at a concert, simply, how many people do you estimate listen to your show?
4527914	4528454	End of sentence.
4528875	4529575	Thank you very much.
4530976	4532777	Kurt somebody, who am I going to say the last name?
4534799	4535019	Sorry.
4536080	4540523	I was going to say real quick, looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan of, you know,
4542481	4543962	Soccer or football.
4544923	4547525	But you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.
4547906	4549187	Both will work on the U.S.
4550628	4551469	Xbox 360s.
4551849	4552509	That's kind of neat.
4553590	4554491	Except it's in PAL.
4554611	4556072	But I'm sure if you're TV, you know.
4557053	4558494	Isn't HD standard?
4558554	4561557	Yeah, HD is pretty standard.
4561617	4565140	As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest.
4565180	4566961	We don't track it very well.
4568242	4571245	We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed.
4571687	4574328	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4600457	4602259	I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.
4602859	4604280	You know what I mean, though.
4604480	4606802	It is an excuse in the end.
4607643	4608564	Heart, heart, heart.
4610625	4611546	So, I don't know.
4611606	4613427	I do need a good excuse to hang out with Loki.
4615008	4618471	So in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.
4619192	4621614	I'm going to lowball it.
4621814	4624136	I don't know.
4624276	4625156	It's kind of weird.
4625417	4627898	I don't know if we should say.
4629199	4629900	It's not important.
4630868	4631648	Is it really important?
4631968	4632488	I don't think it is.
4633109	4633249	No.
4634049	4635329	I'll say this.
4635629	4636390	It's four digits.
4636770	4640031	It's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.
4640531	4643171	We'll leave it there on the lower end.
4643972	4644512	All right, that's it.
4644592	4645432	That's it for the emails.
4646532	4646852	All right.
4647853	4648193	Yay.
4649093	4656035	Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned it last week a little bit,
4656812	4684937	Spring Update is going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360 including instant messaging via Windows Messenger and that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller but you're going to be able to message people while playing games and also while watching movies and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list as well which is kind of nifty and
4686010	4702014	Some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for some different video codecs, like MPEG-4, H.264, and Play For Sure, which is kind of neat.
4703275	4707136	Yeah, but no Xvid and DivX support yet.
4708376	4712377	But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and that's awesome.
4712577	4714418	I like that they're adding stuff instead of...
4720385	4726910	Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message people on MSN?
4727510	4728071	I know I won't.
4728691	4730753	I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.
4731333	4736196	You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.
4737597	4741941	But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.
4742421	4743922	Usually that takes concentration, you know?
4744224	4744985	How about this, Rob?
4745345	4748908	Switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.
4749369	4754173	You can do Letterboxd, Zoom, Stretch, and Native since you've lost your remote.
4754513	4755594	I didn't lose the remote.
4756195	4759138	Somebody lost their remote, but it wasn't me because it happened while I was on vacation.
4759878	4760759	But we won't go there.
4764202	4765123	Let's see what else.
4766685	4766785	Um...
4768436	4769217	Oh, this is kind of cool.
4769257	4779465	The whole downloading stuff, while you can download in the background, you can also set your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in a low-power mode.
4781266	4781866	Like a PC.
4786210	4796998	It says, a new option in auto-downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.
4797618	4798239	That's kind of nifty.
4800606	4800846	I don't know.
4802467	4806730	The Rob Dean chant is taunting me because I always decline his hold'em invites.
4807691	4808231	I feel bad.
4808291	4808951	This one's kind of cool.
4809612	4823961	Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they can boast about their achievement scores.
4825462	4826923	Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.
4827825	4831388	I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.
4831808	4832189	Hooray.
4835751	4836412	That's going to be fun.
4837233	4839434	That's... yeah.
4839615	4841836	God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.
4842857	4844158	You're not an ass, Rob.
4844539	4847821	I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes play Texas Hold'em with us.
4848001	4851524	GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that.
4851544	4853786	Is it you guys play on, like, what, Friday and Saturday night?
4854206	4855207	That's clubbing night.
4856308	4857349	You don't go clubbing anymore.
4858266	4859427	Once in a great while, I do.
4860027	4860568	I want to go.
4861849	4862950	Well, we can sometime.
4862970	4864971	Okay.
4866132	4866572	How about this?
4866973	4870715	We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?
4871976	4872517	I'm just teasing.
4872537	4873898	We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.
4873918	4874338	That would be fun.
4874598	4875119	Yeah, we do.
4875359	4876239	Anyhow, back to games.
4877160	4879902	You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.
4879922	4880583	Wouldn't that be fun?
4880763	4882724	People would so laugh at you.
4882744	4883805	Yeah, talk about looking like an ass.
4884761	4891527	Anyway, last week on the show I ranted and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar was broken.
4891867	4893649	Although, well, you know, it did work.
4893709	4894289	It would play the game.
4894329	4897672	I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.
4897832	4899174	You could fix them, by the way.
4899494	4900354	Yeah, but here's the thing.
4900395	4901115	Now you don't have to.
4901135	4904858	Apparently Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.
4904898	4906400	They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m.
4907795	4913138	That will resolve the situation where input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.
4913238	4914999	Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.
4916180	4917300	And guess what else it does?
4917641	4919342	It bricks consoles, supposedly.
4919362	4920942	It freezes your game, yay!
4921143	4925745	I don't know, there's reports on the internet, something's hit and dig, like all these people's consoles are getting bricked.
4926345	4930167	And I don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence, or if the patch did something.
4930668	4933409	It really is calibration, that's what it was.
4933950	4934650	And, I mean...
4935228	4963475	I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing they put hot glue in the screws so I can't I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy bar to adjust it thank you very much you bastards how dare they well here's something that we started asking why they dare since a lot of people are not too very fond of the first one although I thought it was cool
4965090	4970054	There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.
4971315	4984005	In the May edition of the official Xbox magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually in progress.
4984885	4987608	And that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it.
4987628	4989449	But right now it's rumor mill fodder.
4989749	4990690	Book tie-ins?
4991130	4991210	Joy.
4991230	4991951	They have a lot of books.
4992639	4994520	I'm sorry, wait, what game's getting a sequel?
4994980	4995720	Perfect Dark Zero.
4999481	4999781	Dork.
5000021	5001862	Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.
5002442	5005102	I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.
5005162	5006563	This show needs a soundboard.
5006963	5012965	Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where you actually have normal jumps.
5014605	5015665	I like the super jumps.
5015725	5016766	I like being able to fly.
5016786	5017386	I like jumping!
5018506	5019226	Yay, jumping!
5019686	5019967	Anyway.
5021107	5021467	Anyways.
5022183	5029292	This week, Capcom has had their Gamers Day, although we weren't invited.
5030053	5036501	And they announced a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.
5036988	5047130	including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about including Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix which is a fucking long-ass name and stupid.
5047150	5050251	Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter 2 game with a longer title.
5050291	5051291	I mean, I think that's the joke.
5051471	5053372	I think that's seriously a joke.
5054252	5056752	It's like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter 2 game name.
5057632	5061433	Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max extreme.
5061553	5061833	Lame.
5061993	5062974	Okay, that's lame.
5063434	5064434	Lame, lame, lame.
5064949	5066450	Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
5093863	5095524	Wasn't that in our match game a couple weeks ago?
5095564	5100286	Didn't we do a match game just like three weeks ago here on the show about what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came up?
5100626	5100886	Yeah, probably.
5100926	5103287	That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.
5104548	5105548	I do want Puzzle Fighter.
5105568	5106088	That's awesome.
5106108	5106489	I'll buy it.
5106649	5107169	It's awesome.
5107189	5107629	Hell yeah.
5108750	5110490	I heard they're adding new modes and stuff, too.
5111131	5114712	They're going to have a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.
5115192	5116293	Wait a minute.
5116533	5119314	The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo, actually, now that I think about it.
5119714	5122676	There was also the other game, Panel de Pon, which I think...
5124165	5127128	Puzzle the Pawn is Bustamove Puzzle the Pawn is exactly the same game
5147000	5149101	I'm sure somebody in chat is correcting us right now.
5149161	5155686	I want to have a version of... I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to... I'll be damned, he's right.
5155786	5158448	It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.
5159588	5160789	No, but it was paneled upon.
5160829	5161590	Is it paneled upon?
5161790	5162370	Puzzled upon.
5163331	5163851	Who cares?
5163991	5165472	I used to play this game all the time.
5166953	5169735	You know what game I would love them to bring out a version of over here?
5169795	5170536	It's Puzzling Desu.
5170596	5171536	It's paneled upon.
5171596	5172517	It's got to be this game.
5173578	5174558	That makes much more sense.
5174698	5175639	It's Tetris Attack...
5176021	5176861	Pokemon Puzzle League.
5176881	5177962	That game makes more sense.
5178302	5179843	That game makes more sense to have in there.
5180203	5181344	Alright, that's paneled upon.
5181384	5181904	My bad.
5183185	5184685	I still want Puzzle and Descent.
5185886	5191469	Um, one last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Exos of Evil, and Talisman.
5191809	5195671	Um, and it's basically, you know, this universe that they've created.
5195831	5200213	It's very similar, like, Robotron crossed with, they were saying, um,
5201246	5202026	Geometry Wars.
5202627	5204528	They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays.
5204588	5206749	But anyways, it's going to be a top-down shooter game.
5208189	5212351	Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up.
5212892	5214152	So, awesome!
5214753	5217514	That's coming Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
5220362	5226846	Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed at Capcom Gamers Day.
5226906	5229327	It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations.
5229447	5232289	And of course, there's a little trailer that goes with it that you can see on the internet.
5232889	5234450	Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.
5234470	5235471	I saw a little glimpse of it.
5235891	5238893	And I believe it goes back to one time.
5238933	5243536	The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court.
5243936	5245057	So, whatever.
5245837	5247358	There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there.
5247378	5248439	They'll be very happy about this.
5248659	5248999	I still...
5249497	5251198	I still have somehow missed the first games.
5251238	5260284	This is one of those series like, you know how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?
5260824	5261745	This is one of those games.
5261765	5262565	Okay, question for you.
5262805	5263006	What?
5263206	5271971	How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it, you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?
5272131	5272832	Dude, I hope so.
5274333	5277755	Also, if you can't get enough Attorney games, hey, wait for this.
5278106	5283890	Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP.
5284350	5288052	So, not the new stuff, but, you know, the old console's feeling a little loved there.
5288933	5305924	Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and, you know, he defends famous cartoon characters, so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to get other licenses to get, like, you know... But I guess they just won't have any of the other
5307608	5308429	Drew Nami, ThePhoenixRightFan
5332581	5337605	Young Phoenix Wright being on trial for murder with his teacher Mia Fey defending him
