0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	20000	Tonight, April 15th, 2007, 360 is set to get a new keyboard for its spring update.
20000	27000	It's Parappa the Rappa set to get another sequel, and would you mount for a mount?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	35000	The answer is no, but we'll get to that later in the show.
35000	42000	Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47000	49000	Money.
49000	50000	That's what I want.
50000	53000	No, that's what I just spent a whole bunch of.
53000	55000	Really, on what?
55000	57000	On one of our giggling lesbians.
57000	62000	I see. Alright. Well, can I have a loan?
62000	65000	Ask my accountant.
65000	69000	Alright. Uncle Scrooge, is Uncle Scrooge your accountant?
69000	70000	No.
70000	73000	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
73000	75000	Hello.
75000	76000	How you doing, Loki?
76000	78000	Good. So far.
78000	79000	So far?
79000	80000	Yeah.
80000	84000	But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?
84000	89000	I need food. I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet.
89000	91000	Angry Loki needs food badly.
91000	93000	I'm not angry, I'm just hungry.
93000	95000	Don't shoot food.
95000	98000	Exactly. Unless it's into my mouth.
98000	101000	Not Angry Loki is about to die.
101000	107000	I love Gauntlet, but seriously, they overdid Gauntlet. Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.
107000	113000	Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet, then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet, then we had, you know, it was overdone.
113000	115000	Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.
115000	119000	It should have been, like, Gauntlet Legends, and, you know...
119000	123000	Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome. I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.
123000	125000	Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.
125000	126000	Yeah.
126000	128000	Alright. Well, anyway.
128000	137000	Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week, we tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
137000	143000	Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday, so I would be heading into your sixth year.
143000	147000	Our fifth birthday is coming up in June. That's going to be exciting.
147000	150000	So, we're hoping to have a big show for that one.
150000	158000	I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.
158000	160000	I would make a suggestion.
160000	161000	What's that?
161000	163000	It's all over the floor.
163000	164000	Well...
164000	166000	You've probably got enough for a corpse.
166000	172000	It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lounge Radio kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.
172000	178000	And, as much as I'd like to have, like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.
178000	186000	So, we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like, somewhere else.
186000	192000	Like, at Golf Land or, I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese. I don't give a shit.
192000	194000	I have a grill at my house.
194000	196000	It's not here. Want to go to your house? Have a barbecue?
196000	197000	We can have a barbecue at my house.
197000	198000	Orange Lounge Barbecue?
198000	200000	Let's do the Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.
200000	202000	So, you don't care if strangers come to your house?
202000	204000	I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.
204000	209000	Alright, there you go. Hide Shermy. Because somebody might try to kill her.
209000	210000	Shermy will hide herself.
210000	214000	Alright. Anyhow, so more details on that to come. That'll be coming up in a couple months.
214000	219000	Alright, let's get to it. We'll start off with How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Soccer.
219000	225000	Um, I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.
225000	230000	And, uh, that's actually, you know, I played a lot of Cookie Mama while waiting at the bank.
230000	232000	Things I do for us.
232000	234000	The sacrifices I make.
234000	237000	I learned how to make Tonkatsu.
237000	239000	Have you not played Cookie Mama on the Wii yet?
239000	241000	No, I'm broke.
241000	244000	You really should at some point. Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.
244000	248000	It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game. Ever.
248000	249000	Yuck.
249000	254000	Well, wait. Resident Evil, then Cookie Mama.
254000	258000	I hope that is not Chris's blood.
258000	261000	You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.
261000	262000	Right.
262000	263000	Anyway.
263000	265000	Or do you?
265000	266000	Gotta...
266000	267000	I don't know.
267000	268000	Perf.
268000	272000	You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.
272000	274000	I don't even know where the hell that...
274000	275000	The Resident Evil prone...
275000	278000	Yeah, somebody sent me that on me three times. It was like Resident Evil voice acting...
278000	280000	I sent it to you!
280000	282000	Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.
282000	283000	Bitch.
283000	285000	I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.
285000	288000	Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.
288000	289000	No I don't.
289000	290000	So I have a big pink button.
290000	291000	No I don't.
291000	293000	I send you awesome.
293000	295000	So, is that it? Cookie Mama, what you gave me a week?
295000	300000	Oh, that and then let the PSP battery die.
300000	306040	and I couldn't find the charger so poo on him so that was a game you didn't
306040	314480	play very well done Jamie ah shut up also Joe you just got back from a road
314480	320400	trip right so yes angry angry drivers driving just stupid people that's why I
320400	324960	thought all right Loki how was your gaming week I played earth defense force
324960	334740	2017 per usual so that's fun I played briefly guitar hero 2 and that was
334740	339600	about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not gonna play much of
339600	344840	it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though
344840	350600	haven't really played much DDR either play boom boom rocket that was fun
350600	356040	actually it's doing pretty good on some of the songs but I don't they get pretty
356040	360240	hard and some of the achievements are actually pretty easy like unlocked five
360240	366280	after playing like the first song or something is weird and then I played
366280	372980	gnarly golf which that's an old Apple to GS game that I played through an Apple
372980	378800	to GS emulator on the internet and I miss that game except it's really crappy
378800	382440	now why that game of all games I don't know it's a game I used to play a long
382440	387640	time ago and it was fun I remembered it being a lot more fun but the emulator
387640	394240	didn't work right right so you never lose lives so I beat the whole game and
394240	400360	I was like this dumb uh then let's see what else did I play I played Super
400360	408320	Paper Mario and it has way too much dialogue 20 minutes of fucking dialogue
408320	416600	before I can play the game that's retarded but it's okay so far what else
416600	426760	did they play that's about it I think yeah all right let's see I Mikey movie I
426760	431680	also play Super Paper Mario a lot I think it's great I think it's an awesome
431680	437240	game I like the whole old-school side scroller thing mixed with like the
437240	441600	role-playing elements and I think that 3d thing is freaking brilliant I love
441600	444000	the fact that you can you know hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3d
444000	447840	world and you really have to kind of explore and dig around and then like the
447840	451000	fact that the other characters have their abilities to see I have to juggle
451000	454800	it it's really like imagine if Super Mario Brothers were like a puzzle game
454800	458320	in some regards like practice for the game feels like sometimes there's fetch
458320	462800	quests and everything it's fun but I'm unlike Loki I thought the dialogue was
462800	465720	kind of fun I mean yeah it has a long opening to the game but you know they're
465720	468720	just trying to set the stage because you know they couldn't have just done
468720	472680	another you know princess gets kidnapped story although well to some extent that
472680	476320	is what they did but it's much deeper than that this time so when they
476320	480120	introduced new characters and you know there's that quirky sense of humor that
480120	483040	comes with a lot of the Mario role-playing games like definitely
483040	486520	reminds me the Mario and Luigi series series the sense of humor that's in the
486520	490960	game so I disagree with you look yeah I think I think the dialogue is cool well
490960	495100	it didn't have the dialogue was cool it's just I didn't really care for 20
495100	498480	minutes of it right in the beginning of the game you know to me why just why
498480	502080	didn't you skip the opening wedding because I wanted to know the story
502080	508920	because that obviously it's there if it's important I mean so I just wish
508920	512280	they would have liked you know paraphrased or maybe broken it up a
512280	517040	little bit you know instead of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
517040	520440	blah blah blah blah play a little bit Oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
550440	555720	Seriously though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?
555720	562120	I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the chaos
562120	563120	heart.
563120	564120	I mean, come on!
564120	565120	I didn't think of that.
565120	567720	It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.
567720	568720	So whatever.
568720	569720	I'll play the game.
569720	570720	It's gonna be awesome.
570720	574760	No, don't get me wrong, but it's just, seriously, they could've spaced out the dialogue a little
574760	575760	bit more.
575760	576760	Gotta love our chat room.
576760	580920	OrangeLawnTradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.
580920	586440	Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?
586440	589840	Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.
589840	594440	It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote goddamn Super Paper Mario.
594440	599040	It's like, and Luigi came, buh buh buh buh buh, I mean, Stephen King just writes about
599040	603840	nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.
603840	607680	It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden
607680	611600	my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm gonna go down the street and find
611600	612600	out what goes down there.
612600	615480	And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.
615480	616480	Exactly.
616480	617480	Stupid.
617480	618480	But that's right.
618480	621320	I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.
621320	626160	Just need Super Mario RPG to come to virtual console and we'll be all good.
626160	627160	The game is great.
627160	628160	I just bought that!
628160	629160	For three dollars.
629160	630160	Oh, the original cartridge, right?
630160	631160	Yep.
631160	632160	Where'd you find that?
632160	634640	Stephen traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.
634640	635640	Well, lucky you.
635640	636640	I'm sure that'll be awesome.
636640	638120	You think that'll come out on virtual console?
638120	641680	I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario,
641680	644880	or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.
644880	646760	Anyway, the game's awesome.
646760	648000	Don't listen to Loki's rants.
648000	649000	It's tolerable.
649000	650000	I didn't say it wasn't awesome.
650000	651880	I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.
651880	653820	Alright, well, great.
653820	656800	If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.
656800	657800	You just have to read.
657800	660080	I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.
660080	661080	Alright.
661080	666800	The only thing I think is gonna be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't
666800	670840	really see it as being the type of game I'm gonna go back through and play again a lot.
670840	672280	But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.
672280	673280	I don't know.
673280	676600	Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper
676600	679440	Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever, I don't know.
679440	682880	I kinda see it as something I'm gonna play once and be done with.
682880	683880	But we'll see.
683880	684880	We'll see.
684880	687380	Ask me again when I get there.
687380	692800	But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.
692800	695080	Also my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.
695080	700360	That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.
700360	704320	I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should've taken a picture of it, because, hey, it makes
704320	707840	my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 on the leaderboard.
707840	709720	But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard.
709720	712440	I was number five one day.
712440	716080	And I know you might be thinking, well, medium, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?
716080	720800	I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all 10 medium songs.
720800	725600	And I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main
725600	727280	Blades page comes from.
727280	731680	So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100%
731680	732880	perfects on all the songs.
732880	735920	So I don't know, whatever.
735920	738900	I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long
738900	740480	to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.
740480	746160	It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.
746160	750160	The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.
750160	755000	It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest
755000	757160	of the songs I won't want to play again.
757160	758760	I liked actually some of them.
758760	762180	There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.
762180	763300	I don't know.
763300	767320	I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad, because to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't
767320	769800	that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?
769800	773880	I'm all, fuck this shit, I should just put a pad in there.
773880	777200	Somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad, and I'm
777200	778200	sure, I haven't tried it.
778200	779200	I think you can.
779200	780200	I'm sure, why couldn't you?
780200	783400	The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.
783400	786640	There's no reason you couldn't do it, because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad
786640	788680	or the buttons, which is actually how I do it.
788680	790080	I use both.
790080	793640	I use left on the D-pad, and then the other three I use the buttons, because that allows
793640	795100	me to have the triggers as well.
795100	797400	It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.
797400	800200	Don't do all direction, or don't do all buttons.
800200	804840	Do like one or two of the arrows on the direction pad, and then the other two on the buttons,
804840	808960	and if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.
808960	814900	There is one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.
814900	815900	So I was like, um, okay.
815900	819080	Well you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.
819080	823560	Well it was up, up, and left, left.
823560	828040	Well then yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there, hit left on D-pad
828040	829040	and left on the button.
829040	830040	I don't know.
830040	832240	I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.
832240	836040	Um, because I haven't played the game really for one night, just like I played it hardcore
836040	837040	like one night.
837040	839720	I played it for hours, but the songs just aren't replayable for me.
839720	843680	That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and like DDR, or Beatmania.
843680	848560	Let's say Beatmania, which you know, obviously this game is hugely inspired by.
848560	853180	Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again, and Konami obviously
853180	856880	has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.
856880	862200	Granted they license stuff, but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care
862200	863200	about anyway.
863200	864760	Well okay, maybe a little bit.
864760	866480	Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.
866480	868400	But most of it is forgettable, right?
868400	870160	But the original in-house stuff is great.
870160	874780	You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.
874780	879880	So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable
879880	880880	of creating music.
880880	886440	Unless they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.
886440	887440	EA tracks.
887440	888440	EA tracks.
888440	889440	Exactly.
889440	890640	Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?
890640	893120	Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?
893120	895600	It's because there's downloadable packs later.
895600	896600	Oh great.
896600	903540	So you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are not
903540	905840	even going to be that great I'm sure.
905840	907480	And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.
907480	912600	We'll get into that later.
912600	916360	Dark Tetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose.
916360	920240	SSJ100 Matt says fucking Avril.
920240	922820	Dark Shy says no insult J-Pop.
922820	924700	It's not all bad, but come on.
924700	926000	Some of it's pretty forgettable.
926000	927000	Some of it's not.
927000	928000	I like M-Flow.
928000	929480	They're pretty cool.
929480	931800	Third style for life.
931800	936160	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.
936160	939920	If everyone's done with their gaming week, tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.
939920	946200	I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games Community site, which is something we've
946200	951680	kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.
951680	955500	It's kind of like Myspace, but without the cam bots and horrors and stuff.
955500	957760	And it's people talking about video games.
957760	958760	It's pretty awesome.
958760	962800	So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.
962800	963800	I'm on there.
963800	964800	DarkSakura's on there.
964800	965800	Matt's on there.
965800	968480	I'd like you to check out if you have a chance.
968480	973920	I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time, because you
973920	977120	might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational
977120	978120	tide pool game.
978120	984040	And it kind of got me thinking this week, what are my favorite edutainment games from
984040	985040	yesteryear?
985040	986880	And of course, number one's The Oregon Trail.
986880	991800	But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.
991800	994160	And actually, I was looking at some of the comments, and I thought this was interesting
994160	997800	because the Rob D. already commented on my post, he says, this is probably just a generational
997800	1002360	gap considering that anything more than five years constitutes a gap for edutainment.
1002360	1005280	But no learning company games other than Carmen Sandiego?
1005280	1007480	And he kind of goes on to name some of his favorites.
1007480	1010240	And yeah, I'm looking at my list again.
1010240	1011480	I was kind of old.
1011480	1015520	Like a lot of my titles are really old, like Apple IIe, like Rocky's Boots, and some of
1015520	1016520	that stuff.
1016520	1017520	Oh, fuck.
1017520	1018520	What?
1018520	1019520	I don't remember that.
1019520	1021400	You know, I had to get really obscure for some of these.
1021400	1022960	But these were games I played.
1022960	1026520	And I think the one like frickin' probably no one has heard of is Cave of the Word Wizard.
1026520	1029040	But seriously, that game was scary as hell.
1029040	1030040	I've heard of it.
1030040	1031040	Have you?
1031040	1032040	For the Commodore 64?
1032040	1033040	Yeah.
1033040	1035220	Dude, it's freaky because this game is about who made this?
1035220	1037860	TimeWorks Inc. made this for the Commodore 64.
1037860	1041400	And basically, you went around this cave, and you had to jump over rocks, and you were
1041400	1042400	collecting crystals.
1042400	1044320	And you had to avoid bats and rocks.
1044320	1047000	And if you messed up, then you lost a Band-Aid.
1047000	1052120	Well, randomly, in this like flash of light, like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound
1052120	1059440	effects, this little wizard would appear, and he'd go, spell anti-disestablishmentarianism,
1059440	1060440	or whatever word.
1060440	1062240	Because he used the voice chip in there, right?
1062240	1065160	So you'd have to spell it out, and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind
1065160	1066160	of sucked.
1066160	1067160	It was a Commodore 64.
1067160	1076200	Yeah, it would be like, now spell.
1076200	1078680	And if you got it right, he would give you a Band-Aid.
1078680	1084760	But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker, and he'd take flashlight power from
1084760	1085760	you.
1085760	1089360	And so you were left to die in this cave, because of this horrible wizard who wanted
1089360	1092600	to punish people who couldn't spell.
1092600	1095520	But obviously, if you've ever read my live journal, you'll see this game actually taught
1095520	1096520	me nothing.
1096520	1102440	Anyway, check it out, community.allgames.com, look for my blog.
1102440	1104560	DarkSockerLoki, do you guys ever post your blogs?
1104560	1106760	I've seen Logie post a few things.
1106760	1107760	No.
1107760	1109960	I've seen pictures of my cat up there.
1109960	1113040	Logie posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this
1113040	1116800	week, but we'll leave you to find out what that is.
1116800	1119360	Let's get on with the real show, shall we, Logie?
1119360	1120640	Yes, shall.
1120640	1128080	Anyways, so not a big surprise, but Perrin Kaplan, open her big fat mouth again, and
1128080	1131120	is talking about Nintendo Wii shortages.
1131120	1135080	And basically saying they're doing everything in their power to make sure that the systems
1135080	1141800	are out there, but it's just a supply and demand situation, and there's nothing more
1141800	1142800	that it can do.
1142800	1145240	They're at maximum production.
1145240	1150740	I have a hard time believing that, but that's what they're saying, so I guess that's what
1150740	1152360	we've got to go off of.
1152360	1155240	But here's why I don't believe that.
1155240	1160960	You don't see any accessories or any systems or anything, well, I mean, not very much hitting
1160960	1165840	the retail markets and stuff.
1165840	1168200	Okay now, explain this to me.
1168200	1171540	Those stupid point cards, it's fucking cardboard.
1171540	1177640	Why the fuck aren't there billions of these things out there, I mean, it's cardboard.
1177640	1183760	It's not some fucking fancy chip, it's a piece of cardboard.
1183760	1189240	So that's why I don't believe this stuff, because it's fucking impossible to find this
1189240	1190240	stuff.
1190240	1192760	I don't know about the controllers and all that stuff, but I don't understand why these
1192760	1198760	controllers are any harder to make than, say, the classic controller or whatnot.
1198760	1203600	It's not that complicated of a piece of equipment, so I don't understand why it's taking them
1203600	1204600	so long.
1204600	1205760	Well, you don't need those cards anyway.
1205760	1206760	The cards are pointless.
1206760	1208320	You get charged tax on those cards.
1208320	1209320	Buy them online.
1209320	1210320	I understand.
1210320	1213680	You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on
1213680	1214680	it.
1214680	1215680	Sorry, folks.
1215680	1216680	I understand that, but there's...
1216680	1218240	Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.
1218240	1223080	Some people like the cards for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards
1223080	1224080	or stuff like that.
1224080	1225520	Allowance bonus thing.
1225520	1227160	Steal your mommy's wallet.
1227160	1232600	But this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold
1232600	1235920	out of right now, something that should be able...
1235920	1240960	So if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.
1240960	1243120	These things should be fucking easy to make.
1243120	1244120	Same with the controllers.
1244120	1246160	The controllers aren't that complicated.
1246160	1253240	I mean, hell, even, you know, the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts
1253240	1256560	in it that weren't in, like, say, the GameCube or something like that.
1256560	1257780	Like, the GameCube controllers.
1257780	1260260	Why the fuck can't they make more of them?
1260260	1261800	Maybe they're made from magic trees.
1261800	1262800	Oh, okay.
1262800	1264920	Well, there you go.
1264920	1266280	You know, magic trees.
1266280	1271480	Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.
1271480	1272840	That's what they're gonna have in Animal Crossing.
1272840	1276440	They'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out
1276440	1277440	of.
1277440	1280680	They can just shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.
1280680	1282760	They could just recycle.
1282760	1284320	I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.
1284320	1287560	Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.
1287560	1288560	Yes!
1288560	1289560	That's what probably happened.
1289560	1293240	You know, someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce
1293240	1297400	these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.
1297400	1302280	So yeah, if you're looking for a Wii, you're not gonna find them for a while, unless, you
1302280	1305920	know, whether it's something that Nintendo's doing on purpose, which would make no sense,
1305920	1308880	or if it's just, you know, that they can't make enough, whatever.
1308880	1312080	Either way, it's gonna be, you know, hard to find them.
1312080	1316440	But hey, if it's any consolation, there aren't really that many games that are major that
1316440	1319160	are coming out between now and Christmas.
1319160	1324040	Okay, I hate to derail here, but Mikolatov has joined us and he's come in the room and
1324040	1327340	he's laughing his ass off, and I know you guys are playing video games out there.
1327340	1330800	By the way, like, Mikolatov, X-Differ, and Rice Princess are all here, but none of them
1330800	1333360	wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.
1333360	1336920	But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.
1336920	1337920	It's distracting!
1337920	1339560	We're trying to do a show in here!
1339560	1340560	Oh, okay.
1340560	1347000	So, Christopher is playing Marble Mania, and that was in my office, and you know, I saw
1347000	1348000	it.
1348000	1349000	I thought it was a really fun game.
1349000	1350000	It is really fun.
1350000	1353420	But he picked the panda marble, and if people don't know about this game, every time the
1353420	1357760	marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.
1357760	1363640	The panda sounds like it's farting, and it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing
1363640	1367600	ever, and I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing
1367600	1368760	so hard.
1368760	1373920	So you guys are laughing at fart noises, and that's what's derailing this entire show.
1373920	1383600	It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.
1383600	1384600	Don't die!
1384600	1386320	It's all that eucalyptus, you know.
1386320	1390320	It's Cassie shit.
1390320	1392320	Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!
1392320	1394200	Oh, my mistake.
1394200	1398400	Hey, this is what I get for not reading.
1398400	1400520	Bamboo, whatever!
1400520	1401520	It's Cassie!
1401520	1407520	I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.
1407520	1413760	Maybe that's your problem, you're feeding the panda eucalyptus.
1413760	1415640	Well thank god I don't work at a zoo.
1415640	1417880	They'd be dead.
1417880	1419440	The chat room is asking if it's for...
1419440	1420440	Koala Panda!
1420440	1424080	DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 4.20 this week?
1424080	1425800	No, we're not.
1425800	1427560	We're role models for the young kids.
1427560	1430800	We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.
1430800	1434320	What is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?
1434320	1438120	Winners don't use drugs, remember that, boys and girls.
1438120	1443320	Winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera
1443320	1446280	browser to check out the internet with.
1446280	1448920	The final version has gone online this week.
1448920	1453340	You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because when the blue
1453340	1456360	light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.
1456360	1459360	But in this case it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.
1459360	1462620	So the full version of the internet channel is there.
1462620	1466760	The new features is, thank god, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto
1466760	1467760	hide.
1467760	1470120	You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that, so you can have your
1470120	1471120	YouTube's full screen.
1471120	1473400	You can just hit one, and it will hide it.
1473400	1474400	Awesome.
1474400	1477520	You can also zoom in and out at a lot.
1477520	1483760	I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.
1483760	1486840	So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to
1486840	1490880	worry about trying to get it full screen, and da-da-da, and all that stuff.
1490880	1496120	You can also do www.com at a click of a button, because all that's in there.
1496120	1498960	They just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover, so it was supposed to run
1498960	1499960	a little faster.
1499960	1501280	Although, I don't know.
1501280	1504440	I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up, or the Wi-Fi,
1504440	1507560	but internet channel is slow.
1507560	1509200	So slow.
1509200	1512100	It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.
1512100	1515800	It's faster to browse the internet on, obviously, a computer.
1515800	1518600	But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.
1518600	1520960	I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.
1520960	1523080	Does it just not have the power to handle, or what?
1523080	1529440	Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel, or forecast channel,
1529440	1530440	whatever.
1530440	1531440	Any of the channels.
1531440	1537200	It takes fucking forever to load up, so it's just slow.
1537200	1541200	Am I supposed to enable some port in my router?
1541200	1544480	You know how for some file share programs, you're supposed to open up certain ports in
1544480	1550200	your router, and direct them directly to one of the things that is connected to the router?
1550200	1551800	You know what I mean?
1551800	1554840	Maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii, to make it run faster.
1554840	1555840	Who knows?
1555840	1556840	Eh.
1556840	1560560	Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.
1560560	1562120	Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.
1562120	1566280	Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves, and turn it into a koala.
1566280	1568120	Well, here's some-
1568120	1569120	Whatever.
1569120	1573860	I don't give a shit if fucking koalas.
1573860	1574860	It would be more- Koalas are cute.
1574860	1578120	It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.
1578120	1581160	Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.
1581160	1586320	Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have
1586320	1593840	their Wiis and are keeping up with Virtual Console releases, there is a, I don't know
1593840	1598820	if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on Virtual Console.
1598820	1600920	We love some ActRaiser, don't we?
1600920	1601920	Not in this country.
1601920	1606520	Well, that's exactly it, it's out in the UK.
1606520	1613840	It actually has 800 Wii points, and basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where
1613840	1615680	you walk around and you're God.
1615680	1617920	I like walking around as God, I do that every day.
1617920	1618920	I love that.
1618920	1623120	ActRaiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.
1623120	1625640	Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay, it's-
1625640	1627320	Ah!
1627320	1630760	I like smiting my enemies.
1630760	1638560	Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii points, Bonk's Revenge
1638560	1641600	for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii points.
1641600	1645240	Blah, blah, blah, all I heard was ActRaiser, honestly.
1645240	1646800	When do we get it?
1646800	1649560	I'm hoping that's a good sign we get it on Monday, except for the fact that I'm going
1649560	1650560	to be out of town all week.
1650560	1651560	Poor baby.
1651560	1652560	I know, poor me.
1652560	1653560	Should we go to Disneyland?
1653560	1654560	Yeah, that's true.
1654560	1655560	I'm going to Disneyland.
1655560	1656840	ActRaiser or Disneyland?
1656840	1657840	I don't know.
1657840	1659080	We can bring the Wii with us.
1659080	1660080	That's a good idea.
1660080	1661080	Let's bring a Wii.
1661080	1662080	Yeah, we should.
1662080	1663080	Okay.
1663080	1669320	Yeah, the only thing I would be wondering is, now Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because
1669320	1672520	Pac-Man is, you can play Pac-Man on everything.
1672520	1675120	Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.
1675120	1676120	I'm sorry, 2600.
1676120	1677120	Oh, yeah.
1677120	1678760	The 2600 version is like...
1678760	1679760	Crap!
1679760	1680760	Yeah, no.
1680760	1681760	It's like Pac-Man barf.
1681760	1682760	It's not real Pac-Man.
1682760	1684720	It's, I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.
1684720	1686720	It's Diet Pac-Man.
1686720	1696000	Anyways, so other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force, they've
1696000	1703200	been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out, probably Monday.
1703200	1707600	So you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually
1707600	1709880	a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.
1709880	1714960	Ooh, Rice Prince is in chat and says Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.
1714960	1721800	Hey, maybe that's a good sign that, you know, this Actraiser, or the UK release will mirror
1721800	1722800	the release that we get.
1722800	1723800	But we already got Pac-Man, right?
1723800	1725800	I think we already got Pac-Man.
1725800	1726800	I know.
1726800	1728760	Not that I really care, because I'm not going to go down.
1728760	1730480	Maybe we'll get Ms. Pac-Man or some bullshit.
1730480	1731480	I don't care.
1731480	1732480	I just want Actraiser.
1732480	1733480	It's like an original game.
1733480	1736720	That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?
1736720	1737720	Originally made games?
1737720	1739720	Yeah, we'll see.
1739720	1740720	Someday.
1740720	1741720	Alright.
1741720	1742720	Let's see.
1742720	1743720	Also, speaking about Nintendo.
1743720	1747920	Oh, you're going to love this story, Loki, because I know you love piracy, but Nintendo
1747920	1749600	does not.
1749600	1754840	You might know that recently in the news, the US has complained to the World Trade Organization
1754840	1761880	about China, and it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.
1761880	1767600	Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support
1767600	1768600	this.
1768600	1773320	Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.
1773320	1777600	What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here, quote, Nintendo
1777600	1781440	will continue to work with the US government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo
1781440	1783000	products in China.
1783000	1786800	We're pleased the US government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments
1786800	1790160	in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.
1790160	1796720	That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America's Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.
1796720	1800640	What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that their ROMs and their old shit still
1800640	1803280	run rampant throughout the internet.
1803280	1805400	They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.
1805400	1808840	Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.
1808840	1810640	It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.
1810640	1815520	Hell, there's that one site where you could play all the video games online, or I don't
1815520	1817720	remember, it's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.
1817720	1821320	You can play them all right there in your browser, and Nintendo certainly has an interest
1821320	1826120	in old games because they're making five bucks off of everyone they can sell to a virtual
1826120	1827120	console user.
1827120	1828120	I don't know.
1828120	1829120	Great.
1829120	1830120	That's not China's problem.
1830120	1831120	That's happening right here.
1831120	1832120	I'm glad they hate piracy.
1832120	1833120	I'm glad they're blaming China.
1833120	1843520	It's not like, because America, no one here pirates anything ever, never ever.
1843520	1846360	The Rob D in chat says ROM sites don't really exist anymore.
1846360	1847840	It's mostly torrents.
1847840	1849600	Yeah, that's true.
1849600	1851280	But still somebody's hosting the torrents, right?
1851280	1853880	You got to host the seed file somewhere.
1853880	1855400	Depends on where it's legal or illegal.
1855400	1857600	You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.
1857600	1860320	Pirate Bay just says back in Go, you guys are stupid.
1860320	1866560	Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.
1866560	1869760	So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.
1869760	1875840	Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.
1875840	1883720	The company, Datel, has a program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter
1883720	1890360	your Mii avatar for your PC.
1890360	1899320	It's actually 1,499 pounds and $1,999 in the US, but you can download it off of their site.
1899320	1901640	It's at Code Junkies.
1901640	1907480	And the website is, just go to codejunkies.com and look it up.
1907480	1908480	It's actually pretty cool.
1908480	1910960	And I'll be posting the link in the chat room.
1910960	1915720	I believe there's actually some free stuff that's out there that does the exact same
1915720	1916720	thing.
1916720	1923760	In fact, website wemodwe.com, and that's W-I-I mod W-I-I dot com.
1923760	1927320	And they have kind of something similar where you can exchange stuff.
1927320	1931600	You just basically have to have some sort of Bluetooth adapter or Bluetooth in your
1931600	1934320	laptop or computer or whatever, and it does it for free.
1934320	1939720	But to be honest, though, why the fuck is Datel releasing a PC editing program for Miis?
1939720	1943240	I thought the Wii already had that.
1943240	1945480	You can just do it on your Wii.
1945480	1948200	Isn't it funner to do it on your computer?
1948200	1949200	I don't know.
1949200	1950200	You know what?
1950200	1953440	I just like that I have a Bluetooth device, and I like that it's called a dongle, because
1953440	1954440	that's a funny word.
1954440	1957760	Why don't they have that for, I don't know, say, the DS?
1957760	1958760	That'd be kind of neat.
1958760	1959760	That would be kind of cool.
1959760	1963240	It would be cheesy and stupid and useless, but neat.
1963240	1967740	You know, I did find that DS in Super Paper Mario, and it is pretty deceiving.
1967740	1972800	I totally thought at first, before I remembered that story that was on the internet, I totally
1972800	1975840	thought at first, I was like, wait, it's saying connectivity, looking for connectivity?
1975840	1976840	What a tease!
1976840	1979720	What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there
1979720	1982220	was going to be some type of functionality.
1982220	1985640	By the way, thanks to the Magica Radio, I had just run out to the living room real quick,
1985640	1989980	and I saw them playing a Korowinpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking
1989980	1990980	funny.
1990980	1991980	It really is funny.
1991980	1997480	It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.
1997480	1998480	Remember that?
1998480	1999800	Where it's just farting noises all the time.
1999800	2002000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
2002000	2003400	You've never seen Labyrinth?
2003400	2004400	The Bog of Eternal Stench?
2004400	2005400	Yeah, the Bog of Eternal Stench.
2005400	2006400	Oh, god.
2006400	2008100	So bad!
2008100	2009480	The last time I saw it, I was like eight.
2009480	2011360	Mine was a couple months ago.
2011360	2013120	We need to fix that!
2013120	2014120	I guess so.
2014120	2017000	You know, Megsy hasn't seen Labyrinth.
2017000	2025120	Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.
2025120	2033340	Basically, their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super
2033340	2039560	Paper Mario is not in the store or street date by 2pm, then you get $20 in a gift card.
2039560	2043960	Well, the problem was that someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario
2043960	2051360	was sold out, but the thing was, they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore
2051360	2052360	they don't get $20.
2052360	2056280	It's kind of like, well, we had it, but you just weren't here.
2056280	2060000	What was to stop them from telling everybody that?
2060000	2062000	Nothing.
2062000	2063400	Nothing at all.
2063400	2064480	Aha!
2064480	2065480	So it was a scam.
2065480	2066480	Yes.
2066480	2075640	Did he call the Better Business Bureau, or did he just post his angry rant on the internet
2075640	2077640	and telling everyone to dig it?
2077640	2080000	Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.
2080000	2083320	Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau
2083320	2086440	instead of dig probably would have been a little more effective, because I don't think
2086440	2089880	the Better Business Bureau reads Joystik, Kotaku, and Destructoid.
2089880	2094720	Or even better, maybe, I don't know, let's flashback to say when the Wii came out, and
2094720	2098240	I think there were similar situations with bundling and stuff like that.
2098240	2100680	So are we surprised?
2100680	2101680	No.
2101680	2102680	Who cares?
2102680	2103680	It's Super Paper Mario.
2103680	2104680	It's like everywhere.
2104680	2108040	If you don't get it, you know, it's...
2108040	2113480	Act Deft and Chad is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.
2113480	2116680	Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?
2116680	2119560	You don't know any better walking into the store.
2119560	2126440	You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, oh, we sold
2126440	2127440	out.
2127440	2128960	There was a line.
2128960	2130440	It's crazy.
2130440	2131440	Yep.
2131440	2133200	No gift card for you.
2133200	2138160	Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?
2138160	2141880	The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements there's a little bit of small
2141880	2146160	print that you got to read and that's, you know, the offers can change without notice.
2146160	2151520	So ha, they can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super
2151520	2152520	Paper Mario.
2152520	2153920	They don't have to, you know, follow that.
2153920	2157680	They can just say, fuck you, bitch, I ain't doing shit.
2157680	2163580	So could we post a big ad on the internet somewhere that says Orange Lounge Radio gives
2163580	2169000	free blowjobs and then like in little fine print lie.
2169000	2170000	This is a lie.
2170000	2171000	What, Rice Princess?
2171000	2173480	But that would be true on your behalf.
2173480	2174480	I'm sorry.
2174480	2177440	Rice Princess, it actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our.
2177440	2178440	But on your behalf.
2178440	2179440	It's your slut.
2179440	2180440	Oops.
2180440	2181440	I mean, hi.
2181440	2188720	This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.
2188720	2189720	Thank you.
2189720	2190720	Shut up.
2190720	2191720	Thank you for ruining our program.
2191720	2192720	Uh-huh.
2192720	2193720	I'm going to go now.
2193720	2194720	So hi everyone and bye.
2194720	2195720	All right.
2195720	2196720	Wow.
2196720	2205280	Raven's dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.
2205280	2207800	Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.
2207800	2209200	You should have heard what she yelled.
2209200	2210200	Anyhow.
2210200	2211200	Wait, wait, wait.
2211200	2212200	Let me, let me simulate it.
2212200	2213200	Oh, what?
2213200	2214200	Ew!
2214200	2215200	How was that?
2215200	2216200	That was good.
2216200	2217200	That was good.
2217200	2220040	A little less angry next time though.
2220040	2224640	Well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?
2224640	2232040	Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week
2232040	2236760	on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th and it was this woman making
2236760	2244340	a post there saying, hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.
2244340	2247520	In return, you can mount me.
2247520	2253720	You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000, excuse me, I want the
2253720	2256100	5,000 gold before we do anything.
2256100	2259400	We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.
2259400	2263680	So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 night elf druid and would prefer
2263680	2265200	someone who is into role playing.
2265200	2267440	I have a costume.
2267440	2270600	But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold.
2270600	2274680	I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold.
2274680	2279620	Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal.
2279620	2290520	So other words, short translation, I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much and I don't even
2290520	2291520	know where to go with this.
2291520	2292640	It's prostitution.
2292640	2293940	Pretty much.
2293940	2297080	But she gets away with it because A, it's on the internet, I'm assuming she doesn't
2297080	2298080	live in Nevada.
2298080	2301680	I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on but I don't think it was Vegas and anyway,
2301680	2303460	it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.
2303460	2308720	So it was probably illegal but she gets away with it because it's the internet and it's
2308720	2312640	not real money.
2312640	2313640	Would you...
2313640	2315720	It's offering sex for services so...
2315720	2318800	Would you give amount for amount?
2318800	2321200	No, Rob.
2321200	2326160	Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman and obviously her picture
2326160	2331840	was all over the internet because you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you
2331840	2335240	kind of see her and she ain't all that.
2335240	2338360	No, not at all.
2338360	2339360	But this is the thing.
2339360	2342280	Just a couple days later, there was a follow up post.
2342280	2345920	Hi, I just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my
2345920	2349600	picture all over the internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.
2349600	2352280	I got my epic mount in about an hour.
2352280	2356120	That was very enjoyable for both parties while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds
2356120	2358680	of hours farming for years or don't even have them.
2358680	2362880	I won't be revealing my name or his but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll
2362880	2366280	be killing you 280% faster.
2366280	2367640	That's a little WoW joke there.
2367640	2374200	Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.
2374200	2377640	She said it twice and capitalized it both times so I was reading it that way.
2377640	2380560	Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.
2380560	2383040	I'm planning to meet him again later this week.
2383040	2385380	He's getting double value for his gold.
2385380	2386800	So talk all the trash you want.
2386800	2391960	I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can
2391960	2392960	ever hope for.
2392960	2396200	Well, she does make a point.
2396200	2397880	As long as she's got a good attitude about it.
2397880	2403840	As long as she gets her epic mount, that way she can defend herself from the ugly sick
2403840	2407000	because it looks like she's been beat down with it a few thousand times.
2407000	2408000	Okay, wait, wait.
2408000	2409840	Away from the personal attacks for a minute.
2409840	2417640	Let's say this had been a very Angelina Jolie but blonde, big, big titties posting this.
2417640	2418960	That still doesn't make it right.
2418960	2422240	Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about 5,000
2422240	2425320	gold I think equals about $600 in real money.
2425320	2430800	Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that
2430800	2431800	route.
2431800	2434280	Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.
2434280	2436240	Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.
2436240	2437240	You okay with it?
2437240	2439240	I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.
2439240	2440240	Seriously.
2440240	2441240	Well.
2441240	2443240	No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.
2443240	2445600	I think I got a 20 in my wallet.
2445600	2446600	No.
2446600	2449640	Can I prostitute you to clean my kitchen?
2449640	2450640	Fuck you.
2450640	2457960	No, but I think, you know, and I'm saying this, and, you know, it's also not just because
2457960	2461720	I watched the prostitution episode of bullshit last night either.
2461720	2473380	But I believe that, you know, if done in a, I'm trying to think about how to say this.
2473380	2478120	If you are taking the proper precautions to stay clean, to protect yourself from unwanted
2478120	2482440	pregnancy and STDs, and you're getting something out of it.
2482440	2483440	It's your choice.
2483440	2485680	Who has the right to tell you what to do with your body?
2485680	2488040	That's what I say.
2488040	2489040	But I don't know.
2489040	2493280	I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed
2493280	2494960	doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy.
2494960	2496400	You know, I don't care.
2496400	2501120	But yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my
2501120	2502760	finger on it.
2502760	2506640	Like you just kind of like, ah, that's just not right.
2506640	2507640	That's not right.
2507640	2510280	I'm trying to put out for wow.
2510280	2511280	It is sad.
2511280	2512280	For wow, Jamie.
2512280	2516440	People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii, so.
2516440	2522540	You know, I'm not saying that it's sad.
2522540	2525260	I think that someone is desperate enough.
2525260	2528840	But honestly, more power to her, you know.
2528840	2534480	If she says, you know what, I have no problem with, you know, giving it up a little bit
2534480	2535480	for a mountain.
2535480	2544040	You know, I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.
2544040	2548240	I mean, I would think that, I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything
2548240	2550680	to actually earn it, you know.
2550680	2553640	Like in game, like everybody else does.
2553640	2554640	But at the same time.
2554640	2558680	But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG type websites and all
2558680	2559680	that, anyway.
2559680	2560680	Right?
2560680	2562080	It's pretty much, it's pretty much the same thing.
2562080	2567160	For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.
2567160	2572320	It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.
2572320	2575160	Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?
2575160	2576160	I don't know.
2576160	2579560	Well, no, it doesn't matter though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly, older
2579560	2583320	chick and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair, ooh.
2583320	2585040	But anyways, hey, great.
2585040	2588440	I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview, well, so much for that, Loki ruined
2588440	2589440	those chances.
2589440	2591440	That's fine, I'll talk to her.
2591440	2595560	Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.
2595560	2598760	I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?
2598760	2604240	GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's joining.
2604240	2606160	I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.
2606160	2610280	No, no, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.
2610280	2611640	Sluts do it for free, whores get paid.
2611640	2612640	That's true.
2612640	2613640	So she was being a whore.
2613640	2614640	She was being a whore.
2614640	2615640	World of Warcraft.
2615640	2616640	She wasn't a slut, she was a whore.
2616640	2617640	Big difference.
2617640	2618640	But you, but again.
2618640	2623200	Is he, I don't know if GS68 might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone have
2623200	2624200	cared?
2624200	2625200	Men can be, there's male prostitutes.
2625200	2626200	They're whores.
2626200	2627200	Well, I know that.
2627200	2628680	There's people who give up the butt love for money.
2628680	2630560	I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?
2630560	2631560	I know that.
2631560	2636040	I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.
2636040	2637600	I get it for free, okay?
2637600	2643880	I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with sauce over
2643880	2645440	AIM, which I'm not on.
2645440	2647440	Nobody IM me.
2647440	2653400	Um, just that, you know, because it's legal in Nevada, and it's actually a good source
2653400	2656400	of income, and it's safe and clean.
2656400	2657800	I don't even have letters on this one.
2657800	2662600	To be honest, I mean, seriously, this stuff happens all the time in fucking Second Life
2662600	2667640	and shit like that, and no one, it just happens so often now that no one really gives a shit.
2667640	2668640	This, I mean...
2668640	2671600	In a way, all she did was cut out the middle man.
2671600	2672600	I mean, really.
2672600	2674760	I mean, if not this, then what?
2674760	2675760	She could have been a stripper.
2675760	2679960	She would have stripped for cash, just used the cash to buy the gold for my GE.
2679960	2680960	There you go.
2680960	2682460	All she's doing, she's cutting out the middle man.
2682460	2685000	She's going straight from stripping to her mount.
2685000	2689380	It's the same difference as saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help
2689380	2691600	me get my mount.
2691600	2693400	It's an exchange of services.
2693400	2695840	It's just bringing it from...
2695840	2697920	Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.
2697920	2699720	She couldn't have done stripping.
2699720	2700720	Uh-uh.
2700720	2706680	I, I say it was her choice to do it, you know, if anyone's going to judge her, you know,
2706680	2710000	look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can, you can afford to judge
2710000	2711000	somebody else.
2711000	2712000	That's what I say.
2712000	2713000	Okay, put it this way.
2713000	2715440	Let me lay it out to you straight here.
2715440	2721640	She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.
2721640	2722640	So is she.
2722640	2725480	I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.
2725480	2726480	What's your point?
2726480	2732440	Yeah, but you don't have sex with fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.
2732440	2736640	Well, she has sex with Dan and he buys her games.
2736640	2737640	I mean...
2737640	2740920	Yeah, but I married him.
2740920	2741920	That's why Jamie has...
2741920	2742920	Wait!
2742920	2745040	I'm not, I'm not 31 yet.
2745040	2747800	That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.
2747800	2748800	No.
2748800	2749800	I'm just teasing.
2749800	2750800	Obviously, there's a big difference.
2750800	2751800	No, that's wrong.
2751800	2752800	I know it is.
2752800	2754800	I'm not 31 yet, by the way.
2754800	2755800	Okay, well there you go.
2755800	2756800	Four days!
2756800	2757800	Stop it!
2757800	2761760	I have, I have 2 AM on Thursday, so just be nice to me.
2761760	2764080	What if this chick's got like fucking kids and stuff?
2764080	2765080	I mean, because...
2765080	2766400	Mommy, what are you doing?
2766400	2770320	Oh yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.
2770320	2771320	At least I got my mount.
2771320	2773840	All right, this topic's gone on way too long.
2773840	2774840	We can bring it up in Skype.
2774840	2775840	I'm learning it later.
2775840	2777400	Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.
2777400	2778400	Please.
2778400	2780800	I've even eaten all the fucking Pocky.
2780800	2781800	It's good.
2781800	2786440	I know, I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's cookies and cream.
2786440	2787440	Anyway.
2787440	2794600	So, all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?
2794600	2795600	Right?
2795600	2799240	No, actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.
2799240	2800240	I really like it.
2800240	2808200	Well, you can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.
2808200	2814160	So it's 500 points, the three packs are Pack 1 is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of
2814160	2815160	Spades.
2815160	2817600	Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein.
2817600	2822440	Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar, which for me, at the top of all of those was
2822440	2824120	you know, Pack 1 for me.
2824120	2826880	You know, at least two good songs in there.
2826880	2831240	But you're basically playing about two bucks a song.
2831240	2836160	And the interesting thing that was, you know, they're gonna keep having these packs on here.
2836160	2839480	If they're gonna be that much, you're gonna end up actually spending a lot of money to
2839480	2841880	get some of these extra songs for packs of three.
2841880	2847680	Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?
2847680	2849280	Go ahead.
2849280	2851540	This is bullshit!
2851540	2854800	Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?
2854800	2857880	Like 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?
2857880	2858880	Guitar and game?
2858880	2859880	No, maybe 69.
2859880	2860880	I don't remember.
2860880	2861880	Yeah, it was pretty expensive.
2861880	2867160	It was $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the song packs at this price, you
2867160	2872720	will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.
2872720	2873720	That's hot.
2873720	2874720	No, it's not.
2874720	2882280	It's stupid, and the sad thing is, I am so tempted to still buy one of these packs, because
2882280	2887760	I do kind of want to play the songs on the Xbox 360, and like, I hate myself for it.
2887760	2890280	And Red Octane knows that they can get away with charging it.
2890280	2893960	This is the milking of the franchise that's going to lead to its death.
2893960	2898040	This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.
2898040	2901320	Because they know this is going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloaded
2901320	2902320	pullbacks.
2902320	2903320	Right.
2903320	2910020	Yeah, they're really just jumping ship because they're totally not going to milk the franchise
2910020	2915720	by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for
2915720	2916720	it.
2916720	2917880	This works for Harmonix, though.
2917880	2921640	If you think about it, Loki, they rip themselves off with Guitar Freaks.
2921640	2922640	Guitar Freaks is what?
2922640	2924840	It's amplitude with a guitar controller.
2924840	2925840	Kinda.
2925840	2926840	Right?
2926840	2927840	Guitar Hero?
2927840	2928840	Yeah.
2928840	2930320	Or did I say Guitar Freaks?
2930320	2931320	Yeah.
2931320	2932320	Whatever.
2932320	2933320	Well, hell, there's that too.
2933320	2936240	Guitar Freaks plus amplitude equals Guitar Hero, pretty much.
2936240	2937240	Right?
2937240	2938240	Am I right?
2938240	2939240	Yeah.
2939240	2940240	All right.
2940240	2941240	There you go.
2941240	2944340	But what I don't understand is that why, if we're going to pay this kind of money for
2944340	2947440	these songs, why not give us new songs?
2947440	2953380	I bet people may not have complained so much if you would have given new songs.
2953380	2957340	I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and
2957340	2958560	they're easy to copy over.
2958560	2960640	Well, then they should be cheap.
2960640	2963840	Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges
2963840	2967360	like 99 cents a song and those songs are way better produced.
2967360	2971120	Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital
2971120	2974480	distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but still for $2, I know
2974480	2978760	you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.
2978760	2983240	Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.
2983240	2985760	Why can't you, you know, throw some of those?
2985760	2987760	Throw a classic pack up.
2987760	2989760	Why even do the packs at all?
2989760	2992040	Some of those songs kind of suck and I don't want them.
2992040	2993040	Exactly.
2993040	2994040	That's why they're doing that.
2994040	2996080	Like I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.
2996080	2997960	I want the Red Hot Chili Peppers one.
2997960	2998960	It's ah.
2998960	2999960	You have to buy all of them.
2999960	3004960	Now, here's what I say, you can put the packs up, but make it, you know, some sort of discount
3004960	3007520	over like say buying each song individually.
3007520	3012480	Say if you want to buy, make each song, you know, buck 25 or something like that, you
3012480	3014520	know, then that's not so bad.
3014520	3018000	It's still bad, but it's not so bad.
3018000	3022960	And then that way you save a little bit of money buying, you know, you know, one song
3022960	3027360	over or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.
3027360	3031160	The Rob D is making some interesting points in our chat, chat.ornisandrea.com.
3031160	3034920	I think the rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.
3034920	3036800	There's just not much you can do about it.
3036800	3038640	It's not like you can innovate a guitar.
3038640	3040400	It's Tony Hawk syndrome.
3040400	3047240	Well, but in a way, in a way, Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as
3047240	3049100	the Guitar Freaks guitar.
3049100	3052220	And you sort of saw it coming, like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games
3052220	3053220	a long time.
3053220	3057340	Remember Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks because what did they do before they made
3057340	3058340	games?
3058340	3062400	They were, they were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income
3062400	3067440	off of music games, economy's beat mania series and all the, all the songs there.
3067440	3073040	They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons and everybody always asks,
3073040	3074040	why did they put five?
3074040	3077880	Because Guitar Freaks only has three and everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?
3077880	3078880	Why?
3078880	3083520	And everybody speculated, Oh, Guitar Freaks, like super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation two,
3083520	3087120	they're super duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows
3087120	3088120	that.
3088120	3090280	Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.
3090280	3093600	Well, here's, here's the, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed
3093600	3094600	off about.
3094600	3098640	I don't know if some people may have seen this in the forums, how, and I mentioned a
3098640	3105480	little on top of the show, how I built my own Guitar Hero effects pedal.
3105480	3110920	Basically the thing, which is going to be a yet another purchase is just a fucking push
3110920	3112360	button switch.
3112360	3117480	It's something very simple that, I mean, should I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're
3117480	3118640	going to have to buy.
3118640	3122180	And that's going to be in addition to, you know, the guitar and everything.
3122180	3124080	So they say they sell for 10 bucks.
3124080	3128480	There's another 10 bucks you're paying for a fucking button for something that, and granted
3128480	3132480	it's probably not necessary, but near are the song packs and yet it's something extra
3132480	3134680	that you're going to be buying.
3134680	3137280	So there you go.
3137280	3138280	Wonderful.
3138280	3142160	And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game,
3142160	3143160	but it works.
3143160	3147000	I know that for a fact.
3147000	3150400	I do agree that other music game series have become stagnant as well.
3150400	3155640	I love DDR, I really do, but it is starting to get kind of old.
3155640	3159720	I really feel like, you know, obviously it's inevitable there's going to be more DDR games
3159720	3160720	this year.
3160720	3165920	It's just a question of what, and I just feel like I'm not that excited about it anymore
3165920	3171040	because like I've said on this program a while ago, my idea, and you know, granted you don't
3171040	3173200	have to use this idea, this is just an idea.
3173200	3178440	You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole dance magic
3178440	3182120	mode from DDR Disney and battle mode in Supernova.
3182120	3184680	Battle mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.
3184680	3189320	It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever, and it was in the groove,
3189320	3190320	same thing.
3190320	3191320	It had a similar mode in there.
3191320	3193360	It was just kind of an afterthought.
3193360	3197880	Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select
3197880	3203420	and, you know, I don't know, this whole like you got served kind of atmosphere there.
3203420	3207080	There could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive, and that's
3207080	3209400	a way you could innovate DDR, but I don't know.
3209400	3212880	If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, well, DDR Supernova was one of
3212880	3214600	the top 25 selling games last year.
3214600	3219120	If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess
3219120	3220840	why bother innovating?
3220840	3222840	Cost money to innovate.
3222840	3227920	Anyways, speaking of- Our topics are taking too long tonight, my bad.
3227920	3228920	Sorry.
3228920	3233800	Well, also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Super Contra, and this is according to the ESRB.
3233800	3237280	They have a rating now for it for the 360, so yay.
3237280	3240520	I think this was one that was announced, I want to say, at E3 last year.
3240520	3247360	I could have sworn it was announced, but yeah, now it's coming, so no big surprise.
3247360	3253200	I want to say that when we saw that arcade montage, that there was Super Contra mixed
3253200	3255080	in with regular Contra or something.
3255080	3256080	Yeah.
3256080	3257080	Is it super regular?
3257080	3258440	Does it take Metamucil?
3258440	3261440	Shut up.
3261440	3267520	This is a game, after that little comment, I will want to play Jamie with her on Xbox
3267520	3268520	Live Arcade.
3268520	3269520	Quake 3.
3269520	3270520	Who?
3270520	3274320	Because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.
3274320	3275320	No.
3275320	3277320	I'll actually literally throw up on you because of the motion.
3277320	3278320	That's it.
3278320	3281960	How long can you play before you start getting sick?
3281960	3284760	Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.
3284760	3286840	Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?
3286840	3287840	About five minutes.
3287840	3288840	All right.
3288840	3289840	Well, good.
3289840	3290840	Five minutes.
3290840	3291840	I can get five frags on you at least.
3291840	3292840	I'm really good at Quake.
3292840	3293840	All right.
3293840	3294840	Well, we'll put that to the test.
3294840	3295840	I was a pro at Gotchum on Quake.
3295840	3296840	Gotchum on Quake?
3296840	3297840	Yep.
3297840	3298840	I don't even want to know.
3298840	3299840	And I can actually play the...
3299840	3300840	I don't even want to know.
3300840	3303280	But anyway, so what am I talking about?
3303280	3310080	The ESRB has recently leaked a rating for Quake 3 Team Arena with a rating of M, of
3310080	3311080	course.
3311080	3316680	But for the Xbox 360, now seeing as Quake 4 has already been released, it's a regular
3316680	3318800	game and it wasn't that great.
3318800	3320400	Quake 2 was already on there too.
3320400	3322320	And Quake 2 was on the disc as well.
3322320	3323320	Where does Quake 3 fit?
3323320	3324320	And Quake...
3324320	3328080	Well, I guess the original Quake hasn't been released yet, but Doom did and Doom had a
3328080	3329220	lot of success.
3329220	3334960	So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3, logically, is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?
3334960	3337560	So we'll see.
3337560	3342040	I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.
3342040	3344040	It's probably the only thing that was possible before.
3344040	3346040	No, downloadable mods would be great.
3346040	3347600	Oh, that would be awesome.
3347600	3351280	That would be cool if, like, when they released this, they put downloadable mods.
3351280	3356560	They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.
3356560	3358760	Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...
3358760	3359760	Well...
3359760	3361400	You only have a few more months for that.
3361400	3364640	Well, here's some other news, though.
3364640	3370560	For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will
3370560	3377800	be available in Europe and America in June.
3377800	3384680	They were not giving too much, too many details as far as when it will actually be available
3384680	3387080	in Europe, though.
3387080	3395360	But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to
3395360	3406200	go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels, so that's pretty cool.
3406200	3413700	But also, the thing about this is that it's sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying
3413700	3417240	that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.
3417240	3418880	Yeah, but that may be console, though.
3418880	3422400	Yeah, so is Gears of War.
3422400	3424400	We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.
3424400	3426040	And Halo is exclusive.
3426040	3428560	Yeah, we got that on PC as well.
3428560	3430400	It's exclusive to just be released.
3430400	3434160	It's exclusive to Microsoft's Empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever, it's their
3434160	3435160	IP.
3435160	3436160	Yeah, that does make sense.
3436160	3440640	I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still
3440640	3442440	a Microsoft product, so yeah, that makes sense.
3442440	3444240	Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.
3444240	3448720	Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.
3448720	3454120	They're not really referring to PCs, because I think they don't really generally kind of
3454120	3458240	compete with PCs as far as platforms, I would think.
3458240	3461280	PC gamers and console gamers are usually very different types.
3461280	3466000	I mean, like, say me, I definitely consider myself a console gamer, but I do play PC games
3466000	3467000	now and again.
3467000	3471600	You know, obviously World of Warcraft, but besides, outside of that, I play an occasional
3471600	3475960	PC game, and I think most hardcore PC gamers kind of feel the same way, like, yeah, I play
3475960	3479120	mostly PC games, but I'll try out a console once in a while.
3479120	3483600	You know, I have a PlayStation, you know, I play games on once in a while.
3483600	3484600	Yeah.
3484600	3490760	Well, one PC game, and I actually tried playing this this week, but Dance Online, it's claims
3490760	3495160	new kind of DDR multiplayer online game.
3495160	3498000	You know, think Ota Jam, something like that.
3498000	3502800	Anyways, it's free to play, and it's available online, I believe it's acclaimed.com slash
3502800	3507600	dance, and you can actually check it out.
3507600	3511160	I don't know if they're going to be doing kind of the Ota Jam thing where you can buy
3511160	3515800	costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing, but apparently you're
3515800	3523000	going to be able to actually win signed, you know, stuff from actually playing the game,
3523000	3527400	so that might be kind of neat, or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like
3527400	3530080	that, so I don't know.
3530080	3533720	That's good that it's free, because I played the beta a few months ago, and I'll be honest,
3533720	3534800	I don't really remember it.
3534800	3539080	I reviewed it on the show, but I couldn't tell you when, and it was not something I
3539080	3543200	would have paid for, so I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free, and sure, this whole,
3543200	3546360	you know, pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that, they'll make money
3546360	3547360	from it.
3547360	3548360	Advertising, sure, what the hell.
3548360	3552720	You know, how about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?
3552720	3555680	I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing, something like that.
3555680	3556680	Why not?
3556680	3561800	Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero, like have stuff, you know, sponsored by different
3561800	3562800	things?
3562800	3566280	Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.
3566280	3569200	You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who
3569200	3571280	want to get out there and exposed.
3571280	3574000	I don't know.
3574000	3575000	It's still early, though.
3575000	3576000	I mean...
3576000	3577000	It is.
3577000	3581280	I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2, and you know, they
3581280	3583560	haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.
3583560	3587320	I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere, somebody was calling this Red Octane's
3587320	3590520	Horse Armor, and I could see that.
3590520	3595880	And certainly Oblivion, actually, you know, I'll give it this, Oblivion got torn into
3595880	3600040	a new one across the internet for the whole Horse Armor thing, and they fixed it in a
3600040	3601040	big way.
3601040	3606200	I mean, and honestly, Oblivion has the best downloadable content of any title.
3606200	3609480	It's the most supported in the realm of downloadable content.
3609480	3610480	I mean, wouldn't you agree?
3610480	3611480	Yeah.
3611480	3613920	There's so much extra that's out there available for the game.
3613920	3616120	So they did make right, eventually.
3616120	3622040	So hopefully, Red Octane will follow in their footsteps and all will be forgiven.
3622040	3624040	Hopefully.
3624040	3625440	Hopefully.
3625440	3628440	Hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.
3628440	3633680	It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but I want you to think, it's a type of keyboard that
3633680	3636740	actually plugs into your controller.
3636740	3641120	It's that typical QWERTY, is what they call it, the QWERTY keyboard, that actually plugs
3641120	3645200	into the bottom of your controller, so you can have it all right there in your hand.
3645200	3648760	Now, I know what you might be thinking is, this is what I thought, is that, you know,
3648760	3651040	well, why the hell do you need one of these?
3651040	3655280	Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because
3655280	3657080	I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.
3657080	3658080	It was fine.
3658080	3661840	Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a
3661840	3665840	pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something,
3665840	3667520	put the keyboard back down.
3667520	3669120	This would actually be pretty quick for me.
3669120	3673800	Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it, because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since
3673800	3678680	it was basically ported from the PC version, PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play
3678680	3680340	the game completely on the keyboard.
3680340	3684520	The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going
3684520	3688560	to be built to do that, so you might need something like this in order to do that.
3688560	3693440	And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just
3693440	3697400	typing something up in a chat window or something like that.
3697400	3701320	That's completely different, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.
3701320	3706600	But it's nice, that way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.
3706600	3710880	I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.
3710880	3716480	I just hope it's not more than 20 bucks, because honestly, we'll get into the reason this is
3716480	3724640	coming out very soon, but it's not going to be worth it.
3724640	3729040	I think Microsoft's pretty smart on their pricing for stuff, and it doesn't look like
3729040	3731040	it's that...
3731040	3736920	I'd say maybe $15, $20, $17.99 maybe, that's going to be my guess.
3736920	3738580	We'll see.
3738580	3743320	Going to the chat and seeing what the folks in chat are saying.
3743320	3750800	Hostile One says, that looks useless to me, Jaded suggests a keyboard-mouse combo.
3750800	3754640	Bonnie Dale says, in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's
3754640	3758320	too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too
3758320	3759320	long.
3759320	3764400	Oh, SSG100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.
3764400	3769180	I'd pay to have the Advantage or the minibosses in Guitar Hero, too bad most of their songs
3769180	3772520	are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.
3772520	3778160	What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?
3778160	3780320	Maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.
3780320	3783720	Maybe around the time we start getting more Halo news, like the beta or the game, maybe
3783720	3786640	that'll be a downloadable song later on for free.
3786640	3788680	Who knows?
3788680	3790220	We shall see.
3790220	3794040	We shall also see right now what is waiting for us in the mailbag, because you kids can
3794040	3797480	email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3797480	3801400	And DarkSakura likes to jump into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite
3801400	3804680	emails to read with you folks here on air.
3804680	3806600	So here we go, let's go into the mailbag.
3806600	3813400	DarkSakura, who's on tap this week?
3813400	3816800	We got a bunch of crap, really.
3816800	3827200	First email actually is a link from Heon.
3827200	3833920	It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters, I'm not sure, but the point that I wanted to say
3833920	3837380	was actually in the email, it says, wanted to let you know about it, look, you probably
3837380	3844680	already knew, love the show, but it needs more lesbians.
3844680	3846040	Is that in our show role later on?
3846040	3847040	I don't remember.
3847040	3850720	No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.
3850720	3852080	No, it wasn't announced.
3852080	3854120	It was found on Gamefly.
3854120	3857200	Oh, okay.
3857200	3859120	It was officially leaked on Gamefly.
3859120	3860120	I see.
3860120	3864680	That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.
3864680	3869840	I wonder what tipped them off.
3869840	3872320	People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.
3872320	3874320	That's true.
3874320	3882640	Anyway, we also have, actually our friend Rob with two Bs sent an email saying that
3882640	3889960	the FTC had provided evidence that the current self-regulation by the ESRB has significantly
3889960	3893040	improved and is better than other media.
3893040	3899520	I'm going to link for the chat room an article from Ars Technica that goes into that.
3899520	3901400	It's really long, but I thought it was pretty cool.
3901400	3905600	They said that they're basically doing a better job than we are.
3905600	3907040	Oops.
3907040	3910960	No comment?
3910960	3912960	I don't know.
3912960	3917160	I like to think the game industry is doing a better job than most people give them credit
3917160	3918160	for.
3918160	3919160	Yeah, I would agree with someone saying that.
3919160	3920680	The rating system is broken.
3920680	3921840	We all know that.
3921840	3926040	We all know the rating system is broken, but the video game system somewhat seems to work.
3926040	3929040	M for Mature and T for Teens.
3929040	3934080	There's a good distinction there, whereas in the movie world, we have R. Granted, there's
3934080	3936720	PG-13, but you can get away with a lot.
3936720	3939000	PG and PG-13, it's like it complies together.
3939000	3940000	It's the same thing.
3940000	3945960	Yeah, and R, there's such a vast difference between what is considered R. You have movies
3945960	3951920	like what's a really frickin' violent movie that's come out in the past few years?
3951920	3954880	I haven't seen it, but I imagine Grindhouse is pretty violent, right?
3954880	3958000	So you have Grindhouse on one end of the spectrum, and you have Romy and Michelle's High School
3958000	3962440	Reunion is also rated R, because the F word is used a couple times in it.
3962440	3963440	Like fuck?
3963440	3966600	Yeah, the fuck word is used, like Janine Garofalo is in it.
3966600	3967600	End of story.
3967600	3968600	I love Janine Garofalo.
3968600	3969600	Who doesn't?
3969600	3973160	But the point is that those are very different kinds of movies.
3973160	3976800	I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, okay?
3976800	3980480	A couple little fucks isn't going to kill them.
3980480	3981480	No!
3981480	3984840	You hear the word fuck, and you suddenly want to kill people!
3984840	3989600	Yeah, but I would not let them watch Terminator 2.
3989600	3990600	I would.
3990600	3993320	Well, you and I are different.
3993320	3994880	Did I saw Terminator 2 in the theater?
3994880	3995880	That was awesome.
3995880	3997280	Anyway, next email.
3997280	3999400	Hey guys, Sesha here.
3999400	4003600	I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft, and whether
4003600	4005760	it will really matter to them.
4005760	4009920	I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may
4009920	4015560	be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce
4015560	4019320	games these days, so going multiplatform solves that problem.
4019320	4020480	Excuse me.
4020480	4025120	I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.
4025120	4027720	It's just something that I heard, and it makes sense.
4027720	4031240	But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multiplatform, do you think this would really affect the
4031240	4034520	sales of the PS3, or would it not really matter?
4034520	4037240	I'm not so sure myself, and thought I'd ask you guys.
4037240	4041720	Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in, and a big shout
4041720	4042720	to Irene.
4042720	4043720	Heart.
4043720	4044720	Oh, thank you.
4044720	4045720	That was good timing.
4045720	4048720	Yeah, she just watched in the room.
4048720	4049720	Take care, people.
4049720	4050720	Stay fukin' epic.
4050720	4051720	Love, Sesha.
4051720	4054720	Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.
4054720	4055720	No, I'm kidding.
4055720	4056720	Hi, Sesha.
4056720	4057720	You're hot.
4057720	4058720	I'm gonna go now.
4058720	4059720	Bye.
4059720	4060720	So?
4060720	4061720	Answer?
4061720	4066600	Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
4066600	4071080	if it does come to the 360, since more people have a 360.
4071080	4075480	But then again, I mean, I don't know.
4075480	4081760	If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that'd be a big blow to Sony, because it would give
4081760	4089640	people yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3, because it's like, if you don't have any
4089640	4093400	exclusive games, no one's really gonna want- I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive
4093400	4100600	games with Microsoft, and it may not be something that everybody wants, but it's a lot less
4100600	4105240	exclusive games than, say, Sony has right now, and I don't know.
4105240	4111040	I think it makes perfect sense to go multiplatform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track
4111040	4112600	record, though.
4112600	4114680	They're definitely ones for exclusive content.
4114680	4115680	Not necessarily.
4115680	4120920	They used to be like that, but see, now with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're
4120920	4124120	releasing games on a bunch of different systems.
4124120	4128960	Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation
4128960	4134880	3 version, since they're gonna make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.
4134880	4135880	Why?
4135880	4139820	I don't know, because they haven't milked it enough yet.
4139820	4143520	I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple-sequel thing
4143520	4146840	like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy VII, although even though I think
4146840	4154560	Final Fantasy V is my favorite of the series, but Final Fantasy VI was, I think, their most
4154560	4160240	epic, but Final Fantasy VII is the fan favorite, I think that they're just trying to say, let's
4160240	4164040	make this the next Final Fantasy VII and beat it into the ground.
4164040	4165280	Probably.
4165280	4167540	It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.
4167540	4170460	So next email, huh?
4170460	4175080	This one is from SakuraMaxx, I guess.
4175080	4180000	By now I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff
4180000	4181000	and I am now dead.
4181000	4183120	I have two requests.
4183120	4186480	Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.
4186480	4189320	While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.
4189320	4196560	I seriously am a dead Tauren and I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter
4196560	4198400	of days.
4198400	4202920	SakuraMaxx in Deathicus Server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters
4202920	4203920	names?
4203920	4206400	If you want to find out the character names, go check out-
4206400	4207400	Get on forums.
4207400	4210680	Yeah, go on the forums, cheat plug.
4210680	4218480	Also as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.
4218480	4224040	I don't know, if someone happens to have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat, who knows,
4224040	4228440	maybe one day, but I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube
4228440	4229440	vid.
4229440	4233400	There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools, go check that out.
4233400	4237480	As far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little
4237480	4241200	clips and you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro, that's the song we use for the
4241200	4242200	outro.
4242200	4245360	We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permission, copyright issues,
4245360	4246360	blah, blah, blah.
4246360	4249360	Then we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.
4249360	4251200	Well next email, shall I?
4251200	4252200	Sure.
4252200	4254200	I have an OLR, it's me, Neki.
4254200	4255200	Excuse me.
4255200	4257200	Neki's on my Myspace now.
4257200	4260840	I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like
4260840	4265480	to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.
4265480	4267160	Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.
4267160	4268160	Oh, thank you.
4268160	4273920	I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week and I will have my diploma by the
4273920	4274920	weekend.
4274920	4275920	Congrats.
4275920	4276920	Rad.
4276920	4278920	We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.
4278920	4279920	Okay.
4279920	4284600	Let me read the email.
4284600	4288560	Orange Lounge match game coming soon to mobile phones.
4288560	4292520	And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they
4292520	4295120	should listen to the show when you weren't there, Jamie.
4295120	4296120	What?
4296120	4299860	Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news
4299860	4300860	that week.
4300860	4301860	Isn't that every week?
4301860	4303240	He was just being lazy that week.
4303240	4308480	Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week because here's the deal.
4308480	4311200	I'm flying out to Burbank at eight o'clock in the morning, which is why I'm running out
4311200	4314240	of the room so much because I'm trying to get my packing done, like laundry and stuff,
4314240	4319080	like because I'm literally driving over to get taken to the airport in the morning and
4319080	4320080	everything.
4320080	4323960	So I'm going to be gone Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then out of some weird twist of fate,
4323960	4331120	I fly back here on Wednesday just so Thursday I can drive back down to LA with dark soccer
4331120	4332120	again.
4332120	4335080	And you might be thinking, why didn't you just stay in LA, you dumb ass?
4335080	4338120	And truth be told, A, I don't want to pay for a hotel.
4338120	4341120	B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found
4341120	4343280	out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.
4343280	4344280	But it doesn't matter.
4344280	4345280	It is what it is.
4345280	4347120	I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.
4347120	4348120	So it'll be good.
4348120	4351600	But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following
4351600	4352920	gaming news next week.
4352920	4355720	So it's going to be the low-key show.
4355720	4359640	Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.
4359640	4363200	As you love pinball and Lego, here's a great match, okay?
4363200	4364200	There's apparently a pinball.
4364200	4365200	Yeah, one that someone made.
4365200	4366200	I think there's a logo.
4366200	4367200	Oh yeah, the logo pinball.
4367200	4368200	The logo pinball.
4368200	4369200	The logo pinball.
4369200	4370200	Yeah, we talked about that one.
4370200	4372440	That's great.
4372440	4378600	Maybe it isn't accurate, but as damn useful as it is, and then this is Xbox 360 Regional
4378600	4382080	Compatibility Guide.
4382080	4385120	So these are games that work on either or both systems.
4385120	4386120	That's interesting.
4386120	4388740	I didn't even know that was possible.
4388740	4397600	The website is at xbox-sky.com-xbox360-regional-compatibility-guide.
4397600	4403360	And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on, are they talking about
4403360	4404360	all regions?
4404360	4411080	Or just compatible games, because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.
4411080	4412880	These are all region.
4412880	4413880	Oh.
4413880	4417440	Pretty interesting stuff.
4417440	4419160	Maybe a few games are multi-region.
4419160	4420800	Far Cry works on both.
4420800	4423080	F.E.A.R. works on all three.
4423080	4427120	It even is going so far as listing the PAL ones as well.
4427120	4428120	That's pretty cool.
4428120	4429120	Anyway.
4429120	4430120	Thanks for the link.
4430120	4431120	That was pretty fun.
4431120	4432120	That's weird.
4432120	4433840	Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.
4433840	4434840	That's kind of weird.
4434840	4439600	I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room, unless Rob, you want to do it for
4439600	4440600	me?
4440600	4441600	Sure, why not?
4441600	4442600	Okay.
4442600	4443600	R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.
4443600	4447360	Okay, he has an HD, but it has some nifty little features.
4447360	4452440	And this is something on Gizmodo, which I'm not going to link.
4452440	4457120	It's a projector that looks like R2-D2, hooray.
4457120	4461960	Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into
4461960	4467040	it, and the USNCSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website
4467040	4468040	I aforementioned.
4468040	4472560	I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making
4472560	4476400	it 20 gigabyte, and they announced one 20 gigabyte.
4476400	4483200	Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.
4483200	4490040	My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced, slash having, I love the phrase
4490040	4494520	being serviced, having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will
4494520	4496120	be up, quote, soon.
4496120	4497120	Nice plug, by the way.
4497120	4498400	Yeah, he's saying, yeah, I got my site in.
4498400	4501960	Anyways, bye, Necky.
4501960	4504040	I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.
4504040	4505040	No.
4505040	4506040	I like Necky.
4506040	4507040	Cool.
4507040	4508040	Last email.
4508040	4509040	Dun, dun, dun.
4509040	4510040	Hey, guys.
4510040	4514400	Love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered,
4514400	4519320	I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety
4519320	4524000	of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school,
4524000	4527360	work, convention, or at a concert, simply how many people do you estimate listen to
4527360	4528360	your show?
4528360	4529360	End of sentence.
4529360	4530360	Thank you very much.
4530360	4531360	Kurt Peters.
4531360	4534360	Kurt's somebody who I'm not going to say the last name.
4534360	4539720	Sorry, I was going to say real quick, it looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan
4539720	4548040	of, you know, soccer or football, but you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.
4548040	4551960	Both will work on the U.S. Xbox 360s.
4551960	4552960	That's kind of neat.
4552960	4553960	Huh.
4553960	4554960	Except it's in PAL.
4554960	4558400	But I'm sure if your TV, you know, is an HD standard?
4558400	4561600	Yeah, HD's pretty standard, so.
4561600	4566140	As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest, we don't track
4566140	4568280	it very well.
4568280	4572840	We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed, but we've never really
4572840	4576320	been about the numbers, because honestly, during the first, you know, couple of years
4576320	4581320	of Orange and L'Andrea, for a long time, I'll say the very first show we did for 12 people,
4581320	4583680	13 people, and you couldn't download the show.
4583680	4585920	And most of us were in the same room, ha ha.
4585920	4586920	Yeah, ha ha.
4586920	4592600	So that was mostly it, but we did the show back then and continue to do the show now,
4592600	4596360	even now, even though, you know, we got bigger thanks to podcasting, just because, you know,
4596360	4599480	Dark Soccer, Loki and I need an excuse to hang out every week, and, you know, this is
4599480	4600480	fun.
4600480	4602920	I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.
4602920	4604240	You know what I mean, though.
4604240	4607040	You know, it is an excuse in the end.
4607040	4608040	Yeah, yeah.
4608040	4609040	Heart, heart, heart.
4609040	4610040	Making little hearts.
4610040	4611040	So, I don't know.
4611040	4615060	Do you need a good excuse to hang out with Loki?
4615060	4619820	So in the beginning, in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.
4619820	4621680	I would, I'm going to lowball it.
4621680	4624320	I don't, I don't know.
4624320	4625320	It's kind of weird.
4625320	4630920	Like, you know, I don't know if we should say, it's kind of, it's just, it's not important.
4630920	4631920	Is it really important?
4631920	4632920	I don't think it is.
4632920	4633920	No.
4633920	4634920	No, no.
4634920	4635920	I'll say this.
4635920	4636920	It's, it's, it's four digits.
4636920	4640600	It's somewhere, it's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.
4640600	4642520	We'll leave it there.
4642520	4643520	On the lower end.
4643520	4644520	All right.
4644520	4645520	That's it for the emails.
4645520	4646520	All right.
4646520	4647520	Yay.
4647520	4655040	Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned
4655040	4656840	it last week a little bit.
4656840	4662840	Spring Update's going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360, including instant messaging
4662840	4665040	via Windows Messenger.
4665040	4669440	And that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller.
4669440	4675760	But you're going to be able to message people while playing games, and also while watching
4675760	4681680	movies, and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list
4681680	4684920	as well, which is kind of nifty.
4684920	4691960	And some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for
4691960	4702720	some different video codecs, like MPEG4, H.264, and Play for Sure, which is kind of neat.
4702720	4708440	Yeah, but no XVID and DivX support yet, so.
4708440	4712520	But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and you know, that's awesome.
4712520	4718880	I like that they're adding stuff instead of, I don't know, removing functionality.
4718880	4722320	Like back groups compatibility in PlayStation 3.
4722320	4726040	Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message
4726040	4727400	people on MSN?
4727400	4728620	I know I won't.
4728620	4731360	I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.
4731360	4737800	You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.
4737800	4742440	But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.
4742440	4744280	Usually that takes concentration, you know?
4744280	4749440	How about this, Rob, switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.
4749440	4754160	You can do letterbox, zoom, stretch, and native, since you've lost your time.
4754160	4756320	I didn't lose the remote.
4756320	4759480	Somebody lost the remote, but it wasn't me, because it happened while I was on vacation.
4759480	4762080	But we won't go there.
4762080	4766880	Let's see, what else?
4766880	4769280	Oh, this is kind of cool.
4769280	4773440	The whole downloading stuff, where you can download in the background, you can also set
4773440	4778560	your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in like
4778560	4781320	a low power mode.
4781320	4782840	Like a PC.
4782840	4792440	It says, a new option in auto downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access
4792440	4797600	to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.
4797600	4802480	That's kind of nifty.
4802480	4806920	The Rob Dean chant is taunting me, because I always decline his Hold'em invites.
4806920	4808360	I feel bad.
4808360	4809640	This one's kind of cool.
4809640	4814640	Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games
4814640	4819680	their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they
4819680	4823880	can boast about their achievement scores.
4823880	4827680	Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.
4827680	4831840	I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.
4831840	4832840	Hooray.
4832840	4836600	That's going to be fun.
4836600	4837600	That's...
4837600	4838600	Yeah.
4838600	4841960	God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.
4841960	4844400	You're not an ass, Rob.
4844400	4847960	I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes to play Texas Hold'em with us.
4847960	4853000	GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that you guys play on Friday
4853000	4854360	and Saturday night.
4854360	4856360	That's clubbing night.
4856360	4858320	You don't go clubbing anymore.
4858320	4860000	Once in a great while, I do.
4860000	4861720	I want to go.
4861720	4863280	Well, we can sometime.
4863280	4864280	Okay.
4864280	4867120	Well, how about this?
4867120	4871960	We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?
4871960	4872960	I'm just teasing.
4872960	4873960	We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.
4873960	4874960	That'll be fun.
4874960	4875960	Yeah, we do.
4875960	4877240	Anyhow, back to games.
4877240	4879800	You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.
4879800	4880800	Wouldn't that be fun?
4880800	4882280	People would still laugh at you.
4882280	4883280	I would, yeah.
4883280	4885280	Talk about looking like an ass.
4885280	4890800	Anyway, last week on the show, I rammed and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar
4890800	4891800	was broken.
4891800	4893720	Although, well, you know, it did work.
4893720	4894720	It would play the game.
4894720	4897880	I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.
4897880	4899400	You could fix them, by the way.
4899400	4900400	Yeah, but here's the thing.
4900400	4901600	Now you don't have to.
4901600	4904880	Apparently, Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.
4904880	4910720	They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m. that will resolve the situation where
4910720	4913080	input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.
4913080	4916400	Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.
4916400	4917680	And guess what else it does?
4917680	4918680	It breaks consoles, supposedly.
4918680	4920680	It freezes your game.
4920680	4921680	I don't know.
4921680	4924980	There's reports on the internet, something to sit and dig, like all these people's consoles
4924980	4929400	are getting bricked and don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence or if the patch
4929400	4930400	did something.
4930400	4931400	Uh-oh.
4931400	4932400	It really is calibration.
4932400	4934120	That's what it was.
4934120	4939880	And I mean, I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing.
4939880	4942360	They put hot glue in the screws.
4942360	4947320	So I can't, I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy
4947320	4949720	bar to adjust it.
4949720	4951520	Thank you very much.
4951520	4953840	You bastards.
4953840	4955840	How dare they?
4955840	4960840	Well, here's something that we started asking why they dare, since a lot of people are not
4960840	4965200	too very fond of the first one, although I thought it was cool.
4965200	4971320	There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.
4971320	4983240	In the May edition of the official Xbox Magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually
4983240	4988760	in progress and that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it, but right now it's rumor
4988760	4989920	mill fodder.
4989920	4990920	Book tie-ins?
4990920	4991920	Joy.
4991920	4992920	I'm sorry.
4992920	4995160	Wait, what game's getting a sequel?
4995160	4996160	Perfect Dark Zero.
4996160	4997160	Dark.
4997160	5002080	Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.
5002080	5005280	I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.
5005280	5006800	This show needs a sound board.
5006800	5011920	Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where
5011920	5014240	we actually have normal jumps.
5014240	5015640	I like the super jumps.
5015640	5016640	I like being able to fly.
5016640	5017640	I like jumping!
5017640	5018640	Yay, jumping!
5018640	5030680	This week, Capcom has had their Gamers' Day, although we weren't invited, and they announced
5030680	5035560	a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the
5035560	5039840	PlayStation Network, including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about,
5039840	5046240	including Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, which is a fucking long-ass name and
5046240	5047240	stupid.
5047240	5050240	Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter II game with a longer title.
5050240	5051400	I mean, I think that's the joke.
5051400	5057800	I think that's seriously a joke, like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter II game name.
5057800	5060960	Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max!
5060960	5061960	Extreme!
5061960	5062960	Lame.
5062960	5063960	Okay, that's lame.
5063960	5065100	Lame, lame, lame.
5065100	5072000	But anyways, it is coming eventually to both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade,
5072000	5073480	and yeah.
5073480	5074840	Hooray.
5074840	5081200	Another thing that's getting an even longer title, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.
5081200	5082800	Now that's cool.
5082800	5083800	It's cool, but it's still a ret-
5083800	5084800	For matching service?
5084800	5087280	Just call it Puzzle Fighter, god damn it.
5087280	5092400	Don't need the Super Puzzle Fighter II Remix HD Super Duper.
5092400	5093400	It's Capcom.
5093400	5096800	Wasn't that in our match game a couple, like didn't we do a match game like just like three
5096800	5100000	weeks ago here on the show about like what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came
5100000	5101000	up?
5101000	5102000	Yeah, probably.
5102000	5104400	That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.
5104400	5105680	I do want Puzzle Fighter.
5105680	5106680	That's awesome.
5106680	5107680	I'll buy it.
5107680	5108680	It's awesome.
5108680	5109680	Hell yeah.
5109680	5110680	I heard they're adding new modes and stuff too.
5110680	5115280	That they're going to have like a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.
5115280	5116280	Well the better-
5116280	5117280	Wait a minute.
5117280	5119800	The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo actually, think about it.
5119800	5122680	There was also, what was the other game, Panel de Pawn, which I think-
5122680	5123680	Puzzle de Pawn.
5123680	5128240	Oh, Puzzle de Pawn, which is, I think is Pokemon Puzzle League, if I remember right.
5128240	5129240	Nope.
5129240	5130240	It's basically that game.
5130240	5131240	Is it?
5131240	5132240	Puzzle de Pawn is Bust the Move.
5132240	5133240	What?
5133240	5134600	That's Puzzle Bobble.
5134600	5135600	No?
5135600	5136600	Puzzle Bobble.
5136600	5138120	Yeah, Panda's a eucalyptus.
5138120	5139120	I believe her.
5139120	5141320	Puzzle Bobble is Bust the Move.
5141320	5143640	Well, I will look it up right now.
5143640	5144640	I know my title.
5144640	5146920	Puzzle de Pawn is exactly the same game.
5146920	5149080	I'm sure somebody in chat is correct with us right now.
5149080	5150080	I want to have a version of-
5150080	5154620	I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to-
5154620	5155620	I'll be damned.
5155620	5156620	He's right.
5156620	5158760	It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.
5158760	5160840	No, but it was Panel de Pawn.
5160840	5161840	Is it Panel de Pawn?
5161840	5163400	It's Puzzle de Pawn.
5163400	5164400	Who cares?
5164400	5167000	I used to play this game all the time when I was-
5167000	5169840	You know what game I would love to bring out a version of over here?
5169840	5170840	It's Puzzle and Desu.
5170840	5171840	It's Panel de Pawn.
5171840	5173720	It's got to be this game.
5173720	5174800	That makes much more sense.
5174800	5177040	It's Tetris Attack, Pokemon Puzzle League.
5177040	5178440	That game makes more sense.
5178440	5180240	That game makes more sense to have in there.
5180240	5181240	All right.
5181240	5182240	It's Panel de Pawn.
5182240	5183240	My bad.
5183240	5186600	I still want Puzzle and Desu.
5186600	5192760	One last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Axis of Evil, and Talisman.
5192760	5195960	It's basically this universe that they've created.
5195960	5202760	It's very similar, like Robotron crossed with, they were saying, Geometry Wars.
5202760	5205560	They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays, but anyways, it's going to be a
5205560	5207440	top-down shooter game.
5207440	5213000	Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up,
5213000	5214960	so awesome.
5214960	5218800	Let's come in Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
5218800	5225480	Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed
5225480	5227000	at Capcom Gamer's Day.
5227000	5230720	It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, and of course, there's a little trailer that
5230720	5232880	goes with it that you can see on the internet.
5232880	5234480	Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.
5234480	5239000	I saw a little glimpse of it, and I believe it goes back to one time.
5239000	5245040	The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court, so whatever.
5245040	5248480	There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there that'll be very happy about this.
5248480	5252760	I still have somehow missed the first game, so this is one of those series, like you know
5252760	5257920	how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't
5257920	5260940	have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?
5260940	5261940	This is one of those games.
5261940	5262940	Okay, question for you.
5262940	5263940	What?
5263940	5268740	How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it,
5268740	5272120	you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?
5272120	5274080	Dude, I hope so.
5274080	5278240	Also, if you can't get enough attorney games, hey, wait for this.
5278240	5285400	Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP, so not the new
5285400	5288800	stuff, but the old console's feeling a little love there.
5288800	5295840	Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and he defends famous cartoon characters,
5295840	5299720	so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to
5299720	5305640	get other licenses to get like, you know, but I guess they just won't have any of the
5305640	5308680	other cartoon characters in the game.
5308680	5310720	They'll just have his own stuff, original stuff.
5310720	5311720	I don't know.
5311720	5313960	Either way, fans of Adult Swim will be very happy.
5313960	5319160	And of course, other stuff that they were showing, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, and
5319160	5325160	Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which I heard was pretty lame.
5325160	5328720	Drunami being the Phoenix Wright fan, well, he hasn't been on the show in a while.
5328720	5329720	What the hell gives Drunami?
5329720	5331000	Do you not love us anymore?
5331000	5332240	Well, he plays Phoenix Wright.
5332240	5337560	He says, young Phoenix Wright being on trial for murder with his teacher Mia Fay defending
5337560	5338560	him.
5338560	5339560	There you go.
5339560	5340560	That's what Phoenix Wright's all about.
5340560	5344760	Lots of folks are going to be happy with that.
5344760	5347040	That's it for part A here of Orange Lawn Orange Radio.
5347040	5349480	As you know, Orange Lawn Orange Radio is split into two parts.
5349480	5352240	We tape here live on Sunday night, and we have to give ourselves a little break.
5352240	5354340	We got to stretch, go to the bathroom, all that good stuff.
5354340	5358500	So while we take a break here, you guys listening to the podcast just have to wait a couple
5358500	5360200	days because we like to space it out.

5366560	5367560	stay tuned.

5373800	5374800	a week.
5374800	5387760	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
