00:15.480 --> 00:19.920
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.640
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15th, 2007.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.800
Happy tax day to you and if youíre thinking, ìGosh, my taxes were long due.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.200
Iím actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.î Thatís because youíve downloaded probably

00:32.200 --> 00:34.360
our audio archive, also known as podcasting.

00:34.360 --> 00:38.120
Well, Orange Lounge Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
two parts.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.080
Or, if you want to hear it even before itís on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and

00:43.080 --> 00:47.160
B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.

00:47.160 --> 00:52.360
Monday nights at 6 oíclock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6

00:52.360 --> 00:56.920
oíclock, so just kind of be listening around 5.30 Pacific Standard Time or 9 a.m. on Tuesdays

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
Pacific Time.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.520
You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.

01:01.520 --> 01:07.200
Alright, letís give us some gaming news to talk about, so letís start it off.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.400
We need our Death March to play, Rob.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Why?

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
We need playing.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Thatís all I got.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.640
I thought for a moment you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars, so that

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
was kind of cool.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
AnywayÖ

01:19.640 --> 01:23.040
Unfortunately, I only have the one, no, I donít even have that.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.120
I have this.

01:27.120 --> 01:43.360
Okay, Death to PlayStation 3, the 20GB model is kaput.

01:43.360 --> 01:50.440
It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so sayeth Sony.

01:50.440 --> 01:59.960
Basically, the consumer market said, ìWe like the 60GB one because the 20GB one just

01:59.960 --> 02:11.800
completely blows my ass.î So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20, however,

02:11.800 --> 02:19.680
I donít know if thatís going to make it all this special thing, so it lasted six months.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.680
You own one of these, right?

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
Yes, I do.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.400
And itís just as good as the fucking 60GB, because thereís nothing on the download

02:26.400 --> 02:32.560
store to actually put on there, and itís not very easy to get videos on there.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.760
And do I really need wireless internet when itís sitting less than two feet away from

02:36.760 --> 02:37.760
a router?

02:37.760 --> 02:38.760
Probably not.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.760
It has a 60.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.200
Well, Loki has a collectorís item now, because those 20GBs are going to be super rare now.

02:45.200 --> 02:52.400
And do I need the fucking silver molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there?

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
A little pinstripe?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
I donít know.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.640
Now, thatís the rare one now, right?

02:56.640 --> 02:59.000
Iím fucking awesome, yeah!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Suck that, folks!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Well.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.080
Yeah, itís more like theyíre admitting that the 20GB is no longer available.

03:09.080 --> 03:15.160
It hasnít been available for months now, but this was something that happened.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.640
I want to say around January.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.640
Well, since you all found out, you canít order one.

03:21.640 --> 03:27.520
Itís nice that theyíre finally copping to that stuff.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.080
Anyways, so some other fun stuff.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.520
Letís see here.

03:33.520 --> 03:42.640
Sony is trying to get in on the wireless, kind of handheld input devices, very similar

03:42.640 --> 03:44.360
to the Wii now.

03:44.360 --> 03:49.600
Not exactly copying the Wii, but itís a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.040
They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a

03:55.040 --> 04:02.360
Power Glove, and itís supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I donít

04:02.360 --> 04:07.520
know, games and stuff, virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.120
I donít know, I think it looks kind of cool.

04:10.120 --> 04:15.060
And I donít really give a crap if itís a ripoff of Nintendo or whatever.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.760
At this point, who cares?

04:17.760 --> 04:24.820
Just make it, as long as it doesnít suck like the iToy did, Iím all for it.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.820
So itís a glove?

04:25.820 --> 04:26.820
Yeah, itís like a littleÖ

04:26.820 --> 04:27.820
So like the Power Glove?

04:27.820 --> 04:28.820
Itís so bad.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.360
Itís not really like the Power Glove.

04:30.360 --> 04:37.200
It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for

04:37.200 --> 04:38.200
your thumb.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.840
And then thereís like, I donít know if itís something that will cause it to tighten up

04:41.840 --> 04:47.200
or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of almost feel objects and stuff.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.680
So say, for example, I wanted to grab a virtual boob, I could do that and it would feel like

04:51.680 --> 04:53.120
Iím grabbing a virtual boob.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.480
So thatís what they needed to do with this.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.480
Yeah.

04:57.480 --> 05:01.120
Did you ever play with thatÖ What was that thing?

05:01.120 --> 05:05.800
They had it at the E3 Outpost and it was at E3 in Kensha Hall.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.800
The Novant Falcon?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
Was that what it was called?

05:08.800 --> 05:13.600
It sounds kind ofÖ It said the Novant Falcon wasnít a glove, it was this little ball.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
That thing was awesome.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.720
Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls

05:18.720 --> 05:22.440
together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.480
So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.080
Well hereís what itís also going to allow you to do.

05:27.080 --> 05:32.120
It says theyíre going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external

05:32.120 --> 05:39.200
input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending

05:39.200 --> 05:43.280
figures so you can flip off the thing and it will know that.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.280
I think it would be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people in like home

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
and stuff.

05:48.280 --> 05:54.880
It means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah, blah, blah, tactile

05:54.880 --> 06:00.000
feedback and means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.760
So yeah, itís basically going to be like VR gloves.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.840
Hooray!

06:04.840 --> 06:06.960
I have one thing to say about that.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
What?

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
Itís so bad.

06:08.960 --> 06:16.080
Anyhow, I donít know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog 3Speech

06:16.080 --> 06:19.380
from Sony has talked about some upcoming Playstation 3 games.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.600
Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.560
ìThatís when weíll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting

06:26.560 --> 06:31.960
game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air-foot vehicle combat game Warhawk,

06:31.960 --> 06:34.920
which is still looking likely to be released over the Playstation Network rather than the

06:34.920 --> 06:36.120
shops.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.120
First person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September as well as the first

06:40.120 --> 06:45.080
Playstation 3 version of Ratchet and Clank.î Kind of interesting because you think about,

06:45.080 --> 06:48.320
ìOkay, well, thatís about the time weíre supposed to get the real version of Playstation

06:48.320 --> 06:52.240
Home as well and everything.î It almost sounds like Playstation 3 is just going to hold on

06:52.240 --> 06:55.120
to everything until the next Christmas season.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.720
All the more reason for Halo to come out in September.

06:57.720 --> 07:02.160
Now, something to consider though is that 3Speech is a semi-official blog handled by

07:02.160 --> 07:07.920
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list

07:07.920 --> 07:10.000
that has a confirmed U.S. date is Lair.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.120
Thatís set for July.

07:12.120 --> 07:17.400
So the 3Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europeís perspective, but not necessarily

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
us.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.920
Lair, I know thatís been talked about as a July title, same with Warhawk.

07:21.920 --> 07:27.760
Warhawkís been a July title for a while, but then again, itís kind of morphed into

07:27.760 --> 07:32.440
really different things than before, so who knows when thatís coming out.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.320
I hope they donít wait that long because they donít have any exclusives between now

07:36.320 --> 07:38.360
and September, if thatís the case.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.840
Well, it should also be noted that 3Speech said something about BioShock on the Playstation

07:42.840 --> 07:46.960
3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, ìThere is currently

07:46.960 --> 07:50.300
no indication that BioShock will come out on the Playstation 3.î Oops, weíre talking

07:50.300 --> 07:51.300
out of our ass.

07:51.300 --> 07:59.920
Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a, what was the quote from Clerks and

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
Oral Bow movement?

08:00.920 --> 08:02.480
I really donít know.

08:02.480 --> 08:07.320
Well, I have some good news, at least this is good for me.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.000
They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.120
I think thatís great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.

08:17.120 --> 08:27.520
The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007 and there actually is a notice saying that the

08:27.520 --> 08:32.040
Sony Europe site, I suppose, has already been up.

08:32.040 --> 08:39.640
So Iím going to personally think of it as a rumor because it didnít really do all that

08:39.640 --> 08:45.960
great in Japan on PSP, but if itís coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.800
The game is just fucked up.

08:47.800 --> 08:54.440
Of course, theyíre going to jump on an opportunity to actually have another game that uses the

08:54.440 --> 08:55.440
6-axis.

08:55.440 --> 09:00.520
It actually uses the 6-axis and use it well, I hope.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.840
I donít know.

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
We can hope.

09:02.840 --> 09:03.840
Hold our breath, maybe.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.720
Kind of screwed other things up, but okie dokie.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.760
Anyways, weíve got some stuff coming out this week.

09:10.760 --> 09:16.720
Not a whole lot, not really a lot that you may be looking for, but itís coming out anyways.

09:16.720 --> 09:22.520
So starting off on PlayStation 2, Raiden 3 is finally making its way out and thatís,

09:22.520 --> 09:25.040
of course, the arcade shooter game.

09:25.040 --> 09:31.440
Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2, and I know the first one really blew, hopefully this oneís

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
not so bad.

09:32.440 --> 09:40.960
PC port of The Plan, and thatís coming to PlayStation 2 as well, didnít look very good.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.960
Eureka!

09:41.960 --> 09:45.560
7 Volume 2, the new wave, I believe thatís the new wave.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
Anyways, Eureka!

09:46.560 --> 09:50.600
7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks ok.

09:50.600 --> 09:56.320
Red Star, that old claim game thatís been in development forever and now itís finally

09:56.320 --> 09:58.880
making its way out in PlayStation 2.

09:58.880 --> 10:06.480
On the PSP, we have Hollow Knights finally making its way out, as well as Pocket Pool,

10:06.480 --> 10:18.400
that semi-porn billiards game, and letís see here, nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.

10:18.400 --> 10:27.440
Nothing on PlayStation 3, and letís see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics,

10:27.440 --> 10:34.960
letís see here, Mission Blackhawk, and Mission Combat Force, and a game called Made Man,

10:34.960 --> 10:36.600
which got horrible reviews.

10:36.600 --> 10:42.680
Finally, on the Wii, weíve got Bust-a-Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game, but of course

10:42.680 --> 10:48.080
the big stuffís going to be coming out on the DS, and weíve got Pokemon Diamond and

10:48.080 --> 10:54.240
Pearl finally making its way out, as well as a Sudoku game, Tundoku.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.040
Thatís it.

10:56.040 --> 11:03.680
Alright, over in Japan, theyíre having these following releases, for April 19th on the

11:03.680 --> 11:10.040
Wii, Super Paper Mario, they get their version of Super Paper Mario, Furu Park is coming

11:10.040 --> 11:13.800
out as well, looks like a little skating game with little chibi characters, thatís also

11:13.800 --> 11:15.600
coming out on the Wii.

11:15.600 --> 11:20.800
I guess Tony Hawk maybe not as popular over there as Furu Park, at least not Furi Furi

11:20.800 --> 11:23.260
Park, which is what I almost read.

11:23.260 --> 11:27.800
Starting on the PlayStation 3, nothing really to note on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 still

11:27.800 --> 11:33.240
getting a little bit of love, theyíre getting a game called Fate Stay Night, Rialta Nua

11:33.240 --> 11:40.280
is coming out on April 19th, and theyíve got a special edition, its own memory card,

11:40.280 --> 11:46.840
this is based on the Type-Moon Sukihime novel game that was released a couple years ago,

11:46.840 --> 11:50.960
itís anime, manga, figurines, etc., etc., so some of you guys that really follow anime

11:50.960 --> 11:54.280
are probably looking forward to that, so thatís coming out this week.

11:54.280 --> 12:03.120
Also coming out, Oruan Coco Host Buu is coming out in Japan, thatís an anime, Oruan High

12:03.120 --> 12:10.800
School Club something, little roses, and little girly men, yeah, itís a really fucked up

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
little anime.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.960
Alright, well if you want the little fucked up game that goes with it, itís coming out

12:14.960 --> 12:17.840
on the PlayStation 2 this week.

12:17.840 --> 12:22.720
Also on the Nintendo DS, letís see, what are you getting over there, Gaouken Alice

12:22.720 --> 12:27.800
Waku Waku Happy Friends, thatís coming out from Kidís Station on the DS this week, April

12:27.800 --> 12:31.800
19th, that looks like another anime game, my birthday has a lot of fun stuff on it,

12:31.800 --> 12:39.160
thatís all they get out there, Wi-Fi Tao Senkai No Dare Demo, you might think thatís

12:39.160 --> 12:43.640
an accessory but itís not, oh itís Clubhouse Games, thatís what it is, itís the Japanese

12:43.640 --> 12:47.120
version of Clubhouse Games, there you go.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.320
Once I saw the box art I was like, hey thatís just Clubhouse Games, so they get that this

12:50.320 --> 12:56.560
week on the DS, PSP, thereís your big releases this week, Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition

12:56.560 --> 13:00.840
coming out in Japan this week, so check that out.

13:00.840 --> 13:11.400
Thatís some pretty crazy stuff, now on the 20th for the UK we have Final Fantasy V Advance

13:11.400 --> 13:19.960
for GBA, God of War 2 on PlayStation 2, we have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP,

13:19.960 --> 13:24.760
The Red Star, Iím actually really thinking Iím going to get that game, after playing

13:24.760 --> 13:31.400
it at E3 a while back I thought it was pretty fun, Capcom Puzzle World on PSP, Cube on PSP,

13:31.400 --> 13:38.360
Diddy Kong Racing DS, Free Running on PSP, Hard Rock Casino on PlayStation 2 and PSP,

13:38.360 --> 13:46.440
Capcom US Navy Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 PSP, and Tony Hawkís Project 8 on PSP.

13:46.440 --> 13:57.400
Sweet, anyways, back into the news here, of course weíve got some interesting stuff coming

13:57.400 --> 14:03.120
out, of course one thing thatís been confirmed to be coming out, and Iím sure this is not

14:03.120 --> 14:10.560
a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octaneís site there was a response to I believe

14:10.560 --> 14:18.400
an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3, and it says Guitar Hero 3, and Guitar Hero

14:18.400 --> 14:25.440
3 is headed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and itís supposed

14:25.440 --> 14:34.920
to be coming out Fall 2007, so there you go, yet another release, and interesting, and

14:34.920 --> 14:41.320
according to, apparently there was, itís been removed from the website as well, because

14:41.320 --> 14:46.300
yeah, we didnít realize that there was another Guitar Hero game coming out this year, I mean

14:46.300 --> 14:50.840
after all there are some, was it the 80ís edition coming out later this year, and who

14:50.840 --> 14:55.680
knows what else theyíll throw in there, so not a big surprise.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.360
Itís funny we havenít heard much on Guitar Hero 80ís edition besides that little tidbit

14:59.360 --> 15:03.800
you found a couple weeks ago, itís weird, you would think we would have heard more about

15:03.800 --> 15:04.800
it by now.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
No.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.280
You think they might push it back?

15:07.280 --> 15:10.160
Yeah, I already know that, yeah.

15:10.160 --> 15:17.440
Oh, okay, alright then, letís see, moving on, if youíre a fan of music games then youíd

15:17.440 --> 15:23.440
probably like Ohndan as well, so we know hereís Elite Beat Agents, and Ohndan 2 is coming

15:23.440 --> 15:28.240
out in Japan on May 17th is what the rumblings are saying, is that the gameís coming out

15:28.240 --> 15:34.160
quite possibly that soon, some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet,

15:34.160 --> 15:42.540
Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia,

15:42.540 --> 15:48.280
Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube,

15:48.280 --> 15:52.880
the artist is Hirai Ken, Popstar, itís one of the cheesiest songs Iíve ever heard in

15:52.880 --> 15:57.280
my life, so, but itíll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they

15:57.280 --> 16:01.520
know it in Japan, Ohndan, so, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward

16:01.520 --> 16:03.880
to that one.

16:03.880 --> 16:08.600
I actually think that I might definitely pick that one up, except I havenít picked up the

16:08.600 --> 16:10.320
other one either, but anyway.

16:10.320 --> 16:18.960
Well, now this makes me also particularly happy, excuse me, sorry, allergies, anyway,

16:18.960 --> 16:29.000
there is a talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper, well, not second because

16:29.000 --> 16:37.160
thereís only a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2, Nana Oncha has been

16:37.160 --> 16:42.000
quoted saying, weíre also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all

16:42.000 --> 16:49.600
the family, and they said, yeah, that one, so theyíre apparently talking about Parappa.

16:49.600 --> 16:59.880
Hmm, letís see, well, you know thereís some, a new Parappa sequel would be kind of cool,

16:59.880 --> 17:05.920
one thing thatís not so cool, but, you know, once again, trying to milk something, Guinness

17:05.920 --> 17:12.920
Book of World Records, they are releasing a video game edition, hooray, so youíre going

17:12.920 --> 17:22.060
to have a book thatís going to have a bunch of gaming achievements in it, awesome.

17:22.060 --> 17:24.840
Am I the only one thatís not excited about this, I think this is kind of retarded.

17:24.840 --> 17:25.840
Iím not excited.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.880
I thought this was with Twin Galaxies.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.280
I would rather know about people who have like the worldís longest fingernails, and

17:33.280 --> 17:36.280
you know, can bench press a car.

17:36.280 --> 17:41.480
Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like throw baby a mile or something

17:41.480 --> 17:42.480
like that.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.480
Genetic oddities, those are great.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.880
Believe it or not, thatís a record, you know, but somebody thatís like, I have the high

17:47.880 --> 17:50.520
score DDR, and you know thatís going to be in there.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.880
Isnít that what leaderboards are for?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.920
I thought this was what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.920
Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one though.

17:57.920 --> 18:02.420
So, I donít know, itís kind of lame.

18:02.420 --> 18:06.720
People are listening to all that Twin Galaxies drama on another program, I could give two

18:06.720 --> 18:11.120
shits about video game high scores these days, I mean seriously.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.920
I donít know, well whatever, there will be some people that are into that, hooray for

18:13.920 --> 18:14.920
them.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.640
Hopefully a lot more people are into this, because I know thereís a lot of people that

18:17.640 --> 18:22.640
are excited about this game, itís called Trusty Bell, and theyíre getting a special

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
Xbox 360 pack in Japan for Trusty Bell.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.120
Theyíre calling it something else different over here though, right?

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
Eternal Sonata.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.640
Thank you, Eternal Sonata is what theyíre calling it over here, but in Japan itís Trusty

18:31.640 --> 18:36.040
Bell, and theyíre getting a whole Xbox 360 pack that will come with the game, Trusty

18:36.040 --> 18:39.880
Bell, and of course a controller and all that good stuff.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.920
Obviously theyíre thinking this is one of those games like Blue Dragon that might push

18:42.920 --> 18:45.960
some consoles, so they are bundling it all together.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.440
Itís going to be fucking awesome since you canít save anything because thereís no memory

18:49.440 --> 18:51.440
card and itís a core system.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.440
Awesome!

18:52.440 --> 18:53.440
You suck, Pete.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.440
I didnít even catch that, thatís great.

18:55.440 --> 19:01.560
Way to go, yeah with an RPG, Iím just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.

19:01.560 --> 19:02.560
Thatís awesome.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.400
Thatís awesome, I didnít even catch that, thereís no, oh my God, no hard drive and

19:06.400 --> 19:08.040
no memory card.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
Brilliant.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Good job.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.040
Thatís lovely.

19:11.040 --> 19:20.040
Well, what else is brilliant is Dark Sakura surfing the internet all week long at work

19:20.040 --> 19:21.480
actually, thatís all she does.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.960
No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them

19:24.960 --> 19:32.720
with you in this little segment we call Dark Sakuraís Website of the Week.

19:32.720 --> 19:37.200
And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, Dark Sakura?

19:37.200 --> 19:46.160
The website of the week is ICanHasCheeseburger.com, which is like a Caturday site, I love it.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.920
I visited the site, I didnít get it, I thought it was cute.

19:50.920 --> 19:58.600
Itís ICanHasCheeseburger.com and cheeseburger is spelled C-H-E-E-Z-V-U-R-G-E-R, ICanHasCheeseburger.com.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.960
The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over

20:02.960 --> 20:09.640
a kitten with the caption, ìDo not want.î Thereís also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua

20:09.640 --> 20:16.880
wearing a dolphin wig, it says, ìI love scotch, here it goes down, down into my bellies.î

20:16.880 --> 20:19.480
I was just like hooray, another cat site from Jamie.

20:19.480 --> 20:26.120
And thereís dogs on here too, thereís a little puppy making his sad faces, ate all

20:26.120 --> 20:29.040
the cheeseburger brownie face.

20:29.040 --> 20:34.240
Dark Tetsuya is posting his favorite, Dark Tetsuya is posting from ICanHasCheeseburger

20:34.240 --> 20:39.040
the entry on April 13th, ìPrincess in another castle, sorry.î I guess the cats are wearing

20:39.040 --> 20:40.040
it.

20:40.040 --> 20:44.840
Thereís one of a cat with a wiimote in his lap saying, ìI can please have a walk through.î

20:44.840 --> 20:47.360
So, there you go.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.440
ICanHasCheeseburger.com, what is it, ICanHasCheeseburgers, is that what it is?

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
ICanHasCheeseburger.com.

20:54.440 --> 21:00.560
Alright, check it out boys and girls, the official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.800
Some interesting stuff, if youíre looking to try some games out, thereís been some

21:03.800 --> 21:09.560
demos that have come out on live recently, some that you might not be excited about,

21:09.560 --> 21:14.880
some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out, hooray.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.880
Some that actually look kind of interesting and havenít gotten to play yet, Monster Madness

21:17.880 --> 21:24.480
Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command

21:24.480 --> 21:31.400
and Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that would be pretty awesome as well.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.880
Look for it.

21:32.880 --> 21:40.720
Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed,

21:40.720 --> 21:46.160
sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince

21:46.160 --> 21:51.840
of Persia Classic, for the record it got a 12 plus years age rating.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.520
But that would be, you know, since thereís new Prince of Persia, isnít there a new game

21:54.520 --> 21:57.200
coming out somewhat soon, in the not too distant future?

21:57.200 --> 22:00.840
Yeah, theyíre supposed to be doing what for like 360 or something.

22:00.840 --> 22:06.960
So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.

22:06.960 --> 22:11.280
By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me

22:11.280 --> 22:15.380
a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie weíve earlier spoken about

22:15.380 --> 22:19.320
on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.

22:19.320 --> 22:24.360
So as long as he doesnít screw up Transformers, I suppose weíll be looking forward to Prince

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
of Persia.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.320
But if he does screw up Transformers, there will be hell to pay.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.600
Brimstone and fire will rain down upon him.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
Yes.

22:32.600 --> 22:39.120
Fire and brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.

22:39.120 --> 22:43.520
Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire and this isnít though about

22:43.520 --> 22:44.520
a dragon.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.840
So anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.000
GameTap can do Saturn games, isnít that great?

22:52.000 --> 22:58.200
But itís actually also in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoonís V.I. heading

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
out.

22:59.200 --> 23:05.160
Now, Iím sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.

23:05.160 --> 23:11.200
Or as it was calledóGod, why canít IóBecause Panzer Dragoon Orta was theó

23:11.200 --> 23:14.240
Itís a start, Jamie, Jesus.

23:14.240 --> 23:19.880
I know, but the Panzer Dragoon RPG was just like fucking beautiful.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.120
You know, I have that game on Saturn.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.840
Here, have a cheeseburger.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
I have that game.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.320
You have a cheeseburger game?

23:25.320 --> 23:26.960
No, bite my butt.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.320
I have aóI actually do have BurgerTime.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.320
Does that count?

23:30.320 --> 23:31.320
Dude, BurgerTime is awesome.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.320
They have BurgerTime on GameTap.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.320
Thatís all you need.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.320
But Panzer Dragoon RPG is just likeó

23:35.320 --> 23:39.280
Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Super BurgerTime on GameTap.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.280
I know.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.080
I didnít even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once

23:43.080 --> 23:44.840
and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
What is this?

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
We have Sega Love now.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
What is this?

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
Sega!

23:48.840 --> 23:51.800
Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.800
Good.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.200
They can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.120
All right, so be it.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.120
You donít want to talk about that.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.120
Do not want!

24:03.120 --> 24:04.200
Exactly.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.800
You might want, though, Halo 3 multiplayer beta.

24:06.800 --> 24:15.960
Itís coming out now May 16th and will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.

24:15.960 --> 24:20.460
To which the entire internet responded, ìThree weeks!

24:20.460 --> 24:21.460
Win!î

24:21.460 --> 24:29.080
The beta will contain three multiplayer maps of Valhalla High Ground and Snowbound, graphically

24:29.080 --> 24:35.680
improved since the first multiplayer screenshots, and they will only be playable in matchmaking

24:35.680 --> 24:37.480
only.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.840
And letís see what else.

24:38.840 --> 24:44.760
New guns, vehicles, gameplay features, including the mysterious X button, which, by the way,

24:44.760 --> 24:47.960
has been spoiled, and itís just an equipment button.

24:47.960 --> 24:54.440
So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.120
Who fucking cares?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
Whatever.

24:57.120 --> 25:03.640
Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda

25:03.640 --> 25:08.600
yadda yadda, wonderful.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.920
So buy Crackdown if you havenít yet.

25:10.920 --> 25:15.000
Well, I was going to share with you all a little bit about what the X button does in

25:15.000 --> 25:20.360
the Halo 3 beta, but Loki kind of ruined it, so thank you, Loki, for being a bastard.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.360
But if you didnít already hear, yeah, you get the bubble.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.600
Itís all confirmed over on Bungie.net.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.720
Just look for a post that Frankie made on April 13th.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
Itís all right there.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.840
It gives a little hints about whatís going on.

25:30.840 --> 25:37.160
Thereís going to be a shield, the whole bubble shield thing, and whatever, trip mines.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.000
Itís going to be interesting, itís going to add a whole new element to the game, but

25:41.000 --> 25:45.840
they swear it will not be, like, something thatís, you know, exploitable.

25:45.840 --> 25:49.240
You know, itís something thatís going to be limited, all that functionality.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.400
So weíll see.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.600
Lord knows I could use a shield when Iím playing Halo, because I get shot in the face

25:54.600 --> 25:55.840
all the time when Iím playing Halo.

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
I donít like it.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.360
Shot in the face is fun.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.360
Not really.

26:00.360 --> 26:01.360
Not if itís you.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.360
Itís getting shot.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
I donít get shot in the face.

26:03.360 --> 26:10.560
But something, though, that is, I think, pretty neat is Pac-Man Versus is going to the Nintendo

26:10.560 --> 26:12.880
DS by way of the Namco Museum.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.480
Isnít that cool?

26:14.480 --> 26:24.600
For anyone who doesnít know, Pac-Man Versus was a, it was like where you played on your

26:24.600 --> 26:31.480
portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man while you had your Pac-Man controller

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
playing on the main screen.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.480
I thought it was the other way around.

26:33.480 --> 26:38.640
I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and then one person had Pac-Man

26:38.640 --> 26:42.800
on the, or Game Boy Advance.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
I never played it.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.080
No, the ghosts were split on the screen, thatís right, and it was Pac-Man that was on the

26:47.080 --> 26:48.080
Game Boy.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.520
You know what I meant.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.160
Pac-Man could see everything going on, but I thought it was funny because it was actually

26:54.160 --> 26:58.240
really loud when people would play it at my house and be like, ìIs it fun?î

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
Was it fun?

26:59.240 --> 27:00.240
Yeah, itís fun.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.240
Itís pretty fun.

27:01.240 --> 27:07.520
But itís going to be a, it has the multiplayer packed in as 20 bucks and also will include

27:07.520 --> 27:14.880
Dig Dug 2, Xevious, Pac-Man, Mappy, Galaxian, Galaga, and Tower of Druaga.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.120
Which a lot of those are shit games, but.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.000
I love Xevious and Mappy and Galaxian.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.760
Those games are cool, but Tower of Druaga, have you ever actually played it?

27:21.760 --> 27:22.760
It sucks.

27:22.760 --> 27:23.760
No, but I have a sticker for it.

27:23.760 --> 27:24.760
Alright, well it sucks.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.880
I want the Valkyrie game.

27:26.880 --> 27:30.040
Actually I have the Valkyrie game on TurboGrafx.

27:30.040 --> 27:33.000
But do you get to play Wi-Fi, like over the internet?

27:33.000 --> 27:36.640
That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man Versus on Wi-Fi.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.640
Probably not.

27:37.640 --> 27:43.320
Alright, well, weíre starting to get late into the show and we still have not done this

27:43.320 --> 27:47.160
segment and I donít know, for some reason putting this segment after a story about the

27:47.160 --> 27:50.880
Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate, so itís time to bring on the pain in our

27:50.880 --> 27:52.680
FUs of the week.

27:52.680 --> 27:59.560
Dark Sakura, whatís your bitch this week?

27:59.560 --> 28:09.800
Um, I have a rash.

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
Thatís it.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
Thatís it?

28:11.800 --> 28:12.800
F you to your rash?

28:12.800 --> 28:14.300
F you to my rash.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.300
Where is your rash?

28:15.300 --> 28:16.300
Is it in a private place?

28:16.300 --> 28:21.320
Or is it a place where I can see it?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.320
No questions asked.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.320
Itís on my back.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
On her back, okay.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.800
Itís obviously an allergic reaction to something, because whenever I have a rash thatís an

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
allergic reaction, it gets bloody.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
Ew.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.800
So yeah, Iím going to the dermatologist, hopefully next week.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.800
Thatíll be fun.

28:41.800 --> 28:42.800
Lucky!

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
God, I had an FU earlier.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.800
I donít know.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.800
Iíve got nothing.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
Iím really pissed off at.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
Iím hungry.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
F you to hunger?

28:48.800 --> 28:49.800
Yeah.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.800
F you to world hunger?

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
No, itís my hunger.

28:51.800 --> 29:04.440
Iím going to say I also F you toÖ F you to the fact that I ate all that pocky, thatís

29:04.440 --> 29:06.440
going to make me fat.

29:06.440 --> 29:11.880
F you to the freaking aquarium that IÖ if you listen to the bonus segment live tonight

29:11.880 --> 29:15.040
or on all games that doesnít go to podcasts, youíre going to be talking about my aquarium

29:15.040 --> 29:19.880
I bought, and it killed one of my fish, so F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed

29:19.880 --> 29:22.960
my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.280
Bastard filter.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.880
Bastard aquarium.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.040
Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
said it would work.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
So F you to PetSmart.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.040
Thatís it.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.320
Those were nice short FUs this week.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
Yes.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.320
Good times.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.680
Weíll open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.

29:41.680 --> 29:46.380
Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking

29:46.380 --> 29:47.380
around about.

29:47.380 --> 29:53.720
I donít even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is a girly putting

29:53.720 --> 29:56.280
up or putting on makeup game.

29:56.280 --> 30:02.520
So itís called Cosmetic Paradise, and itís a makeup adventure game, and you live in the

30:02.520 --> 30:10.000
magical land of cosmetics and must undergo a trial before becoming a queen.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.700
Their heroine must help the townís ladies when they want to confess their love to boys.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.560
Help comes in the form of makeup.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.720
It says in-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.640
The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.

30:25.640 --> 30:31.040
There are mini games which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.

30:31.040 --> 30:35.520
The Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so that items can be exchanged with friends and players

30:35.520 --> 30:39.200
and so you can do each otherís makeup.

30:39.200 --> 30:44.680
I want this game because it sounds so stupid.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.520
Come on Dark Sakura, get the makeup game and play with me.

30:47.520 --> 30:51.880
We can do each otherís makeup.

30:51.880 --> 31:00.960
This is one of the strangest attempts to get that girl gamer demographic that no one seems

31:00.960 --> 31:01.960
to get.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.560
I donít know, Dark Sakura, will this make you want to play video games?

31:06.560 --> 31:07.940
The makeup game?

31:07.940 --> 31:24.640
You can visit the world of Katwa and Cosmetica?

31:24.640 --> 31:27.960
What if you could do the gothic Lolita thing with the makeup?

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
That would be awesome.

31:29.960 --> 31:35.600
If I could play Be Gothic Lolita the game, then I would definitely do that.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.440
Thatís great.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.480
In chat, theyíre asking who died, Zach or Kelly, because my two fish were named Zach

31:42.480 --> 31:45.800
and Kelly because my aquarium is named Bayside.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.060
Kelly died.

31:47.060 --> 31:48.060
Kelly was the fat one.

31:48.060 --> 31:51.700
She got sucked right up in the filter, so I fear for Zach because Zach was kind of scrawny,

31:51.700 --> 31:53.700
so heís the littler fish.

31:53.700 --> 31:56.240
I get sucked up and just shop right back out again.

31:56.240 --> 32:01.320
I know, Iím kind of worried about that, but he wonít be alive by the time I get back

32:01.320 --> 32:02.320
from LA.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.500
Either heíll get sucked into the filter tonight or X4 wonít feed him.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.500
One of the two will happen.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.440
Well, you can leave the fish in there and heíll just eat the other fish.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.000
I get you a miniature koi.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Weíll see.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.120
Letís get Rob a piranha.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.640
Thatíd be cool.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.640
Letís see.

32:19.640 --> 32:24.000
The Rob D says, ìOf course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.î

32:24.000 --> 32:26.200
Talking about the makeup game.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.520
Gaming Nerd says, ìThis sounds like a sky game, LOL.î

32:28.520 --> 32:29.840
What, because Iím gay?

32:29.840 --> 32:31.920
Dude, I donít do makeup and stuff.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
Thatís gay.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.920
Thatís different.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
Thatís theater.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.320
I donít even really do makeup at Rocky.

32:39.320 --> 32:45.280
Letís see, Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, ìMakeup games sell more copies than even

32:45.280 --> 32:46.280
GTA.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.160
Oh my God, video games are no longer violent.î

32:49.160 --> 32:50.160
Interesting.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.720
Hi, we can hear you.

32:53.720 --> 32:59.000
Letís see.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.680
Bandit in chat says, ìAs long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
win.î There we go.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.160
Zach liked fatties.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.760
Yeah, I like to smoke them.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.840
All right, letís open up the Skype line.

33:10.840 --> 33:14.400
If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.400
We have extra time.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.400
We should have done a game tonight.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.320
I donít have anything prepped though.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.320
Oh well.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.080
Weíll take extra calls, I guess, if thereís folks that actually want to call us.

33:23.080 --> 33:29.980
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always call us on the regular telephone

33:29.980 --> 33:30.980
as well.

33:30.980 --> 33:37.560
Thatís 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.120
You can ask us about any of the news we talked about tonight or if you have a comment or

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
whatever.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.560
Or you know what, you can just ask us anything tonight.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.160
We have a lot of extra time.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
Who cares?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.920
Itís potpourri night here on the phones.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.360
Hi, youíre on OrangeLoungeRadio.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
Whoís this?

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Good evening.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.360
This is DMN.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.360
Hi, DMN.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.360
Whatís up?

33:55.360 --> 34:00.920
Iím calling about one of your stories at the top of the show regarding Nintendo and

34:00.920 --> 34:03.160
their shortages of Wiiís.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.160
Yes.

34:04.160 --> 34:09.920
I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve

34:09.920 --> 34:13.840
the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiiís.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.440
So theyíre purposefully holding back, you think?

34:17.440 --> 34:19.640
I do.

34:19.640 --> 34:26.240
The big talk around wherever I am is whereís the Wiiís, whereís the Wiiís.

34:26.240 --> 34:29.920
Nintendo is trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get

34:29.920 --> 34:34.400
them even more.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.880
Is that right?

34:35.880 --> 34:37.000
What is your opinion on that?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.620
Is that right?

34:38.620 --> 34:41.520
I think itís stupid.

34:41.520 --> 34:46.520
They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win

34:46.520 --> 34:51.400
that console war, they need to sell more systems, especially financially.

34:51.400 --> 34:57.400
They need to sell two systems for every one of Sonyís PS3 and they need to sell three

34:57.400 --> 34:59.920
systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.880
Yeah, but thatís not necessarily true because theyíre making a profit off each system whereas

35:03.880 --> 35:07.360
everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.360
That is true.

35:09.360 --> 35:14.880
Owned by Loki.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.000
And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title,

35:19.000 --> 35:28.400
Iím surprised Nintendo has released this game and Wiiís are still not readily available.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
I donít know.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.540
I would think that thereís no point to making a shortage now.

35:33.540 --> 35:38.600
You donít hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
I donít know.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.680
Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas, but even then it would be stupid

35:42.680 --> 35:48.440
to do it around Christmas because then thatís when you make your most money.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.920
So I donít get the point of a forced shortage.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.440
I just donít understand it.

35:52.440 --> 35:56.520
Maybe I donít know enough about economics.

35:56.520 --> 36:00.480
My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
What?

36:01.480 --> 36:04.240
Thatís just my two cents on the matter.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.240
Anything else?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.240
Whatís up on STFU this week?

36:06.240 --> 36:11.800
We didnít have a show last week and the week before I wasnít on so everybody has to suffer

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
because Iím back this week.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.800
Congrats.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.960
What are you giggling about?

36:16.960 --> 36:19.080
Why are there giggling girls over there?

36:19.080 --> 36:20.080
I forget Safeword.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.080
I donít get it.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.080
Bondage!

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
Oh.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.080
Oh.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
I thought I was thinking Safeword.

36:25.080 --> 36:29.560
Itís a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, ìI forget Safeword.î

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
Yeah.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
Hi, John.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Hi, Jamie.

36:32.560 --> 36:37.920
No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.320
Oh, hi Irene.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.840
Sheís running out of the room crying.

36:41.840 --> 36:42.840
All right.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.280
I better go call her and talk to her then.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.280
Oh, really now?

36:47.280 --> 36:48.280
Gotta go.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.280
Bye.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
You so just got caught.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.280
All right.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.280
Letís take another call.

36:52.280 --> 37:09.200
Hi, youíre on Orange

37:09.200 --> 37:10.200
Jersey.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.960
Youíre always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.400
What was going on at the end of the break?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.680
Was there a tourney or something?

37:15.680 --> 37:16.680
No.

37:16.680 --> 37:21.680
A massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.400
But yeah, just word of 2DX and whatnot.

37:25.400 --> 37:33.800
But yeah, I donít get why Activision does wonderful things to your 360, case in point,

37:33.800 --> 37:38.760
breaking it with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.400
So basically, if you want theóI mean, I donít get it.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.760
If you want the whammy bar fixed, youíre going to have to go through an arm and a leg

37:45.760 --> 37:51.600
and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.520
I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.600
Luckily, I wonít have to for a week.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.400
So maybe itíll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because Iím going to be gone

37:59.400 --> 38:00.400
for a while.

38:00.400 --> 38:05.600
But Iím afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because if my 360 breaks, Iím going to be so mad

38:05.600 --> 38:08.960
because I know when I call Microsoft, like now they want you to pay to get it fixed.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.120
Iím going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesnít deserve

38:13.120 --> 38:14.120
it.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
Think about it, Ryan.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
Yeah, I understand that.

38:16.120 --> 38:21.120
But you know itís like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
What?

38:22.120 --> 38:23.720
Thatís a staggering number.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.720
9 out of every 10?

38:24.720 --> 38:25.720
Yeah, thatís bullshit.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
Yeah, somebodyís pointed that out here.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.720
A 90% break rate though.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.720
It says something about a 90% break rate.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.120
A 90% break rate?

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
Come on.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
If that were happeningó

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
I know.

38:35.120 --> 38:40.080
No, but only for the people who actually downloaded, who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably

38:40.080 --> 38:41.080
notó

38:41.080 --> 38:42.080
I know.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
No, thatís notó

38:43.080 --> 38:44.360
It doesnít represent the entire user base at all.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.360
But thereís likeó

38:45.360 --> 38:46.360
Yeah, thatís bullshit.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.420
Iím telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of

38:49.420 --> 38:50.760
people on them right now.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.080
That game is selling like crazy.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.200
I know that youíre not supposed to judge sales of a game based on a leaderboard, but

38:56.200 --> 38:57.200
you kind of can.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
You kind of can.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
But think about it.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.360
Donít you think it was a rush job to get Guitar Hero 2 to the 360 in the first place?

39:03.360 --> 39:05.000
Oh, Iím sure it was.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.840
Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
I want to know.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
I mean, of theó

39:10.840 --> 39:18.960
How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch break one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the

39:18.960 --> 39:20.240
actual number is?

39:20.240 --> 39:21.240
1%, whatever.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.800
How does it break one 360?

39:22.800 --> 39:24.040
I had no idea.

39:24.040 --> 39:28.520
All I know is that no matteróI mean, it could happen anytime.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.520
Itís completely unrelated.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.520
Itís basically like death.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.120
Itís like the odds of dying in a car accident.

39:34.120 --> 39:38.360
You know, theyíre much higher than actually dying of terrorism.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.360
What?

39:39.360 --> 39:40.360
Okay, shut up.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.360
Knock it off.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.360
Listen.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.040
Hereís why this crap is going on.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.720
Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.

39:47.720 --> 39:51.160
Thatís why you get people saying, ìOh, 90% of the consoles are breaking afteróî No,

39:51.160 --> 39:54.840
itís because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.520
Thatís why I have a little 360-form, so you canít blame me for that.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.520
No, it might be that your system died.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
All right?

40:01.520 --> 40:05.920
You can put it on the 360-forms from other people who are experiencing the same issue.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.920
Yeah, but one personó

40:06.920 --> 40:08.680
And they shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.800
Yeah, but one person has their system crash and then another person is like, ìWell, why

40:11.800 --> 40:12.800
did this crash since day two?

40:12.800 --> 40:17.400
It must be because of Guitar Hero.î And then other people, ìOh, my friendís system crashed

40:17.400 --> 40:24.640
too.î I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now itís broken and itís all because

40:24.640 --> 40:25.640
of Guitar Hero.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.640
Well, thatís besides the point.

40:26.640 --> 40:30.640
I just want to take a bath in my 360.

40:30.640 --> 40:35.960
Non-Microsoft, I donít get how a non-Microsoft update can actually break a 360.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
I donít either.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
Thatís the first time.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.240
I mean, thatís the first time I heard of that.

40:39.240 --> 40:45.840
I heard of Microsoft doing that to other unlucky ones and thatís why Iím worried.

40:45.840 --> 40:52.200
Iím holding off on the 360 because of that, because of the fact that any update can break

40:52.200 --> 40:55.320
my system and I have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to get it replaced.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.600
Itís not even worth the time and effort.

40:57.600 --> 41:02.280
Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still breaking after theyíve uninstalled

41:02.280 --> 41:06.040
the update and when theyíre going into the dashboard, which wouldnít even be running

41:06.040 --> 41:09.280
the game at all and wouldnít have anything to do with the fucking update.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.560
So itís not related and people are retarded.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.560
This conversation is giving me a migraine.

41:13.560 --> 41:17.160
Oh, well, I think weíll leave it at that.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.160
All right, Zaku.

41:18.160 --> 41:23.200
Thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesnít kill your family, okay?

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
All right.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
All right.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.840
Take care.

41:26.840 --> 41:32.960
The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and itís killing grandmas across the nation.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.520
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
Whoís this?

41:35.520 --> 41:36.520
Hey, whatís up, guys?

41:36.520 --> 41:37.520
Hi, whatís on your mind?

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
Whoís this?

41:38.520 --> 41:40.680
This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold them?

41:40.680 --> 41:43.760
Hello, the Rob D. Iím not dodging you and hold them.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.760
I understand.

41:44.760 --> 41:45.760
I understand.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.840
You guys play on a bad night, God.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.120
Play on like a Monday night.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
Nothing happens on Monday.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Oh, fuck.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
Heroes is back next week.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.120
Never mind.

41:53.120 --> 41:58.040
Actually, as a college student, weeknights would be worse, but either way, thatís not

41:58.040 --> 41:59.040
what I call them.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.040
All right.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.040
Whatís on your mind?

42:01.040 --> 42:04.240
Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable

42:04.240 --> 42:05.240
content.

42:05.240 --> 42:10.480
What to you would be a better solution, the iTunes model of buying one song a piece or

42:10.480 --> 42:16.360
actually whatís the more egregious offense, the three-song packs or the cost per song,

42:16.360 --> 42:21.640
which to me is also pretty bad?

42:21.640 --> 42:24.360
One of those songs ended up, but they ended up costing $2 a song, right?

42:24.360 --> 42:25.880
About $2.10 per piece, per song.

42:25.880 --> 42:26.880
Okay.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.560
I think it should just be, they should be priced, I think DDR, even though thereís

42:30.560 --> 42:34.640
a whole another can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on

42:34.640 --> 42:39.240
the disk and people were mad about that, but that aside, I think the pricing scheme over

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
there was somewhat fair.

42:40.240 --> 42:44.520
It was, what, 100 points a song, so it worked out to be, what, $1.25 or something?

42:44.520 --> 42:48.960
So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought like a pack of 10, you got a discount,

42:48.960 --> 42:51.160
so it only ended up being like a dollar a song.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
I like that.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.160
Yeah.

42:53.160 --> 42:57.280
A dollar per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download

42:57.280 --> 42:59.640
because I donít want to download every Guitar Hero song.

42:59.640 --> 43:02.840
Right, and same thing with DDR is that, you know what, maybe I donít want Candy because

43:02.840 --> 43:07.560
Candyís been in every freaking DDR game lately, so maybe I want to skip that one, but I have

43:07.560 --> 43:10.840
that option, or I could just download the Mega Pack and itís kind of included.

43:10.840 --> 43:14.120
It depends how many of the songs I want, but hereís the other difference between the DDR

43:14.120 --> 43:18.940
packs is that not only are they cheaper because itís $1.25 a song, but they are new songs

43:18.940 --> 43:20.280
mostly to the series.

43:20.280 --> 43:24.280
About, letís say, three quarters of them are new, right?

43:24.280 --> 43:29.560
Yeah, I think paying that much and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy

43:29.560 --> 43:33.240
all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I donít remember how much, I think

43:33.240 --> 43:37.540
it was about $90, then thatís ridiculous.

43:37.540 --> 43:38.540
What do you think?

43:38.540 --> 43:39.540
Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?

43:39.540 --> 43:42.440
Do you think theyíre going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the

43:42.440 --> 43:45.460
internet or do you think, you know, hey, if some suckerís going to buy it, letís keep

43:45.460 --> 43:46.460
cranking it out?

43:46.460 --> 43:51.160
If enough people buy them, not a chance.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.800
So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, donít buy it.

43:53.800 --> 43:58.840
Exactly, and honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
individually.

43:59.840 --> 44:03.040
I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I donít have to download every

44:03.040 --> 44:04.040
song.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.320
But if theyíre going to put them in three packs, no way.

44:06.320 --> 44:10.920
I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar

44:10.920 --> 44:12.520
Hero songs are kind of long.

44:12.520 --> 44:16.280
You know, DDR songs are short, theyíre like, what, a minute and a half, a minute and 45,

44:16.280 --> 44:19.880
so you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs

44:19.880 --> 44:20.880
so they could be more.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.160
I would, youíre right, Iíd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual

44:24.160 --> 44:25.160
song.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.160
But none of this packs stuff.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.160
I donít like that.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.560
Yeah, I think itís almost a double offense in their case.

44:29.560 --> 44:33.760
Another game I want to play, though, is the Phoenix Ride, or not the Phoenix Ride game,

44:33.760 --> 44:35.040
the Harvey Birdman game.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.880
I think thatís a perfect license for Capcom.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.920
Yeah, do you think theyíre going to kind of model it after Phoenix Ride or what do

44:39.920 --> 44:40.920
you think itís going to be like?

44:40.920 --> 44:43.400
I donít think they could avoid it, honestly.

44:43.400 --> 44:47.400
I think that theyíd be almost remiss not to do that.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.400
Objection!

44:48.400 --> 44:49.400
I guess weíll see.

44:49.400 --> 44:50.400
Iíll take the case.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.840
Do you think Phoenix Ride is popular enough that enough people would get it, like thereíd

44:53.840 --> 44:58.920
be enough cross-interest between the two franchises, Phoenix Ride and Harvey Birdman?

44:58.920 --> 45:02.320
Maybe itíd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
I guess thatís true.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
All right, well, RobÖ

45:05.320 --> 45:06.600
It depends how theyíll do it.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.080
Rob D., anything else on your mind?

45:08.080 --> 45:09.080
No, thatís about it.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.080
Iíll let you guys take some more calls.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.080
All right, sounds good.

45:11.080 --> 45:14.120
Iíll give your podcast a cheap plug over on AllGames.com.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.320
You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
Five times a week?

45:17.320 --> 45:18.320
Yeah, itís a lot of fun.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.320
All right.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
Monday to Friday.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.320
Itís so much fun.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.320
All right.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.320
Yeah, thanks a lot.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.320
See you guys later.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.320
No problem.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.320
See you.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.320
Letís go to another call.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.320
Weíll take this call here.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.360
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.360
Whoís this?

45:32.360 --> 45:33.360
Itís Raven Stoffman!

45:33.360 --> 45:34.360
Ah!

45:34.360 --> 45:35.360
What do you want?

45:35.360 --> 45:36.360
Iím sorry.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.400
Iím just so excited tonight.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.080
Why is that?

45:40.080 --> 45:41.720
Because you picked up my call.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.040
Well, here you are.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.880
You get in almost every week you call.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.520
Very rare do you not seem to get in.

45:48.520 --> 45:49.800
We have to be ultra busy.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.520
Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, thereís

45:52.520 --> 45:53.520
not a lot of folks calling in.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.600
So, here you go.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.280
The phones are dead except for you right now.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.680
I think weíve got all the other calls.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.920
So, whatís on your mind?

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
Whatís on my mind?

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
Yeah.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.920
Oh, what was?

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
Okay.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.840
Sam and Max is on my mind, Culture Shock and all the rest.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.320
This last season is coming out this month and Iím so sad.

46:11.320 --> 46:12.320
Have you been playing Sam and Max?

46:12.320 --> 46:14.160
I didnít realize youíve been playing Sam and Max.

46:14.160 --> 46:18.200
Oh, Iíve been playing Sam and Max since it first came out.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.720
How is it for those folks that havenít really been playing the series?

46:21.720 --> 46:26.320
Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?

46:26.320 --> 46:30.560
Dude, you should be playing this game because itís kind of like a text adventure and you

46:30.560 --> 46:34.520
go around places and the characters are so lovable.

46:34.520 --> 46:37.920
If Sam is so funny, weíll go like, ìHoly fish, based on a dance talker.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.920
Weíre on it, chief.î And he will hang up the phones like, ìWhatís wrong, sap?

46:42.920 --> 46:44.800
We have to sabotage the president.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.560
Heís doing something wrong.î And it has like funny dialogue.

46:48.560 --> 46:52.880
And you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things, itís a text adventure

46:52.880 --> 46:53.880
game.

46:53.880 --> 46:59.440
I know you say youíre sad because the series is ending and I think weíve all heard, you

46:59.440 --> 47:01.400
know, the last episode for now is coming out.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.500
But donít you think that the series has been popular enough that we havenít seen the end

47:04.500 --> 47:06.240
of it yet?

47:06.240 --> 47:12.720
I think season two has got to be imminent, but I donít know when.

47:12.720 --> 47:18.560
Well, I guess thatís true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live?

47:18.560 --> 47:20.680
Oh, I hope so.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.080
Iím heavily addicted to this game now.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.980
Would you play through it again if it came out on Xbox Live or Wii or anything like that?

47:26.980 --> 47:33.200
I think I would, but it wouldnít be enjoyable unless they had like something new in it.

47:33.200 --> 47:36.120
Anything else youíve been playing this week?

47:36.120 --> 47:37.440
Did you talk about Phoenix Wright?

47:37.440 --> 47:40.480
My computer overheated if you talked about it.

47:40.480 --> 47:43.720
We did mention at the end of part A in our last caller just mentioned Phoenix Wright.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.240
Are you a Phoenix Wright fan?

47:45.240 --> 47:51.560
Oh my God, I was just running around just screaming my head off going like, ìItís

47:51.560 --> 47:52.560
Phoenix Wright 3!

47:52.560 --> 47:57.240
Theyíre finally going to bring it out!î I was like, ìHoly shit, I hope it comes out

47:57.240 --> 48:02.640
soon because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All,î Iíve been just

48:02.640 --> 48:05.640
going just itching for another one.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.400
Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark because it seems like theyíre

48:08.400 --> 48:10.000
really starting to crank these out?

48:10.000 --> 48:13.320
Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.

48:13.320 --> 48:16.760
If it comes out tomorrow, Iím there.

48:16.760 --> 48:21.840
The Rob Dís in chat says, ìI could envision Ravenstaufen seeing the news, getting up screaming

48:21.840 --> 48:25.200
and running around.î Do you have a video on YouTube of this?

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
I should.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
Thatís what you should do.

48:27.200 --> 48:32.200
I should just go, ìOh my God, itís Phoenix Wright!î I should put it in the alt key.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.200
Exactly.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.120
All right, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaufen?

48:36.120 --> 48:39.960
One more thing, as usual.

48:39.960 --> 48:45.440
I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.160
Through the Skype line or through that other service?

48:48.160 --> 48:52.720
No, no, no, all live through the Skype line.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.800
Did somebody patch the show into you or something?

48:54.800 --> 48:55.840
No, no.

48:55.840 --> 48:58.640
I actually did something ingenious if you have time.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.720
Just give me one minute to tell me, to tell you.

49:01.720 --> 49:02.720
Okay.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.920
You got me curious, what is up?

49:05.920 --> 49:06.920
Okay.

49:06.920 --> 49:13.400
My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone and Rob D showed

49:13.400 --> 49:19.120
me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer, and that

49:19.120 --> 49:21.320
works great and I can hear you.

49:21.320 --> 49:26.840
While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.

49:26.840 --> 49:32.120
So, you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.480
No, I called my cell phone.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.480
Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
Oh, my gosh.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
Wow, that's hardcore, Ravenstaufen.

49:38.480 --> 49:44.440
He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically

49:44.440 --> 49:45.440
pick up.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.440
I think I get it now.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.440
Mm-hmm.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.800
But that's pretty hardcore.

49:49.800 --> 49:50.800
You're pretty hardcore.

49:50.800 --> 49:51.800
A big nerd.

49:51.800 --> 49:52.800
Yeah, a big nerd.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.000
Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Well, thank you.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
You're taking us to compliment.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
But you're crazy.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
You do know this.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.640
I know this, but that's okay.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.920
All right, Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.920
Take more calls.

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
That is fine.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.920
Bye.

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
Enjoy.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.280
Hopefully, they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for

50:08.280 --> 50:10.280
all the calls they're making.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.280
Okay.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.280
All right.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.280
Let's go to another call.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.280
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
Who's this?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.280
Hello, all you happy people.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.160
Hey, I can barely hear you.

50:20.160 --> 50:21.160
Get a little closer to your mic.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.160
Try again.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.160
Hello, all you happy people.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.160
Hey, who's this?

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
This is Dark Knight.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.160
Hey, Dark Knight.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.160
What's on your mind, buddy?

50:28.160 --> 50:29.160
Nothing much.

50:29.160 --> 50:35.880
Just hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just make me not convinced to still

50:35.880 --> 50:36.880
not get one.

50:36.880 --> 50:39.680
So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?

50:39.680 --> 50:42.440
I am not a next gen owner at all.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.440
At all.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.640
You're still in the ancient times.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.640
Well, not really.

50:46.640 --> 50:50.560
I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.

50:50.560 --> 50:54.800
The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.

50:54.800 --> 50:58.320
Do you play handhelds at all?

50:58.320 --> 51:00.320
I still own a DS.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
It's the only thing I got.

51:02.320 --> 51:08.520
DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.

51:08.520 --> 51:13.160
Do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?

51:13.160 --> 51:17.160
Thinking about it a while back, but like I said, hearing the brick situation and everything

51:17.160 --> 51:20.640
just makes me cut and change my mind every time.

51:20.640 --> 51:26.840
It is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.360
I always said, oh, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
their consoles back.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.960
You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.840
Then it did happen to me, and I remember ranting about it on the show.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.040
I got a brick 360 back in February.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.720
My first 360 bricked after like a week.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.800
I was so pissed.

51:43.800 --> 51:50.200
It's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation, you know what I mean?

51:50.200 --> 51:54.000
Especially now they want to charge you their beer.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
What's that?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.320
I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.

51:56.320 --> 52:00.160
As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
Gates got this name.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.040
There ain't nothing wrong with it.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.520
Yet the darn thing is still bricked, I don't know.

52:07.520 --> 52:08.520
It happens a lot.

52:08.520 --> 52:09.520
Well, I don't know.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.520
I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird.

52:13.520 --> 52:18.500
People don't just show up out of the woodwork, suddenly a handful of people all have their

52:18.500 --> 52:21.280
consoles go kaput at the same time because of Guitar Hero.

52:21.280 --> 52:25.000
But I would think that Microsoft has this stuff trended, and if something's going on,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.120
you're going to hear something about it on Monday.

52:27.120 --> 52:31.280
I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Fantasy Star University

52:31.280 --> 52:35.440
and hearing people say, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, every

52:35.440 --> 52:36.440
20 minutes.

52:36.440 --> 52:40.280
Speaking of which, you're still following Fantasy Star Universe, right?

52:40.280 --> 52:41.280
Yes.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
What news is going on over there?

52:42.280 --> 52:45.860
Because I kind of abandoned the game, but I know it's still going strong.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.360
What's up with Fantasy Star Universe?

52:48.360 --> 52:50.520
Right now, it's leveled off.

52:50.520 --> 52:57.160
Not much hacking going on anymore, just basically money problems in the game and whatnot, plus

52:57.160 --> 52:59.960
they updated the lobby again recently.

52:59.960 --> 53:03.800
Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you've visited all the planets

53:03.800 --> 53:06.160
and do all those basic quests?

53:06.160 --> 53:09.360
Yes, we're doing S2 missions now.

53:09.360 --> 53:15.320
Most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot, like some areas where

53:15.320 --> 53:19.880
they get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.

53:19.880 --> 53:20.880
What else then?

53:20.880 --> 53:25.560
We've got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops, that's all.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.560
Sounds pretty cool.

53:26.560 --> 53:27.560
All right, Wayne.

53:27.560 --> 53:28.560
Yes?

53:28.560 --> 53:32.560
Then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.620
Oh, that's right.

53:33.620 --> 53:34.840
There's that expansion pack coming out.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.960
When's that supposed to be released?

53:36.960 --> 53:39.880
Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the US might

53:39.880 --> 53:40.880
see it in December.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.360
I guess that's better than never.

53:43.360 --> 53:44.360
Yes.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.960
I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.

53:46.960 --> 53:51.400
So far, from what inside information I got from one of the chat regulars here, it looks

53:51.400 --> 53:54.240
pretty interesting with the expansion.

53:54.240 --> 53:57.960
Well, spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
Make it so.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.400
We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.

54:01.400 --> 54:03.600
I'm doing it enough times as it is.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.600
All right.

54:04.600 --> 54:05.600
We appreciate it.

54:05.600 --> 54:06.600
All right.

54:06.600 --> 54:07.600
Thanks so much for the call.

54:07.600 --> 54:08.600
We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.

54:08.600 --> 54:09.600
No problem.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.600
You too.

54:10.600 --> 54:11.600
All right.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.320
Thank you so much for the call and in chat seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight

54:14.320 --> 54:15.320
on the phone.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.320
Oh, man.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.320
I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.040
I'd be a little scared too.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.040
Hi.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.040
Who's this?

54:23.040 --> 54:24.040
Hi.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.040
My name's Billy.

54:26.040 --> 54:28.360
Hi, Billy.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.360
How old are you, Billy?

54:30.360 --> 54:32.560
I'm eight.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.080
You're eight, huh?

54:34.080 --> 54:38.000
And what are you doing listening to this program?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.840
My daddy said I could.

54:39.840 --> 54:41.240
Your daddy said you could, huh?

54:41.240 --> 54:44.280
Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?

54:44.280 --> 54:45.720
Yeah.

54:45.720 --> 54:50.600
What kind of video games do you play, Billy?

54:50.600 --> 54:52.120
The Mario one.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.480
You play the Mario one?

54:53.480 --> 54:56.880
Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.880
Which Mario game is your favorite?

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
The one on the Wii.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.240
The one on the Wii?

55:00.240 --> 55:06.400
You play Super Paper Mario or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?

55:06.400 --> 55:10.640
I don't know what the virtual console is.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.360
You don't know what a virtual console is?

55:13.360 --> 55:14.360
No.

55:14.360 --> 55:15.360
Okay.

55:15.360 --> 55:21.280
Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?

55:21.280 --> 55:27.920
My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with a guitar hero thing.

55:27.920 --> 55:37.480
It didn't work and he threw it out the window and I don't know what to do.

55:37.480 --> 55:44.840
Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window or did he throw the guitar out the window?

55:44.840 --> 55:48.080
I think the Xbox.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.680
He threw the entire Xbox out the window?

55:50.680 --> 55:51.920
Yeah.

55:51.920 --> 55:56.120
Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?

55:56.120 --> 55:59.640
I think he hit a kitten.

55:59.640 --> 56:00.640
Really?

56:00.640 --> 56:01.640
Yeah.

56:01.640 --> 56:03.840
There was a flat sound.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.560
That's sad.

56:05.560 --> 56:09.080
Nobody likes a flat pussy.

56:09.080 --> 56:12.080
I don't know what to ask this kid.

56:12.080 --> 56:16.000
So why are you calling us to tell us your dad is throwing things at the neighborhood

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
animals?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.160
Shouldn't you call the cops if it's that concerning?

56:19.160 --> 56:26.920
Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.040
What do you want us to do to help?

56:28.040 --> 56:30.720
Loki, they think it's you calling him, by the way, but you're right here, right?

56:30.720 --> 56:31.720
I'm not calling him.

56:31.720 --> 56:32.720
He's right here.

56:32.720 --> 56:33.720
He's right there.

56:33.720 --> 56:34.720
My voice does not sound like that.

56:34.720 --> 56:41.520
My dad, my daddy, thinks Loki's stupid.

56:41.520 --> 56:45.120
Why is Loki stupid?

56:45.120 --> 56:48.840
Because my daddy loves Max.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.680
Your daddy loves men?

56:50.680 --> 56:52.040
No, Max.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.040
Oh, Max.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.880
Oh, your daddy loves Max.

56:54.880 --> 56:55.880
Okay.

56:55.880 --> 56:56.880
No.

56:56.880 --> 56:57.880
That's true.

56:57.880 --> 56:58.880
My daddy said that.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.720
No, my daddy is not like you, Sky.

57:01.720 --> 57:02.720
Oh, okay.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.040
Oh, you know what that is at eight years old.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
I see.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
You're very perceptive for eight.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.040
Are you a Mensa member, Billy?

57:08.040 --> 57:09.040
No.

57:09.040 --> 57:10.040
What's a Mensa?

57:10.040 --> 57:11.040
Don't worry.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
It's nothing.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.800
It's a club for smart people.

57:13.800 --> 57:15.080
It's nothing like Menzies.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.520
That's all you need to know.

57:17.520 --> 57:21.120
So what else are we going to ask this kid about?

57:21.120 --> 57:26.840
Oh, don't even go there, Dark Soccer.

57:26.840 --> 57:27.840
So well, since we're babysitting-

57:27.840 --> 57:28.840
Baby's cool.

57:28.840 --> 57:29.840
What?

57:29.840 --> 57:32.520
Dark Soccer is cool.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
Actually if you meet her-

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
Well, that-

57:34.520 --> 57:35.520
She's a real bitch, but-

57:35.520 --> 57:38.520
That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.

57:38.520 --> 57:39.520
Hey!

57:39.520 --> 57:41.520
I'm great.

57:41.520 --> 57:42.520
Okay.

57:42.520 --> 57:46.160
Let's see.

57:46.160 --> 57:50.040
I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain

57:50.040 --> 57:52.760
you?

57:52.760 --> 57:55.800
Can we watch The Lion King?

57:55.800 --> 57:56.800
Sure you can.

57:56.800 --> 57:57.800
Yes.

57:57.800 --> 58:02.440
We'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.

58:02.440 --> 58:07.040
I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.040
It's the circle of life.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.920
I'm scared.

58:11.920 --> 58:16.320
I think I'm going to hang up now.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.320
All right.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.320
You do that.

58:18.320 --> 58:19.320
Okay.

58:19.320 --> 58:20.320
Bye.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
All right.

58:21.320 --> 58:22.320
Thank you.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.320
Bye.

58:23.320 --> 58:26.880
Which number of callers was that crank calling us?

58:26.880 --> 58:28.720
Do you think that was DMN or-

58:28.720 --> 58:29.720
I can't say.

58:29.720 --> 58:31.920
They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.

58:31.920 --> 58:35.840
So whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.840
You know who that was, DarkSakura?

58:37.840 --> 58:39.960
You're a jerk.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.240
Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us through his magic-

58:42.240 --> 58:43.240
Excuse me.

58:43.240 --> 58:47.920
I was here with the microphone set down looking at fucking Caturday pictures.

58:47.920 --> 58:48.920
Telepathy.

58:48.920 --> 58:49.920
Hi.

58:49.920 --> 58:50.920
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
Who's this?

58:51.920 --> 58:52.920
Uh-oh.

58:52.920 --> 58:53.960
Call dropped.

58:53.960 --> 58:54.960
Try again.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.720
1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.920
You can always call us on Skype.

58:57.920 --> 59:02.040
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

59:02.040 --> 59:05.720
Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?

59:05.720 --> 59:10.760
I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
now.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.240
DidYouLoseASock says, Who was it?

59:13.240 --> 59:14.240
That was funny.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.240
Let's see.

59:15.240 --> 59:20.440
GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.

59:20.440 --> 59:24.120
GamingNerd says, Sky loves swearing to eight-year-olds.

59:24.120 --> 59:27.860
Misty says, If we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch a

59:27.860 --> 59:28.860
bitch about that makeup.

59:28.860 --> 59:32.600
Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.

59:32.600 --> 59:33.600
Hi.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.600
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:34.600 --> 59:35.600
Who's this?

59:35.600 --> 59:36.600
It's Zappi.

59:36.600 --> 59:37.600
Hey, our match game champion.

59:37.600 --> 59:38.600
Zappi, what's on your mind?

59:38.600 --> 59:42.400
Well, since you brought Pop Pury up, you brought this upon yourself.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.600
How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?

59:45.600 --> 59:50.080
It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.080
What happened?

59:51.080 --> 59:54.720
Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.

59:54.720 --> 59:56.280
Oh, I didn't have no idea.

59:56.280 --> 59:58.080
I didn't really mean to be an asshole.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.080
No, it's okay.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.560
Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.800
No, it's My Computer's Dying.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.920
Aww.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.040
The Vio is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.940
Do you want me to find it and burn it into a DVD for you?

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.840
I do not burn it into a Divix or X-video format.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.840
I need MPEGs.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.880
I don't know how to do that.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.320
I don't want it burned as a DVD-playing file.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.280
I want it as just data without extra crap on it.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280
I think I can do that.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280
I don't know.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280
Okay, MPEG.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280
MPEG is the winner.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280
I'll try.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280
All right.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280
Did you at least get to see last week's?

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280
No, I didn't.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
Oh, you're behind on the whole season.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
Yes.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280
But think of it.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.000
You'll get to have a whole marathon day.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.920
Oh, I can see anger rising here in the Orange Lawns radio room.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.280
Good job, Zappi, getting us all mad.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.400
No, I'm just kidding.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.880
What games have you been playing this week, Zappi?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.240
Not since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240
You broke your PSP?

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.240
Yeah.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.640
How'd you do that?

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.040
I dropped my laptop on the screen.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040
Ouch.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.040
So, what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.800
I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh, that's great.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.120
What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.680
Call of Duty and Ratchet and Clank.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.960
A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.880
I actually like it.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.920
What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.520
There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
There's a...

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.520
Let's name that stealth game.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.800
It completely slipped my mind.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.720
Not Metal Gear Solid, but...

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720
Subsistence?

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
No.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
Oh, wait.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
No, duh.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.720
Is that what?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720
Acid?

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.680
What was the other Metal Gear one?

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680
It's not Metal Gear.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:54.160
It's the number one that's on the PlayStation platform.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.600
It starts with an S. A Cyclone Filter.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.720
Oh, okay.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.120
That's a pretty good one.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
Cool.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.920
Also, there's Daxter.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920
That's good.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.920
All right.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920
There's some good...

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.920
Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920
Uh, no.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920
I'm not really...

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.360
Rondo of Blood!

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.600
Two people in chat room did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.600
so there you go.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.200
And why is he giving us the mandatory Rondo of Blood?

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200
So there you go.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200
All right.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.160
Well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, Dark

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160
Sakura.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.160
I do my best.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.160
All right.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.160
Take care, buddy.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160
All right.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160
Bye-bye.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.480
See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480
He should do that for you.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.440
Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.960
It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on...

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.320
I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.060
had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.600
his laptop.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.160
And so since then, I've actually had a problem with the Divix stuff, so...

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160
All right.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160
One more call.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
Hi.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
You're on Orange Lawn.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160
I'll show you.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160
Who's this?

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.160
This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.160
Hey!

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.160
DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.160
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160
Nothing much, man.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160
This is my first time calling.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.400
I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
time.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.680
I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.680
so...

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
Wow.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680
Congratulations.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680
Jeez.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
You've been listening for three years, and you've never gotten on the show.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.120
Well, there you go.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120
What the hell?

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120
Our line doesn't get hammered that much.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.120
Well, that's all right.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.920
Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.600
What did you want to talk to us about tonight?

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.160
Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo...

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.520
How Nintendo's delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.840
Of course, yeah.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.800
Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.720
blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues,

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.360
because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on,

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.160
whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony, regarding to all these

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
delays.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160
That's IBM.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:15.400
I'm not sure if you guys know this, but IBM is really the main supplier for the chipsets

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.920
for all three of the next-gen systems, and because of their chips that is all based on

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.360
the PowerPC model, in effect, they're all kind of borrowing from one another, and all

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.760
the chipsets are all coming from out of the same factory, and so in a way, any of the

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.920
shipment problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.600
get out enough chips, and it happened before with, but I'm not sure if you know that

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.680
Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.240
That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips, and Apple was like, well,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.240
fuck you guys.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.720
You can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel, and now you kind of see

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.680
the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.400
You know, that's an interesting point, because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.920
companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.960
that go into the system, and for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.080
delays previously, was that there was like a component?

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.280
I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip, but I noticed one of these systems got

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.920
so slowed down, because the factory couldn't produce enough of it, unless it was 360 last

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920
year.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.920
It was the PlayStation 3, and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really IBM's fault

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920
either.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.080
It's the fact that Nintendo's retarded, and it only has one factory building these

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.080
fucking systems, instead of like four factories, or even more building systems.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.120
That's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.600
right now, despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.840
It's because they're retarded still, and they only have one factory producing them, despite

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.760
the fact that most of the components in it were stuff that was in the GameCube, and that

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.200
they should have tons of, and should be really easy to manufacture.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200
Yeah, but one-

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.200
That's a good point.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.200
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.320
I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as getting enough factories out

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.920
there to make these damn systems, but I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:13.640
at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles,

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.240
you kind of have to look at it this way.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.880
IBM only has one factory, too, so in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880
in this situation?

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:29.360
All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the whole overall picture.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.600
There's no winners.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:37.680
The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wiis, because

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.960
Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360, so they're just

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.200
going to pretty much switch from making 360s into Wiis, because it's all third-party factories

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200
anyways.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.800
So that's the rumor, at least.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.840
Hopefully that's actually the case, and they're not actually just sandbagging all this stuff

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840
until Christmas.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.120
Well, we could only hope, man.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.080
You know what, though?

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.600
Do you have your Wii, DJ Kibbles and Bitch?

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600
Yeah.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.560
Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.560
Exactly.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560
You know what?

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.880
That's my thoughts now, is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880
the system.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880
You know what?

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.360
Who cares if there are shortages?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.360
It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360
and wait.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.360
But you know what?

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.360
I agree.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.000
You know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.480
this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June, well, it sucks to be you

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.680
if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get a console, you know, you don't get

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.000
the free internet browser or whatever, you know?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.320
It would suck.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.880
Yeah, you know, I mean, at the same time, though, when you are an early adopter, you

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:45.000
do kind of get fucked over later on in the case of, like, the 360 Elite bullshit that's

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
going down.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
True.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Or the Red Rings of Death.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.600
We did get to play our systems a year in advance, but, you know, look at the other end of things

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600
too.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.360
So, whatever, it's a catch-22 at the end of the day.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.240
Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240
on my 360.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.840
Until they sell porn.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.440
Good point.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.760
Oh, God, please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760
HD porn!

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.080
Oh, my God, sales of 360 would go through the roof, seriously, they would whoop the

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.080
Wii's ass.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:19.200
I mean, I think about, you know, dads across America going to buy a system for their children.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.520
Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.840
fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high death!

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
Porn wins, always.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.360
Well, Viance, PlayZ3 makes that the easiest, since you can put, like, video files on there

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.640
pretty simple.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.440
Baby formula, or wow epic mount?

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.000
Baby formula, wow epic mount, I just can't choose.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.560
DJ Kibbles N Bits, really good first call, really good point.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.400
Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.920
Oh, no, that's it, man, that's it.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.920
It's a pleasure, it's a pleasure.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.120
Well, no problem, thanks so much for calling, any time, call back.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.520
All right, take care, guys.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520
Later!

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.760
All right, well, that was a good Skype line tonight, lots of people we got to hear from

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:09.840
there, and of course our chat room going along there, let's see, I think they're talking

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.600
about Doctor Who now.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.480
Dark Sakura, is there a Doctor Who debate?

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
Ignoring.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480
Ignoring?

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480
I see.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.480
I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but...

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480
Exterminate!

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.120
Legend of Zaku says, remember this lesson in life, when trying to get a Wii, there will

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.600
always be at least 10 diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.600
that sells it.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.200
eBay profiteers.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.960
Have a special place in hell waiting for them.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.400
All right, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.600
Yes, but Loki can go first.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600
All right.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600
Okay.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.800
Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.320
One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.600
voice chat.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
Not true.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.960
Let's see here.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:03.160
Dark Alex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160
So that's pretty awesome.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.120
Get the run homebrew and the latest games.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:14.320
There's a rumor that Dragon Ball Online, Xbox 360 edition is coming, and I don't know, I

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:21.680
guess they're basing that off of a posting for job opening on Game Job, and I don't know,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.400
that's kind of interesting I guess.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:31.000
Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller, looks like a 360 controller, don't care.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.200
Virtual consoles for Monday, apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.880
Revenge.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.320
So that would be kind of neat for the US.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320
Where's my Actraiser?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.520
Well it doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.960
There's a new game coming to the Playstation Network that looks exactly like, I cannot

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:56.480
remember the damn name, it's on the 360, whatever, what do you think?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480
What that game is?

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.080
Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080
I don't know.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.440
No, it looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.440
Boom Boom Rocket?

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.440
It's not Boom Boom Rocket.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440
Geometry Wars?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440
I don't know.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440
No, not Geometry Wars, the other one.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.000
Like, Mutant Storm Reloaded, that's what it was.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.600
Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:23.440
For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source, for the Half-Life engine, who

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:31.800
cares, and, oh, this is stupid, Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.800
Makes me want to paint.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.320
Was it spray painted red?

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.120
Yes, it was, more or less.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120
People are retarded.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.680
And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.160
Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the Playstation.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.360
So I hope that is true.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.120
Alright.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:04.640
Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend, Brad, from

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.640
PodCulture.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.280
Yay, Brad.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.840
This is, it's not really news, but it's something that's really cool.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.880
It's from Tech Blog, sorry, I should say Tech e-blog, I should say.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.800
The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:27.960
Number ten is the Cliccovision Portable, the NES station, which is basically a Nintendo

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.160
don't have to look like a PS2, just a mod.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:43.560
There's the N-Pod, which is a, it runs NES games, it's interesting, it actually looks

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.440
kind of cool, I want one.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.720
There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a nomad,

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.960
and then attached a CD player to it.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:02.360
The GameCube ToGo, which, yeah, whatever, that one's kind of bizarre, but neat at the

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
same time.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.360
The NES Plus Sega, that's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.000
The handheld Atari Jaguar, next!

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.660
Only good game on that was Tempest.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:19.120
Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, yeah, whatever.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.200
Dreamcast Portable, that's kind of cool, and PlayStation 2 Portable.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:30.080
I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.080
He brought it over, it worked, it was pretty cool, I think that this is cool, I still want

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080
a game axe.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080
A what?

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080
A game axe.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.080
What the hell is that?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.140
Let me find a picture of it.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.160
It's another handheld, chopped up system.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.160
But there's no time!

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160
That was it!

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160
We're out of stories!

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160
We're out of steam!

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160
We're out of time!

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.240
So that's it, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.240
Was that your last story?

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.240
I'm sorry.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:14:00.040
Okay, I'm trying to pull up the thing, it's a portable NES player.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.720
End game gear.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720
And stuff.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.720
Anyway.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.720
Rob!

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.720
Rob.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.720
Let's go around and get everyone's...

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.720
Rob.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.720
What?

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.720
Rob.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720
I will kill you.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.080
Can I have a cheeseburger, please?

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.560
That's it, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.360
Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.360
What's that?

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360
Tuesday.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Yeah?

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.360
I have class.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.440
No pump on the volume.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.680
There may not be guys on a show Wednesday, because of my trips, so it's going to be a

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.840
very quiet week on Orange Laundrio, but at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.840
live this week.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.160
And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160
Interesting.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160
Yeah.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160
Alright.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.920
Also, next week's show should be very interesting, because Dark Soccer and I will be at Disneyland

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.360
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or not Sunday, we're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360
Thursday.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360
On Sunday.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360
Yeah, anyway.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.360
Too confusing.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.000
So we'll be pulling into town just when the show's about to start, so next week could

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.320
very well be the Loki show, with hilarious commentary from Dark Soccer and Sky, so won't

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.320
that be fun, Loki?

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320
Yeah.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320
Still think Loki should come with us.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320
I know.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320
I wish Loki would come with us.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.320
Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.320
No.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320
You make me sad.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320
Don't you want to ride a, you know, Rockin' California Screamin'?

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320
No.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320
Alright.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320
I know.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320
He's so boring.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.040
He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040
Guess I can't say I blame him.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040
Play games.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040
Alright.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.640
Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.640
Loki, your final thought.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.480
Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.880
2 on Blade Season 2.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.120
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.120
I have the best wallpaper ever, and I just posted links to it in the chatroom.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.160
My final thought is penguins.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.800
And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800
You're a dick.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800
That's it.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.640
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.080

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.280
You guys are what motivates us to do Orange Launch Radio here every week for free.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.200

all that shit helps too.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880
We really appreciate it.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880
Have a great week.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:41.440
