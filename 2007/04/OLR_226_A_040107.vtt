00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight April 1st, 2007

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
It's no joke that Sonic and Mario are teaming up for an Olympic game

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
The Xbox 360 Elite gets officially unveiled

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
When we talk about who is already upset with the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
No really this time of Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that internet podcast dedicated to video game culture

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
The gaming lifestyle and what you the gamer really want to know about

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yo

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How you doing Jamie?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
My nose is full of goo

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Gross

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Also joining us tonight say hello to Tech Master Loki

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hello

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
How you doing Loki?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm doing good

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Alright we have some special guests in the studio tonight

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
They helped us out with our little April Fools joke tonight

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
If you didn't check it out the reason why you may not have gotten it

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Is because we are going to push the April Fools joke show

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Right around the same time we push out this show

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
So iTunes may not catch it but we wanted to build it that way

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
So that you know those folks that want to skip through the April Fools joke

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Cause you know April Fools is lame or whatever can do that

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
But those that want to hear what a really funny job Chris and Megsy

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And well myself and everybody else did with that can hear it

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So there you have it Chris is here tonight everybody

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Hi Rob

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And she is a lesbian but not the giggling type

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
No I'm not

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Well once in a while if I tell a funny joke she might giggle

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah laugh like a hyena is more like it

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Alright and joining us all the way from Wisconsin say hello to Megsy

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Hi

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
How you doing Megsy?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm okay

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Thanks for your help with the show earlier appreciate it

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh hi

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Hi

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something so

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah I'm looking at porn

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Hot are you down low on lesbian porn on my Mac?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hells yeah

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hot right

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Well anyway again you know our April Fools joke was all in good fun

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
If you don't know what it is yet go back in the podcast archive and check it out

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Just a little bit of a disclaimer first though

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Because we want to say that it is April Fools day today

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
So we've been trying to be very careful in what stories we picked out tonight

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We didn't take any extra submissions for our show roll after last night

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And we're not going to be accepting any last minute submissions through our chat room today

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
As we usually do just because we're going to try to keep it as legitimate as possible

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
First off also we did our gaming weeks in the previous show

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But I want to see if anybody wanted to expand on that

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Because I know we were being a little silly in the April Fools show

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Does anybody have anything they want to say in their gaming week that they didn't say in the previous show?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I really didn't get a pin bot

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Aww I'm sorry to hear pin bot sounds awesome though

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I know I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You know you weren't here last week we missed you

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I had the plague, the disease

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And I totally thought of you and I wish I could have stole it for you

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I has played one

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
At California Extreme or whatever they call it?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yep

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I want to go to that this year sounds hot

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
It was great

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Anything you wanted to add Loki?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
It's kind of cool

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
It's like a shoot em up game I guess

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't know

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
But it's fun we're checking it out it's a free download

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So if you want the link to it check that out

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
But you got to be a friend

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
community.allgames.com

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You got to be one of my friends and I'll be able to get the link

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
So there you go

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
There's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
So you should check it out

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's just an awesome game

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That's all I meant

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Of course

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Alright

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
My gaming week what I really played

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
But with a listener of the program not a stupid boy

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
We were cracking each other up

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But I also played a lot of Castlevania 70 of the night

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Just trying to make my way through that

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Which of course I love

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
You know what I surprisingly liked a lot though

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Is Jetpack Refueled I didn't think I'd like this game

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Because I thought it looked a little cheesy

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
But I think that's kind of why I like it

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Is because it really does remind me of

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You know an old Commodore 64 type game

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Which you know well it kind of was

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So but it's the type of game I totally grew up on

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And they really did give it an overhaul

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
For Xbox 360

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
You know it's only five bucks

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I think it's a good like

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Like an 80's arcade type game

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
It's just that instead of getting the same old

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Root Beer Tapper, Joust those type of games

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It's like something you may not have played before

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
And it's kind of fun

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet though

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But for five bucks honestly so far

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
It's not a bad deal

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
And I apologize about my voice

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And to the chatters in our chat room

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
At chat.orangelandradio.com

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Who say I still sound like a woman

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
From the previous show

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Screw you I have no voice left

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
From yelling a lot last night

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I was at Rocky Horror MCing

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
So I have like no voice

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I've been drinking hot tea all night

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
To try and make myself feel better

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Chris is amazing

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh I'm sorry Tetris Evolution

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I also bought

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And hey it's Tetris

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
$30 not a bad deal

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Pretty easy achievement points

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
All things considered

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Online play is like you remember it

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
On the Game Boy version

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
But

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I don't know why they didn't do it as an

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Xbox Live Arcade title

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I don't know I think a lot of people are going to be wondering that

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Because yes you can have videos

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And they're high def pretty videos

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You can't randomize them which is kind of weird

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
And they do have music included

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
But I've actually found the way I enjoy listening

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
To the game is I use the

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
XB stream program to grab

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Podcasts and I'll play Tetris while

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
As a podcast like I don't know

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Either you know our show if I want to

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Nelson or something you know

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And it's kind of fun so

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah $30 not a bad deal but I think it'll be

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
In your bargain bin soon

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Chris make see anything you guys want to add

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I've played Animal Crossing

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Animal Crossing on DS? Yeah on the plane

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
On the plane how was that we can't you didn't use the

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Wi-Fi though on the plane did you? Of course not

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
No but I haven't played for like

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Three months and everybody in my village was like

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Bitch I invited you to tea like

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Five months ago

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And I'm like I'm sorry and there was like

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
A gajillion weeds and I had a bunch of

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Mail and it was a mess but I cleaned it up

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
All the way from Madison to

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Here

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It would be that long to clean up your village

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Kind of and then make everybody not mad at me

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Anymore

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Alright well good times

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I wonder if there's like a still

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I guess there probably still is a real active

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Animal Crossing community online cause I was thinking

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Wow if I just got the game now like most people

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I know quit playing that a long time ago

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So there would be nobody left to visit my village

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But I guess there's still a pretty active

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Community online somewhere huh

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Chris anything you want to add

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Well I actually really did play

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
World of Warcraft cause it's the only game

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Fuck you

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I had to spend a lot of time waiting

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
For Meg Z to get here so I did that by playing

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Wow although I did it more as an experiment

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I have found if you go to any of the major

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Areas where there are lots of people in traffic

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And you have a girl character

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And you start making her dance

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Watch how many guys

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Decide to join in it's very

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Funny it doesn't even matter

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Not when you're a tauren I'm finding out

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Cause nobody wants to dance with a cow

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I like to dance with a cow

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It works well with the elves and sometimes

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The humans just cause there's a lot of traffic

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It is

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Especially when you're sitting there knowing wow these guys have no clue

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah really

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Like some guy asked me ASL and I said

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Mail

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I said mail 42 Arizona

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And he walked away

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Awesome

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It was very funny

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
He's in our chat saying I'm going to make a draenei

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Dude the draenei chicks are hot

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
They are

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Oh my god I'd bang those if I could

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You know I might be gay and all but even I think the draenei

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Chicks are hot what can I say

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I just like their accent

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Not enough rage

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Alright so there it is conclusion of our gaming weeks

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So um

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Let's do some real brief housekeeping here

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I have to keep this a little bit vague

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We were going to say a little more about it

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
But I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Obviously it pains us

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Journalistically

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
To have to go back and remove

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Something that used to

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Be there before

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Trust me we did not enjoy doing that

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
We didn't want to do it

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
But as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We kind of had to do it

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Unfortunately Orange Lounge Radio

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Is a hobby for us

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And it doesn't pay the bills

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Push comes to shove

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Things got to change

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
We also believe in karma

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
What goes around comes around

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I think what we do here is really great

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
For the community and we give a lot of

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Publicity to a lot of

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Great up and coming games

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
We don't get paid for it

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
They don't pay for us to talk about their games

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I guess the only impression we can take away from this

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Is that

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
If a company doesn't want us to talk about their games

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I guess there's a lot of other

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Dependent games that aren't getting enough exposure

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That we should maybe be spending our time talking about

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
A little more like to Miki Fighters

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Miki Fighters

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It's fun, it's free

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It's a good price

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
We've certainly been spending a lot of time this week

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Kind of reassessing I don't want to go about doing things

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Still be the same Orange Lounge Radio

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
You know and love

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Let's get into some news

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Game Stuff have their

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Financial conference call

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I guess their investor

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Conference call

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
The COO Dan D'Amato

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I think that's how you pronounce his name

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Was talking a little bit about the crippling

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Wii shortage that's been

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Kind of happening ever since the system came out

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And particularly bad

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You know with this month

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Or I should say last month

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
March

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
He was quoted saying I don't think it's going to be

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
An issue going forward

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I think this is just my

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
This is just my opinion but I think Nintendo

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Essentially dried up the supply

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Because they made their numbers for the year

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
The new year starts April 1st

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And I think we're going to see the supply flowing

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Now

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's interesting of course

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Nintendo responded to that saying

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
No that's not true they never intended

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
For you know shortage to actually happen

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You know so on and so forth of course

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
You know my opinion on that is

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I mean if they're really drying up the

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You know the sources on purpose

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
They're not going to go yeah we're holding them back

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Because we hit our numbers for the year so

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Sorry if you can't get one

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I mean that's just going to piss people off

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So anyways

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
You know long story short

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't know you know

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
But I know that the systems haven't been in stores

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
For a long time and I know

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You know at least distribution

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
As a whole hasn't been able to

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Get a hold of them for

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
The month of March I mean they pretty much

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
You know

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Allocated everything to retail

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So what little there was in retail I don't know

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
If it's because they did it intentionally

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Or if it was just they're

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Really behind and they really

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Can't make enough you know

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Either way

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Hopefully it'll start getting better in April

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
April fools

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
No just kidding

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
What I'm wondering though is and this is something I've been kind of wondering

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
About this week is that I seem to remember

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Last year obviously Xbox 360

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Had some real shortage problems as well

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And we were pretty harsh

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
With the Xbox 360 and Microsoft

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And you know why the F aren't there more systems out there

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And blah blah blah blah

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It seems like we've been a little more forgiving

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Of Nintendo through all this and I'm trying to figure out

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Why that is is that because they just they have

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
More consoles out there on the market

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So that those of us diehards that really

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Or is that because we were smarter about it this time

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
When we all camped out and got them or whatever

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I think we were just a little bit smarter about it

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And also the fact that I mean

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
The 360

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Was like kind of the first next gen console

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So it was like something you really had to have it

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
You know a lot of times now it's like

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Well the Wii's not out oh well I'll just play my

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
360 or I'll just play my Playstation 2

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Or something like that until it comes out

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
There's really and also it'd be a little

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Different if Super Mario Galaxy

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Was out there now

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Versus you know later or Smash Brothers

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You know Brawl or something like that

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
If that stuff was out there now

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You know that'd be a little bit different but I

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I mean personally I don't

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
But to be honest Perfect Dark Zero is nothing to get that

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Excited about for me I mean and the Xbox

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Launch games were nothing like oh I gotta have it

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
True and

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I just wanted the system as a whole you know

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't know the download

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
The live I don't know I just wanted the damn thing

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
A year ago you know and I was frustrated when I couldn't

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Get one I would think it'd be pretty dumb even

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
If they are hitting their numbers to

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You know intentionally drive the market

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I don't think that's even I mean I just think

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
They just can't produce enough of these I mean

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It's even the issue with their accessories

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I mean that's kind of a good you know point right there

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
That they just don't have enough accessories

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Out there even to

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You know fill the market and you can't

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Tell me that that stuff's hard to produce

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I mean come on

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I guess I'm just wondering aloud here

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Are we being fair

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
To Nintendo like

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I mean are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
The same way

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Fuck no they should be getting more systems out there

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Some goddamn technology has been out forever

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I mean with the goddamn GameCube

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Produce more fucking systems

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And Dustcap in our chat room agrees with you

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Version 2

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
SSJ100Matt wants to know how long did the 360

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Shortage last I got mine in February

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
But I think it was May

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It was May yeah

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I work at Gamestop it lasted until about

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Mid March April

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
You could walk into a store I think I saw

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
The first available one around the end of January

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But seriously though

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
They need to get on top of

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
At least the systems out there

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I mean okay great

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
They want to keep the demand up or something like that

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I think the demand's up there

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
People want to buy this thing and if it's any

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Kind of indicator

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I mean you basically show your friends this

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Game system if they don't have it yet

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
After playing with it for a little bit

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
They're just like God I gotta get one of my own

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I would think you'd want as many systems out there

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
As possible to get as many impressions as possible

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
To sell even more systems

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Which in turn you sell more software and make more money

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So I don't think they're doing it on purpose

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And I mean

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Everyone's kind of running with this

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You know before because it was the CEO

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
It's his opinion and

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
That's it I mean it's as valid as my opinion

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
So I don't know

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
We don't know you can only speculate

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
All that matters is

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's April now more systems in stores

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Well at least

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
We do have some good news

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And this is no joke

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Nintendo and Sega

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Have both stated

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
That Miyamoto is going

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
To be part of the development

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Of Mario and Sonic

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
At the Olympic Games

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
So

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
They're actually talking specifically

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
That there are going to be

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Not just that there's a number of different titles

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
From what I'm seeing anyway

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But the game is being

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Created by Sega with work by Miyamoto

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I'm sorry

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
When it comes down to like the 500 meter dash

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Or whatever the hell it is

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Mario's a big fat plumber

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Tear his ass open

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Who lives on a diet of mushrooms

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Megsy's pointing at her shirt

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Getting upset because she's wearing flying Mario

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Okay but in defense

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The high jump and shit like that because he's got hops

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
But fucking Sonic will beat him

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Yeah

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Well Sonic can go faster

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Than the god damn speed of sound

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So there

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I think

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Mario will also have Sonic

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Beat in the ability

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
To make a good next gen

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Game competition

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But you know who will win?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Nintendo and Sega

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Because they have tricked you into

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Buying a god damn olympics game

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
If history

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Have shown you anything

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Olympics games suck

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Really bad

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
So

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Personally I don't know

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
If this gets you interested in the olympics

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Hooray I'm not falling for it

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I ain't buying this shit

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Let's see I'm looking at chat room

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Funny deal had a really quick comment on the last story

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And fans keep buying their bullshit

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Or the Nintendo 64 shortages?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
No you must be old

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
No I'm just kidding

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I wasn't really following gaming back then

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
As closely as I am now

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I mean a little bit but I was much younger

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And a lot of that didn't sink in like it does now

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Let's see

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Also moving on here

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
MooMooCannogram says

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
DarkSakura

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Y'all know that there are other characters in the game

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Well I would say yeah

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But Mario and Sonic being in the same game

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Is kind of news worthy

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
So what if there's other characters

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Just seeing Miyamoto with Sonic

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Is weird

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It doesn't matter who else is in the game

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
To some extent really

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Alright

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Well moving on to

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Something that did not turn out to be an April Fools

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Joke and I told you it wasn't

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
If you want to go back a couple weeks I said

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Look I know something you don't know

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
But this Knights thing is not bullshit

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And sure enough

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's not bullshit

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
A magazine cover was leaked out of

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I believe this is Sweden

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This games magazine

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Game Reactor put this image up on the internet

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And then of course it caught wildfire

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Of Knights but there it is

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
A world exclusive on Knights

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And I'm sure they just beat the punch

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
To some American publication

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Just going to have the same thing

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
As previously in the teaser thing

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And I was going to say there's also been screenshots out there now too

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So it looks kind of cool

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Now here's a question though

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You know Sonic games as of late

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Ever since the Dreamcast

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Have not been that great

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So is this

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Sega's chance to redeem themselves

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Or should we just

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I want another Clockwork Knights

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Dark Soccer

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I know you've been a long time Sonic fan

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
But what are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Do you think they can make a good one?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
What if it turns out

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Like Sonic on 360 and PS3

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It can't, it's on the Wii

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You think that will be it saving grace?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
WEEEEEE

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Be honest

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
It's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Control issues won't be

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That big of a problem

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I hope

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
We'll see

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Well there it is

19:11.000 --> 19:18.440
Um, not to say told you so, but, but yeah, Maisie, wait, wait, before we get to the next

19:18.440 --> 19:19.920
story, Maisie, you're squeaking over there.

19:19.920 --> 19:25.320
What I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie as a Knights fan girl, I mean, could, Sega's

19:25.320 --> 19:27.480
kind of done a lot of misfires lately.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.980
What, what's going to stop them from misfiring this one?

19:29.980 --> 19:32.560
Because it's Knights.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.240
But Sonic was cool and Sonic on PlayStation three and 360 was not fun.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.240
Okay.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.240
That's Sonic.

19:39.240 --> 19:44.280
Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
You know what?

19:45.280 --> 19:48.520
It will be, it will be good because it is Knights period.

19:48.520 --> 19:53.000
But okay, Mario is missing had Mario in it and it wasn't that much fun.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.840
Mario was missing was the shit.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
You're just easy to please.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.840
I don't know.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.400
There's no, I don't know what else to think.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.080
Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.880
I said, you have no idea.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.080
Ooh, la la.

20:08.080 --> 20:17.280
In that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it, the E3 event or E3 like

20:17.280 --> 20:22.560
event that you can go to because it's open to the public, God help us all.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.360
Um, anyways, so one reason you're probably gonna want to go there other than the fact

20:26.360 --> 20:30.320
that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to

20:30.320 --> 20:36.640
be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of, um, huge lineup.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.760
Hopefully by that time we'll see, you know, the big, you know, Super Mario Galaxy and

20:40.760 --> 20:44.680
Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.880
But um, it should be interesting.

20:46.880 --> 20:51.040
I know, especially if they're on board then, you know, it's likely other people will jump

20:51.040 --> 20:53.280
on board as well.

20:53.280 --> 20:59.920
So anyways, E for everyone or E for all, it's going to be coming October in LA, same place

20:59.920 --> 21:04.800
as the original E3 and only $100 to get in.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.040
And there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.040
Wow.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.160
That's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.480
I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.480
You know what?

21:17.480 --> 21:19.280
I have to admit I'm interested.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.040
I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.

21:22.040 --> 21:26.200
I think I'm, I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.240
200,000 people in half the exhibition space.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.240
Yeah.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.240
That's going to be very uncomfortable.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.240
I don't know.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.640
But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.640
I don't know.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.440
That is a very lofty goal, but E3 was crowded as it is.

21:39.440 --> 21:45.920
I mean, I don't know, but I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because

21:45.920 --> 21:47.600
we did not feel the love.

21:47.600 --> 21:52.000
Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some

21:52.000 --> 21:53.120
reason it didn't happen.

21:53.120 --> 21:58.840
I don't know what possibly went wrong there, but yeah, we're not going to E3.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.400
Well, I'm not, Loki's not.

22:02.400 --> 22:07.160
You know, you know, I am, you know, you know, you know, when E3 started going, going down,

22:07.160 --> 22:10.080
you know, you know, it was the mark of it, of it starting to go down because they got

22:10.080 --> 22:17.000
rid of the booth, babes, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I don't know.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.720
Going down was having to fight my way around the crowd.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.080
That's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.780
That is that's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark when Paris Hilton was getting those

22:27.780 --> 22:29.160
kinds of lines at E3.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.720
I was like, what's wrong with this picture?

22:32.720 --> 22:38.160
This is it, but the booth babes, well, there'll be booth babes at E4 all.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.160
I'm sure.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.160
There you go.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.160
Are you going to go to E4 all?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.160
Maybe.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.160
I don't know.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
I'm thinking about it.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
She says, no, I don't know.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.160
I want to know a little more about it.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.240
Like what is the, I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
the must have?

22:49.240 --> 22:50.240
Yeah.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.000
I mean, seriously, am I going to pay a hundred dollars to wait five hours to play a game?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.200
I mean, seriously, there's 200,000.

22:56.200 --> 23:02.680
If 200,000 people actually are, first of all, I don't know that that could actually work,

23:02.680 --> 23:08.920
especially with like fire codes and stuff, but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000

23:08.920 --> 23:13.760
people in there as it was last year with E3, 70,000 people, I believe.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.600
And it was fucking crowded.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.480
And now you have half the space and more than double the people.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.480
Fuck that.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.280
Uh, JVMON says 200,000 could be a typo.

23:23.280 --> 23:29.320
Maybe they meant to say 20,000, which is a bad, and that's not a bad, that's not a bad

23:29.320 --> 23:32.440
showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.

23:32.440 --> 23:36.440
You know, if they can pull off 20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
year out the gate.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.880
So, well, we'll see.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.800
Best of luck to E4ALL.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.960
And um, I think I'm going to go, I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it, but

23:44.960 --> 23:45.960
I want to go.

23:45.960 --> 23:51.280
I want to go to E3 though, but yeah, well, we don't always get what we want sadly.

23:51.280 --> 23:56.000
Like I said, you know, we give free publicity, we give free publicity to games on this show.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.180
So if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your

24:01.180 --> 24:02.880
work cut out for you, Jamie.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.240
Hey, I'm amazing.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.440
You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?

24:07.440 --> 24:09.080
Like we did last year.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.080
Chirp.

24:10.080 --> 24:14.720
So guess what's not live?

24:14.720 --> 24:15.720
Zombies.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.940
They're in Resident Evil.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.040
My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
That's okay.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.520
I'm going to.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.520
Hey.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.640
So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?

24:25.640 --> 24:31.680
It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii is going to be at 480p progressive

24:31.680 --> 24:35.000
scan 16 to 9 widescreen.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.400
Isn't that great?

24:37.400 --> 24:41.520
Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
or whatever.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.920
I mean, hooray for, you know, it doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.920
It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.

24:49.920 --> 24:55.320
There will be after the Capcom Gamers' Day thing, which was, I think, I think that's

24:55.320 --> 24:57.160
like in the next couple of weeks here.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.760
There's been mumblings that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for

25:00.760 --> 25:05.760
the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers' Day, because

25:05.760 --> 25:07.520
they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
Yeah.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.320
Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.320
That's true.

25:13.320 --> 25:17.320
All right, well, we do know some things that are coming out.

25:17.320 --> 25:22.600
Well, I guess it is still a little bit of a rumor, but these have a lot more foundation

25:22.600 --> 25:27.440
to them, and that would be Final Fight and Street Fighter II Turbo making an appearance

25:27.440 --> 25:28.560
on the Virtual Console.

25:28.560 --> 25:34.000
We know this because it has shown up on the ESRB's list of clear titles.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.240
Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter II Turbo is going to be making its way to

25:40.240 --> 25:44.720
Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter II just came out not that long ago.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.320
It's kind of like, obviously, Street Fighter II Turbo was the superior game.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.000
I don't know why anyone would want to have both.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.960
At least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between

25:54.960 --> 25:59.760
the games, but now it's kind of like, sucker.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.360
You still can't play it online, but if you want to relive it in all its Super Nintendo

26:04.360 --> 26:07.440
glory, you have that ability.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.960
Final Fight, by the way, sucked on Super Nintendo, I thought, because it-

26:10.960 --> 26:11.960
Booze!

26:11.960 --> 26:12.960
I have all those games.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.160
But it didn't have Guy in it, and yes-

26:14.160 --> 26:15.800
I have Final Fight Guy.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.960
But in Final Fight Guy, it didn't have Cody in it.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.000
It's like they just replaced the sprites or whatever.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
No they didn't.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
And there was like stages missing.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.120
He had his moves.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.320
That's why it was all about Final Fight CD.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.600
Or yeah, or just Final Fight Arcade, you know, I don't know.

26:30.600 --> 26:35.160
I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console, but these are a little

26:35.160 --> 26:40.280
more exciting, other Virtual Console releases, because Hudson updated an official list, so

26:40.280 --> 26:45.080
we know these will be happening for sure, Bonk's Revenge, which I assume comes as a

26:45.080 --> 26:48.880
surprise to no one, will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console.

26:48.880 --> 26:54.760
Also Bravo Man, Shock Man, and Battle Lode Runner, which is kind of cool, because Lode

26:54.760 --> 26:58.960
Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love, and I have to be honest, I'm

26:58.960 --> 27:02.460
not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting

27:02.460 --> 27:06.080
very excited over this game, so it must be good.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.480
You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
Do you know Battle Lode Runner?

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
I remember.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
I totally know.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Hmm.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
Interesting.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.480
Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.480
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

27:14.480 --> 27:22.560
Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week, and we've

27:22.560 --> 27:24.640
got some good stuff coming out in the US.

27:24.640 --> 27:30.960
It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2,

27:30.960 --> 27:33.720
we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.600
It's kind of a good kid's game, I guess.

27:36.600 --> 27:41.680
If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones,

27:41.680 --> 27:46.000
or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.120
I have a random question.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.080
Can you use a Karaoke Revolution mic with these games?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.080
No.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.080
Bastards.

27:52.080 --> 27:57.640
But hey, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of

27:57.640 --> 28:01.120
them, and it's the normal price of karaoke revolutions.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
Well, I know.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.160
I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but you know.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.720
Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.720
Anyways.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.480
I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
Yeah.

28:12.480 --> 28:19.040
Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that

28:19.040 --> 28:22.680
got ported over, and it's very, very cheap.

28:22.680 --> 28:29.320
Let's see, PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, that is also coming out on the Wii, and Pimp

28:29.320 --> 28:33.400
My Ride will be making its way out on the PSP as well.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.480
I don't know if you should be too excited about that.

28:37.480 --> 28:43.240
Rapala Trophies, if you're into bass fishing, hooray, on the 360.

28:43.240 --> 28:48.700
On the PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, which should be pretty cool.

28:48.700 --> 28:53.080
Same damn game as before, I believe they added maybe a few things to it.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.960
And let's see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, I already said that.

28:55.960 --> 29:00.760
Let's see, Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out, also ported the GameCube

29:00.760 --> 29:01.960
game.

29:01.960 --> 29:10.360
Let's see, on PC, The Sims 2 Celebration, that looks kind of neat, and a bunch of other

29:10.360 --> 29:16.520
crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way,

29:16.520 --> 29:20.680
and actually, Locomania sounds kind of fun.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.400
That might be kind of neat.

29:22.400 --> 29:29.240
And then, let's see, on the DS, Cake Mania, and Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales,

29:29.240 --> 29:31.500
that should be pretty cool.

29:31.500 --> 29:36.360
And then, finally, the game, probably going to be picking up this week, Guitar Hero 2,

29:36.360 --> 29:41.080
making its way to the 360, so, pretty awesome.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.760
I thought you were getting my copy early, what happened?

29:44.760 --> 29:47.840
Comes out Wednesday.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.440
I'm working on it.

29:49.440 --> 29:53.760
Pull through for me, I have to be the coolest kid on the block, and have it before anyone

29:53.760 --> 29:54.760
else.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.000
What do you mean you have it?

29:57.000 --> 30:03.440
You're a liar, April Fools, Magsy, full of lies and loos.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.560
Just get heart, love ya.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.800
Well let's move on to more release dates.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.800
How about the UK?

30:11.800 --> 30:17.960
Well here's what we've got coming out, on the 5th we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords,

30:17.960 --> 30:23.080
we also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360, on the 6th we have Frontline Fields of

30:23.080 --> 30:31.160
Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and the Red Star on PS2.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.280
I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.840
What's that about?

30:35.840 --> 30:39.440
I just remember it was shooting stuff, and I like guns.

30:39.440 --> 30:44.320
It's an old acclaimed game that finally got published, and it's being made into a movie,

30:44.320 --> 30:47.400
it's based off of a comic book series as well.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.000
Yeah, what he said.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Alrighty.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.440
Well, moving on over to Japan and checking out what's on their release date schedule.

30:55.440 --> 31:00.300
Cold Set Saga is getting an updated version out in Japan this week, which I think is kind

31:00.300 --> 31:01.300
of interesting.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.880
I thought the game had already come out, but it looks like they're getting an updated version.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.840
I'm not sure what exactly they've updated, but there you have it.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.240
If you're a Cold Set fan, I'm sure you're going to want to pick that up.

31:11.240 --> 31:16.180
Also coming out, Championship Manager 2007 in the Asian territories.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.200
On the Nintendo Wii, Barnyard comes out in Japan.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.900
I'm not sure if this is a game we already have here.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.240
I think it is.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
Is it based on the movie?

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
It is, yeah.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
Blech.

31:26.240 --> 31:30.240
It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
a ball.

31:31.240 --> 31:37.040
PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into

31:37.040 --> 31:41.960
Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.

31:41.960 --> 31:49.240
Netsuchuu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachi Slots Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love

31:49.240 --> 31:51.240
your pachinko.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.080
It looks like some sexy ladies there.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
Actually, wait.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.200
I don't know, though.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.720
That might actually be just a slot machine game.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.080
Maybe that's why they go on pachi slots.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.360
I'm sure they've got pachinko in it, too, though.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.360
Come on.

32:04.360 --> 32:05.360
It's a gambling sim.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.400
A gambling sim with sexy ladies.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.800
I've never played pachinko.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.520
Can you explain pachinko to me?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.840
How exactly does it work?

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
I have no fucking clue.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.240
But you played it?

32:15.240 --> 32:20.760
I was in Japan, and they told me, you've got to play pachinko, because it's one of those

32:20.760 --> 32:23.720
Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.

32:23.720 --> 32:28.560
So I went to the pachinko parlor and put $10 in, and it ate my $10, and I didn't know what

32:28.560 --> 32:29.560
to do.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.560
It's basic.

32:30.560 --> 32:31.560
Okay.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.560
I don't know the basics of the game.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.560
I'm sure somebody-

32:33.560 --> 32:34.560
It's legalized gambling.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.560
It's pretty much legalized gambling.

32:35.560 --> 32:40.480
So there you put these little metal balls falling in certain spots.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.600
I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
metal balls.

32:44.600 --> 32:50.120
I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.

32:50.120 --> 32:54.640
And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes-

32:54.640 --> 33:00.240
This game sounds fucking hot.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.780
You can exchange those for prizes, or you can usually go around the corner and get money

33:03.780 --> 33:04.780
for them.

33:04.780 --> 33:09.520
Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and whatnot, and it gives you money.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.480
But Rob makes you eat too gross.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.760
I've collected a lot of balls over the years.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.760
Where's my prize?

33:15.760 --> 33:20.440
I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.900
You have your own set of balls.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.060
Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.

33:25.060 --> 33:29.400
That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant very similar to the ones that

33:29.400 --> 33:31.860
would serve Rocky Mountain oysters, you know?

33:31.860 --> 33:34.360
Rack of lamb, rack of balls.

33:34.360 --> 33:42.640
Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.200
Do you even care what's coming out of Nintendo DS in Japan?

33:45.200 --> 33:46.200
Sure you do.

33:46.200 --> 33:52.640
Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.

33:52.640 --> 33:56.160
And of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover, but I assume that this

33:56.160 --> 34:01.240
is a simulation game that teaches you manners, because you can pick A, B, C, and it looks

34:01.240 --> 34:07.200
like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.420
So this is interesting, to say the least.

34:11.420 --> 34:16.360
Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.920
Isn't this series ever going to die?

34:17.920 --> 34:18.920
I like that.

34:18.920 --> 34:19.920
Probably never.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.920
The app is old.

34:20.920 --> 34:25.720
And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Soup Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam

34:25.720 --> 34:26.720
games.

34:26.720 --> 34:31.360
Nintendo vs. ZAFT Portable.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.480
There you have it, Japanese release dates.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
Aren't we happy?

34:35.480 --> 34:36.840
We are happy.

34:36.840 --> 34:42.000
One thing though that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting

34:42.000 --> 34:44.920
you yet another firmware, 3.30.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.040
And what will it give you?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.720
Well, some interesting stuff.

34:48.720 --> 34:56.360
For example, you can have some brand new video sizes, including full screen video now at

34:56.360 --> 35:00.520
480x272, the native resolution of the PSP.

35:00.520 --> 35:10.620
Somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution, which is actually DVD resolution, that's 480p.

35:10.620 --> 35:13.320
I don't know how the hell that's going to fit, since there's not that many pixels on

35:13.320 --> 35:16.880
the damn screen, but okay, sure.

35:16.880 --> 35:21.420
And then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, which I believe

35:21.420 --> 35:28.000
is the T-Mobile hotspots, and you get like 60 days, like a trial for that or something.

35:28.000 --> 35:35.360
It will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there, so you know, you may want

35:35.360 --> 35:43.320
to wait a little bit because, let's see, because there's some good news, and that is that like

35:43.320 --> 35:47.960
most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.

35:47.960 --> 35:55.640
And yeah, it's been cracked already, and actually the rumor is that DarkAlex is working on a

35:55.640 --> 36:01.640
custom firmware for 3.30, so I would say give it a couple more weeks, and you'll probably

36:01.640 --> 36:04.380
see this on the internet.

36:04.380 --> 36:12.960
Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a TA82PSP

36:12.960 --> 36:17.660
motherboard in there, and you have the custom firmware already on there, if you try to upgrade

36:17.660 --> 36:21.960
to this it may break your PSP, so you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have

36:21.960 --> 36:24.600
the custom firmware in there, so just be careful.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.480
Well, better hope that people heed that, right?

36:29.480 --> 36:30.480
Yes.

36:30.480 --> 36:35.140
Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's

36:35.140 --> 36:41.960
really surprised by this, is that the man, the voice, David Hayter, is returning as Solid

36:41.960 --> 36:45.700
Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriot.

36:45.700 --> 36:48.340
That just makes me absolutely so happy.

36:48.340 --> 36:55.800
Also coming back are the voice actors for Raiden, Roy Campbell, and Otacon, so that's

36:55.800 --> 36:58.840
very cool.

36:58.840 --> 37:02.900
And that actually just makes me very happy.

37:02.900 --> 37:07.240
Isn't David Hayter also the voice of the blood elves in World of Warcraft?

37:07.240 --> 37:08.460
He's awesome.

37:08.460 --> 37:13.120
He also wrote the first X-Men movie, too, the screenplay.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.120
The first two movies.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.120
He wrote it?

37:15.120 --> 37:16.120
Yeah.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
I did not know that about him.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.120
I'm so sorry, guys.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.920
My voice is giving out so bad tonight.

37:19.920 --> 37:23.800
Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.000
I didn't realize that's what he did.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know where that's going.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.640
And he also did Applebee's commercials.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.160
I found his voice reel.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.920
I want my baby bit, baby bit.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.240
Oh, Jiranami says, no, David Hayter did not do the blood elves.

37:36.240 --> 37:40.880
Somebody pulled the Napier Fools joke on me then, bastards.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.400
I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.400
My bad.

37:45.400 --> 37:52.720
Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I

37:52.720 --> 37:53.880
think.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.880
For the game.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.880
Hmm.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.800
Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.880
But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.

38:00.880 --> 38:01.880
Oh, cool.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.880
You'll have to check that out, then.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.920
They still, you know, have to do the translations.

38:05.920 --> 38:06.920
I guess that's true.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
That's true.

38:07.920 --> 38:12.600
Because the game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.040
Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was

38:16.040 --> 38:20.240
promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.

38:20.240 --> 38:23.800
They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than

38:23.800 --> 38:25.160
Talladega Nights was.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.200
That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.

38:28.200 --> 38:32.840
But they were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network, and then the first 20,000 were going

38:32.840 --> 38:34.240
to get their movie.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.640
But nobody's gotten it yet.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.120
Casino Royale is fucking awesome.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.000
I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
It's so good.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
It's all she freaking talks about.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
It's not all I freaking talk about.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
So he's like, have you seen the Bond movie?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Have you seen the new Bond movie?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
It's freaking hot.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.880
Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie, because it's really

38:52.880 --> 38:53.880
good.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.880
And you should see it too.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.160
I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either, and it was really good.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.160
Fucking hate Bond.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.160
No, I hate fucking Bond.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.160
You know what?

39:00.160 --> 39:01.160
This just isn't working out.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.160
You know what?

39:02.160 --> 39:03.160
Fuck you.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.400
I love it when lesbians fight on this program.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.400
Let's see.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.240
Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember,

39:11.240 --> 39:16.720
you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets

39:16.720 --> 39:18.520
mailed to you.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.600
Ouch.

39:19.600 --> 39:24.080
So, perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.440
Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation

39:27.440 --> 39:28.440
3.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
It bundled in there.

39:29.440 --> 39:34.320
Well, it was bundled in, and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?

39:34.320 --> 39:35.320
That's true.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.960
It was like a real special something, huh?

39:36.960 --> 39:42.880
Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.880
You're special ed.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
You're mom's special ed.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
Anyways.

39:45.880 --> 39:46.880
Last night.

39:46.880 --> 39:52.080
So, you may be waiting a while to get your copy of Casino Royale.

39:52.080 --> 39:57.240
Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
3.

39:58.240 --> 40:04.680
According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they

40:04.680 --> 40:08.960
are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.600
And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful

40:13.600 --> 40:19.280
platform and developing technology and products, and they're planning on developing technology

40:19.280 --> 40:24.120
and products for this console, says, however, we believe that the install base will be high

40:24.120 --> 40:28.800
enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.280
So not only do you have to wait until 2008, you have to wait until the second half of

40:32.280 --> 40:38.800
2008, which fiscal year for most companies is from, I believe, April to April, I want

40:38.800 --> 40:41.000
to say, or March to March or something like that.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.600
So second half would actually be fall of 2008.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.960
No Tomb Raider on PlayStation 3 for you.

40:47.960 --> 40:48.960
You know what?

40:48.960 --> 40:53.840
I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises

40:53.840 --> 40:54.840
could this affect?

40:54.840 --> 40:55.840
Umm...

40:55.840 --> 40:56.840
Juice X?

40:56.840 --> 41:03.160
I'm trying to remember, Eidos recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.

41:03.160 --> 41:07.160
They were doing like Battle Stations Midway.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.920
I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.920
Thief, Hitman.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
Hitman, yeah.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.920
Oh, that's a pretty big series.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.920
Okay, there you go.

41:14.920 --> 41:15.920
Huh.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
Well, I don't know.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.440
None of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
to try.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.960
Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and

41:23.960 --> 41:24.960
I just, I haven't.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
You know?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.560
So many games, so little time.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.960
And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there too.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
That's true.

41:31.960 --> 41:32.960
That's true.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.960
It looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain too, I forgot about

41:36.960 --> 41:37.960
that.

41:37.960 --> 41:44.000
All right, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008, but Jamie's got a lot of love

41:44.000 --> 41:46.720
for you all out there, don't you, Jamie?

41:46.720 --> 41:47.720
Yeah.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.760
And she loves to share the website she finds with you on the internet every week in a little

41:51.760 --> 41:54.040
segment we call Dark Socras.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.280
I really need tea or something.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.760
My voice is cracking like I'm 12 all over again.

41:58.760 --> 42:03.320
No, it's, well, I have tea, I have my licorice tea, but it's just not enough.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.600
Licorice is nasty.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.600
I'm sorry.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.600
I love licorice.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
Anyway.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.480
Dark Socras website of the week.

42:10.480 --> 42:20.760
Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random, and it's transmission.org.

42:20.760 --> 42:29.840
It's T-R-A-N-S dash mission dot org, and it's a UK website for the club scene for Transvestites.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.640
So I'm done.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.640
Did you actually browse the website?

42:36.640 --> 42:37.640
I mean, what kind of-

42:37.640 --> 42:40.160
I was looking for shoes.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.720
You were looking for, wait a minute.

42:41.720 --> 42:42.720
I was looking for shoes.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
Hold on.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.160
Stop the damn music for a minute.

42:45.160 --> 42:51.640
How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual

42:51.640 --> 42:53.360
clubs in Britain?

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
Let's get them.

42:54.360 --> 42:56.480
Because there's a link on here, on their links page.

42:56.480 --> 43:00.760
There's a shops link, and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.760
These shoes are $300.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.480
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.440
Let's get them.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.440
So yeah.

43:08.440 --> 43:09.440
You started it, Rob.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.440
You started it, Rob.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
I guess I, I don't know.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
I guess I deserve that.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
I don't know.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Let me borrow that top.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.800
It really is a pretty, pretty famous transit.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.480
You want the rest of my water bottle for now?

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
I'm not sick.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
Okay.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
I have a drink.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
Let me go bribe people.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
All right.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.840
Chris is going to go bribe people.

43:24.840 --> 43:25.840
Try to get us some drinks.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.320
I'm going to give people some blood.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.320
All right.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.320
Anyhow.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.320
Can I help?

43:30.320 --> 43:31.320
Can you just help?

43:31.320 --> 43:36.400
Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NCSoft and ArenaNet, because they

43:36.400 --> 43:41.200
are putting out not just one, but two new Guild Wars titles, for those of you guys that

43:41.200 --> 43:43.120
are into Guild Wars.

43:43.120 --> 43:47.580
Guild Wars Eye of the North will be a new expansion that is coming out.

43:47.580 --> 43:50.920
It is coming out for around the holidays, 2007.

43:50.920 --> 43:56.320
It's got 18 dungeons, 10 brand new heroes, and 150 new skills.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.960
It's going to be pretty awesome.

43:57.960 --> 44:03.520
Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 is also going to be coming out in the second half of 2008.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.700
That was officially announced, and they are going to follow what worked for them with

44:07.700 --> 44:11.820
Guild Wars, no monthly subscription fee.

44:11.820 --> 44:15.600
The world will always be available, just like the original Guild Wars.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.480
That's kind of cool, especially for those folks into Guild Wars.

44:18.480 --> 44:25.680
What I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?

44:25.680 --> 44:29.760
I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.

44:29.760 --> 44:34.040
EverQuest 2 didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got, because people didn't want

44:34.040 --> 44:35.320
to leave their characters behind.

44:35.320 --> 44:40.040
I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate, or if because, eh,

44:40.040 --> 44:45.560
I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there will be some extra incentive.

44:45.560 --> 44:51.360
I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the

44:51.360 --> 44:57.920
North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2, just to, you know, make people buy everything

44:57.920 --> 44:58.920
they want.

44:58.920 --> 44:59.920
So there you go.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
Gotta collect them all.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
Yeah.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.920
Gotta get them all.

45:03.920 --> 45:11.360
Anyways, this isn't really a news article, more of a, I guess a commentary by me, but

45:11.360 --> 45:18.480
I was reading, there was this post on Joystiq actually, and it's a column that they do,

45:18.480 --> 45:25.360
I believe every other week, by a woman named Bonnie Ruberg, and basically she writes a

45:25.360 --> 45:26.880
column called Playing Dirty.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.520
It's a column on sex and gender in video games.

45:30.520 --> 45:37.280
And her article this week was, Lady, Get Off the Road, and it's basically talking about

45:37.280 --> 45:39.480
men say women are bad drivers.

45:39.480 --> 45:44.780
This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license

45:44.780 --> 45:46.320
photo to prove it.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.240
I take my on-road duties seriously.

45:50.240 --> 45:54.760
And basically her complaint is that she believes that those comments about women being bad

45:54.760 --> 45:56.960
drivers are unfounded, and in fact, it's-

45:56.960 --> 46:00.720
Can I say something funny I saw a woman doing on the road yesterday?

46:00.720 --> 46:04.360
No, this is, Chris, I swear to God, this is a true story.

46:04.360 --> 46:08.840
I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?

46:08.840 --> 46:11.840
So, but she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.400
She's not even the student driver.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.400
No, I know.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.080
No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.

46:17.080 --> 46:20.280
She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper to bumper trying to

46:20.280 --> 46:23.760
go across the Bay Bridge, text messaging while driving.

46:23.760 --> 46:26.200
You can't text message, break up.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.640
You can't text message, break up.

46:28.640 --> 46:34.120
So yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.200
True story, I am not shitting you.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.440
This is- That takes a special kind of loser.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.320
This is why you women get a bad rap.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.320
Exactly.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.800
You wanna know why men get a bad rap?

46:46.800 --> 46:50.780
Small penis cars every single fucking time.

46:50.780 --> 46:54.760
I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.

46:54.760 --> 46:57.120
What the hell is that car called?

46:57.120 --> 46:58.120
What is that car?

46:58.120 --> 46:59.120
It's like a four BMW.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.600
I know, but- I don't know.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.280
It's one of the new little beamers I've got.

47:04.280 --> 47:10.180
So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that

47:10.180 --> 47:12.120
they've got a bigger cock than I do.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.080
I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.

47:15.080 --> 47:18.840
And then they perceive- Now, what you boys don't know is that Chris

47:18.840 --> 47:20.980
has a very big cock.

47:20.980 --> 47:21.980
That's right.

47:21.980 --> 47:22.980
In her top dresser drawer.

47:22.980 --> 47:23.980
Exactly.

47:23.980 --> 47:28.240
And when it vibrates, beat that motherfucker.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.400
Not as big as mine.

47:29.400 --> 47:30.400
That's right.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.400
Hers is detachable though.

47:31.400 --> 47:34.400
So- Shut up, Rob.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.600
But yeah, you men are- Lesbian sex, bleh!

47:37.600 --> 47:41.480
You men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that car.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.680
Okay, and maybe- Okay, so men-

47:43.680 --> 47:44.920
Sorry, do you wanna finish the article?

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
Sorry.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Yeah, I wanna finish.

47:46.920 --> 47:51.640
Anyways, so they go on to complain basically that men, you know, are driving fast and they're

47:51.640 --> 47:56.240
breaking- Oh, and they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.

47:56.240 --> 48:00.720
They're all- Just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.880
Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.

48:03.880 --> 48:07.400
They've got awful driving written all over them.

48:07.400 --> 48:10.120
Yeah, I don't think games are reality.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.120
Duh!

48:11.120 --> 48:14.080
You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!

48:14.080 --> 48:15.680
I can make some points for that!

48:15.680 --> 48:17.360
No, I'm not retard, okay?

48:17.360 --> 48:19.280
So here's the thing.

48:19.280 --> 48:23.120
I fucking hate the goddamn women that drive the giant SUVs, talking on their goddamn cell

48:23.120 --> 48:26.380
phones, not paying attention to the fucking world, and because- Getting distracted by

48:26.380 --> 48:30.800
stupid shit like, hey, look, there's a bird over there, and meanwhile like swerving all

48:30.800 --> 48:35.120
over the fucking place because their conversation's interesting.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.160
That's the difference.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.540
Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
That's why.

48:40.540 --> 48:45.760
You know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great, then we

48:45.760 --> 48:49.200
can go out there and play that and you'll have something to play.

48:49.200 --> 48:53.600
But I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think

48:53.600 --> 48:57.680
they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are,

48:57.680 --> 49:02.880
you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that,

49:02.880 --> 49:05.200
you know, but usually I let them pass me no problem.

49:05.200 --> 49:09.080
But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway talking on the cell

49:09.080 --> 49:14.920
phones swerving all over the place, not using her signal, and you know, goddamn, might as

49:14.920 --> 49:20.800
well stop and back up on the freeway, and I have seen that by the way before.

49:20.800 --> 49:21.800
That's what pisses me off.

49:21.800 --> 49:26.400
And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples, actually a lot, a lot, a lot

49:26.400 --> 49:31.400
of bad apples out there too, kind of spoil a bunch, and you know, women should just get

49:31.400 --> 49:34.800
pissed off at these stupid people that drive, it's really SUV drivers.

49:34.800 --> 49:39.200
I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.

49:39.200 --> 49:44.800
I actually have to agree with you, those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with

49:44.800 --> 49:45.800
fire.

49:45.800 --> 49:49.840
And you know what, the guys at speed out there, they end up crashing anyways, so it's all

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
bad drivers.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.840
I'm sorry, I missed something, what the fuck does this have to do with games?

49:53.840 --> 49:55.680
It doesn't have to do anything with games.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.120
Why the fuck did you bring this story up, man?

49:58.120 --> 50:03.160
Because it was on Joystick, and because it was, and because it's basically, they're talking

50:03.160 --> 50:08.360
about like Need for Speed, Cytruck, and Burnout and stuff like that, kind of blaming, I guess,

50:08.360 --> 50:10.400
So what, is that how the article reads?

50:10.400 --> 50:15.120
Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop

50:15.120 --> 50:16.640
texting, blah, blah, blah.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.640
That's what I read.

50:17.640 --> 50:18.640
Cytruck, burnout, okay thanks.

50:18.640 --> 50:19.840
Is that it?

50:19.840 --> 50:24.720
That's what I read, that's how my guy filter went through that, you know, it's like squawk,

50:24.720 --> 50:28.600
squawk, squawk, med suck, squawk, squawk, squawk.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.600
I thought that was your wife talking to you.

50:30.600 --> 50:31.600
Oh no.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.600
Or me.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.600
Or me.

50:33.600 --> 50:38.960
Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.

50:38.960 --> 50:43.080
That's right, that's right, I'm going 120 miles on the freeway, I'm wondering why somebody

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
going 80 is in my way.

50:45.080 --> 50:49.000
Okay, I'm going to go fry people.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Next!

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Alright, wow.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.920
Oh by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills

50:55.920 --> 50:58.560
at racing sims because they need to practice.

50:58.560 --> 51:06.000
Women, they're already such good drivers that they can squander their free time on destruction.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So smackdown.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, are you politely commenting for a reason here, because anytime there's

51:12.080 --> 51:17.160
a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it, but tonight, strangely quiet.

51:17.160 --> 51:23.720
I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in, or if you're just rolling your eyes mentally,

51:23.720 --> 51:24.720
I don't know.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.880
I'm trying to get a feel.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.300
What is going through Jamie's mind?

51:28.300 --> 51:36.040
Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective, so moving forward.

51:36.040 --> 51:38.040
Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.

51:38.040 --> 51:40.560
What the hell do they do with anything?

51:40.560 --> 51:43.440
They do bad driving and good driving.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.360
So how about smackdown, right?

51:45.360 --> 51:48.800
There's going to be some smackdown in here pretty soon.

51:48.800 --> 51:58.560
On new smackdown vs raw 2008 edition, to be on the PS3, we DS also a bunch of other shit.

51:58.560 --> 52:08.460
So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system,

52:08.460 --> 52:15.160
you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff, and some of the fan requested

52:15.160 --> 52:22.680
updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience,

52:22.680 --> 52:29.320
out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff, but I just think smackdown vs raw is

52:29.320 --> 52:36.320
funny because wrestling is like soap opera for guys.

52:36.320 --> 52:43.000
Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start

52:43.000 --> 52:47.200
your own reality show that appears on VH1?

52:47.200 --> 52:50.280
Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan though, he comes back a year later.

52:50.280 --> 52:54.840
It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right, or whatever?

52:54.840 --> 53:01.960
I'm so gay, obviously, I don't know what I'm talking about.

53:01.960 --> 53:05.120
You like the last smackdown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up,

53:05.120 --> 53:06.120
Darkseid?

53:06.120 --> 53:09.200
Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.

53:09.200 --> 53:12.840
Who puts the smackdown when you and Dan do battle in smackdown?

53:12.840 --> 53:15.680
I just make characters and make him use them.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.040
I usually make really kickass characters though.

53:18.040 --> 53:22.600
Like the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was this really pretty boy in

53:22.600 --> 53:29.680
D-Generation X, and then we just let him play on watch mode where you could just watch all

53:29.680 --> 53:33.200
the matches and he won every single match, had all the belts.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.160
We even put him in a women's match.

53:36.160 --> 53:40.000
That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game, but still, he had all

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
the belts.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
He was fucking awesome.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.340
I just remember because he was pretty.

53:45.340 --> 53:47.360
Pretty Boy, was that his wrestling name?

53:47.360 --> 53:48.360
Pretty Boy?

53:48.360 --> 53:53.120
No, he had some cool name, but he was just, I think his name was actually just Mr. X.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
How original.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
All right.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.760
Maisie, what, you had something to say?

53:57.760 --> 53:59.920
Maisie has a joke about wrestling, sure, why not?

53:59.920 --> 54:03.420
We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with the joke.

54:03.420 --> 54:08.120
The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.760
How's that?

54:09.760 --> 54:13.000
Just watch professional wrestling, and then watch some gay porn.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Not much of a difference.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.160
Some advice from Maisie there.

54:18.160 --> 54:19.160
All right.

54:19.160 --> 54:23.840
Well, we are going to take a quick break here.

54:23.840 --> 54:27.240
The lesbians saw boobies.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.040
What are you looking at here?

54:29.040 --> 54:34.520
I'm on Destructoid, scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore 69, Celebrity Boobs

54:34.520 --> 54:36.040
and Nakedness, etc.

54:36.040 --> 54:42.480
Then they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller

54:42.480 --> 54:44.120
on there.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.440
Is it like an April Fools joke or something?

54:45.440 --> 54:46.440
I don't know.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.080
I'm just scrolling down.

54:48.080 --> 54:51.920
They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
I do like that site.

54:52.920 --> 54:53.920
It's a lot of fun.

54:53.920 --> 54:54.920
All right.

54:54.920 --> 54:58.760
I guess that's going to do it, though, for part A here of Orange Laundry.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.680
I don't know if you're thinking, gosh, this is a little short.

55:00.680 --> 55:03.860
Well, don't forget, we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was

55:03.860 --> 55:04.860
a separate show.

55:04.860 --> 55:10.400
But we will be back for your full part B right after a quick little segment here.

55:10.400 --> 55:13.280
Coming up in part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite, because there's

55:13.280 --> 55:14.280
a lot on that.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.480
We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers,

55:18.480 --> 55:20.040
Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.

55:20.040 --> 55:26.520
Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.

55:26.520 --> 55:31.040
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

55:31.040 --> 55:32.040
