Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on Sunday, April 1, 2007.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We already did our April Fool's joke. The rest of the show is legit.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you want to check out our fun little April Fool's joke, go back in our podcast archive or audio archive, whatever you want to call it, and check it out.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's there.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But we have a lot of news this break.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Some video game noobs and Dark Sakura and Loki joining me as always.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Also joining me tonight, Chris and Meg Z, the OLR lesbians.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go to the Xbox 360.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Xbox 360 Elite is official, which further proves the point that all Microsoft rumors are true, except the ones that came out today on April 1.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But we all knew the black Xbox 360 was coming for some time.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And Loki, I got to hand it to you.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Last week when we went over this on the show, you called it a 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You called the price down to the dollar.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not that hard.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's really not, but it's still kind of impressive.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The premium system and the Elite system are the price of the core plus the hard drive.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So the pro system being $399.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The hard drive is $100 to the 20 gig.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I figured, OK, $479 so that the hard drive is probably $179.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And what do you know?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They kept to the pattern.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So yay me.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, the Elite will be coming with this 120 gigabyte hard drive, and it's coming out for $479 on April 29.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The Elite also comes with an HDMI port and comes in sexy black.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're bringing sexy black.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm bringing sexy black.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wow.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just because it's April Fool's Day doesn't mean I ran out of bad jokes.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That was not an invitation to break into song.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also, black wireless controllers, black battery packs, and black play and charge kits will be coming out as well.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Pretty exciting stuff.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And black headsets.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Although, I don't know.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's exciting stuff for some people, but not for me.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because the first Xbox period was black.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So hooray for having a black console for Microsoft.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I mean, we've already had one.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
People still buy the black console.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why?

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because the DS Lite came out and it's white, and now the black one came out and everyone's like,

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh my God, I got to get it black.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Or pink.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Pink.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, no one wants pink.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've got a pink one.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Black.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You know, it's just, I don't know.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
People are suckers for new colors.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, that's true.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like, one of the things you look at in marketing is the color of something.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
As long as it's different from whatever it was before, it'll be more popular.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And also, it's only limited time.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's going to go back to the white.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So buy the black ones while you can.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Random thought.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The low-end PlayStation 3 is $4.99.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So isn't it interesting that Microsoft's kind of getting close to entering Sony's price range,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
especially when they have their own little back and forth and stuff?

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As they would say, it's all about choices.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You don't have to buy that Elite One.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Although, if you want HDMI, you do.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, hooray.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
JeremyTod1 wants you to know, the DS Lite is a handheld, not a console.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Aha, touche.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, fine.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's see then, how about, well, the GameCube came in multiple colors.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look at the PlayStation 2 Slim.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That came out in multiple colors.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or PlayStation 2, the original system, came out in multiple colors in different countries.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I mean, who cares?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It doesn't matter.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just a fucking console.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To be honest, if you really wanted a black console, you can do it for like $60.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Or get some spray paint and you can do it even less.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I mean, seriously.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Rama's in our chat room, taping live here on Sunday nights.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Chad.orangelandtrader.com.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Rama says, I have a big black Wii.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And if you know Rama, then that's funny if you're six years old.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Or if you're a lesbian, apparently.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you hear the cackling in the background, that's the two lesbians giggling at Rama's big black Wii.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Anyways.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Isn't he cute?

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, with the 120 gigabyte system, you're probably wondering a few things like,

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
say for example you do have a 20 gig hard drive, how are you going to move your stuff over?

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, you'll be happy to know that it is going to come with a data cable.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, if you do have one of the older hard drives, you can transfer your saves using that data cable to the new hard drive.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
However, you cannot transfer more than one hard drive.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And I remember previously they suggested that you get more than one hard drive for those digital downloads and stuff.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, you're fucked because if you put another hard drive on there, it will just overwrite all the data on there.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That also being said, you know...

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, not to sound like a cock, but it's not that hard to switch the hard drives out.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, if you could afford multiple hard drives, is it really going to kill you to switch the one out and put the other one in?

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It makes you say yes.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Y'all are some lazy bitches.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No. Well, here's what I'd suggest though.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you're going to run into these problems and you don't like these restrictions that they have on there,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
buy the XSATA or something very similar to that.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's one of those devices you can buy for 50 bucks, you can transfer stuff to your PC, vice versa and stuff.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Just transfer, dump everything on your PC, dump it back onto the hard drive.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There you go.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can do multiple hard drives, whatever.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, do that if you don't like these restrictions.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Otherwise, stick with the free cable.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The other thing, much like the original hard drive, it's going to be loaded full of crap.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And, you know, as you probably remember before, and I'm kind of wondering how much of that 120 gigs is actually available to use,

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
because you remember before in the 20 gig one, 7 gigs is for the updates and stuff for the emulation.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, logic tells me 113.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, there's been more updates since then and that partition might be bigger.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Touché.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Anyway, so, what you're going to get, or I should say, have to delete off your hard drive are the following things.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
For trailers, you're going to be getting the Forza 2 customization damage videos,

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Halo Wars Fable 2, Halo 3 TV ad, Halo 3 trailer, Halo 3 8.2 Brute video,

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Accessory TV Spot, Wireless World video, and Holiday 06 accessories video.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why the fuck do they have this stuff on there for free?

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't understand, because you can download it off of Live for free.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Not everybody gets on Live though.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, goody.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So, they really probably want to see the Holiday 06 accessories video, because I'm sure that's really exciting.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, I have to be honest, when I first bought my Xbox 360, I did watch some of the videos on there,

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
because I was like, oh, hi-def videos on my HDTV, that's kind of pretty, because I didn't have an HD DVD player,

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and I don't think Comcast had been installed yet for the HD.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was kind of fun, I don't know.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I deleted those.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, I deleted them since then.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Other things you'll have on there, playable demos, including Assault Heroes, Cloning Clyde, Geometry Wars,

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Marble Blast Ultra, Small Arms, Feeding Frenzy, Uno, Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Luminous Live,

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Zuma, Heavy Weapon, Lego Star Wars 2, Lost Planet, the multiplayer one, Madden 07, Fusion Frenzy 2,

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and Call of Duty 3, and of course, like usual, Hexac HD will be on there, the full game.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wow.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But then again though, from what I hear, if you do end up having to transfer your stuff over to that new hard drive,

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you'll wipe it all out anyways.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Some real quick chat comments before we get to our next story.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In chat we have Hostile One says, I guess they don't want people sharing downloaded games.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I mean, with this whole...

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, at least with that free cable, you're going to have to buy an extra tool to do that.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mystic Gohan asks, does anyone know if the 360 uses USB hard drives for storage?

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, it does not.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Big fat no, sorry.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mystic Gohan also asks, who would buy a 120GB hard drive without Live?

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What would be the point, other than music, which I doubt is what someone would do?

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Good point, good point.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Seems fairly pointless.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Some people, Magsy, what was this?

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, okay, this is my first reaction.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's like, ooh, it's bigger and better, I must have it.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You know what, it's a valid point.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There are not a lot of people, but there are a small amount of people.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's like, ooh, big, new, shiny, must have.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But you want to know what's funny, though, is that Sony is taking all the credit for the idea.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, they're going around saying that, you know, there's actually a quote from their SVP of marketing

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
saying, we think that every PlayStation 3 owner should have the elite experience,

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
which is why we include an internal hard drive and HDMI output in every PS3 we sell,

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
along with the 50 gigabytes of storage capacity on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So they're all trying to do, like, oh, well, we're all hot shit, and, you know, they're trying to be like us.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's getting really soap opera-y and kind of fun to watch what's going on between Microsoft and Sony,

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
because like with the UK launch where Microsoft was, like, crashing the party with those big Xbox 360

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
heart shoe signs and stuff, it's kind of getting funny watching the two fight like little bitches.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's great. I mean, I'm eating this shit up.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There should be a podcast all to, like, dramatizing this whole thing.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
These are the days of our gaming.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Maisie, I'll put you in charge of that project.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They should do a reality show like that.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right. Cool.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, I have another story, speaking of which, which is an interesting follow-up,

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because, you know, Sony says that, you know, welcome to the elite status Xbox 360.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But what's interesting is that Sony actually filed something on March 2nd, 2007,

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
indicating that they are going to be releasing another PlayStation 3 model with an 80-gigabyte hard drive.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It was something that, you know, they were running it by the FCC.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They have to get the approval and all that stuff.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Could this be a whole new model?

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Could this just be a storage upgrade?

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know, but Sony kind of was doing a little bit of damage control earlier this week with the whole thing.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I remember reading a little later.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, we have no plans to do that.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Except we do have plans to do that.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, we're not copying them.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We are not copying them.

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How many times has Sony done that, though, really?

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like, you know, back when, I think it was E3 2004, I think,

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
was when the, it was announced that the 360 was going to have two packages,

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and Sony just lapped them, and then, you know, what happened with the PS3 is two packages.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Good point.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, because of hard drive size, that's why people aren't buying your console.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It must be because the hard drive's not 80 gigs.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's why.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's why you're not selling any systems.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, rumor goes around that Ken Kutaragi wants 250 gigabytes.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Great!

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Two, great, so the system will be...

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey, you know how many Crayolas that holds?

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know what I'm doing with my system?

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I'll tell you right now, we're loading that shit with porn.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I kid you not.

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That is what we are doing with that 20 gigabytes I have in there.

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Maybe.

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I do have lesbian porn in HD, so we can do that, but...

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've seen the lesbian porn in HD, it's pretty weird.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wait, you have pirates on HD DVD, don't you?

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh my god, bring that shit over, I have an HD DVD player.

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, I have the highest budgeted porn in my possession that's HD DVD.

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's actually pretty funny.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hey, I wonder if I can get that in Blu-ray.

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, maybe.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The porn industry signed their allegiance over to HDTV.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Blu-ray's going down.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Sorry guys, we forgot we were a video game show for a minute.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey, it's talking about...

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm talking about video games, so I'm just saying though,

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that's the only use I've found for the 20 gigs that I have in there right now,

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and I couldn't imagine if I had 250 gigs, I guess.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It'd be cool if you could use it as external storage or something.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
More porn.

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's what I was thinking.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
All right, well, I don't know about you guys,

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but if you're Dark Sakura and you only own a Blu-ray player,

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you're pretty pissed to hear that HD DVD is going to get the porn industry,

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and I know that makes Dark Sakura a little bit angsty, right?

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, not really.

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Roll with me here, because we've got...

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Makes me angsty.

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, so angry.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Maybe I'll just use the music to do this.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you're not mad about the Blu-ray,

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
then find something else to F you of the week, Dark Sakura.

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
My rage is the fact that I can't find any decent Deadpool icons for LiveJournal,

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
so I have to make them myself.

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's really it, because I've had a pretty darn good week.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I graduated!

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Congratulations.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Seriously, those who have been listening to the show for a long time,

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I know you've been working hard at the massage stuff.

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I am a fucking massage therapist now, bitches.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I want my Happy Birthday!

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No!

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, great.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm really glad to hear you've graduated.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Now, Jamie, I have a real sore spot right here.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
$75.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Low-key.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
F you to Epson.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I tried refilling my printer ink.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Apparently there's some fine print that they don't like to talk about,

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and that fine print would be that you can only use Epson cartridges for your Epson printers.

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have the Photo R300 or whatever,

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and apparently I tried buying generic brand ink,

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
because in the past for every other fucking printer I've owned, it works.

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I understand that maybe the quality of the ink or whatever may be the last big deal.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm willing to spare the extra dollars for lower quality ink.

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Whatever.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But when I put it in my printer, after spending, I might add,

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
even on this cheaper ink, $60,

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
because that's how much it costs to refill the fucking ink and this stuff,

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
it said we've detected that this is not Epson ink,

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and please use genuine products, and it will not work at all.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So that's money just down the drain.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you, Epson.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not buying any more of your products.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In fact, I'm thinking about dumping my printer into the dumpster.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So fuck you, and I'm writing some hate mail to you.

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Build on eBay. They'll always help.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Better business bureau.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
All right. Is that it?

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, I was going to say, if you're looking for a printer out there,

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Epson, I think Canon, HP, they all have the chips inside of them

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that will count how many days go by or whatever,

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and basically your cartridge will stop working after so many days,

281
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
even if you don't print anything.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So just that in mind, you want to make sure you freeze them

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
when you first get them.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you get software off the internet, feel free to do that.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Just be careful when you're buying stuff.

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Read up on it first.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
More FUs of the Week from me. I have many tonight.

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
One FU to April Fool's Day.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is my least favorite day of the year, because everybody's a damn fool.

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is my voice for making me sound like a 12-year-old all over again tonight.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I want to say FU to folks that don't...

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Folks that sometimes don't have to work for what they're given very hard,

293
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and sometimes folks are kind of giving things on a silver platter

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and it makes them a little bit ungrateful.

295
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not... I'm talking about people who are ungrateful.

296
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not talking about anybody. No, no, no.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is something completely in another dimension.

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Because there are people I know that are, you know, fortunate,

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but are yet humble, if that makes sense.

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There's a big difference between that and being un-humble.

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So there's certain people out there that should have to work harder for the FUs.

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And then I would also like to give a big FU to the fact

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I have to pee so fucking bad right now,

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
so I'm going to run out of the room while Chris and Megsy do their FUs.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I found something for Megsy just now.

306
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I found an icon of Emma Foster's boobs that makes me happy.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm angsty. Okay.

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, FU. Okay, my FU goes to the guy that was sitting behind us

309
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
during T. and Susan's turtles, which we went to see today.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This guy sitting behind us first had the nerve to talk on his cell phone

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
during the first part of the film, which was annoying,

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but I mean, he's just like, oh, I'll call you back.

313
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I liked his cell phone ring, which was like, don't pick up the phone.

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That was his cell phone ring. Don't pick up the phone.

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Which was fucking annoying to begin with.

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And then after that, like maybe 20 minutes later,

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
we hear someone kind of snoring.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This guy started talking on his cell phone and then fell asleep and was snoring.

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I really wish I had some possible reflection like throwing back at him.

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He should have thrown some reason at his head, then you would have given him a reason to wake up.

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hell yeah.

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, I don't really have a big FU of the week,

323
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
except for your people who cannot take a joke, Mickey.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not going to elaborate too much since we spent like a half an hour of me bitching about it.

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I'm not going to elaborate.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But FU to the people on April Fools who fall for an April Fools joke

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and then can't take a fucking joke, you losers.

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't mean that. You guys are nice, but seriously, fuck off.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I mean it then.

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, Jamie means it.

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Dude, this is the best icon ever. It's the one where Kitty has a gun at Emma's head.

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's hot.

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Did Maisie do hers?

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah, we're done.

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Sorry, I was peeing. I didn't know.

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You and your peeing, Ross.

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, look, when Mother Nature calls, I've learned you probably want to answer.

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because if you hang up on her, she's not going to like that.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Mother Nature will do that to you.

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
She's killing you for that shit.

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's get back into the news.

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Anyways, speaking of killing you.

343
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, well, I'm not really dying in this case.

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But Sony, CR, and Vivendi, I guess, are being sued because Spyro has induced seizures in somebody's baby.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, Corinne Gamespot is reporting that a mother of a child who suffered permanent disability injuries from a grand mal seizure while playing Spyro Enter the Dragonfly has filed suit in New York State Supreme Court.

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And she names all those three companies and seeks unspecified damages.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And you might want to point out also that it is in the manual. There is an epilepsy warning in there.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And it is common practice in the video game software industry to put that stuff in there.

349
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So I think it's your own damn fault, to be honest.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, you know, it's funny because you always see those warnings.

351
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Like, I know I see those warnings all the time.

352
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I always just kind of go, oh, gosh, I must really kind of, like, suck if that's, you know, you.

353
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I mean, sometimes we take certain things for granted that, you know.

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But to kind of hear that somebody's going to sue over that is kind of like, well, I mean, I know I see that thing all the time because I've thought about people who might want to be careful about that.

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know.

356
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I've actually got a friend with epilepsy and he loves playing video games and he plays them all the time.

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So is that kind of like, you know, you're lactose intolerant but you still have ice cream?

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Something like that, I guess.

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You know what? Ice cream is tremendous.

360
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I know, but, you know, and I know plenty of people who are lactose intolerant, they're like, fuck it, I'll just take a lactate.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, it seems like this is just another person trying to get money out of big corporations and by pointing a finger and saying, you caused this, et cetera, et cetera.

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Like, you know, when I threw my Wiimote at the TV and it, yeah, or the strap broke.

363
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DJ Morpheus in chat says, so I can sue OLR for giving me the AIDS.

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, it wasn't me that gave you AIDS.

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

366
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, exactly.

367
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay.

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
See, I hate April Fool's Day. I just hate it.

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, let's move on.

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Speaking of more bullshit, okay.

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There is actually research going on at the University of Bolton, one of the UK schools.

372
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like Michael Bolton?

373
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Somebody had to say it, Jamie.

374
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Rob.

375
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes.

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Dynamifier.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Saying that gaming addiction is over diagnosed up to 10% of the time because there are certain indicators that they were attributing to gaming addiction are actually the same as gambling addictions.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So it's actually along the same lines as a gambling addiction, not just, you know, really being addicted to gaming.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But they're saying that they like to, that basically it's just hype.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's all this.

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That they're using it as a scapegoat.

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That it's just like the same type of addiction people have to gambling.

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it's kind of like, you know, the best cure for video game addiction is to grow up.

384
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Is that basically what they're saying?

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Or just shoot them.

387
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
All right.

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Anybody have anything they want to say on gaming addiction?

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
An addiction is an addiction is an addiction.

390
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It doesn't matter what it's to.

391
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It doesn't matter what caused it.

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's an addiction.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think there's a difference between a chemical addiction and a physical addiction.

394
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
See, I don't think so.

395
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Then again, I actually, you know, now that you think about the biology behind activities, I would say, just like how there's people who are addicted to sex, people addicted to gaming, people addicted to gambling.

396
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Addicted to lesbians.

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
People, especially people addicted to running.

398
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You get that chemical response whenever you perform this action and people become addicted to the feeling they get when they're doing it.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And it's all chemical.

400
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There's people who are addicted, who always have to be, you know, this is the only way I can describe it.

401
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
People who always have to be in a relationship because of the chemicals your body releases while you are, quote, in love.

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And they may not be in love for real.

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They have that feeling.

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And so they're addicted to that feeling of being with another person.

405
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So what you're trying to say is you're going to have to face it.

406
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're addicted to love.

407
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, that also, though, goes a lot to explain people who keep themselves in abusive and codependent relationships, too.

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Wow.

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know.

410
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm like, wow, this show took an interesting turn all of a sudden.

411
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't know.

412
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I was just thinking about it because I honestly see the same type of mentality of people who are addicted, like, say, the Evercrack people.

413
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You point out to them, well, you could be doing this, this, this, and this to improve your life.

414
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't you use sort of the same type of arguments with your friends who are in abusive relationships?

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Well, you know, if you left so-and-so, you could do this, this, this, and this.

416
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, but I need him.

417
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, but I need to level.

418
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm thinking of addicts to online games.

419
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know what?

420
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I think about, though, also, I'm someone who used to smoke, and I know you did, too, for a while, and that's something that's, you know, it's a mental and...

421
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I smoke cigars.

422
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There's a difference.

423
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You don't inhale a cigar.

424
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, okay.

425
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, whatever.

426
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I thought you smoked cigarettes for a while.

427
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I smoked cloves, like, off and on.

428
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
All right.

429
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, in college, I started cigarettes for a while.

430
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's my voice, right?

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But I quit.

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yay.

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And with that, you got the nicotine addiction and the mental addiction.

434
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So, it's kind of like, like, I could kind of see that where wow might be something similar when you get folks who are addicted to wow, because there's that addiction of, like, I need to level.

435
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I need to see my friends.

436
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Da-da-da.

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But then there's also kind of the, like, I'm addicted to it because I don't know what else to do.

438
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's why you, I mean, and people, I think this also goes with the gaming addiction thing is that people are afraid of change to the point that you would rather stay in a negative situation because it's something you know.

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You know, people who may have social anxiety, they use, you know, an MMO as their means of communicating with the outside world and their ways of having interaction when they're afraid of doing something a different way.

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Also, one thing about it, I've done a lot of research on addiction and stuff because I've dealt with different kinds of addiction.

441
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Nothing illegal, but yeah.

442
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
One of the things, addiction a lot of times acts as an escape from real life.

443
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And, you know, it doesn't really matter what you're doing.

444
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You know, if you're doing, you know, an activity repetitively, it's usually an escape from real life, whether it's video games or anything.

445
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So, yeah.

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Just something to add about addiction.

447
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
All right.

448
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No, I agree with that too.

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And I think that also kind of goes hand in hand with the whole afraid of change, afraid of things that are different.

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
People don't want to face their fears, so they try to avoid them one way or another.

451
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Or could we be forgetting the one factor that really is an issue, I think.

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Games are getting so fucking awesome that you can't stop playing them.

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Like Earth Defense Force 2017.

454
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It is fucking awesome.

455
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you someone's payroll?

456
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No.

457
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I've never played that game until you mentioned it 50 times on this program.

458
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Here's why I like that game.

459
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's because it was originally part of the Simple 2000 series.

460
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And everyone remembers, you know, that is like the bottom of the barrel, you know, crap games.

461
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Weird shit like, you know, zombies versus ambulance and stuff.

462
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It is just like, for me, my bad movie collection.

463
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
All right, we've got to get back into the news, but real quick comments from chat.

464
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
ActDeaf says, by the way, I'm addicted to OLR.

465
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well...

466
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's a good addiction to have.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Just like being addicted to doing good deeds is a good addiction.

468
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Being addicted to being a good Samaritan is a good addiction.

469
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Round nose plus two!

470
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All right, let's see what else is there.

471
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Legend of Zaku says, whatever happened to smoking a joint, eating a Twinkie, and going to sleep?

472
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Thank you, Dennis Leary.

473
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Wow, good job catching that.

474
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Can I just add my little quick quirk and then you can move on?

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Sure, sure. We'll move on after this.

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
My only thing to say about addiction is if you're not hurting anybody and you're...

477
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, that's my only thing.

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If you're not hurting anybody else, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

479
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Well, but, you know, a lot of folks joke with me like, oh, Rob, you're addicted to Warcraft.

480
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You're so addicted to World of Warcraft stuff.

481
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And I'm like, you know, I see Magsy's joking with Chris right now.

482
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But look, Chris is outside the house right now being social with people.

483
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know, so am I.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So there's a difference, too, between like joking about it and like...

485
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No, like seriously, you're fucking addicted to WoW because like, you know, you are...

486
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And there are people...

487
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You're having social repercussions and all that stuff.

488
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You know what's really funny?

489
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What?

490
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
After this, I swear, you can move on.

491
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But if all the WoW addicts will be able to say...

492
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Like when you're first loading into your character, you know how they got that little message for you?

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
When the little bar is like loading the thing?

494
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
One of the things that it said, all good things should be taken in...

495
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Moderation?

496
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
In moderation.

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Even WoW.

498
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I thought that was hilarious.

499
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I see that one, too.

500
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I like how Blizzard can laugh at themselves.

501
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, it's true, though.

502
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, it's very true.

503
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Final Fantasy XI has a big old disclaimer that comes up every time you click to log into the game that says...

504
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The World of Anadil is an exciting place.

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for so long, I'd probably read the damn thing verbatim, but it says something like...

506
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The World of Anadil is an exciting place.

507
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
However, please do not neglect your friends' work and all that stuff.

508
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's interesting.

509
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Alright, we gotta keep it moving, but we do welcome your feedback.

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

511
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you know anyone that's addicted to video games?

512
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And what kind of effect has that had on their life?

513
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We want to hear your emails.

514
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And we will get to the mailbag a little later in the show, but first...

515
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We have to feed my Castlevania addiction, because Castlevania is one of the best series in the history of video gaming.

516
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And, well, Paul Anderson has left Castlevania to go work on his new Death Race 2000 remake.

517
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, yeah!

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Or at least that's what early reports indicated, but then came out later to say that, well, it's not so much that Paul Anderson plans on ditching Castlevania,

519
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
it's just that he's having scheduling problems between the two right now, so we're not sure which is going to happen first.

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Good, because Death Race 2000 needs to be out before Castlevania, because that's a fucking awesome movie.

521
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's so awful. I can't wait.

522
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Alright, really quickly indulge me here, because all the gamers probably know what Castlevania is, but what is Death Race?

523
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Death Race 2000 is basically almost like Carmageddon the movie.

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's an old-ass movie, one of the first ones that Sylvester Stallone was ever in.

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's basically David Carradine plays this guy who's in this race that you get points for killing people with your car.

526
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And at the very end, he takes out the commissioner of this race, I guess who's the president of the world or something like that,

527
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
with his hand grenade. Pun intended.

528
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But it's so ridiculous, though, and I can't wait to see this movie.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Definitely worth checking out, though, if you haven't seen it yet.

530
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Death Race and Death Sport, both about the same thing.

531
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I could just watch The Running Man.

532
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, that's pretty funny.

533
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Anyways, so Hitman is getting, of course, a film made about it, and Variety's reporting that it looks like Fox has picked it up,

534
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and they'll be getting shooting, looks like this week, in Bulgaria's capital of Sofia.

535
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And kind of interesting, though, it says the film's going to be filmed in South Africa, London, and Istanbul as well.

536
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Not Constantinople?

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Not Constantinople, no.

538
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Anyways, and I guess the guy who's actually shooting this right now is Xavier Genz, who I believed...

539
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Let's see here.

540
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't really know what else he's done.

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Anyways, who cares?

542
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But it is kind of interesting, though, because they're saying that one of the stars of Desperate Housewives has actually been confirmed as one of the villains,

543
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and I don't follow Desperate Housewives too much, but apparently a cast member...

544
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Let's see.

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know.

546
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, Dougree Scott is going to play a suitor Ian Hainsworth.

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Sorry, this story was putting me to sleep.

548
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What?

549
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Timothy Olfant will play the lead as the assassin Agent 47.

550
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It'll just be a generic fucking action movie like all the others.

551
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It is.

552
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So Dougree Scott, the guy who plays the British guy in Desperate Housewives, is going to play the villain.

553
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Alright, well, thank you for that, and we will be sure to not see that and wait for a DVD so I can Netflix it.

554
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Just kidding.

555
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Anyhow, one other great fucking same old thing we like to look forward to every week here is the mailbag here at orangeonshreddy.com.

556
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
People will email us, and of course that email address is mailbag at orangeonshreddy.com.

557
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Dark Soccer likes to dive in head first into the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails.

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I do?

559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Well, April Fools, or so she tells me.

560
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
She likes to read them here on the air.

561
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I do?

562
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Don't make me shove this mic up your butt.

563
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's just the voice.

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Anyway, anyway, hey, O.L.R., I was just listening to the last episode of O.L.R., and I heard about the youngest O.L.R. listener, a 12-year-old.

565
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But now I declare myself the second youngest listener of O.L.R. at 13 years old.

566
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No matter what you guys say, I'll still listen to you because you guys are great, from Ron.

567
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Thank you, Ron.

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You're so cute.

569
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Oh, the cute little baby.

570
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Hey, don't patronize the...

571
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're so cute, little baby.

572
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Do not patronize the kid.

573
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Anyway...

574
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wait.

575
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This is from...

576
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, my God, if this kid is 13, then that means he was born in 94, right?

577
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's the year I graduated high school.

578
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, my God, I know, I was like a sophomore.

579
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, God.

580
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Thank you for making me feel old, Rob.

581
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I was in fourth grade.

582
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
When I was your age.

583
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I was in second grade.

584
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
No, wait, I was in first grade.

585
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Holy crap.

586
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So, next email.

587
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I was on the date with your mama.

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Last night.

589
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Really?

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
No, that was okay.

591
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is from Alex.

592
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Hi, Alex.

593
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Rondo of Blood sucked because it was on PSP.

594
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
PSP equal to evil.

595
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Youngest OLR listener.

596
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
P.S.

597
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
My parents don't know I listen to this.

598
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's okay.

599
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
We're going to call them live on air.

600
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Do you know what your kid is listening to?

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Wow.

602
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Anyway, Rondo of Blood is awesome.

603
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay.

604
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, we have a joke.

605
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We have a joke.

606
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, God, here we go.

607
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Two jokes.

608
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This is from...

609
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Can someone remind me how the Orange Launch radio listeners got encouraged to send us

610
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
jokes?

611
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Because we actually read one on air.

612
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This is from Aris, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

613
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
All right, I got two.

614
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What's meant to go deep and is full of semen?

615
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
A penis?

616
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
No, submarine.

617
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
A submarine.

618
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Ha, ha, ha.

619
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Okay, what makes people yell when you blow it?

620
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
A penis?

621
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
A whistle.

622
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Blow my whistle.

623
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Is this another 13-year-old listener of Orange Launch Radio?

624
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Blow my whistle, bitch.

625
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Anyway, this is from, I guess it's pronounced Zaid.

626
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
My name is Zaid Mohammed.

627
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm from the UK.

628
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes, Sky, your Brit accent is a joke.

629
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's funny.

630
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Bro cracks me up.

631
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Anyways...

632
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Thank you for understanding me.

633
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I really appreciate it.

634
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Shut up, Rob.

635
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I've been listening to your podcast since the PSP RSS feed enabled, and it's good to

636
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
listen to you guys because you work during the day and make such a great effort to do

637
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the shows on Sunday night in your own time.

638
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And that's an achievement for anyone.

639
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay, this person uses the mixing numbers and shit with their words.

640
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, a MySpace message?

641
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So this fucking pisses me off.

642
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm going to read it because it's cool that you took the time to write us.

643
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But next time, please actually use full words.

644
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Spell everything out, and if in doubt, use a spell checker.

645
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You know what's fucking awesome?

646
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Huh?

647
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Punctuation.

648
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Punctuation is great.

649
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But make sure that when you use...

650
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Can we put that on a poster with Chris's picture, doing a big thumbs up?

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know what's fucking awesome?

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Punctuation.

653
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,800
Make sure, though, that when you use your spell checker, the words that have been spell

654
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,000
checked are the right versions of the word that you want to spell check.

655
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Remember, B-R-A-K-E.

656
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's in your card, dummy.

657
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay, sorry.

658
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Saw that fucking joke a mile away.

659
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Back to the email.

660
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Back to the email.

661
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Back to the email.

662
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Back to the email.

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Because when I get home from work, I'm tired.

664
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Unfortunately, I can't listen to the live show due to time zones.

665
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Anyway, I sold my PSP, and funny enough, but you guys stuck with me.

666
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I enjoy your show so much that I now download the podcast on my PC and listen every Mondays

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and Wednesdays.

668
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Loki PSP is fun.

669
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Dark Alex Customs gets real boring once you kit it up to the max.

670
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
L-O-L, hence the word, sold it.

671
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that you guys are doing a really great show for us

672
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
hardcore and non-hardcore gamers.

673
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
With all your efforts with keeping us updated on the gaming world, I wish you the best on

674
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
the future and more to come.

675
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I love Rice Princess L-O-L.

676
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, I have a headache, but thank you.

677
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I love it when listeners send us nice things.

678
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Please don't get me wrong, but please don't email us in a hieroglyphics.

679
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
No offense.

680
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm not trying to dog on you or anything, but just because you type the email on your

681
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
computer, which doesn't have access to the internet, it's still not the internet.

682
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Please don't talk like you're on the internet.

683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The more you know.

684
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, next email.

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hey.

686
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Wait, wait, wait.

687
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I have a quick something for Chris.

689
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's a little bit late, but I'm sorry I'm slow because the files on my computer are

690
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
misorganized, but here you go, Chris.

691
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Blow my whistle, baby.

692
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Everybody dance.

693
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Suddenly the studio's turned into a lesbian bitch disco.

694
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
This mailbag segment was ruined to you courtesy of DJ Alligator Project.

695
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I have the vinyl, by the way.

696
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Didn't I buy you a Guitar Wolf CD once?

697
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Record.

698
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Record.

699
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You were supposed to rip that for me.

700
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's why I bought it for you.

701
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No, I'm kidding.

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Anyway, next one.

703
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Hey, love your show.

704
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I wanted to send you a message that we should all ponder about.

705
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The actual cost of an Xbox 360.

706
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Now that the Elite finally announced, is the 360 still the cheapest current gen hardware?

707
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
No way.

708
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Let me explain.

709
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Everyone complains that the PS3 is too expensive, but I believe the 360 is the biggest ripoff.

710
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Here's why.

711
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
First of all, to get a comparable 360, you must A, buy the Elite or B, upgrade your hard

712
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
drive for $179.

713
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Second, even if you buy the Elite for $479, it doesn't even compare to the PS3 in terms

714
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
of features.

715
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
A, to get the wireless network, you must pay $99.99.

716
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
B, to get high definition movie player, you must pay $199.99.

717
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
To play online, you must pay $59.99.

718
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
D, to charge your controllers using the console, you must pay $19.99.

719
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So if my math is right, the consumer must pay a total of $859.95 to get a console comparable

720
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to the features and hardware featured in the PS3.

721
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So the old saying now should read, sorry Microsoft, but I can't buy a PS3 Nintendo Wii for the

722
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
price of one of yours.

723
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Let me know what you guys think of this.

724
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Thanks, Matt.

725
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The PlayStation 3, probably about 30 games out right now.

726
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Microsoft's Xbox 360, a lot more than that.

727
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I understand what this person is saying and that is true.

728
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's that sometimes we are unfairly comparing the charges.

729
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
When I say we, I don't mean us specifically because obviously a lot of the Internet is

730
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
on the same page.

731
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But again, when all is said and done, price be damned.

732
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Xbox 360 has the games I want on it right now.

733
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
PlayStation 3 does not yet, but when it does, I will consider buying one.

734
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
No problem.

735
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Home still looks pretty cool.

736
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Little Big Planet, yes, more, more, more.

737
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But they'll start showing the real good, Sony.

738
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's all.

739
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's basically what I want to say.

740
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You know, PS3 may cost less apparently, but Xbox still has better games on it.

741
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Xbox has Ublis.

742
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's Ublis.

743
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I do think if Sony were to really start to threaten Microsoft's grip that they've got

744
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
going right now, which I think Sony may do in a year, I would not be surprised.

745
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
This has been rumors and rumblings already.

746
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
If Xbox drops some elements of their gold service and they give you a little more stuff

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
for free and the gold people get, I don't know, something else special to compensate,

748
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
they've been talking about that sort of rumor has been going around for a long time.

749
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think Microsoft will cut corners where they have to to compete with Sony, but until Sony

750
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
really has a lot more games, I don't know.

751
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Anyway, I guess that's my thought.

752
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Okay, well, we have one more email.

753
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yay.

754
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
One more email.

755
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
One email to rule them all.

756
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay.

757
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay, I have been listening to the podcast version of the show for about two to three

758
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
months now.

759
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, technically it says two thirds of a month, but I think it means two to three months,

760
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I hope.

761
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So now I have managed to catch a couple of live shows.

762
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I want to give you all props because the show is great.

763
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I love Loki's insider info and the comedy of Robin Jamie's bickering like siblings.

764
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's because Rob's my bitch.

765
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Whatever.

766
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You don't know me.

767
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Sit down.

768
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Shut up.

769
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm your mom.

770
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Mom.

771
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Be quiet.

772
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That doesn't sound like my mom.

773
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
My mom is like this.

774
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's my mom.

775
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Wow.

776
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That sounds like your mom giving birth.

777
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's somebody else's mom.

778
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Someone's sick and deranged mom.

779
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This is my mom.

780
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Rob.

781
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Rob, why are you doing that dumb show on the internet on Sunday?

782
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Rob, why don't you come over once in a while?

783
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Now, this is my mom now.

784
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
When are you going to come home?

785
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
When are you going to come home?

786
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why did you move to California?

787
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Actually, I think California is better for you, but you should come back and visit sometime

788
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and bring your husband with you.

789
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You know, your brother Matthew is being such a little ass.

790
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Now, when I was little, it was, you need to clean your room.

791
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I want to take your TV away.

792
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Mom, you didn't get it for me.

793
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Dad did.

794
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't care.

795
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, my God.

796
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Your mom was the bus driver on South Park.

797
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Sit down.

798
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Shut up.

799
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What did you call me?

800
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What did you say?

801
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That's very true.

802
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
My mom was a screamer.

803
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Anyway, back to the email.

804
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Really now?

805
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's why I'm not breathing, okay?

806
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't want to be like my mom.

807
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay, now.

808
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And that's where I learned how to drown out while people are talking to me and then repeat

809
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
everything they just said.

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It also helped me pass tests when I was in high school.

811
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Mailbag, please.

812
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay.

813
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sure that you all have had this debate before, but I'm looking at finally taking

814
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
the plunge and investing my summer into an MMO.

815
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I am at ends, however.

816
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
My brother is hardcore hooked on Final Fantasy XI and constantly comments on its wondrousness.

817
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,440
Like many people, I have some friends who play Final Fantasy XI and some who play World

818
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
of Warcraft.

819
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,480
I am torn between two much less in-depth environments of World of Warcraft and the fact that Final

820
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,000
Fantasy XI is Final Fantasy.

821
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,280
Unfortunately, I don't like any group better than the other.

822
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,000
So I would like you all to help me decide World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI and

823
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
why?

824
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Some debate would actually help, too, so that it isn't a pure landslide toward World of

825
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Warcraft.

826
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,800
I said that because you always seem to talk about World of Warcraft and you never really

827
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,520
mention Final Fantasy XI.

828
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:44,360
So, World of Warcraft versus Final Fantasy XI, keep up the good work, the show is great,

829
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,720
and damn Live 365 increasing fees.

830
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,880
That's from Boco Thet.

831
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,800
You can damn the government for increasing those fees.

832
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,200
Live 365 is just doing what they have to do to stay afloat.

833
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,720
If you want more information on that, live365.com slash choice.

834
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,000
I encourage you all to check it out.

835
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
But anyway, back to the other topic.

836
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,360
Final Fantasy XI is full of bitches.

837
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,760
Well, I did play Final Fantasy XI for two years and I realize you're a new listener

838
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,480
or in lounge, so you kind of missed that whole period where my gaming week every week was

839
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,520
Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI.

840
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Here's the thing.

841
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,900
Final Fantasy XI forces you to have a social experience and be social with other people.

842
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,680
The problem with XI is that it's very difficult to sign on for a short period of time to just

843
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,400
kind of go, hey, I just want to check, you know, I just kind of want to sign on real

844
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
quick.

845
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,880
Especially since it takes five hours to get a fucking party.

846
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,480
Yeah, and sometimes you're having to really wait for a party for a long time.

847
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,640
Now, I know Final Fantasy XI, recently I read something about a new patch they're doing

848
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,720
that's addressing some of those issues to try and make smaller parties more effective,

849
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,480
but I don't know.

850
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,440
The reason why I've stuck with Warcraft is that sometimes you have to party, but there's

851
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,340
so much you can do solo as well that kind of keeps the game going.

852
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,640
The thing, though, that I think would maybe woo you over this, check out, I mean, Warcraft

853
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,240
does the 10-day free trial.

854
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,080
To my knowledge, Final Fantasy XI offers nothing similar yet, but maybe you could watch your

855
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,300
brother, whoever you said has it, play it for a little bit.

856
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,760
Get the 10-day free trial for WoW, try it out.

857
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,160
If you don't like it, maybe Final Fantasy XI is more your taste.

858
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,920
If Final Fantasy XI ever chooses to do a free trial, I would say go for that as well.

859
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,640
For someone who, again, is addicted to WoW, shut up.

860
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,760
I'm actually very antisocial when it comes to games, and the only reason I picked up

861
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,720
World of Warcraft is because I'm a big fan of Blizzard.

862
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,360
I used to play Diablo II and Diablo and whatnot, and the expansions on that, but I'm a solo

863
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
game player.

864
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,180
I don't like interacting with a lot of people, and then every now and then I'll want to chat

865
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,600
with people, but most of the time people are just stupid, so I don't want to go near them.

866
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,020
But WoW is actually really fun.

867
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,160
You can do it all by yourself, and you can only team up if you want to, and that's the

868
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,160
reason I like it a lot.

869
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,240
Any MMO is going to have some annoying little aspects of it, but I just found that WoW is

870
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,800
a lot more easier to deal with if you don't want to deal with other people.

871
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,520
Then they dance.

872
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,620
Well they do, but to Final Fantasy XI's credit, there is no Taru slash Panic, which does win

873
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,620
in Final Fantasy XI.

874
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,520
You just have to see it to know what I'm talking about.

875
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,240
You know what, our chat room is debating this too, and it looks like World of Warcraft is

876
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
winning by a landslide.

877
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,120
I hate to say, for those Final Fantasy XI fans who might be listening, if you want to

878
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,560
argue your points, send us an email, mailbag, orangehonestreader.com.

879
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,280
Hitstun says, objection, Final Fantasy XI is not Final Fantasy.

880
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,880
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, neither MMO is corrupt.

881
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,980
Drunami says, Final Fantasy XI is dead, Final Fantasy XI remains dead, Gill Sellers killed

882
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,980
it.

883
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,600
Yuni says, I suggest that Final Fantasy XI is not worth it, I played three years on it.

884
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,600
DJ Tyrant says, WoW has 90% of their content that can be soloed, Final Fantasy XI has very

885
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,240
little solo content.

886
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,400
In my honest opinion after having played them both, I've put more time into World of Warcraft

887
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:19,320
than I have Final Fantasy XI, because I could play a lot more solo if I wanted to.

888
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:41,840
To be perfectly honest though, I actually still like Ragnarok Online more, because I

889
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:50,760
am curious to hear what's keeping you in the game, because you've heard a lot of us talking

890
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,120
about WoW now, I'm kind of curious, because I know there's a lot of people that still

891
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
play it.

892
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,160
I'm just glad I can contribute something, because that's the only game I play now.

893
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,560
You always contribute lots of stuff to the program, whether you'd like to admit it or

894
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
not.

895
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,000
Moving on, Halo 2 also has a lot of folks who are addicted to it, and Microsoft has

896
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,400
announced they will be putting out two new maps for Halo 2.

897
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,340
Actually I believe they just went up, they're available for $4 to download.

898
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,360
No word yet if they're going to be free later on.

899
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:33,640
The maps that just came out are Hangem High and Desolation, which came over from Halo

900
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
1.

901
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,560
Kind of cool, if you're a Halo fan.

902
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,780
Yes, if you're a Halo fan.

903
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,940
Now bring on the Halo 3 beta.

904
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:46,560
Oh wait, and everybody thinks that each update or whatever is going to be a Halo 3 beta.

905
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,320
If you're not a fan of Halo, maybe you're a fan of Xbox Live's video downloads, if that's

906
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,920
the case, well, there's going to be some more content up there for you guys, including some

907
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
new stuff.

908
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,800
A few more studios have jumped on board, including Paramount Pictures.

909
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,160
They're going to be adding Braveheart, Team America World Police, World Trade Center,

910
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,240
and South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.

911
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:23,640
Warner Brothers Home Entertainment is also adding Sublime and Babylon 5 The Lost Tales.

912
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,800
Some other stuff from TV that you're going to be getting, A&E Networks.

913
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:35,280
They're providing Dog the Bounty Hunter, King of Cars Driving Force, and Chris Angel Mind

914
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,440
Freak, as well as Gene Simmons Family Jewel.

915
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,720
Oh, that's that show they used to make fun of on the soup all the time, remember?

916
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Mind Freak!

917
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Remember that?

918
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Yes.

919
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Oh, God.

920
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,680
ADV Films, they're going to have some anime stuff on there, so you can check that out.

921
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,680
National Geographic, of course, adding some stuff there.

922
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,640
New Line Cinema is bringing snakes on a plane, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning, Tenacious

923
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:08,360
D, and The Pick of Destiny, plus some other top titles, including Austin Powers' The

924
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:18,600
Spy Who Shagged Me and Magnolia, and Total Vid is providing some extreme sports videos.

925
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,040
How about some titles we don't all already own on DVD already?

926
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,960
I'm looking at you, Austin Powers.

927
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,760
Yay for Microsoft getting more stuff on the marketplace, but how about something to compete

928
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,320
with the DVDs that are out there now?

929
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,320
Does that make sense?

930
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,320
I know.

931
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,120
Especially in the TV department, more HDTV.

932
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,640
Also interesting is their pricing structure has changed.

933
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,880
Now basically, here's how it's going to work.

934
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,720
The new releases now, the 720p HD movies are going to be 480 Microsoft points, or $6, while

935
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,200
the standard size movies are going to be $4, or 320 Microsoft points.

936
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,520
That went up, didn't it?

937
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
I think so.

938
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:08,760
The music films, the HD ones are going to be $4.50, or 360 Microsoft points, and $3

939
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,600
for the normal resolution movies, or 240 Microsoft points.

940
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:22,880
Then TV purchases, for HD it's going to be $3, and for SD it's going to be $2.

941
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,760
I don't know, I haven't bought anything yet, and I'm not really looking to purchase anything

942
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,760
anytime soon.

943
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,000
I got the one movie, which was cool, the hard candy or whatever, because it was an artsy

944
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,080
house movie that I didn't think I'd find in HD otherwise.

945
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,440
But now that I have the HD DVD player, and I've got some Netflix here, I got Babel on

946
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
HD DVD.

947
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
I don't know.

948
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,720
I'm kind of using Netflix to get my movie filled right now.

949
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,240
I know this is not the avenue that they want to go in.

950
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,480
I'm telling you, big money here.

951
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,560
Porn downloads, confirm with a credit card number or something like that, that you're

952
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,840
over 18 or something like that.

953
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
That would be fucking awesome.

954
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,640
I would love to see porn downloads.

955
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,440
Do you really think Microsoft would do that?

956
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
No.

957
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:15,040
No, because it would be horrible for PR, but they should.

958
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,880
Maybe there's a creative way they could do it.

959
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,720
Like you know, Pimps at Sea.

960
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,040
That's the Halo 3 alpha name.

961
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,040
It's a joke.

962
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,040
They had a movie poster for that, which looked funny.

963
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,280
It was a parrot with a pirate's hook for a head.

964
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,280
You know what?

965
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
What?

966
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
Chicken butt.

967
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,640
We need ninja, like more ninja stuff going on.

968
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:48,480
Anyway, because we all know that the natural enemy of the pirate is the ninja, so a pirate

969
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
ninja.

970
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,680
There was a pirate ninja in Weebles.

971
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,480
Anyway, for anyone who has been keeping up with Bullet Witch, the Xbox 360 shooting game,

972
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
there is now some downloadable content.

973
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,120
Who hasn't yet committed suicide.

974
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,080
Announced by Atari.

975
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,200
What's out is there is a White Witch outfit.

976
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,480
There's also going to be coming up a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary and Pixie outfits later

977
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,480
on.

978
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,080
Mummy slash schoolgirl comma.

979
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
We can't hear Megzi.

980
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,840
I was going to say a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary.

981
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
With pixie wings.

982
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,200
With pixie wings.

983
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,680
I came.

984
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,680
Wow.

985
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,560
Anyway, so also coming up, these are new missions that are 20 Microsoft points each.

986
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,340
The Dynamite Beauty is available now.

987
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:50,400
Coming up is Clad and Streaming and Great Spells and some other difficulty settings.

988
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,400
There will also be Caterpillar City, Endless One Shot Kill, Geist Search and Destroy and

989
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,040
enhanced additions of City of Screams, Up in Flames at 10,000 feet, Down in the Valley,

990
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,060
The Bound Soul and The End of Chaos.

991
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,960
There will also be theme packs.

992
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:16,440
For people who don't know much about the game, it's by the studio Cavia.

993
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,740
It's a third person action game and this witch lady has to shoot things.

994
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,600
Which download content will make my game not suck?

995
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,760
I know.

996
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,200
Coming out next month for 100 Microsoft points, a patch that makes the game not suck.

997
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,760
Here's the thing that's really ridiculous about the whole thing anyways is that for

998
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,400
20 Microsoft points, I think that's the equivalent of a quarter, just make it free.

999
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
I mean, seriously, you're making a quarter off this crap.

1000
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:52,760
I mean, just make the goddamn content free as if, you know, sorry the game sucks so bad.

1001
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,640
I'm going to download this by the way because I have the game, although I don't know if

1002
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,360
I want to waste a quarter on this stuff.

1003
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,480
I'll think about that.

1004
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,600
I may throw it at a hobo instead, you know?

1005
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
Have any of you worth, you know, a little bit more to me?

1006
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,580
Mummy school girl pixie wings, quarter at hobo.

1007
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,360
I don't know.

1008
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,600
But I do know that Pcross DS is coming out in Europe pretty soon.

1009
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
Do you like my transition?

1010
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,920
Pcross DS is this kind of like picture crossword type game.

1011
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
I don't know.

1012
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
It kind of looks like Minesweeper to me.

1013
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,920
I haven't played it.

1014
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,760
But it's coming out on May 11th in Europe.

1015
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,600
It's a part of the Touch Generations label.

1016
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,260
Nintendo's putting it out on the DS.

1017
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,800
Over 300 puzzles, everything from easy to the toughest upon tough.

1018
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,420
Also multiplayer amongst the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

1019
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,360
So if you want to do some puzzling over Wi-Fi, here's something to check out.

1020
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,120
The game has been getting very solid reviews, even though I don't make it sound very good.

1021
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,720
Keep in mind I haven't actually played it, so my opinion doesn't mean shit.

1022
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,720
Right.

1023
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,360
It's an old Game Boy game.

1024
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
Is it?

1025
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
I don't remember.

1026
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Yeah, it's a very, very old game.

1027
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,920
It was Mario's Pcross a long time ago.

1028
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,920
Well shit.

1029
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,480
And I like puzzle games too.

1030
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,120
In fact, I kind of actually, for some sick side of me, kind of wants to get Honeycomb

1031
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,760
Beat just because it was kind of fun at that show we played it at.

1032
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
Oh, I don't know.

1033
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
I'll hook you up.

1034
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Don't worry.

1035
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Okay.

1036
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Well, let's move on then.

1037
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,400
Anyways, so in case you may have been under a rock for some reason, you know, it might

1038
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,880
be nice and cool down there.

1039
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Who knows?

1040
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,040
Well, there, Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hit the internet and the internet exploded because

1041
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,000
I crashed a bunch of different websites.

1042
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Sounded just like that.

1043
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,760
That was also the same sound that was in my pants after watching it, but no, seriously

1044
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,200
though.

1045
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
It was awesome.

1046
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:52,220
That was also the sound Lizzie Lohan's vagina made shortly after she got out of rehab.

1047
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,220
Never mind.

1048
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,100
There's a joke there.

1049
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,100
Look for it.

1050
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,120
A few politicians are a little bit pissed off at the fact that the game takes place

1051
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,680
in Liberty City.

1052
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,920
Note to politicians, the game is taking place in Liberty City for about four different games

1053
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
now.

1054
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,840
Where the fuck were you?

1055
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:17,440
Anyways, so now they're just like, oh, but now that it really looks like New York, we

1056
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,440
don't like it.

1057
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,600
And it's funny because I'm going to quote this, I think the best one I read here, sorry

1058
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,400
about it, was on Kotaku.

1059
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,400
They were saying, and here are some of the quotes that they picked out here, setting

1060
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,100
Grand Theft Auto in the safest big city in America would be like setting Halo in Disneyland.

1061
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,160
City Councilman Peter Velour.

1062
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,480
I want to play Halo.

1063
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,160
Halo in Disneyland might make me interested in that game a whole lot more than I already

1064
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
am.

1065
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,680
That's like the lady with the SUV, that'd be right up there with the lady on the cell

1066
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,840
phone in the SUV.

1067
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:58,320
The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing

1068
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
police officers.

1069
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,840
Jason Post, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg.

1070
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:08,880
And then the best one, and probably the most uninformed, in previous incarnations, players

1071
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,320
advanced through the game by killing cops, selling pornography to children, and killing

1072
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,960
prostitutes.

1073
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,000
I'm just going to take a wild guess here.

1074
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,960
I think one of those three is not right.

1075
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,640
Must be the killing cops part, because I don't think you sell pornography to children in

1076
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,640
there.

1077
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,680
There's not Grand Theft Auto child pornography.

1078
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,720
But if they put that in Grand Theft Auto IV, that'd be a great new feature.

1079
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,920
It'd be a cool side mission.

1080
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,780
Either way though, they're going to bitch and moan.

1081
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,400
It's just going to build up the hype for it.

1082
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,080
Certain people are going to file lawsuits, and the game's going to come out and fucking

1083
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
rock.

1084
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:53,320
So anyway, way to go Rockstar, you know how to hype up your games.

1085
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,960
Here comes the hype train.

1086
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,960
Come on, rather train.

1087
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
Choo choo.

1088
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
Choo choo.

1089
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
It did look good though.

1090
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,960
Very good.

1091
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,960
I can't wait to play it.

1092
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,320
I'll tell you what I'm happy about though.

1093
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm happy about more Ninja Gaiden, because I need to play this demo.

1094
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:16,120
I've been a big Ninja Gaiden fan forever, so coming out on the Japanese PSN, we have

1095
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,720
the demo for Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

1096
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,960
And it's not Gayden, it's Gaiden.

1097
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,600
Pronounce it right, fuckers.

1098
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Ninja Gaiden?

1099
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,600
No.

1100
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,840
There's a joke I want to make, but I can't.

1101
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,840
I know.

1102
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,080
I'll make my people angry.

1103
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,080
Sure.

1104
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:40,600
No, it just, it really pisses me off, because I grew up, and I was like, I don't think that's

1105
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,560
how it's supposed to sound.

1106
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,160
And Gaiden, by the way, means side story, huh?

1107
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,160
Okay, anyway.

1108
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,640
Stop being so Gayden.

1109
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm going to kick your butt.

1110
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,760
So anyway, you run around in tight leather, maybe it is a little gay.

1111
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,640
That made Jamie's bitching all worth it, seriously.

1112
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,800
The demo is to be out.

1113
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:17,560
I don't see a date, April 27th is going to be their date, so happy birthday to me.

1114
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Alright, well, while DarkSakura is playing Ninja Gayden on her PlayStation Network, Ninja

1115
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:35,100
Gaiden Dragon Sword is coming out for the DS, and it's been spotted in Famitsu Magazine.

1116
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,560
The game is completely controlled on the touchscreen, but not blocking.

1117
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,720
So don't expect your typical 2D Ninja Gaiden.

1118
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,160
Great, I'm sure that controls like, awesome.

1119
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,720
We'll see, I mean, very little is known about the game except for the fact that it's on

1120
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,720
its way.

1121
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,360
Unless you can read Japanese, maybe you can get some more out of that than I can, I don't

1122
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,360
know.

1123
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,080
I did hear that there was, this was shown during like, I think one of their gamer days

1124
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:02,240
or whatever, the equivalent of a press event, and it didn't control very well.

1125
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Uh oh.

1126
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,320
But then again, then again, the game is, you know, still early in development, and they

1127
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,360
didn't fix that, but there were some issues.

1128
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Uh oh.

1129
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:17,140
Anyways, something that makes me very happy, I might have to stop playing Earth Defense

1130
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,840
Force 2017 for it, Crackdown is getting a new update, in fact they're going to fix the

1131
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,720
multiplayer and lag issues, which is nice, because they need to do that.

1132
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,840
Enable the Halo 3 Beta.

1133
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,160
They're not going to enable the Halo 3 Beta.

1134
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
Fuck.

1135
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,360
Anyways, so some other stuff that they're going to be doing as well, they're supposed

1136
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:42,920
to be possibly expanding the co-op to allow some more players, in fact one of the things

1137
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,880
they're going to be adding a new multiplayer mode that was based off of some YouTube videos,

1138
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:55,440
so that's pretty interesting, and then also rumors that they might do airborne cars as

1139
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,440
well.

1140
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,520
However, there is, there has been a- Wait, flying cars?

1141
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,800
Isn't that already a patch for that?

1142
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,840
What would you do for the flying car?

1143
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,920
You know- Me, George Jetson, his boy, Elroy.

1144
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,320
No I- Okay, so but there are going to be some free updates, I know there was one that was

1145
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,380
fixing the patching stuff, there's another one that they added that's going to be increasing

1146
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:28,560
the number of gang control cars that are roaming the streets for certain achievements, and

1147
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,880
there's going to be later on I guess a free thing to reset the gang so that all the bosses

1148
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,160
come back to their normal spot, so you can play co-op and get that co-op achievement

1149
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,160
for finishing all the missions that we need to do.

1150
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,160
Cool.

1151
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,160
Have you been playing the game?

1152
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,720
A little bit.

1153
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,680
Strangely enough I've been playing Tetris a lot this week, so, because the achievements

1154
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,880
are not that hard, so I'm trying to get my 1500 score by mid-April or whatever it was,

1155
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,680
I don't have much time left and I have like 600 points to go.

1156
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
You too may win Contra.

1157
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Contra.

1158
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
I already have it.

1159
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,680
I love Contra.

1160
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:11,080
Well, there's something that I'd have to say, some Japanese airlines are getting contrary,

1161
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:21,180
ha ha, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is banning local wireless gaming

1162
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,640
on flights because the Wi-Fi signal allegedly interferes with the airplane's instruments,

1163
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,720
the same, you know, cell phone thing.

1164
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:37,640
Now, there's an interesting thing about that, as was indicated, and I'm going to go ahead

1165
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:45,000
and quote the source of this, I think is a very good point that Joystiq made, is that

1166
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,560
Lufthansa has been offering in-plane Wi-Fi since 2003 and haven't had any crashes because

1167
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,240
of it.

1168
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:03,160
The FAA states that Wi-Fi is safe, so I guess that maybe Japanese planes are built differently.

1169
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Maybe.

1170
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,200
Where the hell does Lufthansa fly?

1171
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,480
I've always seen their airline, I've never flown them.

1172
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,720
Where do they go?

1173
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,600
I flew in Lufthansa when I went to France.

1174
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,480
Oh, they're like a Europe airline.

1175
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,800
Yeah, well, I went to O'Hare to Frankfurt, to Paris.

1176
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,520
That's why I've never flown them, because I've never been to Europe.

1177
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
Well, you should go to Europe.

1178
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
I want to.

1179
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,320
Are there any listeners out there who want to send me a lot of money, so go to Europe.

1180
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:35,920
Well, speaking of another place I want to go to, Australia, this is some interesting

1181
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,720
news here.

1182
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:44,520
Richie Young, who was once the Australian PlayStation 2 magazine's editor, he says he

1183
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:52,160
was offered sex, money, overseas trips, and other types of gifts, all in the name of inflating

1184
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,560
game review scores.

1185
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,320
We all know that little handouts and freebies and all that kind of crap goes on all the

1186
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:05,480
time, which we try to tell you, this is why you should support indies, because the mainstream

1187
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,600
gaming doesn't give a shit about indies, and boy, have we learned that in a big way recently.

1188
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,560
I have not had any offers for sex.

1189
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,560
Exactly.

1190
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:19,680
We don't get offers for sex, but anyway, very interesting, so that all kind of came to light

1191
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,240
this week, and of course, has the internet abuzz about sex for game reviews.

1192
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,240
So there you have it.

1193
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,000
It's my nerd dream, the two things I love the most.

1194
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:39,240
I want to review video games and fuckerkers, all while leveling my blood elf.

1195
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,040
I want to cast a spell!

1196
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Oh, Black Wolf.

1197
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Why do you want to cast a spell?

1198
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
There's nothing to attack you.

1199
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,800
I'm attacking the darkness.

1200
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,320
Black Wolf in chat totally wins with this comment.

1201
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,400
OLR doesn't get offers for sex, but they do get fucked.

1202
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,440
God, I love you, Bobby Black Wolf.

1203
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,680
All right, Skyblind's open, 1877 Game OLR, or username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1204
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Let's go to the phones.

1205
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
They're already ringing.

1206
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
Oh, Chris, real quick.

1207
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Skype, baby.

1208
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
I'll make it worth your wild.

1209
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,520
Well, how can you turn that down?

1210
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,640
Let's go check out the phones.

1211
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,640
They're ringing.

1212
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,640
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1213
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,640
Who's this?

1214
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,640
This OLR?

1215
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,640
Is this OLR?

1216
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,360
Yes, this is Luigi Mario.

1217
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,960
Hiya, Luigi Mario.

1218
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,960
What's on your mind?

1219
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,880
Not much, just calling and say that I love the show.

1220
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Do you, Luigi?

1221
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Yes, I do.

1222
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,880
Yeah.

1223
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,880
Why are you, I mean, I've never had a video game celebrity call into the show before.

1224
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,280
I mean, you don't have anything better to do on Sunday nights, like save a princess

1225
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,280
or whatever?

1226
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,280
No, because she's too busy humping Mario.

1227
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,280
What, Luigi?

1228
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:53,200
Daisy's in the back playing DDR Supernova.

1229
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,400
Daisy's playing DDR Supernova?

1230
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,200
Why isn't she playing DDR with Mario?

1231
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
Yes.

1232
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,560
Well, she didn't like that.

1233
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,160
She wanted something to up her game.

1234
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,160
Okay.

1235
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,520
Hey, I got a question.

1236
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,880
I've always wanted to ask Luigi this question.

1237
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,200
How does it feel to constantly get shafted with your brother getting all the attention?

1238
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,520
Well, it doesn't bother me much because it gives me more time to relax and have a little

1239
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
fun.

1240
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,520
Because between a you and a me, I think Peach is a little bit of a whore.

1241
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Wait, so are you saying you trade off Princess Peach with your brother?

1242
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,520
That's kind of gross.

1243
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,640
Well, what can I say?

1244
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,920
She keeps getting kidnapped by Bowser all the time.

1245
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,680
My girl is at home having fun.

1246
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,720
I have a nice accent.

1247
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,360
I'm sorry, but I think this joke is in another castle.

1248
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,960
I really don't know what to say.

1249
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
Okay.

1250
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,960
Wait.

1251
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,760
Well, Luigi, I'm going to ask you, what made you decide to call into our program tonight?

1252
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,600
Well, I just got a newer computer and someone had sent me a link to check it out, so I decided

1253
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
to.

1254
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,440
Was that Charles Martinet who sent you that link?

1255
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,560
No, one of your listeners.

1256
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Oh.

1257
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,680
The other guy by the name of Rama.

1258
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh.

1259
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
I like Rama.

1260
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,680
Rama?

1261
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,680
Yeah, he's okay.

1262
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,280
I didn't know why you spoke to Rama.

1263
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,680
Rama's got a big black wee.

1264
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,200
Is that really true?

1265
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,340
Wait a minute.

1266
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,960
Have you been sleeping with Rama as well as Princess Peach?

1267
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Oh, no.

1268
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,440
I told the girl about the way.

1269
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,440
You should.

1270
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,440
Hey, wait.

1271
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,440
I've always wanted to know this.

1272
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,440
Does Toad?

1273
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,440
What?

1274
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,700
What do you think?

1275
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,700
I think yes.

1276
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,700
He's a screaming queen.

1277
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,700
What do you think?

1278
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,000
Look at what the hell we're at.

1279
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,160
All right, Luigi.

1280
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,840
Say something else before I hang up on you.

1281
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
Love the show.

1282
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,840
Keep it up.

1283
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,840
All right?

1284
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,840
I'll be listening to the next one week.

1285
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
All right.

1286
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,480
Thank you, Luigi, for the call.

1287
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,480
You're so weird.

1288
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,000
All righty.

1289
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,760
It's something about the damn holiday today that's making everybody crazy.

1290
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,320
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1291
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,320
Who's this?

1292
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,320
Oh, it's Darth Vader on the line.

1293
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,320
Hi.

1294
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
It's Uni.

1295
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,320
Hi, Uni.

1296
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,320
What's on your mind?

1297
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,760
You know, we were talking about Final Fantasy XI versus WoW earlier.

1298
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,720
Yes, and you were a Final Fantasy XI player for a long time, right?

1299
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,720
Oh, yeah.

1300
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,440
I was playing it for about three years, two months.

1301
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,800
I keep reminding everybody that.

1302
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,080
It turned out I was playing the wrong game.

1303
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,080
Really?

1304
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,240
And what made you decide that you were playing the wrong game?

1305
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,940
Because everybody kept treating me like crap, and I was only helping everybody out that

1306
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,920
I possibly could.

1307
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,720
You were a white mage, weren't you?

1308
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Yes.

1309
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,120
I was a white mage, and that's why I quit.

1310
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,120
I was also a white mage.

1311
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,040
The white mage is the party bitch.

1312
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,680
Oh, I know.

1313
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,680
This is the...

1314
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,680
I little...

1315
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,680
Come on.

1316
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,680
Come on.

1317
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,960
This is where my decision to quit the game was.

1318
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,960
I was...

1319
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,080
And Rob has seen me play.

1320
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,960
I did fucking macros with a controller.

1321
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,960
I was hardcore awesome.

1322
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,960
I did everything manually.

1323
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,960
You did everything manually?

1324
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:58,960
Yes.

1325
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Oh, my God.

1326
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,960
You're nuts.

1327
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,960
Well, I was patient.

1328
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,960
Wow.

1329
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,960
I would say...

1330
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Well, you have to be for that game.

1331
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:10,200
I would call up 22nd Stino to buff to give everyone plenty of freaking time to get there,

1332
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:17,080
and our team was like, oh, I'm going to go pump this log.

1333
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,600
So when the bitch comes and we call in our thing, he's like, where's my buff?

1334
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,440
I'm like, no, you suck.

1335
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:30,120
So I let him die by going all black mage on whatever our thing was, and then he's messaging

1336
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,600
me like, oh, you bitch, blah, blah, blah.

1337
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,880
I'm like, no, you're the bastard who didn't show up.

1338
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:44,440
I also leveled ninja and black mage, all both to 75.

1339
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:50,720
My favorite class I think I ever played on Final Fantasy XI was probably when I played

1340
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Summoner, but the problem was I was so screwed because if you didn't have Fenrir, you were

1341
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,720
like this, you were a piece of shit Summoner.

1342
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
I know.

1343
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,120
I had to deal with that too.

1344
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:08,760
I did, though, have to say that I loved Monk.

1345
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,760
Monk was pretty great.

1346
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Monk?

1347
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,880
I was going to level that to 75, but that was before I decided to quit.

1348
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,360
Well, Uni, one more question for you.

1349
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,440
What is WoW giving you that Final Fantasy XI was lacking?

1350
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:32,080
The rest of the EXP, a lot more better people that don't treat me like crap, and I can solo

1351
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,880
my EXP instead of being the party's bitch.

1352
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,920
Are you playing a priest in WoW?

1353
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,480
I'm playing a tank.

1354
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,560
See, well, it's a different type of character, but then again, the priests I know don't get

1355
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,000
treated like bitches in WoW, so I don't know.

1356
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,840
Oh, priests get treated like bitches.

1357
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,840
It depends.

1358
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
It depends.

1359
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,640
Okay, Uni, I got to let you go so we can get to some other calls, any really quick last

1360
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,480
messages for our listeners?

1361
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Okay.

1362
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
Listen to Diana Fire.

1363
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Thank you.

1364
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,480
All right.

1365
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Take care, Uni.

1366
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
Bye.

1367
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,480
Uni does her own show on another network.

1368
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,480
She has a cute little picture.

1369
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,480
Call the Diana Fire.

1370
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,480
It is.

1371
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,480
That's her.

1372
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
That's her.

1373
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,480
A little Skype picture.

1374
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,480
A little Skype picture.

1375
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
We like it when listeners.

1376
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,480
One time we had a listener call us with video.

1377
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,480
It was crazy.

1378
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,480
Sweet.

1379
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,480
I didn't even know Skype could do that.

1380
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
I'm so behind the times.

1381
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1382
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
Who's this?

1383
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Rayden Softin.

1384
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,480
Hi, Rayden.

1385
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Analog.

1386
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,480
Hey, Rayden.

1387
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,480
What's on your mind?

1388
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,480
What's on my mind?

1389
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,480
Two things.

1390
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,680
Can I say actually one thing real quick?

1391
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,760
I want to say thank you, Rayvenstaufen, and sorry.

1392
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,520
Our original April Fool's joke for tonight was that we were going to have Rayvenstaufen

1393
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,480
and some of our other infamous callers host the show, but unfortunately it didn't play

1394
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
out that way.

1395
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,480
Some things happened.

1396
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,440
It was kind of easier to throw this together, but thanks, Rayvenstaufen, for being a good

1397
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,160
sport and being ready and willing to do that.

1398
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Always, guys.

1399
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,160
Always.

1400
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,160
All right.

1401
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,160
What's on your mind, buddy?

1402
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:53,360
I've got two more news stories that you didn't mention, and this you didn't mention on the

1403
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:01,640
other podcast two weeks ago, GameWise opening up a new... This is not bullshit.

1404
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,220
They're opening up a new distribution center in Pittsburgh, and that's good for me because

1405
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,760
I don't have to wait eight days for a turnaround.

1406
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,640
I had heard of that, and that is very good news.

1407
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,080
I think part of the thing I like about Netflix is that they have a distribution center in

1408
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,840
West Sacramento, so I always get movies within a day.

1409
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,840
Always.

1410
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,160
I can imagine how frustrating that's got to be to have GameFly, and you're on the East

1411
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,640
Coast and you're waiting so long for games because GameFly is a good idea in theory.

1412
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,520
In fact, I really don't know why I'm not using it or something similar.

1413
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,240
I hear there's one for games and flicks that maybe I should look into.

1414
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,240
I don't know.

1415
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,760
Not flicks is too good.

1416
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,040
Are they not good?

1417
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,720
Whatever the case is, I probably should be doing this with games, but for some reason

1418
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,720
I keep buying.

1419
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,720
I don't know why.

1420
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,200
It's an addiction or something.

1421
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,840
I don't know.

1422
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,840
All right.

1423
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,760
Well, congratulations on that, and let me know how the service improves for you once

1424
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,760
that happens.

1425
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,520
Well, I'm fine with the service already.

1426
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,200
It's just, like I said, the turnaround time sucks.

1427
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Black Wolf agrees, by the way, that games and flicks sucks.

1428
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,120
There you go.

1429
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,680
Thank you, Black Wolf.

1430
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,000
All right.

1431
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
What else is on your mind?

1432
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,280
Your resurrection hit the PlayStation 3 today.

1433
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,160
Oh, on the PlayStation Network store?

1434
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
Or yesterday.

1435
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,160
It hit.

1436
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,160
It hit.

1437
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,160
So no joke, right?

1438
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
No joke.

1439
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
I don't know.

1440
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
Well, that's cool.

1441
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,160
How do I know that?

1442
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
Because I picked it on my podcast.

1443
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,160
Oh, I see.

1444
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,560
Is this just a cheap plug for your own podcast?

1445
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
No.

1446
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,560
All right.

1447
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,000
Well, have you downloaded Tekken yet?

1448
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,400
I don't have a PlayStation 3.

1449
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,160
That would be a problem.

1450
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,600
I don't know why.

1451
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,040
I'm curious.

1452
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,960
Black Wolf says Tekken Dark resurrection came up a few weeks ago.

1453
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,240
I thought I saw some story about it, but again, I don't have a PS3, so I've been able to check

1454
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,720
for myself.

1455
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,480
So Raven's talking about you might be a little late for that train.

1456
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,480
What?

1457
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
I guess where I got it was old.

1458
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,480
All right.

1459
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,480
I put that on the disclaimer on the thing anyway.

1460
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,480
All right.

1461
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,480
Well, that's okay.

1462
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:13,400
Anything else on your mind, buddy?

1463
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,400
No.

1464
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,720
I'm not going to even plug the podcast.

1465
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,720
You all know about it.

1466
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,720
All right.

1467
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,080
Take care, Raven's Dolphin.

1468
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,080
The infamous, the one and only later.

1469
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
The one and only, Raven's Dolphin.

1470
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,360
Hi, you're on Orange Talents Radio.

1471
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
Who's this?

1472
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,360
This is Legend of Zaku.

1473
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
Hey, buddy.

1474
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
What's up?

1475
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Smoking a little bud.

1476
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,360
I want some cookies.

1477
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,360
Buddy.

1478
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Hey, buddy.

1479
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
What's on your mind?

1480
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
Having a little...

1481
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Just chilling out.

1482
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
Having some Twinkies.

1483
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Yeah.

1484
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,360
Yeah.

1485
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Yeah, buddy.

1486
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
It's on your mind.

1487
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Anyways.

1488
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:54,920
Just doing shit like going to this small time anime convention wasn't that big.

1489
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,040
I had to chug the Ramune bottle really fast.

1490
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,040
Nearly burned my throat.

1491
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:05,000
But yeah, I also went to Nintendo World today trying to win a Wii and a Wii Play tournament.

1492
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Never made it though.

1493
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Dude, if you play Cooking Mama, it's like so much food in Cooking Mama.

1494
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's lame.

1495
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
You should have asked to borrow Radma's Big Black Wii.

1496
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah, I should have.

1497
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
But yeah, that's the whole point.

1498
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I mean, yeah.

1499
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I don't know.

1500
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It's just...

1501
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It wasn't really that much.

1502
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,320
Oh, and another thing.

1503
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,760
On behalf of New York City, I apologize with the way our elected officials react to how

1504
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,600
GTA IV looks like our hometown.

1505
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,600
I forgive you.

1506
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,600
And you should...

1507
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,600
Yeah, but it's also...

1508
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,000
I also forget to disregard what the Daily News and New York Post spews out.

1509
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It's just...

1510
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
They're sensationalists.

1511
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
They're not even...

1512
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,540
They just push junk news to our eyes.

1513
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,280
And all they do is just...

1514
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,760
They act like the Daily Bugle if it was run by that guy, that Jameson guy.

1515
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,480
As in, so did you do nothing but print shit about Spiderman?

1516
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,720
Yeah, no.

1517
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,720
Not even that.

1518
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,000
It's just that they report on...

1519
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,680
They hype up everything.

1520
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,680
They have a slant...

1521
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,680
They're mostly slanted.

1522
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,400
They're not as neutral as other papers like the New York Times are.

1523
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,400
So I don't take their word...

1524
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,360
I only take their word at face value and nothing else.

1525
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
I want to go back to the...

1526
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
I know it's just bullshit.

1527
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,600
I want to go back to the Wii Play tournament.

1528
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
What exactly...

1529
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,240
Is this some tournament on Wii Play or what exactly was going on?

1530
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,560
Yes, it was in Nintendo World.

1531
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,100
How did you get denied entry into this contest?

1532
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,100
Because I woke up late.

1533
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
Oh.

1534
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,100
Because I woke up late today.

1535
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,600
Party a little too hard, huh?

1536
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,800
Yeah, pretty much.

1537
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,240
Dude, I didn't know you could gut your Wiimote and then smoke it.

1538
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,040
Yeah, Wiimote.

1539
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,280
It's a Wiimote right there.

1540
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,400
We make an excellent bong.

1541
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,480
I'm so trying that when I get home.

1542
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,720
Yeah, so too.

1543
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,560
Dude, this is the most entertaining call Zach has ever made at this program.

1544
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,560
This is great.

1545
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,560
All right, Zach.

1546
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
He's up really late.

1547
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,520
I'm hoping to see you when I come out to New York City in June.

1548
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,120
Yeah, I heard about that.

1549
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,120
I went to that too.

1550
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,120
We'll see.

1551
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,120
More details to come.

1552
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,120
Bye.

1553
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,120
All right, later, man.

1554
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,120
Bye.

1555
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
All right, later, buddy.

1556
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,120
Smoke another bow.

1557
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,120
Get her done.

1558
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
Sorry.

1559
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,120
Get her done.

1560
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,640
Wow, you did that way too well.

1561
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,120
That's why I have no voice tonight, because I keep straining my throat with those stupid

1562
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,120
jokes.

1563
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,120
Stop it.

1564
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,120
All right, yes, Mommy.

1565
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,120
All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

1566
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,600
Thank you, boys and girls, for calling in and participating on the Skypline, because

1567
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
rock.

1568
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,680
All right, let's go around and ask if there's any last minute stories tonight.

1569
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,240
Last minute stories.

1570
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,000
Speaking news, I rule.

1571
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,800
April fool.

1572
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,520
She's okay.

1573
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
Loki?

1574
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:52,160
Guitar Hero 2, 360 will have Fector Pedals, because there's a port at the bottom of it.

1575
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,200
I think we reported something like this.

1576
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:59,680
There was a story like this a long time ago, but now it's confirmed, because apparently

1577
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,280
the manual says so.

1578
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,760
Pedals sold separately.

1579
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,520
Now you really can't put the pedal to the metal.

1580
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Get it?

1581
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,760
Here's my impression of Rob tonight.

1582
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:21,320
This is Rob.

1583
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,640
I do sound like a queef.

1584
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,400
So here's something interesting.

1585
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,080
I think someone, I don't remember if we reported on this or not, but apparently the ochreing

1586
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:36,520
of time guy, the guy who was doing the 2D kind of homebrew game, I remember how he was

1587
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,680
dead and everything, well, people aren't sure if this is an April Fool's joke or not.

1588
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,320
It might be, but apparently they think that he's not dead because he's been active on

1589
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:51,600
his MSN and Myspace accounts.

1590
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,040
Either way, this is going to end up fucked up.

1591
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,200
Either way you look at this story is going to end up fucked up, because if it was a big

1592
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,460
April Fool's joke, that's fucked up.

1593
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,680
But if he really was dead and all these people are not believing it, that's fucked up too.

1594
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,080
So there are no winners in this scenario, only losers.

1595
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,560
Mitch Hedberg died on April Fool's Day.

1596
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,560
That's fucked up too.

1597
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,080
And everyone thought it was a joke.

1598
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,640
But seriously, if you're going to smoke 500 drugs, you got it coming.

1599
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,400
I'm sorry to say, but Mitch Hedberg, rest in peace, but dude.

1600
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:32,720
I wonder if he's like, dude, that'd be so funny if I fucking died on April Fool's Day.

1601
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,160
You know that crossed his mind.

1602
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:40,280
Alright, well, anything else, Logie?

1603
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:47,000
No, I don't really have much else other than the lineup of games on Gamefly looks pretty

1604
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
good.

1605
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh, like how you can go to Gamefly and look up all these great new games that are coming

1606
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,120
out?

1607
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,120
Yeah.

1608
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,160
They haven't picked up on yet, or well, maybe some folks did, but they can't really talk

1609
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,160
about it anymore.

1610
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,280
So, you know, you might want to scan Gamefly, see what they got, because apparently Gamefly,

1611
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,280
you know, they can do whatever they want because they're Gamefly.

1612
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,280
So there you go.

1613
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,280
That's hot.

1614
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
I too made new Wallpaper.

1615
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,480
This is what I was doing during the show, was making new Wallpaper.

1616
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,600
Well, I'm proud of all of you.

1617
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,000
Meanwhile, there's a radio show going on, so-

1618
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Why Wallpaper?

1619
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Why don't you put some of this stuff up on OLRPSP?

1620
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Whatever happens.

1621
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Where's the PSP site?

1622
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Where's the Wii site?

1623
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Where's the love, Loki?

1624
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,840
PSP site's still up, just updated, and the Wii site, yeah, about that.

1625
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,880
It's coming.

1626
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,880
Soon.

1627
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,720
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1628
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:45,000
Chris, Meg Z, thank you guys so much for being here and helping us with our April Fool's

1629
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
joke tonight.

1630
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You guys rock.

1631
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I know.

1632
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Get her done!

1633
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Get her done!

1634
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Meg Z, final thought.

1635
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Okay, I had it.

1636
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Chris, your final thought.

1637
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,560
Well, I had a final thought, and then I forgot it.

1638
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,880
Oh, my final thought is, fuck you, Jiranami.

1639
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,320
Yeah, you heard me.

1640
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,320
I said it.

1641
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,320
Fuck you.

1642
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,320
You know why?

1643
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,320
You know why?

1644
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,360
Because that one time I went into the chat room, the one time my computer was working

1645
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,760
right with the chat room, you booted me off because I was trying to get Rob's attention.

1646
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,500
Fuck you!

1647
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,120
I idle in chat all the time.

1648
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,120
So I'm using that there.

1649
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,120
Watch!

1650
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,120
All right.

1651
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,120
I love you, Rob.

1652
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,880
My final thought is, I want a hamburger too, and watching Logi put all that burger to waste

1653
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,880
makes me a sad panda.

1654
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,880
I'm going to throw it away.

1655
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
You're going to throw it away right in front of my face.

1656
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,880
No, I don't want it.

1657
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,880
I don't want to eat something you have eaten, but it makes me go, I want a burger.

1658
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,880
Final thought.

1659
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
Oh, you have a real final thought, Meg Z.

1660
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,880
I have an actual final thought.

1661
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,880
Okay.

1662
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,480
If any of the people in chat or any of the people listening live in the Chicago Midwest

1663
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,960
area and are planning on going to Anime Central this year, Chris and I will both be there.

1664
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,320
I will actually have an art table, and you should come by and see me and buy my art,

1665
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
because it's awesome.

1666
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,080
Actually, I think one of our listeners said she was going to Anime Central, so you guys

1667
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,720
should plan an OLR meetup or something.

1668
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,720
Yeah, we should.

1669
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:06,400
Actually, I think somebody friended me from your OLR live journal, and she's going to

1670
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,060
ASUN, so we're hopefully... Yeah, I'm going to try and see if I can do a promo thing for

1671
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,060
you guys.

1672
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,060
Fuck yeah.

1673
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,060
Do it.

1674
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,060
We'll get you some flyers or something.

1675
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,060
Yeah.

1676
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,060
I'll do a total promo.

1677
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:20,640
I'll do a total promo with her art and the person who's going to share her art table,

1678
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,480
which is Misa, by the way, anyone who is on DeviantArt.

1679
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,200
If you're on DeviantArt, you know who Misa is.

1680
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Yeah.

1681
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,480
I'm going to walk around with both of their art prints all over my body, and I'll have

1682
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:39,600
some OLR flyers, and saying, buy these prints and listen to the show, or God will hate you.

1683
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,020
All right.

1684
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,020
But God already hates them.

1685
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,020
We're going to Anime Central.

1686
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,020
Get her done, Chris.

1687
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,020
Get her done.

1688
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,020
Get her done.

1689
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,680
Okay, for Sakura, your final thought.

1690
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,680
I have two.

1691
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,280
Uno.

1692
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,480
I'm doing my last two massages for my school, because I did graduate, but I haven't got

1693
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,780
my diploma yet, and I'll have it after I do my massage final on Tuesday, so everybody

1694
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,780
think good thoughts for me.

1695
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:03,780
And then... Dos.

1696
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:10,360
She says, you had two, uno, dos.

1697
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:18,880
My other one is in regards to waking up at four in the morning tomorrow, do not want.

1698
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,560
Low key, your final thought.

1699
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,560
Don't worry.

1700
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,880
The Wii site will be done soon, I promise you.

1701
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,280
I've got 3D Realms working on it.

1702
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,480
They promised me they have the best guys, you know, the guys working on Duke Nukem Forever,

1703
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,480
working on the site.

1704
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,220
It should be done very soon, I promise you.

1705
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,440
They wouldn't let you down like that.

1706
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,720
My roommate, Extrofer, just poked his head in here wanting to make a final thought.

1707
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,760
I don't know if we should let him, but whatever.

1708
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,760
Extrofer, final thought.

1709
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,080
I was just going to say, I'm straight now.

1710
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,080
You are not.

1711
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,080
April Fools.

1712
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,080
I am too.

1713
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,440
No, not, look at my Myspace.

1714
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,160
I'm in a date with the girls now.

1715
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,760
Look at your Myspace, that's proof.

1716
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,680
Yeah, because I'm really going to believe what I read on Myspace.

1717
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,360
Myspace is proof.

1718
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,800
You know we already did our April Fools show like two hours ago, right?

1719
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,880
No, this is not an April, I know it's coincidence.

1720
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,880
Coinkydink.

1721
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,360
But I'm with the girls, I want the boobs.

1722
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:21,160
Does vagina taste like pussy?

1723
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,160
Does it taste like pizza?

1724
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,160
No.

1725
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,040
Okay, good, because I don't like pizza.

1726
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,600
You know what pink stuff tastes like?

1727
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,600
It tastes like mmm.

1728
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
Oh, okay.

1729
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:44,000
Mmm, ooh please, ooh please.

1730
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,440
We hope you enjoyed the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1731
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:53,000
It was fun, it was a great five years, but unfortunately I draw the line at pussy talk.

1732
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,320
No, anyway, seriously, we'll see you next week, when we might actually talk about video

1733
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,320
games.

1734
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Wouldn't that be great?

1735
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,520
I can't wait.

1736
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:25,160
So we'll see you then here on Orange Lounge Radio.
