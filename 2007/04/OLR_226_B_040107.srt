00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:14,730
[SPEAKER_04]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on Sunday, April the 1st, 2007.

5
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And we already did our April Fool's joke.

6
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,952
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of the show is legit.

7
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:29,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris and Megzi, the OLR Lesbians

8
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Xbox 360.

9
00:00:53,855 --> 00:01:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360 Elite is official, which further proves the point that all Microsoft rumors are true.

10
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Except the ones that came out today.

11
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,797
[SPEAKER_06]: April 1st, but we all knew the black Xbox 360 was coming for some time.

12
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki, I got to hand it to you.

13
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:13,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week when we went over this on the show, you called it a 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.

14
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: You called the price down to the dollar.

15
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that hard.

16
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really not, but it's still kind of impressive.

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The premium system and the elite system are the price of the core plus the hard drive.

18
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:27,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pro system being $399, the hard drive is $100, so 20 gig.

19
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm bringing sexy black.

20
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:32,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

21
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not an invitation to break into song!

22
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And black headsets.

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for having a black console for Microsoft.

24
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've already had one.

25
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

26
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,463
[SPEAKER_03]: People still buy the black console.

27
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:34,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

28
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:40,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the DS Lite came out as white, and now the black one came out, and everyone's like, oh my god, I gotta get a black!

29
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:40,705
Or pink!

30
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:41,465
Pink!

31
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no one wants pink, but black, you know, it's just, I don't know.

32
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,727
[SPEAKER_03]: People are suckers for new colors.

33
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:48,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's true.

34
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:52,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, one of the things you look at in marketing...

35
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,579
[SPEAKER_13]: is the color of something.

36
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:57,420
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as it's different from whatever it was before, it'll be more popular.

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it's only limited time.

38
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to go back to the white, so buy the black ones while you can.

39
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:17,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Random thought, the low-end PlayStation 3 is $4.99, so isn't it interesting that Microsoft's kind of getting close to entering Sony's price range, especially when they have their own little back-and-forth and stuff?

40
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,288
[SPEAKER_03]: As they would say, it's all about choices.

41
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: and you don't have to buy that Elite one.

42
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:24,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Although if you want HDMI, you do.

43
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hooray.

44
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:32,120
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTodd1 wants you to know, the DS Lite is a handheld, not a console.

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Aha, touche.

46
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fine.

47
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see then.

48
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: How about... We'll look at... Well, the GameCube came in multiple colors.

49
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the PlayStation 2 Slim.

50
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:51,375
[SPEAKER_03]: That came out in multiple colors, or PlayStation 2, the original system, came out in multiple colors in different countries.

51
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who cares?

52
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:54,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, if you really wanted a black console, you can do it for like $60.

54
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Or get some spray paint and you can do it even less.

55
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:04,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma's in our chat room, taping live here on Sunday nights, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, I have a big black Wii.

58
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:20,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you know Ranma, then that's funny if you're six years old.

59
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're a lesbian, apparently.

60
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:31,711
[SPEAKER_06]: If you hear the cackling in the background, that's the two lesbians giggling at Ranma's big black weed.

61
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it cute?

62
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:44,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the 120 gigabyte system, you're probably wondering a few things like, how are you going to put, say for example, you do have a 20 gig hard drive, how are you going to move your stuff over?

63
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll be happy to know that it is going to come with a data cable, so if you do have one of the older hard drives, you can transfer your saves using that data cable to the new hard drive.

64
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,373
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you cannot transfer more to one hard drive.

65
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:10,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember previously they suggested that you get more than one hard drive for those digital downloads and stuff while you're fucked, because if you put another hard drive on there, it'll just overwrite all the data on there.

66
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,776
[SPEAKER_06]: That also being said...

67
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not to sound like a cock, but it's not that hard to switch the hard drives out.

68
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, if you could afford multiple hard drives, is it really going to kill you to switch the one out and put the other one?

69
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:29,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you saying yes.

70
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all are some lazy bitches.

71
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what I'd suggest.

72
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:40,841
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to run into these problems and you don't like these restrictions that they have on there,

73
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:41,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

74
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:41,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

75
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:25,256
[SPEAKER_03]: As you probably remember before, and I kind of wonder how much of that 120 gigs is actually available to use, because you remember before on the 20 gig one, 7 gigs is for the updates and stuff, for the emulation.

76
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So, logic tells me 113.

77
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:33,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's been more updates since then, and that partition might be bigger.

78
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:33,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

79
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, what you're going to get, or I should say, have to delete off your hard drive...

80
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,750
[SPEAKER_03]: are the following things.

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:59,421
[SPEAKER_03]: For trailers, you're going to be getting the Forza 2 customization damage videos, Halo Wars, Fable 2, Halo 3 TV ad, Halo 3 trailer, Halo 3 2 Brute video, Accessories TV spot, Wireless World video, and Holiday 06 Accessories video.

82
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck do they have this stuff on there for free?

83
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:06,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand because you can download it off of Live for free, so...

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody gets on live though.

85
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:14,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh goody, so they really probably want to see the Holiday 06 Accessories video.

86
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm sure that's really exciting.

87
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:25,554
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have to be honest, when I first bought my Xbox 360, I did watch some of the videos on there because I was like, ooh, high def videos on my HDTV, that's kind of pretty.

88
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:29,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I didn't have an HD DVD player and I don't think the Comcast had been installed yet for the HD.

89
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:30,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of fun, I don't know.

90
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I deleted those.

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've deleted them since then.

92
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:58,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things you'll have on there, playable demos including Assault Heroes, Cloning Clyde, Geometry Wars, Marble Blast Ultra, Small Arms, Feeding Frenzy, Uno, Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Luminous Alive, Zuma, Heavy Weapon, LEGO Star Wars 2, Lost Planet, the multiplayer one, Madden 07, Fusion, Frenzy 2, and Call of Duty 3, and of course, like usual, Hexic HD will be on there, the full game.

93
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

94
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:02,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

95
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:11,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again though, from what I hear, if you do end up having to transfer your stuff over to that new hard drive, it'll wipe it all out anyway.

96
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Some real quick chat comments before we get to our next story.

97
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:21,267
[SPEAKER_06]: We have in chat, we have Hostile1 says, I guess they don't want people sharing downloaded games.

98
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:27,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with this whole... Well, at least with that free cable, you're going to have to buy an extra tool to do that.

99
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic Gohan asks,

100
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:33,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone know if the 360 uses USB hard drives for storage?

101
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:34,272
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

102
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,132
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big fat no.

103
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:35,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not.

104
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:36,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Big fat no, sorry.

105
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:41,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty Gohan also asks, who would buy a 120 gigabyte hard drive without live?

106
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be the point?

107
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than music, which I doubt is what someone would do.

108
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

109
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

110
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Seems fairly pointless.

111
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people... Megzi, what was this?

112
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, okay, this is my first reaction.

113
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,827
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, ooh, it's bigger and better.

114
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:56,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I must have it.

115
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:58,264
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

116
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a valid point.

117
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: There are not a lot of people, but there are a small amount of people.

118
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:04,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, ooh, big, new, shiny, must have.

119
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:07,467
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

120
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:13,429
[SPEAKER_15]: But you want to know what's funny, though, is that Sony's taking all the credit for the idea.

121
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they're going around saying that, you know...

122
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:38,677
[SPEAKER_15]: There's actually a quote from their SVP of marketing, saying we think that every PlayStation 3 owner should have the elite experience, which is why we include an internal hard drive and HDMI output in every PS3 we sell, along with the 50 gigabytes of storage capacity on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.

123
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:45,139
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're all trying to do like, oh, well, we're all hot shit, and they're trying to be like us.

124
00:09:47,003 --> 00:10:00,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting really soap opera-y and kind of fun to watch what's going on between Microsoft and Sony because like with the UK launch where Microsoft was like crashing the party with those big Xbox 360 heart shoe signs and stuff.

125
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of getting funny watching the two fight like little bitches.

126
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

127
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm eating this shit up.

128
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,274
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be a podcast all to like dramatizing this whole thing.

129
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,255
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the days of our gaming.

130
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,977
[SPEAKER_15]: They should do a reality show like that.

131
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:15,597
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, cool.

132
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:21,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony released another PS3 model.

133
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: with an 80 gigabyte hard drive.

134
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something that, you know, they were running it by the FCC.

135
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,354
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to get the approval and all that stuff.

136
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:49,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Could this be a whole new model?

137
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Could this just be a storage upgrade?

138
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:56,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but Sony kind of was doing a little bit of damage control earlier this week with the whole thing.

139
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:57,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember reading a little later.

140
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,362
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no plans to do that, except we do have plans to do that.

141
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:03,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

142
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:05,765
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not copying them.

143
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,206
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not copying them.

144
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:09,940
[SPEAKER_13]: How many times has Sony done that, though, really?

145
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:21,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, back when, I think it was E3 2004, I think, was when it was announced that the 360 was going to have two packages, and Sony just laughed at them, and then, you know, what happened with the PS3 is two packages.

146
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because of hard drive size, that's why people aren't buying your console.

147
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be because the hard drive's not 80 gigs.

148
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:30,087
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why.

149
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:32,168
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're not selling these systems.

150
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:35,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, rumor goes around that Ken Kutaragi wants 250 gigabytes.

151
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:37,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Great!

152
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So the system will be... Hey, you know how many Crayolas that holds?

153
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,743
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm doing with my system?

154
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you right now, we're loading that shit with porn.

155
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not!

156
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:51,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we are doing with that 20 gigabytes that I have in there.

157
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

158
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have lesbian porn in HD, so we can do that.

159
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the lesbian porn in HD.

160
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you have Pirates on HD DVD, don't you?

161
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, bring that shit over.

162
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an HD DVD player.

163
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:09,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have the highest budgeted porn in my possession that's HD.

164
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,256
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually pretty funny.

165
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:12,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if I can get that in Blu-ray.

166
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:14,139
[SPEAKER_06]: No, maybe.

167
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,783
[SPEAKER_12]: The porn industry signed their allegiance over to HDTV.

168
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry guys, we forgot we were a video game show for a minute.

169
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm talking about video games, so I'm just saying though, that's the only use I've found for the 20 gigs that I have in there right now, and I couldn't imagine if I had 250 gigs, I guess.

170
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool if you could use that as external storage or something.

171
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:39,729
More porn.

172
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:41,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was thinking.

173
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well...

174
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,359
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

175
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:15,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

176
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:15,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I graduated!

177
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:16,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I graduated!

178
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

179
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, those who have been listening to the show for a long time know you've been working hard at the massage stuff.

180
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:45,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a fucking massage therapist now, bitches.

181
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,794
[SPEAKER_15]: I want my happy ending!

182
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:48,294
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

183
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:50,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, great.

184
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really glad to hear you've graduated.

185
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Jamie, I have a real sore spot right here.

186
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:53,517
$75.

187
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

188
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,541
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to Epson.

189
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried refilling my printer ink, but...

190
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's some fine print that they don't like to talk about.

191
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fine print would be that you can only use Epson cartridges for your Epson printers.

192
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:18,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the PhotoR300 or whatever.

193
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently I tried buying generic brand ink because, you know, in the past for every other fucking printer I've owned, it works.

194
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I understand that maybe the quality of the ink or whatever may be the last big deal.

195
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to...

196
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Spare the extra dollars for lower quality ink.

197
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:36,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

198
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:40,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I put it in my printer, after spending, I might add, even on this cheaper ink, $60.

199
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:44,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's how much it costs to refill the fucking ink in this stuff.

200
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:49,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It said, we've detected that this is not Epson ink.

201
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And please use genuine products.

202
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:53,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will not work.

203
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.

204
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's money just...

205
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Epson.

206
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not be buying any more of your products.

207
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:03,043
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm thinking about dumping my printer into the dumpster.

208
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:09,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck you, and I'm writing some hate mail to you.

209
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Better Business Bureau.

210
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:13,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, is that it?

211
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:25,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to say, if you're looking for a printer out there, Epson, I think Canon, HP, they all have the chips inside of them that will count how many days go by or whatever, and will basically...

212
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:30,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Your cartridge will stop working after so many days even if you don't print anything.

213
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:34,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So just that in mind, you want to make sure you freeze them when you first get them.

214
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get software off the internet, feel free to do that.

215
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be careful when you're buying stuff.

216
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:43,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Read up on it first.

217
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,909
[SPEAKER_06]: More FUs of the week from me.

218
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:45,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I have many tonight.

219
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,591
[SPEAKER_06]: One FU to April Fool's Day.

220
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,454
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my least favorite day of the year because everybody's a damn fool.

221
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:54,877
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to my voice for making me sound like a 12-year-old all over again tonight.

222
00:15:55,624 --> 00:16:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: and I want to say F you to folks that sometimes don't have to work for what they're given very hard and sometimes folks are kind of given things on a silver platter and it makes them a little bit ungrateful.

223
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about people who are ungrateful.

224
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about anybody.

225
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:19,959
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

226
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,581
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something completely in another dimension.

227
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:24,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

228
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are people I know that are, you know, fortunate, but are yet humble, if that makes sense.

229
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,381
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big difference between that and being unhumble.

230
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:42,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's certain people out there that should have to work harder for it.

231
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would also like to give a big F you to the fact that I have to pee so fucking bad right now, so I'm going to run out of the room while Chris and Megsy do their F yous.

232
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,445
[SPEAKER_15]: I found something for Megsy just now.

233
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I found an icon of Emma Frost's boobs.

234
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:56,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes me happy.

235
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:57,916
I'm angsting.

236
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:58,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm angsting.

237
00:16:58,877 --> 00:16:59,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

238
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, what was that?

239
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, FU.

240
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:07,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, my FU goes to the guy that was sitting behind us during TNG's Ninja Turtles, which you went to see today.

241
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:09,125
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy sitting behind us.

242
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:16,390
[SPEAKER_13]: First had the nerve to talk on his cell phone during the first part of the film, which was annoying, but I mean, he's like, oh, I'll call you back.

243
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked his cell phone ring, which was, it's like, don't pick up the phone!

244
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what his cell phone ring, don't pick up the phone!

245
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Which was fucking annoying to begin with.

246
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:29,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, after that, like maybe 20 minutes later, we hear someone kind of snoring.

247
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So this guy starts talking on his cell phone, and then fell asleep and was snoring.

248
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:38,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I really wish I had some popcorn so I could throw it back at him.

249
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:42,009
[SPEAKER_15]: You should have thrown some reason at his head, then you would have given him more reason to wake up.

250
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:46,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.

251
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:57,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't really have a big F you of the week, except for your people who cannot take a joke.

252
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:01,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to elaborate too much since we spent like a half an hour of me bitching about it.

253
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not going to elaborate, but

254
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:14,413
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to the people on April Fool's who fall for an April Fool's joke and then can't take a fucking joke, you losers.

255
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't mean that.

256
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,594
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are nice, but seriously.

257
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:18,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean it then.

258
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:19,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Jamie means it.

259
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, this is the best icon ever.

260
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,257
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the one where Kitty has a gun at Emma's head.

261
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:25,058
[SPEAKER_12]: That's hot.

262
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:26,418
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

263
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Maisie do hers?

264
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:27,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

265
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:28,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

266
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:29,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was peeing.

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know.

268
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Who are you and you're peeing, Rob?

269
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:36,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, when Mother Nature calls, I've learned you probably want to answer.

270
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you hang up on her, she's not going to like that.

271
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother Nature will do that to you.

272
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,462
[SPEAKER_06]: She's killing you for that shit.

273
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back into the news.

274
00:18:47,723 --> 00:19:00,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, speaking of killing you, no, well, I'm not really dying in this case, but Sony, CR, and Vivendi, I guess, are being sued because Spyro has induced seizures in...

275
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: and Somebody's Baby.

276
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:18,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, according to GameSpot, is reporting that a mother of a child who suffered permanent disability injuries from a grand mal seizure while playing Spyro Enter the Dragonfly is filed suit in New York State Supreme Court.

277
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:24,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And she names all those three companies and seeks unspecified damages.

278
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:25,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

279
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:30,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to point out also that it is in the manual.

280
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,845
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an epilepsy warning in there, and it is common practice in the video game software industry to put that stuff in there.

281
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's our own damn fault, to be honest.

282
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, it's funny because you always see those warnings.

283
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know I see those warnings all the time, and I always just kind of go, oh, gosh, I must really kind of, like, suck if that's, you know, you.

284
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:54,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sometimes we take certain things for granted that, you know,

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But to kind of hear that somebody's going to sue over that is kind of like, well, I mean, I know I see that thing all the time because I've thought about people who might want to be careful about that.

286
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:04,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

287
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:08,689
[SPEAKER_13]: I've actually got a friend with epilepsy and he loves playing video games and he plays them all the time.

288
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that kind of like, you know, you're lactose intolerant but you still love ice cream?

289
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,012
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something like that, I guess.

290
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:14,632
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

291
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Ice cream is tremendous.

292
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:20,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but, you know, and I know plenty of people who are lactose intolerant.

293
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:21,677
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, fuck it.

294
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:23,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just take a lactate.

295
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:27,349
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Morpheus in chat says, so I can sue OLR for giving me the AIDS.

296
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it wasn't me that gave you AIDS.

297
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,450
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

298
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,570
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

299
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

300
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,649
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I hate April Fool's Day.

301
00:20:58,669 --> 00:20:59,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hate it.

302
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's move on.

303
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of more bullshit.

304
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:04,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

305
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:13,318
[SPEAKER_15]: There is actually research going on at the University of Bolton, one of the UK schools.

306
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:14,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Michael Bolton?

307
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody had to say it, Jamie.

308
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:21,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

309
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:22,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

310
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:23,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Dine and Fire.

311
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:40,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying that gaming addiction is over-diagnosed up to 10% of the time because certain indicators they were attributing to gaming addiction are actually the same as gambling addictions.

312
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:48,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, it's actually along the same lines as a gambling addiction, not just, you know, really being addicted to gaming.

313
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:55,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but they're saying that they like to, that basically it's just hype.

314
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:56,349
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all it is.

315
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:00,150
[SPEAKER_15]: That they're using it as a scapegoat.

316
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,931
[SPEAKER_15]: That it's just like the same type of addiction people have to gambling.

317
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:10,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like, you know, the best cure for video game addiction is to grow up.

318
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:11,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

319
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that basically what they're saying?

320
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:14,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Or just shoot them.

321
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:17,208
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

322
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody have anything they want to say on gaming addiction?

323
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,910
[SPEAKER_13]: An addiction is an addiction is an addiction.

324
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,330
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter what it's to.

325
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,730
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter what caused it.

326
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,351
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an addiction.

327
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:30,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that there's a difference between a chemical addiction and a physical addiction.

328
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:31,472
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I don't think so.

329
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:37,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Then again, I actually, you know, now that you think about the biology behind addiction,

330
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:45,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Activities, I would say, just like how there's people who are addicted to sex, people addicted to gaming, people addicted to gambling.

331
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:46,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Addicted to lesbians.

332
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:51,245
[SPEAKER_15]: People, especially people addicted to running.

333
00:22:52,466 --> 00:23:00,151
[SPEAKER_15]: You get that chemical response whenever you perform this action and people become addicted to the feeling they get when they're doing it.

334
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's all chemical.

335
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,895
[SPEAKER_15]: There's people who are addicted who always have to be, you know,

336
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:14,912
[SPEAKER_15]: People who always have to be in a relationship because of the chemicals your body releases while you are, quote, in love.

337
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And they may not be in love for real.

338
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:21,216
[SPEAKER_15]: They have that feeling.

339
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,538
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they're addicted to that feeling of being with another person.

340
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you're trying to say is you're going to have to face it.

341
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: You're addicted to love.

342
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:36,046
[SPEAKER_15]: That also, though, goes a lot to explain people who keep themselves in abusive and codependent relationships, too.

343
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:43,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I don't... I know, I'm like, wow, this show took an interesting turn all of a sudden.

344
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:52,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, I'm really... I was just thinking about it because I honestly see the same type of mentality of people who are addicted, like, say, the Evercrack people.

345
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,531
[SPEAKER_15]: You point out to them, well, you could be doing this, this, this, and this to improve your life.

346
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:01,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you use sort of the same type of arguments with your friends who are in abusive relationships?

347
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:05,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, if you love so-and-so, you could do this, this, this, and this.

348
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:06,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, but I need him.

349
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, but I need to level.

350
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:12,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of addicts to, you know, online games.

351
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,528
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

352
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:25,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about, though, like, also, like, you know, I'm someone who used to smoke, and I know you did, too, for a while, and that's something that's, you know, it's a mental and... I smoked cigars.

353
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:26,077
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a difference.

354
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:26,898
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't inhale a cigar.

355
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

356
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:27,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, whatever.

357
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you smoked cigarettes for a while.

358
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,701
[SPEAKER_15]: I smoked cloves, like, off and on.

359
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

360
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:33,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was... In college, I started with cigarettes for a while.

361
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why I'm... My voice, right?

362
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:35,846
[SPEAKER_06]: But I quit.

363
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:36,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

364
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:36,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

365
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:40,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, but with that, you got the nicotine addiction and the mental addiction.

366
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:55,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's kind of like, like, I could kind of see that where WoW might be something similar when you get folks who are addicted to WoW, because there's that addiction of, like, I need to level, I need to see my friends, da-da-da, but then there's also kind of the, like, I'm addicted to it because I don't know what else to do.

367
00:24:57,311 --> 00:25:03,417
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why you, I mean, and people, I, I, I think this also goes with the gaming addiction thing, is that people are...

368
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,087
[SPEAKER_15]: www.DarkSakura.com

369
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:31,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, one thing about it, I've done a lot of research on addiction and stuff because I've dealt with different kinds of addiction.

370
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing illegal, but yeah.

371
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,442
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things, addiction a lot of times acts as an escape from real life.

372
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And it doesn't really matter what you're doing.

373
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:49,126
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're doing an activity repetitively, it's usually an escape from real life, whether it's video games or anything.

374
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:51,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

375
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:53,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Just something to add about addiction.

376
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:53,868
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

377
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:56,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope, I agree with that too.

378
00:25:56,623 --> 00:26:00,025
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that also kind of goes hand in hand with the whole afraid of change.

379
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:00,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

380
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:01,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Afraid of things that are different.

381
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:05,689
[SPEAKER_15]: People don't want to face their fears, so they try to avoid them one way or another.

382
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:09,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Or could we be forgetting the one factor that really...

383
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:10,882
[SPEAKER_03]: is an issue, I think.

384
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:14,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Games are getting so fucking awesome that you can't stop playing them.

385
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:15,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Earth Defense Force 2017.

386
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:17,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fucking awesome.

387
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:19,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on someone's payroll?

388
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:19,831
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

389
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:24,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I had never heard about that game until you mentioned it 50 times on this program.

390
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why I like that game.

391
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it was originally part of the Simple 2000 series, and everyone remembers, you know...

392
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:36,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That is like the bottom of the barrel, you know, crap games, weird shit, like, you know, zombies versus ambulance and stuff.

393
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:40,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just like, for me, my bad movie collection.

394
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:42,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we gotta get back into the news, but real quick comments from chat.

395
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Actdeft says, by the way, I'm addicted to OLR.

396
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Well... That's a good addiction to have.

397
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:52,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like being addicted to doing good deeds is a good addiction.

398
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:54,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Being addicted to being a good Samaritan is a good addiction.

399
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Round nose plus two!

400
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, uh, let's see what else is there.

401
00:26:58,702 --> 00:26:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

402
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku says, whatever happened to smoking a joint, eating a Twinkie, and going to sleep?

403
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dennis Leary.

404
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:08,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, good job catching that.

405
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:11,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just add my little quick quirk and then you can move on?

406
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:12,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

407
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll move on after this.

408
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:22,152
[SPEAKER_12]: My only thing to say about addiction is if you're not hurting anybody and you're... Yeah, that's my only thing.

409
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,613
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not hurting anybody else, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

410
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but, you know, a lot of folks joke with me, like, oh, Rob, you're addicted to Warcraft.

411
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:32,006
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so addicted to World of Warcraft stuff.

412
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:35,187
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, you know, I see Megs, he's joking with Chris right now.

413
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:45,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, Chris is outside the house right now being social with people, you know, so am I. So there's a difference, too, between, like, joking about it and, like, no, like, seriously, you're fucking addicted to WoW because, like, you know, you are...

414
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: You're having social repercussions and all that stuff.

415
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:49,515
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's really funny?

416
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,057
[SPEAKER_12]: After this, I swear, you can move on.

417
00:27:52,317 --> 00:28:04,422
[SPEAKER_12]: But if all the WoW addicts will be able to say, like, when you're first loading into your character, you know how they got that little message for you when the little bar is, like, loading the thing?

418
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:12,026
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that it said, all good things should be taken in moderation, even WoW.

419
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:13,327
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was hilarious.

420
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:14,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that one, too.

421
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I like how Blizzard can laugh at themselves.

422
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's true, though.

423
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:18,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's very true.

424
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:21,451
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm out of the ambition if you want to sit there in your pants.

425
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:28,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI has a big old disclaimer that comes up every time you click to log into the game that says, The world of Vanadil is an exciting place.

426
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:34,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for so long I'd probably read the damn thing verbatim, but it says something like, The world of Vanadil is an exciting place.

427
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:37,503
[SPEAKER_06]: However, please do not neglect your friends, work, and all that stuff.

428
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:38,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

429
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:41,025
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we've got to keep it moving, but we do welcome your feedback.

430
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

431
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know anyone that's addicted to video games?

432
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,109
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of effect has that had on their life?

433
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:47,294
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to hear your emails.

434
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:55,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will get to the mailbag a little later in the show, but first, we have to feed my Castlevania addiction, because Castlevania is one of the best series in the history of video gaming.

435
00:28:55,802 --> 00:29:03,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And, well, Paul Anderson has left Castlevania to go work on his new Death Race 2000 remake.

436
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:04,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah!

437
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, that's what early reports indicated.

438
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:08,774
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, Good!

439
00:29:11,035 --> 00:29:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Race 2000 Death Race 2000

440
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:59,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Race Death Race 2000 is basically almost like Carmageddon the movie it's an old ass movie one of the first ones that Sylvester Stallone was ever in it's basically David Carradine plays this guy who's in this race that you get points for killing people with your car and at the very end he takes out the commissioner of this race I guess who's the president of the world or something like that with his hand grenade pun intended but it's so ridiculous though and

441
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see this movie.

442
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth checking out, though, if you haven't seen it yet.

443
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Race and Death Sport, both about the same thing.

444
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:10,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I could just watch The Running Man.

445
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:14,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

446
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:24,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so Hitman is getting, of course, a film made about it, and Variety is reporting that...

447
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:37,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Fox has picked it up, and they'll be shooting this week in Bulgaria's capital of Sofia.

448
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of interesting, though, it says the film's going to be filmed in South Africa, London, and Istanbul as well.

449
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Not Constantinople?

450
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Constantinople, no.

451
00:30:49,153 --> 00:31:00,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, and I guess the guy who's actually shooting this right now is Xavier Jens, who I believed... Let's see here.

452
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what else he's done.

453
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:05,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, who cares?

454
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:13,640
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is kind of interesting, though, because they're saying that one of the stars of Desperate Housewives has actually been confirmed as one of the villains.

455
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't follow Desperate Housewives too much, but apparently...

456
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Cast Member... Let's see.

457
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:23,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

458
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:30,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Dougry... Oh, Dougry Scott is going to play Suter Ian Hainsworth.

459
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

460
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Timothy... Sorry, this story was putting me to sleep.

461
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,210
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

462
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Timothy Olfant will play the lead as the Assassin Agent 47.

463
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:48,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just be a generic fucking action movie like all the others.

464
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:48,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

465
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:49,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

466
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Dougry Scott, the guy who plays, I guess, the British guy in Desperate Housewives, is going to play the villain.

467
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,381
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

468
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:05,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for that, and we will be sure to not see that and wait for a DVD so I can Netflix it.

469
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

470
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:13,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, one other great fucking same old thing we like to look forward to every week here is the mailbag here at orangeontrader.com.

471
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:18,270
[SPEAKER_06]: People email us, and of course that email address is mailbag at orangenotesradio.com.

472
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,912
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura likes to dive in headfirst into the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails.

473
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

474
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:23,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And read them.

475
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:27,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, April fools, or so she tells me.

476
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:30,095
[SPEAKER_06]: She likes to read them here on the air.

477
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

478
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:33,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make me shove this mic up your butt.

479
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:37,258
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Texas for Boys.

480
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, anyway.

481
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:47,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, OLR.

482
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just listening to the last episode of OLR and I heard about the youngest OLR listener, a 12-year-old.

483
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,354
[SPEAKER_15]: But now I declare myself the second youngest listener of OLR at 13 years old.

484
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:58,398
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what you guys say, I'll still listen to you because you guys are great.

485
00:32:58,558 --> 00:32:59,219
[SPEAKER_15]: From Ron.

486
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ron.

487
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:06,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, if this kid is 13, then that means he was born in 94, right?

488
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:08,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I know, I was like a sophomore.

489
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

490
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:11,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for making me feel old, Rob!

491
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in 4th grade.

492
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,423
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was your age!

493
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:16,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in 2nd grade.

494
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,966
[SPEAKER_13]: No, wait, I was in first grade.

495
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:36,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy crap.

496
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on a date with your mama.

497
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:39,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night.

498
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:40,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

499
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,049
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wasn't.

500
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,051
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is from Alex.

501
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:48,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Alex.

502
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:51,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I said that Rondo of Blood sucked because it was on PSP.

503
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,314
[SPEAKER_15]: PSP equal to evil.

504
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:53,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Youngest OLR listener.

505
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:55,155
[SPEAKER_15]: P.S.

506
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:56,615
[SPEAKER_15]: My parents don't know I listen to this.

507
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,056
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

508
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,857
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to call them live on air.

509
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:02,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know what your kid is listening to?

510
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:03,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

511
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

512
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Rondo of Blood is awesome.

513
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:07,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

514
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:09,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we have a joke.

515
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:11,965
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a joke.

516
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:12,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

517
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:12,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

518
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:13,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Two jokes.

519
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from... Can someone remind me how the Orange Lounge radio listeners got encouraged to send us jokes?

520
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we actually read one on air.

521
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,774
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from Arizth, I guess is how it's pronounced.

522
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:26,315
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

523
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:26,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I got two.

524
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:29,718
[SPEAKER_15]: What's meant to go deep and is full of semen?

525
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:31,899
[SPEAKER_06]: A penis?

526
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:32,420
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

527
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,680
[SPEAKER_12]: A submarine.

528
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,000
[SPEAKER_12]: A submarine.

529
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:33,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up, Rob.

530
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:13,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been listening to your podcast and it's a PSP RSS feed enabled and it's good to listen to you guys because you work during the day and make such a great effort to do the shows on Sunday night in your own time and that's

531
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,209
[SPEAKER_15]: and Achievement for Anyone.

532
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:20,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this person uses the mixing numbers and shit with their words.

533
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:21,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a MySpace message.

534
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:23,053
[SPEAKER_15]: So this fucking pisses me off.

535
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:25,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to read it because it's cool that you took the time to write us.

536
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,457
[SPEAKER_15]: But next time, please actually use full words.

537
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Spell everything out and if in doubt, use a spell checker.

538
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,099
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's fucking awesome?

539
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

540
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Punctuation.

541
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Punctuation is great.

542
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:42,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we put that on a poster with Chris's picture doing a big thumbs up?

543
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's fucking awesome?

544
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:46,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Punctuation.

545
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:53,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure that when you use your spell checker, the words that have been spelled check are the right versions of the word that you want to spell check.

546
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:55,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, B-R-A-K-E.

547
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That's in your card, dummy.

548
00:35:58,371 --> 00:35:58,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry.

549
00:35:58,952 --> 00:35:59,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the email.

550
00:35:59,832 --> 00:36:00,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to the email.

551
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:01,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to the email.

552
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,803
[SPEAKER_15]: because when I get home from work, I'm tired.

553
00:36:07,923 --> 00:36:10,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't listen to the live show due to time zones.

554
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I sold my PSP, and funny enough, but you guys stuck with me.

555
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:18,627
[SPEAKER_15]: I enjoy your show so much that I now download the podcast on my PC and listen every Mondays and Wednesdays.

556
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki PSP is fun.

557
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:28,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Alex Customs gets real boring once you kit it up to the max, LOL, hence the word sold it.

558
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, I just wanted to tell...

559
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:36,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell you that you guys are doing a really great show for us hardcore and non-hardcore gamers.

560
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:43,586
[SPEAKER_15]: With all your efforts with keeping us updated on the gaming world, I wish you the best on the future and more to come.

561
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Rice Princess LOL.

562
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:48,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I have a headache.

563
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:49,968
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you!

564
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it when listeners send us nice things.

565
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't get me wrong, but please don't email us.

566
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:56,762
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense.

567
00:36:56,802 --> 00:37:04,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to dog on you or anything, but just because you type the email on your computer, which doesn't have access to the Internet, it's still not the Internet.

568
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:07,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So please don't talk like you're on the Internet.

569
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you know.

570
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, next email.

571
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:12,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

572
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:12,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

573
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a quick something for Chris.

574
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:18,088
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit late, but I'm sorry I'm slow because the files on my computer are misorganized.

575
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:18,808
[SPEAKER_06]: But here you go, Chris.

576
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:23,786
[SPEAKER_06]: This mailbag segment was ruined to you, courtesy of DJ Alligator Project.

577
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the vinyl, by the way.

578
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I buy you a Guitar Wolf CD once?

579
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:27,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Record.

580
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,494
[SPEAKER_15]: You were supposed to rip that for me.

581
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:50,274
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I bought it for you.

582
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:51,015
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding.

583
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:53,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, next one.

584
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:54,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, love your show.

585
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,877
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to send you a message that we should all ponder about.

586
00:37:57,237 --> 00:37:59,278
[SPEAKER_15]: The actual cost of an Xbox 360.

587
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:05,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that the Elite finally announced, is the 360 still the cheapest current-gen hardware?

588
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,201
[SPEAKER_15]: No way.

589
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:07,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me explain.

590
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:11,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone complains that the PS3 is too expensive, but I believe the 360 is the biggest rip-off.

591
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:12,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's why.

592
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,124
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, you get...

593
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,471
[SPEAKER_15]: To get a comparable 360, you must A, buy the Elite, or B, upgrade your hard drive for $179.

594
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:25,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Second, even if you buy the Elite for $479, it doesn't even compare to the PS3 in terms of features.

595
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,573
[SPEAKER_15]: A, to get the wireless network, you must pay $99.99.

596
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:32,474
[SPEAKER_15]: B, to get high-definition movie player, you must pay $199.99.

597
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:33,135
[SPEAKER_15]: To play online, you must pay $59.99.

598
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:34,695
[SPEAKER_15]: D, to charge your controller's

599
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Using the console, you must pay $19.99.

600
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:49,841
[SPEAKER_15]: So if my math is right, the consumer must pay a total of $859.95 to get a console comparable to the features and hardware featured in the PS3.

601
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:57,308
[SPEAKER_15]: So the old saying now should read, Sorry Microsoft, but I can't buy a PS3 Nintendo Wii for the price of one of yours.

602
00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me know what you guys think of this.

603
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Matt.

604
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:02,954
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3.

605
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: probably about 30 games out right now Microsoft's Xbox 360 a lot more than that I understand what this person is saying and that is true is that sometimes we are unfairly comparing the charges and when I say we I don't mean us specifically because you know obviously a lot of the internet is on the same page but again you know when all is said and done price be damned Xbox 360 has the games I want on it right now Playstation 3

606
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox still has better games on it.

607
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:36,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox has nobody!

608
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:31,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think if Sony were to really start to threaten Microsoft's grip that they've got going right now, which I think Sony may do in a year, I would not be surprised, and this has been rumors and rumblings already, if Xbox drops some elements of their gold service and they give you a little more stuff for free and the gold people get, I don't know, something else special to compensate.

609
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:32,837
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been talking about those.

610
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:34,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That sort of rumor's been going around for a long time.

611
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:39,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Microsoft will cut corners where they have to to compete with Sony.

612
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:43,466
[SPEAKER_06]: But until Sony really has a lot more games, I don't know.

613
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:46,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I guess that's my thought.

614
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:47,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

615
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have one more email.

616
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:50,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

617
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,794
[SPEAKER_11]: One more email.

618
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:56,616
[SPEAKER_11]: One email to rule them all.

619
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:57,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

620
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:03,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I have been listening to the podcast version of the show for about two to three months now.

621
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:07,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, technically it says two-thirds of a month, but I think it means two to three months, I hope.

622
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:10,736
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I have managed to catch a couple of live shows.

623
00:41:10,796 --> 00:41:12,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to give you all props because the show is great.

624
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,899
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Loki's insider info and the comedy of Rob and Jamie's bickering like siblings.

625
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,299
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because Rob's my bitch.

626
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

627
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know me.

628
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:22,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit down.

629
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:23,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

630
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:23,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom!

631
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:23,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Mom!

632
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid!

633
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Be quiet!

634
00:41:28,407 --> 00:41:28,887
[SPEAKER_15]: www.DarkSakura.com

635
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:54,522
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

636
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, your mom was the bus driver on South Park.

637
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit down!

638
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:25,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up!

639
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,622
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say?

640
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:31,423
[SPEAKER_15]: My mom was a screamer.

641
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, back to the email.

642
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:33,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Really now?

643
00:42:35,484 --> 00:42:37,104
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I'm not breeding, okay?

644
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:38,604
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to be like my mom.

645
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:39,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Really now?

646
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:45,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's where I learned how to drown out while people are talking to me.

647
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:48,800
[SPEAKER_15]: and then repeat everything they just said.

648
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
[SPEAKER_15]: It also helped me pass tests when I was in high school.

649
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Mailbag, please.

650
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:51,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

651
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:59,803
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure that y'all have had this debate before, but I'm looking at finally taking the plunge and investing my summer into an MMO.

652
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:01,443
[SPEAKER_15]: I am at ends, however.

653
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:06,225
[SPEAKER_15]: My brother is hardcore hooked on Final Fantasy XI and constantly comments on its wondrousness.

654
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

655
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:37,563
[SPEAKER_11]: So, bless you.

656
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:46,229
[SPEAKER_15]: So World of Warcraft versus Final Fantasy, and I mean that in a pagan way, versus Final Fantasy XI, keep up the good work, the show is great, and damn Life 365 increasing fees.

657
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:47,690
[SPEAKER_15]: That's from Boko Thet.

658
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can damn the government for increasing those fees.

659
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:54,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Life 365 is just doing what they have to do to stay afloat.

660
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:59,679
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want more information on that, life365.com slash choice, I encourage you all to check it out.

661
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:02,260
[SPEAKER_06]: But, anyway, back to the other topic.

662
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:03,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy XI is full of bitches.

663
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

664
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:12,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play Final Fantasy XI for two years, and I realize you're a new listener to Orin Lounge, so you kind of missed that whole period where my gaming week every week was Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI.

665
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:13,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

666
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:19,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI forces you to have a social experience and be social with other people.

667
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:27,767
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with XI is that it's very difficult to sign on for a short period of time to just kind of go, hey, I just want to sign on real quick.

668
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially since it takes five hours to get a fucking party.

669
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and sometimes you're having to really wait for a party for a long time.

670
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:42,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know Final Fantasy XI, recently I read something about a new patch they're doing that's addressing some of those issues to try and make smaller parties more effective.

671
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:53,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know, the reason why I've stuck with Warcraft is that sometimes you have to party, but there's so much you can do solo as well that kind of keeps the game going.

672
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:58,367
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing, though, that I think would maybe woo you over this,

673
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:02,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out, I mean, Warcraft does the 10-day free trial.

674
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:04,654
[SPEAKER_06]: To my knowledge, Final Fantasy XI offers nothing similar yet.

675
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:08,197
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe you could watch your brother, whoever you said has it, play it for a little bit.

676
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:11,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the 10-day free trial for WoW.

677
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:11,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it out.

678
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,240
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't like it, maybe Final Fantasy XI is more your taste.

679
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:19,163
[SPEAKER_06]: If Final Fantasy XI ever chooses to do a free trial, I would say go for that as well.

680
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,285
[SPEAKER_12]: For someone who, again, is addicted to WoW.

681
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:24,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

682
00:45:24,546 --> 00:45:24,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Magic!

683
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:25,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Magic!

684
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:34,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually very antisocial when it comes to games, and the only reason I picked up World of Warcraft is because I'm a big fan of Blizzard.

685
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:39,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to play Diablo 2 and Diablo and whatnot, and the expansions on that.

686
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:41,677
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm a solo game player.

687
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:49,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like interacting with a lot of people, and then every now and then I'll want to chat with people, but most of the time people are just stupid, so I don't want to go near them.

688
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:51,988
[SPEAKER_12]: But WoW is actually really fun.

689
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:57,412
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do it all by yourself, and you can only team up if you want to, and that's the reason I like it a lot.

690
00:45:57,953 --> 00:46:07,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And, I mean, any MMO is going to have some annoying little aspects of it, but I just found that WoW is a lot more easier to deal with if you don't want to deal with other people.

691
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they dance.

692
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:17,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they do, but to Final Fantasy XI's credit, there is no Taru slash Panic.

693
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:19,404
[SPEAKER_06]: which does win in Final Fantasy XI.

694
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:21,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to see it to know what I'm talking about.

695
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, you know what?

696
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Our chat room is debating this too, and it looks like World of Warcraft is winning by a landslide.

697
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:33,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say, for those Final Fantasy XI fans who might be listening, if you want to argue your point, send us an email, mailbag at orangechanneltrader.com.

698
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:37,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitstun says, objection, Final Fantasy XI is not Final Fantasy.

699
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,909
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 says, neither.

700
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:41,949
[SPEAKER_06]: MMOs corrupt.

701
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:44,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunami says, Final Fantasy XI is dead.

702
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI remains dead.

703
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Gil Sellers killed it.

704
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:50,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Uni says, I suggest that Final Fantasy XI is not worth it.

705
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I played three years on it, and gah.

706
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:57,274
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Tyrant says, WoW has 90% of their content that can be soloed.

707
00:46:57,594 --> 00:46:59,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI has very little solo content.

708
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

709
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:15,960
[SPEAKER_15]: In my honest opinion, after having played them both, I've put more time into World of Warcraft than I have Final Fantasy XI because I could play a lot more solo if I wanted to.

710
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:26,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And to be perfectly honest, though, I actually still like Ragnarok Online more because I could just do other shit.

711
00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:27,282
[SPEAKER_15]: What the fuck?

712
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm distracting you, Pete.

713
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, boobs!

714
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:34,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you make a PSP background of that or something and put it on olrpsp.com or something?

715
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:35,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that's all.

716
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:37,664
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thanks for the emails.

717
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelandre.com if you have something you want to email us.

718
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:43,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure we'll have some Final Fantasy XI fans chiming in next week.

719
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:48,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I am kind of curious to hear, those that are still playing XI, what's keeping you in the game.

720
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you've heard a lot of us talking about WoW now.

721
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:52,781
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm kind of curious.

722
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:54,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know there's a lot of people that still play it.

723
00:47:56,722 --> 00:47:58,922
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just glad I can contribute something, because that's the only game I play now.

724
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:00,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whatever.

725
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:03,063
[SPEAKER_06]: You always contribute lots of stuff to the program, whether you'd like to admit it or not.

726
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:05,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

727
00:48:06,444 --> 00:48:10,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 2 also has a lot of folks who are addicted to it, and

728
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:14,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft has announced they will be putting out two new maps for Halo 2.

729
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I believe they just went up.

730
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:18,903
[SPEAKER_06]: They're available for $4 to download.

731
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:23,346
[SPEAKER_06]: No word yet if they're going to be free later on.

732
00:48:24,347 --> 00:48:30,332
[SPEAKER_06]: The maps that just came out are Hang'em High and Tombstone, which are maps that came... Oh, I'm sorry, no.

733
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:33,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang'em High and Desolation, which came over from Halo 1.

734
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:34,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of cool.

735
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:36,117
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a Halo fan.

736
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:37,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, if you're a Halo fan.

737
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:38,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Now bring on the Halo 3 beta.

738
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,531
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

739
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:11,233
[SPEAKER_03]: World Trade Center, and South Park, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.

740
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:22,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Warner Brothers, Home Entertainment is also adding, including, oh, this is going to be kind of interesting, Sublime and Babylon 5, The Lost Tales.

741
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:35,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And some other stuff from TV that you're going to be getting, A&E Networks, they're providing Dog the Bounty Hunter, King of Cars, Driving Force, and Chris Angel Mind Freak.

742
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:38,433
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as Gene Simmons' Family Jewel.

743
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:40,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's that show they used to make fun of on The Soup all the time, remember?

744
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:42,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Mind Freak!

745
00:49:42,954 --> 00:49:43,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

746
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:43,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

747
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:44,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

748
00:49:46,354 --> 00:49:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: ADV Films, they're going to have some anime stuff on there, so you can check that out.

749
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,376
[SPEAKER_03]: National Geographic, of course, adding some stuff there.

750
00:49:53,676 --> 00:50:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: New Line Cinemas, Bringing Snakes on a Plane, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning, Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny.

751
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:01,258
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pink.

752
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:01,438
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pink.

753
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:03,474
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pink of Destiny, yes.

754
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:10,499
[SPEAKER_03]: No, The Pick of Destiny, plus some other top titles including Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Magnolia.

755
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Total Vid is providing, I guess, some extreme sports videos.

756
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:21,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about some titles we don't all already own on DVD already?

757
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:23,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at you, Austin Powers.

758
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

759
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:33,104
[SPEAKER_06]: No offense, I mean, yay for Microsoft getting more stuff on the marketplace, but how about something to compete with the DVDs that are out there now?

760
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:33,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

761
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:35,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

762
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:37,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the TV department, more HDTV.

763
00:50:37,946 --> 00:50:41,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Also interesting is their pricing structure has changed.

764
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:45,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, basically, here's how it's going to work.

765
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:58,202
[SPEAKER_03]: The new releases now, the 720p HD movies are going to be 480 Microsoft points, or $6, while the standard size movies are going to be $4, or 320 Microsoft points.

766
00:50:58,242 --> 00:50:59,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Half and up, didn't it?

767
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:00,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

768
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:06,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic films, the HD ones are going to be $4.50, or 360 Microsoft points, and $3 for the normal resolution movies, or 240 Microsoft points.

769
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:08,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Then TV purchases...

770
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:19,014
[SPEAKER_03]: For HD, it's going to be $3, and for SD, it's going to be $2.

771
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

772
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:29,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't bought anything yet, and I'm not really looking to purchase anything anytime soon.

773
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:37,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the one movie, which was cool, the Hard Candy or whatever, because it was an artsy house movie that I didn't think I'd find in HD otherwise.

774
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:44,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But now that I have the HD DVD player and I've got some Netflix here, I got Babel on HD DVD.

775
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:44,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

776
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:48,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of using Netflix to get my movie feel right now.

777
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is not the avenue that they want to go in.

778
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, big money here.

779
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn downloads.

780
00:51:55,142 --> 00:52:00,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Confirm with a credit card number or something like that that you're over 18 or something like that.

781
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fucking awesome.

782
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see porn downloads.

783
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:05,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really think Microsoft would do that?

784
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:06,228
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

785
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it would be horrible for PR, but they should.

786
00:52:14,855 --> 00:52:16,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's a creative way they could do it.

787
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, Pimps at Sea.

788
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

789
00:52:22,558 --> 00:52:23,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Halo 3 alpha name.

790
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a joke.

791
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:27,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a movie poster for that, which looked funny.

792
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pirate with a pirate's hook for a head.

793
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:35,864
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

794
00:52:36,874 --> 00:52:37,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicken Butt.

795
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:40,795
[SPEAKER_15]: We need ninja, like, more ninja stuff going on.

796
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:45,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, because we all know that the natural enemy of the pirate is the ninja.

797
00:52:46,476 --> 00:52:48,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So... A pirate ninja.

798
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:50,317
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a pirate ninja in Weebles.

799
00:52:51,857 --> 00:53:02,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, for anyone who has been keeping up with Bullet Witch, the Xbox 360 shooting game, there is now some downloadable content... Who hasn't yet committed suicide.

800
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Announced by Atari...

801
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,996
[SPEAKER_15]: What's out is there is a white witch outfit.

802
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:14,821
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also going to be coming up a mummy schoolgirl secretary and pixie outfits later on.

803
00:53:17,463 --> 00:53:20,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Mummy slash schoolgirl comma.

804
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:23,968
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't hear Megzi.

805
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:27,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say a mummy schoolgirl secretary.

806
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,553
[SPEAKER_15]: With pixie wings.

807
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:30,814
[SPEAKER_13]: With pixie wings.

808
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:32,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I came.

809
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:33,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

810
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:33,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

811
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:38,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So also coming up, these are new missions that are 20 Microsoft points each.

812
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:41,590
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dynamite Beauty is available now.

813
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:48,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Coming up is Kladden Streaming and Great Spells and some other difficulty settings.

814
00:53:49,835 --> 00:54:05,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, there will also be, um, Caterpillar City, Endless, One-Shot Kill, Geist Search and Destroy, and enhanced, uh, additions of City of Screams, Up in Flames at 10,000 feet, Down in the Valley, The Bound Soul, and The End of Chaos.

815
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:08,725
[SPEAKER_15]: There will also be theme packs, and, um,

816
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:14,794
[SPEAKER_15]: For people who don't know much about the game, it's by the studio Kavya.

817
00:54:16,355 --> 00:54:22,279
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a third-person action game, and this witch lady has to shoot things.

818
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:25,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Which download content will make my game not suck?

819
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I was going to say, coming out next month for 100 Microsoft points, a patch that makes the game not suck.

820
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:38,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing that's really ridiculous about the whole thing anyways, is that for 20 Microsoft points, I think that's the equivalent of a quarter.

821
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make it free.

822
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:43,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, you're making a quarter off this crap.

823
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:50,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just make the goddamn content free as if, you know, sorry the game sucks so bad.

824
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to download this, by the way, because I have the game.

825
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:58,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I don't know if I want to waste a quarter on this stuff.

826
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll think about that.

827
00:54:59,982 --> 00:55:02,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I may throw it at a hobo instead, you know.

828
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be worth a little bit more to me.

829
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Mummy schoolgirl pixie wings?

830
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:09,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Quarter at Hobo.

831
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:11,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

832
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:15,602
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that P-Cross DS is coming out in Europe pretty soon.

833
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:16,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like my transition?

834
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:22,464
[SPEAKER_06]: P-Cross DS is this kind of like picture crossword type game.

835
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:23,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

836
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:24,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks like Minesweeper to me.

837
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:25,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it.

838
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:27,665
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's coming out on May 11th in Europe.

839
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a part of the Touch Generations label.

840
00:55:29,585 --> 00:55:31,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's putting it out on the DS.

841
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Over 300 puzzles.

842
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:37,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything from easy to the toughest upon tough.

843
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, multiplayer amongst the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

844
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:45,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to do some puzzling over Wi-Fi, here's something to check out.

845
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: The game has been getting very solid reviews, even though I don't make it sound very good.

846
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I haven't actually played it, so my opinion doesn't mean shit.

847
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:53,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Right!

848
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:55,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old Game Boy game.

849
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:56,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

850
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

851
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:58,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a very, very old game.

852
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:00,498
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Mario's P-Cross a long time ago.

853
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:01,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, shit.

854
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like puzzle games, too.

855
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:06,103
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I kind of actually, for some sick reason,

856
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Side of me kind of wants to get Honeycomb Beat just because it was kind of fun at that show we played at that.

857
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know.

858
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:13,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hook you up.

859
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:13,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

860
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:14,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

861
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:16,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on then.

862
00:56:18,656 --> 00:56:25,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so in case you may have been under a rock for some reason, you know, it might be nice and cool down there.

863
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:25,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

864
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hit the internet and the internet exploded because I crashed a bunch of different websites.

865
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounded just like that.

866
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:38,877
[SPEAKER_03]: That was also the same sound that was in my pants after watching it.

867
00:56:39,257 --> 00:56:42,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But, no, seriously though.

868
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:43,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

869
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That was also the sound Lindsay Lohan's vagina made shortly after she got out of rehab.

870
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:52,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

871
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:55,401
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a joke there, look for it.

872
00:56:55,501 --> 00:57:01,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently a few politicians are a little bit pissed off at the fact that the game takes place in Liberty City.

873
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Note to politicians, the game is taking place in Liberty City for about four different games now.

874
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the fuck were you?

875
00:57:11,342 --> 00:57:17,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so now they're just like, oh, but now that it really looks like New York, we don't like it.

876
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:23,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny because I'm going to quote this, I think the best one I read here, story about it was on Kotaku.

877
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:27,457
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying, and here's some of the quotes that they picked out here.

878
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting Grand Theft Auto in the safest big city in America would be like setting Halo in Disneyland.

879
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,978
[SPEAKER_03]: City Councilman Peter VanLore.

880
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play Halo.

881
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo in Disneyland might make me interested in that game a whole lot more than I already am.

882
00:57:48,187 --> 00:57:51,270
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be right up there with the lady on the cell phone in the SUV game.

883
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing police officers.

884
00:57:59,421 --> 00:58:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Post, spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg.

885
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:05,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the best one, and probably the most uninformed.

886
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:14,030
[SPEAKER_03]: In previous incarnations, players advanced through the game by killing cops, selling pornography to children, and killing prostitutes.

887
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to take a wild guess here.

888
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of those three is not right.

889
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:26,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Must be the killing cops part, because, you know, I don't think you sell pornography to children in there.

890
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:30,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not, you know, Grand Theft Auto child pornographer.

891
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they put that in Grand Theft Auto 4, that would be a great new feature.

892
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:36,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a cool side mission.

893
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:39,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, though, they're going to bitch and moan.

894
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:41,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to build up the hype for it.

895
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:46,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain people are going to file lawsuits, and the game's going to come out and fucking rock.

896
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So, way to go, Rockstar.

897
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to hype up your games.

898
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:54,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes the hype train.

899
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:55,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo-choo.

900
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:55,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo-choo.

901
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It did look good, though.

902
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:58,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

903
00:58:58,053 --> 00:58:59,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to play it.

904
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you what I'm happy about, though.

905
00:59:02,394 --> 00:59:03,855
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy about more Ninja Gaiden.

906
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:06,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I need to play this demo.

907
00:59:07,156 --> 00:59:09,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been a big Ninja Gaiden fan, like, forever.

908
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:18,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So coming out on the Japanese PSN, we have the demo for Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

909
00:59:18,661 --> 00:59:20,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is not Gaiden, it's Gaiden.

910
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:22,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Pronounce it right, fuckers.

911
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:27,892
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a joke I want to make, but I can't.

912
00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:30,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make my people angry.

913
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:41,875
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it just really pisses me off because I grew up and I was like, I don't think that's how it's supposed to sound.

914
00:59:42,456 --> 00:59:44,816
[SPEAKER_15]: And Gaiden, by the way, means side story.

915
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, anyway.

916
00:59:47,237 --> 00:59:48,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being so Gaiden.

917
00:59:49,658 --> 00:59:50,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to kick your butt.

918
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:55,707
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, you run around in tight leather.

919
00:59:56,187 --> 00:59:57,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it is a little gay.

920
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:06,113
[SPEAKER_06]: That made Jamie's bitching all worth it, seriously.

921
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,514
[SPEAKER_15]: But the demo is to be out.

922
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see a date.

923
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:13,137
[SPEAKER_15]: April 27th is going to be their date.

924
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:15,279
[SPEAKER_15]: So happy birthday to me.

925
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:19,041
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

926
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:34,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, while DarkSakura's playing Ninja Gaiden on her PlayStation Network heart, Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is coming out for the DS, and it's been spotted in Famitsu Magazine.

927
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:42,725
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is completely controlled on the touchscreen, but not blocking, so don't expect your typical 2D Ninja Gaiden.

928
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, I'm sure that controls like awesome.

929
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:47,377
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

930
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:50,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, very little is known about the game except for the fact it's on its way.

931
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you can read Japanese, maybe you can get some more out of that than I can.

932
01:00:53,143 --> 01:01:03,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hear that this was shown during, I think, one of their gamer days or whatever, the equivalent of a press event, and it didn't control very well.

933
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:08,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, the game is still early in development, and they can fix that, but there were some issues.

934
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:10,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

935
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:11,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

936
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways...

937
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:14,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Enable the Halo 3 Beta

938
01:01:42,067 --> 01:01:47,030
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, one of the things they're going to be adding a new multiplayer mode that was based off of some YouTube videos.

939
01:01:48,812 --> 01:01:49,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty interesting.

940
01:01:50,513 --> 01:01:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, also rumors that they might do airborne cars as well.

941
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there is, there has been a... Wait, flying cars?

942
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't there already a patch for that?

943
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:04,842
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you do for the flying car?

944
01:02:06,763 --> 01:02:10,105
[SPEAKER_05]: You know... Meet George Jetson, his boy Elroy.

945
01:02:12,876 --> 01:02:18,320
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean... Okay, but there are going to be some free updates.

946
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was one that was fixing the patching stuff.

947
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:27,427
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that they added that's going to be increasing the number of gang-controlled cars that are roaming the streets for certain achievements.

948
01:02:28,028 --> 01:02:35,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be, later on, I guess, a free thing to reset the gangs so that all the bosses come back to their normal spot.

949
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:40,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can play co-op and get that co-op achievement for finishing all the missions that we need to do.

950
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:43,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been playing the game?

951
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:44,658
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

952
01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:47,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Strangely enough, I've been playing Tetris a lot this week.

953
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:55,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the achievements are not that hard, so I'm trying to get my 1500 score by mid-April or whatever it was.

954
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:58,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have much time left, and I have like 600 points to go.

955
01:02:58,626 --> 01:02:59,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You two may win Contra.

956
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:00,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Contra.

957
01:03:01,008 --> 01:03:01,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have it.

958
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:02,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Contra.

959
01:03:04,149 --> 01:03:08,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's something that I'd have to say.

960
01:03:08,632 --> 01:03:10,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Some Japanese airlines are getting contrary.

961
01:03:11,214 --> 01:03:11,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha.

962
01:03:12,743 --> 01:03:28,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Japan's Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport, um, is, uh, banning, uh, local, uh, wireless gaming on flights because the Wi-Fi signal, um, allegedly interferes with the airplane's instruments, the same, you know, cell phone thing.

963
01:03:29,396 --> 01:03:39,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, now, there's, uh, an interesting thing about that, as was indicated, and I'm going to go ahead and quote the, uh, the, uh,

964
01:03:40,934 --> 01:03:51,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Source of this, I think is a very good point that Joystick made, is that Lufthansa has been offering in-plane Wi-Fi since 2003 and haven't had any crashes because of it.

965
01:03:53,236 --> 01:04:02,838
[SPEAKER_15]: The FAA states that Wi-Fi is safe, so I guess that maybe Japanese planes are built differently?

966
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:04,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

967
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:06,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell does Lufthansa fly?

968
01:04:06,258 --> 01:04:08,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always seen their airline, I've never flown them.

969
01:04:08,819 --> 01:04:09,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do they go?

970
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:12,336
[SPEAKER_13]: I flew in Lufthansa when I went to France.

971
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:14,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're like a Europe airline.

972
01:04:14,377 --> 01:04:17,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, I went to O'Hare to Frankfurt.

973
01:04:18,138 --> 01:04:18,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

974
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:19,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Paris.

975
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:21,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I've never flown them because I've never been to Europe.

976
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you should go to Europe.

977
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:22,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to.

978
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:26,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any listeners out there who want to send me a lot of money so I can go to Europe?

979
01:04:28,142 --> 01:04:28,402
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

980
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:33,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of another place I want to go to, Australia.

981
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:36,766
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some interesting news here.

982
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Richie Young, who was once the Australian PlayStation 2 magazine's editor.

983
01:04:43,773 --> 01:04:53,557
[SPEAKER_06]: He says he was offered sex, money, overseas trips, and other types of gifts, all in the name of inflating game review scores.

984
01:04:54,278 --> 01:05:07,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we all know that, you know, like little handouts and freebies and all that kind of crap goes on all the time, which, you know, we try to tell you, this is why you should support indies, because the mainstream gaming doesn't give a shit about indies, and...

985
01:05:08,015 --> 01:05:09,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, have we learned that in a big way recently.

986
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:11,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not had any offers for sex.

987
01:05:11,296 --> 01:05:11,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

988
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get offers for sex, but... I know.

989
01:05:15,617 --> 01:05:18,378
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, very interesting.

990
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:23,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So that all kind of came to light this week, and of course has the internet abuzz about, you know, sex for game reviews.

991
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you have it.

992
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my nerd dream.

993
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:31,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The two things I love the most.

994
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to review video games and fuck cookers.

995
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:36,623
[SPEAKER_07]: All while leveling my blood elf.

996
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:40,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to cast a spell.

997
01:05:42,265 --> 01:05:43,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, BlackWolf.

998
01:05:43,146 --> 01:05:44,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you want to cast a spell?

999
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:45,107
There's nothing to attack you.

1000
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm attacking the darkness.

1001
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,851
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf in chat totally wins with this comment.

1002
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:54,434
[SPEAKER_06]: OLR doesn't get offers for sex, but they do get fucked.

1003
01:05:56,975 --> 01:05:58,176
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I love you, Bobby BlackWolf.

1004
01:05:58,456 --> 01:05:58,776
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1005
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:01,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyblind's open.

1006
01:06:01,498 --> 01:06:04,520
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1007
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

1008
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:05,941
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already ringing.

1009
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:07,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Chris, real quick.

1010
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:09,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, baby, I'll make it worth your while.

1011
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how can you turn that down?

1012
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go check out the phones.

1013
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,091
[SPEAKER_06]: They're ringing.

1014
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:15,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:15,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1016
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:17,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It's OLR.

1017
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It is OLR.

1018
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, this is Luigi Mario.

1019
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:24,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Hiya, Luigi Mario.

1020
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,541
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1021
01:06:26,461 --> 01:06:26,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

1022
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:28,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Just calling and saying that I love the show.

1023
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you, Luigi?

1024
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:31,746
Yes, I do.

1025
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:38,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you, uh, I mean, I've never had a video game celebrity call into the show before.

1026
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you don't have anything better to do on Sunday nights, like save a princess or whatever?

1027
01:06:43,276 --> 01:06:44,997
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because she's too busy humping Mario.

1028
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:46,458
[SPEAKER_06]: What, Luigi?

1029
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Daisy's in the back playing DDR Supernova.

1030
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:55,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Daisy's playing DDR Supernova?

1031
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:57,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't she playing DDR with Mario?

1032
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:00,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, she didn't like that.

1033
01:07:00,527 --> 01:07:02,628
[SPEAKER_10]: She wanted something to up her game.

1034
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:05,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1035
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:06,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I got a question.

1036
01:07:06,586 --> 01:07:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always wanted to ask Luigi this question.

1037
01:07:08,827 --> 01:07:13,010
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it feel to constantly get shafted with your brother getting all the attention?

1038
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:18,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it doesn't bother me much because it gives me more time to relax and have a little fun.

1039
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:22,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Between you and me, I think Peach is a little bit of a whore.

1040
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:30,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, so are you saying you trade off Princess Peach with your brother?

1041
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:31,084
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of gross.

1042
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:31,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1043
01:07:35,797 --> 01:07:44,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but I think this joke is in another castle.

1044
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:45,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know what to say.

1045
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait.

1046
01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:50,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Luigi, I'm going to ask you, what made you decide to call into our program tonight?

1047
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:54,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that Charles Martinet who sent you that link?

1048
01:08:00,422 --> 01:08:01,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no, one of your listeners.

1049
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:03,764
[SPEAKER_10]: The very hard guy named Ranma.

1050
01:08:04,885 --> 01:08:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Ranma?

1051
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:07,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, he's okay.

1052
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:11,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I didn't, I didn't know why you spoke to Ranma.

1053
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:14,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma's got a big black wee.

1054
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:17,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the really true?

1055
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, have you been, have you been, uh, sleeping with Ranma as well as, uh, Princess Peach?

1056
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, I told the girl that the way.

1057
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,001
You did?

1058
01:08:27,281 --> 01:08:29,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but, hey, wait, I've always wanted to know this.

1059
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:29,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Toad...

1060
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:32,829
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

1061
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I think yes, he's a screaming queen.

1062
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:35,911
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

1063
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:38,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what the hell we're doing.

1064
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:42,457
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Luigi, say something else before I hang up on you.

1065
01:08:43,778 --> 01:08:44,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop the show.

1066
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up, all right?

1067
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:46,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be listening the next week.

1068
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:49,003
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1069
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:51,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Luigi, for the call.

1070
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:52,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so weird.

1071
01:08:52,906 --> 01:08:53,286
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1072
01:08:54,928 --> 01:08:57,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something about the damn holiday today that's making everybody crazy.

1073
01:08:58,089 --> 01:08:59,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1074
01:08:59,270 --> 01:08:59,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1075
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's Darth Vader on the line.

1076
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:01,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1077
01:09:01,392 --> 01:09:02,253
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Uni.

1078
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:03,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Uni.

1079
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:03,714
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1080
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:07,957
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you were talking about Final Fantasy XI versus WoW earlier.

1081
01:09:08,097 --> 01:09:10,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and you were a Final Fantasy XI player for a long time, right?

1082
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1083
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I was playing it for about three years, two months.

1084
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep reminding everybody that.

1085
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:20,668
[SPEAKER_14]: It turned out I was playing the wrong game.

1086
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:22,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1087
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:24,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And what made you decide that you were playing the wrong game?

1088
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:25,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Because...

1089
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:32,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody kept treating me like crap, and I was only helping everybody out that I possibly could.

1090
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a white mage, weren't you?

1091
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:35,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1092
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:37,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a white mage, and that's why I quit.

1093
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also a white mage.

1094
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:40,797
[SPEAKER_15]: The white mage is the party bitch.

1095
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:42,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I know.

1096
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,139
[SPEAKER_15]: That dropped to 75, come on.

1097
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:48,321
[SPEAKER_15]: This is where my decision to quit the game was.

1098
01:09:49,582 --> 01:09:51,042
[SPEAKER_15]: And Rob has seen me play.

1099
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:53,043
[SPEAKER_15]: I did fucking macros with a controller.

1100
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:55,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I did everything manually.

1101
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,243
[SPEAKER_06]: You did everything manually?

1102
01:09:58,763 --> 01:09:59,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1103
01:09:59,123 --> 01:10:00,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, you're nuts.

1104
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:01,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was patient.

1105
01:10:02,804 --> 01:10:03,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1106
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:04,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say... Well, you have to be for that game.

1107
01:10:05,044 --> 01:10:09,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I would call up 20 seconds to buff to give everyone plenty of freaking time to get there.

1108
01:10:10,145 --> 01:10:14,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And our team was like, I'm going to go pump this log.

1109
01:10:16,407 --> 01:10:21,587
[SPEAKER_15]: So when the bitch comes and we call in our thing and say, where's my buff?

1110
01:10:21,627 --> 01:10:23,368
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, no, you suck.

1111
01:10:23,408 --> 01:10:24,288
[SPEAKER_15]: So I let him die.

1112
01:10:25,049 --> 01:10:28,210
[SPEAKER_15]: by going all Black Mage on whatever our thing was.

1113
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:34,452
[SPEAKER_15]: And then he's messaging me like, I'm like, no, you're the bastard who didn't show up.

1114
01:10:36,092 --> 01:10:42,394
[SPEAKER_14]: I also leveled Ninja and Black Mage, all both to 75.

1115
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite class I think I ever played on Final Fantasy XI was probably when I

1116
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:52,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, though, have to say that I loved Monk.

1117
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Monk was pretty great.

1118
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:56,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to level that to 75, but that was before I decided to quit.

1119
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:18,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Uni, one more question for you.

1120
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: What is WoW giving you that Final Fantasy XI was lacking?

1121
01:11:23,419 --> 01:11:34,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Rested EXP, a lot more better people that don't treat me like crap, and I can solo my EXP instead of being the party's bitch.

1122
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:38,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you playing a priest in WoW?

1123
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:40,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-uh, I'm playing a tank.

1124
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:43,003
[SPEAKER_06]: See, well, it's a different type of character, but then again,

1125
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:46,493
[SPEAKER_06]: The priests I know don't get treated like bitches in WoW, so I don't know.

1126
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:48,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, priests get treated like bitches.

1127
01:11:48,775 --> 01:11:49,336
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends.

1128
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.

1129
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Uni, I've got to let you go so we can get to some other calls.

1130
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:54,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Any really quick last messages for our listeners?

1131
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:55,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1132
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:57,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen to Die in a Fire.

1133
01:11:57,403 --> 01:11:57,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1134
01:11:58,544 --> 01:11:58,825
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1135
01:11:58,885 --> 01:11:59,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Uni.

1136
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1137
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:04,029
[SPEAKER_06]: She has a cute little picture on her phone.

1138
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:04,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

1139
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:04,990
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her.

1140
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,391
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her.

1141
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:06,332
[SPEAKER_12]: A little Skype picture.

1142
01:12:06,352 --> 01:12:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: A little Skype picture.

1143
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:07,773
[SPEAKER_06]: We like it when listeners...

1144
01:12:08,015 --> 01:12:08,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven's Dolphin

1145
01:12:34,508 --> 01:12:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

1146
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:35,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1147
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:04,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Gamefly is opening up a new, this is not bullshit, they're opening up a new distribution center in Pittsburgh.

1148
01:13:05,234 --> 01:13:09,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's good for me because I don't have to wait eight days for a turnaround.

1149
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:11,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I had heard of that and that is very good news.

1150
01:13:11,997 --> 01:13:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we'll really, you know, I think part of the thing I like about Netflix is that they have a distribution center in West Sacramento.

1151
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:21,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So I always get movies within a day, always.

1152
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:27,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I can imagine how frustrating that's got to be to have Gamefly and you're on the East Coast and you're waiting so long for games.

1153
01:13:28,178 --> 01:13:29,638
[SPEAKER_06]: GameFly is a good idea in theory.

1154
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:33,319
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I really don't know why I'm not using it or something similar.

1155
01:13:33,419 --> 01:13:36,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear there's one for games and flicks that maybe I should look into.

1156
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:36,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1157
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they not good?

1158
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever the case is, I probably should be doing this with games, but for some reason I keep buying.

1159
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1160
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:47,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an addiction or something.

1161
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:50,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1162
01:13:51,502 --> 01:13:52,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations on that.

1163
01:13:53,002 --> 01:13:56,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know how the service improves for you once that happens.

1164
01:13:57,742 --> 01:13:59,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm fine with the service already.

1165
01:13:59,423 --> 01:14:02,804
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, like I said, the turnaround time sucks.

1166
01:14:04,185 --> 01:14:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf agrees, by the way, that games and flicks sucks.

1167
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:09,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, BlackWolf.

1168
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:12,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what else is on your mind?

1169
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:17,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Resurrection hit the PlayStation 3 today.

1170
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, on the PlayStation Network store?

1171
01:14:22,112 --> 01:14:22,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Or yesterday.

1172
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:23,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It hit.

1173
01:14:24,153 --> 01:14:25,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no joke, right?

1174
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:27,215
[SPEAKER_02]: No joke.

1175
01:14:27,736 --> 01:14:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool.

1176
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:29,037
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I know that?

1177
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've said that on my podcast.

1178
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:32,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

1179
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this just a cheap plug for your own podcast?

1180
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:35,681
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1181
01:14:36,081 --> 01:14:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1182
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:39,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, have you downloaded Tekken yet?

1183
01:14:40,985 --> 01:14:41,825
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a PlayStation 3.

1184
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:43,946
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a problem.

1185
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:45,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1186
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:46,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious.

1187
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:50,591
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf says Tekken Dark Resurrection came up a few weeks ago.

1188
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:56,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw some story about it, but again, I don't have a PS3, so I've been able to check for myself.

1189
01:14:57,655 --> 01:15:00,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Raven's Dolphin might have been a little late for that train.

1190
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:01,556
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1191
01:15:01,576 --> 01:15:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess where I got it was old.

1192
01:15:04,757 --> 01:15:06,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I put that on the disclaimer on the thing anyway.

1193
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:07,717
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1194
01:15:08,497 --> 01:15:09,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's okay.

1195
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:10,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind, buddy?

1196
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:15,639
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm not going to even plug the podcast.

1197
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:16,379
[SPEAKER_17]: You all know about it.

1198
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:17,039
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1199
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:18,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, Raven's Dolphin.

1200
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,320
[SPEAKER_06]: The infamous, the one and only.

1201
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1202
01:15:22,025 --> 01:15:23,486
[SPEAKER_06]: The One and Only, Raven's Dolphin

1203
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:53,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, if you play Cookin' Mama, there's like so much food in Cookin' Mama.

1204
01:15:53,943 --> 01:15:56,904
[SPEAKER_16]: You should have asked to borrow Ranma's big black leaf.

1205
01:16:16,778 --> 01:16:20,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I should have, but... Yeah, that's the whole point.

1206
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, yeah, I don't know, it's just... It wasn't really that much.

1207
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:25,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and another thing.

1208
01:16:26,324 --> 01:16:34,289
[SPEAKER_16]: On behalf of New York City, I apologize for the way our elected officials react to how GTA 4 looks like our hometown.

1209
01:16:34,669 --> 01:16:35,690
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgive you.

1210
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:42,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but it's also, you know, also forget the... Disregard what the Daily News and New York Post spews out

1211
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,282
[SPEAKER_16]: They're sensationalists.

1212
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,623
[SPEAKER_16]: They just push junk news to our eyes.

1213
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:56,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And all they do is just... They act like the Daily Bugle, if it was run by that guy, that Jameson guy.

1214
01:16:56,725 --> 01:16:59,065
[SPEAKER_15]: As in, so you do nothing but print shit about Spider-Man?

1215
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:01,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no, not even that.

1216
01:17:01,266 --> 01:17:05,067
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just that they hype up everything.

1217
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:07,768
[SPEAKER_16]: They're mostly slanted.

1218
01:17:07,788 --> 01:17:11,769
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not as neutral as other papers like the New York Times are.

1219
01:17:13,175 --> 01:17:17,719
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't take their word, I only take their word at face value and nothing else.

1220
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:21,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go back to the Wii Play tournament.

1221
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:25,244
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly, is this some tournament on Wii Play or what exactly was going on?

1222
01:17:25,264 --> 01:17:26,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it was a Nintendo World.

1223
01:17:26,485 --> 01:17:28,707
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get denied entry into this contest?

1224
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:30,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I woke up late.

1225
01:17:30,748 --> 01:17:33,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I woke up late today.

1226
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Party a little too hard, huh?

1227
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:36,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, pretty much.

1228
01:17:36,813 --> 01:17:41,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I didn't know you could like gut your Wiimote and then smoke it.

1229
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:44,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Get her done!

1230
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:44,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Get her done!

1231
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:13,142
[SPEAKER_05]: April Fool

1232
01:18:43,021 --> 01:18:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: She's okay.

1233
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:45,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1234
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero 2 for 360 will have vector pedals because there's a port at the bottom of it.

1235
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:54,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we reported something like this.

1236
01:18:54,064 --> 01:19:00,725
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a story like this a long time ago, but now it's confirmed because of the apparently the manual says so.

1237
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Pedals sold separately.

1238
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you really can't put the pedal to the metal.

1239
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

1240
01:19:10,768 --> 01:19:12,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's my impression of Rob tonight.

1241
01:19:18,485 --> 01:19:19,747
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Rob.

1242
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,140
[SPEAKER_03]: People aren't sure if this is an April Fool's joke or not.

1243
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:50,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be, but apparently they think that he's not dead because he's been active on his MSN and MySpace accounts.

1244
01:19:51,422 --> 01:19:54,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, this is going to end up fucked up.

1245
01:19:54,883 --> 01:19:57,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way you look at this story is going to end up fucked up.

1246
01:19:58,224 --> 01:20:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it was a big April Fool's joke, that's fucked up.

1247
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:07,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But if he really was dead and all these people are not believing it, that's fucked up too.

1248
01:20:08,627 --> 01:20:10,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are no winners in this scenario, only losers.

1249
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:12,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Mitch Hedberg died on April Fool's Day.

1250
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:14,368
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up too.

1251
01:20:14,969 --> 01:20:15,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone thought it was a joke.

1252
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:19,390
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you're going to smoke like 500 drugs, you got it coming.

1253
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:25,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sorry to say, but Mitch Hedberg, rest in peace, but dude.

1254
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:31,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's like, dude, that'd be so funny if I fucking died on April Fool's Day.

1255
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:33,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that crossed his mind.

1256
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, alright, well, anything else, Loki?

1257
01:20:41,225 --> 01:20:47,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, I don't really have much else other than, um, the lineup of games on Gamefly looks pretty good.

1258
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like how you can go to Gamefly and look up all these great new games that are coming out?

1259
01:20:52,652 --> 01:20:52,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1260
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:59,195
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people haven't picked up on yet, or, well, you know, maybe some folks did, but they can't really talk about it anymore.

1261
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:05,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you might want to scan Gamefly, see what they got, because apparently Gamefly, you know, they can do whatever they want, because they're Gamefly.

1262
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:06,339
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1263
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,691
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot!

1264
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:08,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I too made new wallpaper.

1265
01:21:08,632 --> 01:21:10,093
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what I was doing during the show.

1266
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:12,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Making new wallpaper.

1267
01:21:12,675 --> 01:21:14,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm proud of all of you.

1268
01:21:14,997 --> 01:21:16,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, there's a radio show going on.

1269
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:17,799
[SPEAKER_06]: My wallpaper.

1270
01:21:17,959 --> 01:21:21,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you put some of this stuff up on OLR PSP?

1271
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:23,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the PSP site?

1272
01:21:23,604 --> 01:21:24,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the Wii site?

1273
01:21:24,564 --> 01:21:25,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the love, Loki?

1274
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,748
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP site's still up, just un-updated.

1275
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:30,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Wii site?

1276
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1277
01:21:32,411 --> 01:21:33,071
[SPEAKER_03]: About that.

1278
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:35,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comin'.

1279
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon.

1280
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:38,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1281
01:21:40,092 --> 01:21:41,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1282
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:45,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, Magzy, thank you guys so much for being here and helping us with our April Fool's joke tonight.

1283
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:46,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys rock.

1284
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:47,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Get her done!

1285
01:21:47,396 --> 01:21:48,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Get her done!

1286
01:21:48,596 --> 01:21:49,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Magzy, final thought.

1287
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:53,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I had it.

1288
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, your final thought.

1289
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:00,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I had a final thought and then I forgot it.

1290
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:03,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my final thought is fuck you, DrewNami!

1291
01:22:04,346 --> 01:22:05,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you heard me.

1292
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:05,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I said it.

1293
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:06,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you.

1294
01:22:06,728 --> 01:22:07,348
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why?

1295
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,069
[SPEAKER_12]: You know why?

1296
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:15,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that one time I went into the chat room, the one time my computer was working right with the chat room, you booted me off because I was trying to get Rob's attention.

1297
01:22:18,157 --> 01:22:18,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you.

1298
01:22:19,598 --> 01:22:21,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't chat all the time, so I'm usually not there.

1299
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch!

1300
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1301
01:22:24,682 --> 01:22:25,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you, Rob.

1302
01:22:25,943 --> 01:22:31,807
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I want a hamburger, too, and watching Loki put all that burger to waste makes me a sad panda.

1303
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:32,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out of the way.

1304
01:22:33,429 --> 01:22:34,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to throw it away right in front of my face.

1305
01:22:34,855 --> 01:22:35,377
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't want it.

1306
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to eat something you've half eaten.

1307
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:38,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But it makes me go, I want a burger.

1308
01:22:39,531 --> 01:22:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you have a real final thought, Macy.

1309
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,692
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an actual final thought.

1310
01:22:41,752 --> 01:22:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1311
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:51,776
[SPEAKER_13]: If any of the people in chat or any of the people listening live in the Chicago Midwest area and are planning on going to Anime Central this year, Chris and I will both be there.

1312
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:55,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I will actually have an art table, and you should come by and see me and buy my art because it's awesome.

1313
01:22:56,178 --> 01:23:00,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think one of our listeners said she was going to Anime Central, so you guys should plan an OLR meetup or something.

1314
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:00,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we should.

1315
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:06,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I think somebody friended me from your OLR live journal because it mentioned, and she's going to ASUN, so.

1316
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:07,812
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hopeful.

1317
01:23:07,832 --> 01:23:11,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm going to try and see if I can do a promo thing for you guys.

1318
01:23:11,534 --> 01:23:12,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah, do it.

1319
01:23:12,595 --> 01:23:14,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you some flyers or something.

1320
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:16,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll do a total promo.

1321
01:23:16,277 --> 01:23:22,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to walk around with her art and the person who's going to share her art table, which is Misa, by the way.

1322
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:24,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone who is on DeviantArt.

1323
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:26,943
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're on DeviantArt, you know who Misa is.

1324
01:23:27,744 --> 01:23:31,626
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to walk around with both of their art prints all over my body.

1325
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:39,104
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'll have some oral flyers and saying, buy these prints and listen to the show or God will hate you.

1326
01:23:40,565 --> 01:23:40,905
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1327
01:23:40,965 --> 01:23:41,925
[SPEAKER_13]: But God already hates them.

1328
01:23:42,106 --> 01:23:43,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Get her done, Chris.

1329
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:43,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Get her done.

1330
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,068

[SPEAKER_06]: Uno.

1334
01:23:51,372 --> 01:24:00,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing my last two massages for my school because I did graduate but I haven't got my diploma yet and I'll have it after I do my massage final on Tuesday so everybody think good thoughts for me.

1335
01:24:02,716 --> 01:24:03,436
[SPEAKER_15]: and then... Dos.

1336
01:24:05,437 --> 01:24:06,018
[SPEAKER_06]: He says he had two.

1337
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:06,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Dos.

1338
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,583
[SPEAKER_15]: My other one is in regards to waking up at four in the morning tomorrow.

1339
01:24:15,964 --> 01:24:16,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Do not want!

1340
01:24:18,945 --> 01:24:19,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

1341
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:20,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.

01:24:27,255 --> 01:24:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: They promised me they have the best guys, you know, the guys working on Duke Nukem Forever, working on the site.

[SPEAKER_03]: It should be done very soon.

1347
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:35,720

1348
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:38,502
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't let you down like that.

1349
01:24:39,423 --> 01:24:43,166
[SPEAKER_06]: My roommate, Extrofer, just poked his head in here wanting to make a final thought.

1350
01:24:43,866 --> 01:24:45,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we should let him, but whatever.

1351
01:24:45,607 --> 01:24:46,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Extrofer, final thought.

1352
01:24:46,888 --> 01:24:49,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say, I'm straight now.

1353
01:24:50,723 --> 01:24:52,463
[SPEAKER_08]: April Fools.

1354
01:24:52,663 --> 01:24:52,904
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1355
01:24:53,404 --> 01:24:54,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at my MySpace.

1356
01:24:55,484 --> 01:24:56,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in a date with the girls now.

1357
01:24:56,924 --> 01:24:57,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at your MySpace.

1358
01:24:57,905 --> 01:24:58,685
[SPEAKER_08]: That's proof.

1359
01:24:58,705 --> 01:25:01,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I'm really going to believe what I read on MySpace.

1360
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:03,026
[SPEAKER_06]: MySpace is proof.

1361
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we already did our April Fools show like two hours ago, right?

1362
01:25:05,687 --> 01:25:08,647
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is not an April... I know it's coincidence.

1363

[SPEAKER_08]: Coinkydink.

1364
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:12,768

1367
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:20,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Does, um, does, does vagina taste like pussy?

1368
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:22,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, does it taste like pizza?

1369
01:25:22,392 --> 01:25:22,432
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1370
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:24,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good, because I don't like pizza.

1371
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:27,253

1372
01:25:27,573 --> 01:25:28,673

1373
01:25:32,534 --> 01:25:33,174
