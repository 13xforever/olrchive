27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and what you, the gamer, really want to know
42000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers
46000	48000	I like Frappuccinos
48000	52000	And I like the new Cinnamon Dulce one
52000	53000	Dulce
53000	58000	I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me, Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it
58000	60000	I thought that was wrong, I thought it was Dulce
60000	63000	That's like, um, Versace
63000	66000	I guess so, that's probably true
66000	69000	Nice reference to my favorite movie ever, love it
69000	70000	I thought you would appreciate that
70000	74000	Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Lounge Radio, Loki!
74000	79000	I'm just kidding, I don't know, I had to work in a showgirl's segue somehow
79000	83000	I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl, but
83000	85000	Well then showboy
85000	86000	Okay
86000	93000	Alright, well say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl, I'm not sure, are you gonna get topless for us tonight?
93000	94000	Maybe
94000	96000	Alright, say hello to Amanda
96000	97000	Hi
97000	98000	How are you?
98000	99000	I'm good, how are you?
99000	102000	Good, now you haven't been on the, I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long long time, right?
102000	104000	Very little brief snippets
104000	107000	Don't forget you gotta almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it
107000	109000	Alright, very good, very good
109000	114000	So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right? Have you?
114000	115000	Yeah
115000	116000	Okay
116000	117000	I've been out there
117000	119000	Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio
119000	120000	Like, briefly
120000	123000	Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners, what type of video games do you like?
123000	125000	I like the Wii
125000	126000	You like the Wii?
126000	127000	Wii!
127000	135000	I like puzzle games, that's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff
135000	137000	What have you been playing on your Wii lately?
137000	139000	Uh, WarioWare
139000	140000	WarioWare?
140000	141000	Yeah
141000	142000	That's a fun game
142000	145000	And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff
145000	149000	What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?
149000	152000	I don't know
152000	159000	Um, like, the Bubble Bobble, or the thing where you shoot the little marbles up at the-
159000	161000	Bubble Bobble, you're barely getting picked up, sweetie, you can see yourself in-
161000	162000	Sorry
162000	163000	That's right, Bubble Bobble
163000	164000	Bubble Bobble, yes
164000	165000	That's right
165000	166000	Sounds good
166000	167000	That's Puzzle Bobble
167000	170000	Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide-
170000	171000	Bust a Move
171000	173000	Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it
173000	174000	Alright
174000	179000	I also like bar games, like the little, like, where you put a quarter in and you get a game and you have to, like-
179000	181000	Oh, like the touch screen games at the bars?
181000	182000	Yes
182000	185000	There's an arcade game that's very popular that people don't talk about very often
185000	189000	Those little, what do they call that, the Quartermaster, what are those things called?
189000	190000	Touch Something?
190000	191000	I don't know
191000	192000	Touch Master, I think
192000	193000	Touch Master, I don't know what the hell they're called
193000	199000	Like the one where you have to, like, where you have to get, like, all the groups of, like, two or three or more color blocks and reduce them
199000	203000	I like that, like the blockus, or no, I don't know if it's blockus, something
203000	204000	Alright, sounds like fun
204000	205000	Well, welcome to the show
205000	206000	Thank you
206000	207000	You're in our-
207000	208000	Mega Touch
208000	209000	You're in our chat room under your-
209000	211000	Omega Touch, thank you, whoever, who said that in chat?
211000	212000	That was, um-
212000	213000	Dark Tetsuya
213000	214000	Yeah
214000	215000	Good man, Dark Tetsuya
215000	217000	I'm sorry, I thought it said D Teaser
217000	220000	I'm like, what do you, what's the D that you're teasing?
220000	225000	Alright, um, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on the Sunday night, chat.orangelaungeradio.com
225000	231000	And, uh, Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight, she'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate
231000	232000	As she deems appropriate
232000	233000	Okay
233000	237000	Alright, um, let's go around and talk about our gaming weeks, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
237000	243000	Pretty non-existent given that I was, um, doing my, uh, last few, uh, massages this week
243000	252000	Um, I actually did finish my final on Tuesday, and, um, however, I am getting back into, uh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance because, um, Deadpool is awesome
252000	259000	Um, I, uh, for anyone who has access to my live journal, I put a, uh, link up there of, like, the funniest thing ever
259000	269000	Um, and I've been, um, screaming at our Twilight Zone pinball machine, like, loudly, because, um, I don't know, the machine's a bastard
269000	273000	I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone
273000	276000	Rob's got tea
276000	281000	Sorry, I stepped out for a minute, we can do that in radio, what, I heard you lost your balls over the week?
281000	285000	No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag
285000	286000	I see
286000	292000	No, um, I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there, got into the zone, you know
292000	293000	Oh, those balls
293000	295000	You know, don't touch the door thing
295000	298000	I'd get in the zone and then drain
298000	303000	So, your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone
303000	305000	And Deadpool
305000	306000	Alright
306000	309000	I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics, too
309000	311000	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
311000	316000	Um, I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2070
316000	326000	God, this is gonna become the new, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week
326000	328000	Because it's fun and stupid
328000	339000	I mean, let's put it this way, there's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game, I mean, you can fly up, it's like, 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground, fine
339000	344000	Just, you know, like nothing happened, helicopter will land down there and do it again
344000	354000	Um, so I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, easy on it
354000	357000	Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?
357000	358000	You can do two player co-op
358000	359000	Oh, there you go
359000	365000	And it's a lot of fun, really the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them
365000	378000	And, um, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on the easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels, um, and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet
378000	388000	So, you can actually get one weapon, it's called the genocide gun, that does a million damage, like, to an area of like 72 meters or whatever
388000	395000	It's just, you really have to watch out launching that thing because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that
395000	399000	Unfortunately you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible
399000	415000	Um, other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of, what was it, um, uh, Honeycomb Beats, yeah, and that was okay, I'm not very interested in it though, not my thing
415000	416000	Was that why you gave me your copy?
416000	417000	Yes
417000	419000	Sweet! I got free games from Loki today
419000	420000	Yay!
420000	421000	And then, um
421000	424000	Now I just have to find my DS, I seriously cannot find my DS
424000	438000	I played, um, played Crackdown a bit, that was kind of fun, um, I played another game, which I can't talk about though right now, due to an NDA, but it wasn't as fun as it would seem
438000	443000	Wait a minute, when did Loki start listening to NDAs on this program? This is something, what happened?
443000	445000	I don't think this stuff wasn't associated with an NDA right now
445000	454000	Well, it's a game for the Xbox Live, um, or not the Xbox Live, the games for Windows Live Beta, they're doing that cross-
454000	455000	Lawsuit
455000	459000	Cross play thing, and there's a game you play to test it, and it's stupid, but
459000	460000	I don't want you to get sued
460000	470000	Either way though, it's neat, I guess, I was, and the leaderboards for it though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people
470000	475000	Should, um, come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will, cause they start doing the commentary
475000	480000	I like jumping, my name is Bob, and I like to jump
480000	485000	That's the whole theme of Crackdown by the way, is to jump everywhere you go
485000	486000	Wow
486000	487000	Jump a lot
487000	491000	I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like at the top of bridges and stuff
491000	492000	That part was fun
492000	496000	And then, um, I don't know, just pure killing people
496000	497000	I like the jumping
497000	501000	And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun
501000	507000	Looking at some comments from Chatroom, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made
507000	513000	Uh, JeremyTau1 says, hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers
513000	517000	They do have like a versus mode in that, I don't know how well that would be
517000	521000	Ion671 says, it is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense
521000	525000	And JeremyTau1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?
525000	526000	Too many
526000	528000	Alright, there you go
528000	532000	Um, my gaming week, I played a game called, uh, what was it?
532000	534000	Tidepool Explorer
534000	536000	Because I went to the Monterey Aquarium
536000	540000	Because William took me to Monterey this weekend and it surprised me with a nice little weekend thing
540000	544000	So we went to Monterey and um, and you know, it got me thinking like
544000	547000	They got these cool little educational things for kids
547000	550000	And it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had
550000	553000	Uh, like you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
553000	557000	Remember that, Rocky's Boots, and what were the other MECC games?
557000	559000	Oregon Trail, I guess
559000	560000	Number Munchers
560000	561000	Number Munchers, hell yeah
561000	565000	Like, oh, I'm gonna write this whole Nostalgia article for the community all-game site
565000	566000	Turtle
566000	567000	Turtle?
567000	570000	Oh, or what was that, what was the language? Logo?
570000	572000	Was that the language they made us all learn in like third grade?
572000	573000	We had the turtle?
573000	574000	Yeah
574000	577000	Like, drop pen, 30 north or something
577000	580000	Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn
580000	584000	Um, so yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was the little game where you walk
584000	586000	But it was like, it was like you had two screens
586000	588000	Like, they had four people playing it at once
588000	590000	And you had this big screen in the middle
590000	592000	And then you had a little screen right in front of you
592000	595000	Like an old, uh, picture one of those, um, what do they call them?
595000	597000	Tabletop, like Ms. Pac-Man?
597000	600000	What do they call those games back in the day when they had the, is it just tabletop?
600000	601000	Cocktail?
601000	603000	Cocktail, it was like a cocktail machine
603000	606000	And uh, yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the tidepools
606000	608000	And on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say
608000	613000	Um, pick up, you know, uh, so you could like pick up the shell
613000	617000	Or you could, you know, throw away, like if you found a trash can you could throw it away
617000	620000	Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to like
620000	624000	You know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tidepools and what you can't
624000	626000	So it's just kind of neat
626000	628000	This old stingray will stab you through the heart
628000	632000	Crikey! Um, but yeah, William commented, I know he was like
632000	634000	Oh, that looks like a DS game, and it kind of was
634000	637000	So, I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things
637000	642000	Usually when I see educational games I try to figure out how to break them, but you know
642000	648000	And then we saw, we saw, um, um, penguins
648000	650000	And that made me very happy, not a video game, like actual live penguins
650000	653000	That made me very happy, that's why we went to the aquarium in the first place
653000	657000	We need to get you like your own copy of Portable Pango
657000	660000	Oh, I love Pango, that's one of my favorite games, it's a good game
660000	662000	Alright, it's on that Konami game thing
662000	664000	Is it really? Sweet!
664000	668000	Oh wait, not Puyen, Puyen's different
668000	669000	Oh, maybe it's Puyen
669000	671000	Yeah, Puyen's way different, Puyen's like the free little pig
671000	673000	Puyen's like the dumb little bubble game
673000	675000	Yeah, I had that when I was 64
675000	676000	Wait, I don't know, it says on the back
676000	678000	Pango was a Sega game, wasn't it? I took it in my room
678000	680000	Wasn't Pango a Sega game?
680000	681000	Maybe it was
681000	682000	I think it was
682000	683000	Um, now I've got to find out
683000	684000	Nah
684000	687000	Alright, anywho, uh, let's see, what else?
687000	692000	Oh, but so actual games I really did play, uh, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, hello
692000	693000	Pango is by Sega
693000	696000	Thank you, um, was that from Wikipedia? Or from chat?
696000	697000	No, it was from Google
697000	698000	Alright, sweet
698000	708000	Um, Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the Playstation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on
708000	712000	So I knew to wait and not buy it on Playstation 2, so it's been a long time since I've played Guitar Hero
712000	714000	Because the first one kind of wore off for me
714000	717000	And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2, it's fun
717000	721000	Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did
721000	727000	I don't know, I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs, and there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game
727000	728000	But, you know, it's cool
728000	731000	I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child in mind
731000	734000	I mean, come on, like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero 2?
734000	737000	Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?
737000	740000	It does have a animation thing in the beginning, I don't know if it's the same as commercial
740000	743000	Where they're, like, uh, fighting off a meteor or something like that?
743000	746000	I'm not sure, but there's unlockable videos, I haven't unlocked them yet though
746000	751000	That was awesome, that actually kind of would make me want to buy the game, because it's kind of badass
751000	752000	I don't know
752000	756000	Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, Guitar Hero 2 is fun
756000	760000	Graphics, obviously a step up from the Playstation 2 because it supports widescreen
760000	765000	It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics
765000	768000	The controller itself works pretty good
768000	771000	My whammy bar seems screwy, but now I'm hearing there's a recall
771000	773000	So I bet you anything I got one of those guitars
773000	774000	I did
774000	775000	Did you really?
775000	776000	I haven't played it yet, so
776000	777000	Shit
777000	778000	We'll check mine live on air a little later
778000	781000	If you have one, I probably have one too, because ours came from the same place
781000	784000	Yeah, they basically said it was, like, two different versions of it or something
784000	788000	It's, like, I think it's something probably easy to fix, but, you know
788000	791000	I knew my whammy bar seemed screwy for some reason, but anyway
791000	794000	But, uh, yeah, I mean, there's lots of stuff to unlock
794000	796000	I like the leaderboards
796000	799000	I hear a lot of people saying they can't do online co-op though
799000	802000	They can't do online co-op because, heaven forbid, lag gets in the game
802000	806000	But then I'm thinking, well, DDR kind of has online co-op, and that works, even with the lag
806000	812000	I mean, granted, guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it
812000	815000	So you wouldn't be able to really, I mean, that would be the lagged part
815000	818000	Whereas DDR, you know, the way DDR gets away with it
818000	822000	Is it kind of shows you the steps with, or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag
822000	824000	But it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that
824000	825000	You're playing your own game
825000	826000	So I think they could do it
826000	829000	They just would have to get creative with how the music track plays
829000	830000	You know what I mean?
830000	834000	They obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes
834000	836000	When you screw up, it goes, you know, those little things
836000	838000	Well then they have, like, amplitude online
838000	839000	I have to displace those
839000	841000	And where you could do co-op with amplitude and stuff like that
841000	842000	I'm almost positive they did
842000	844000	Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, they had amplitude
844000	846000	So I'm pretty sure it can be done
846000	847000	I don't know
849000	850000	DevilKai in chat says
850000	854000	Hey Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version
854000	856000	Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.
856000	858000	This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way
858000	861000	It does seem like the pick is a little bit different
861000	865000	If you're getting lag, I would urge you to go into the video options
865000	867000	Hit start and go into the video options
867000	869000	And you can actually calibrate your screen
869000	871000	Because some HDTVs have the lag
871000	873000	Because of the upscaling or whatever it does
873000	874000	I don't know
874000	876000	You really shouldn't have that on an Xbox 360 though
876000	878000	Because it has a native HD signal
878000	879000	But I know either way
879000	880000	If you're getting screwy lag
880000	883000	You can go in and calibrate it
883000	884000	But it's a little hard to find
884000	886000	You wouldn't know that unless you read the manual
886000	887000	So check that out
887000	889000	Anyway, Guitar Hero 2, I do recommend it
889000	892000	Especially if you don't already own the PS2 version
892000	893000	It's good times
893000	894000	It's kind of expensive though
894000	896000	If you already own the PS2 version
896000	899000	You might want to question how important is it to you to have it on next gen
899000	901000	Because I don't know
901000	903000	Granted, there's a couple new songs
903000	906000	Some slightly prettier graphics and the whole online leaderboards
906000	909000	You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you
909000	911000	Oh, speaking of achievement points real quick
911000	913000	There's some really screwy ones in there
913000	916000	You fail a song on easy and get 10 points
916000	919000	You play a left-handed song and get 10 points
919000	920000	You beat tutorial and get 10 points
920000	923000	It seems like some of the scores are mis-weighted
923000	924000	I think if you fail a song on easy
924000	926000	It should be one of those ghost achievements
926000	929000	Kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles
929000	930000	Where it's just on your record
930000	931000	But it's zero gamer score
931000	933000	Or Dead or Alive has one too
933000	935000	I think if you lose 10 battles in a row
935000	936000	That goes on your gamer card
936000	939000	But you don't get any gamer points for it
939000	942000	And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other
942000	944000	Beat a song, perfect
944000	947000	Because you only get 10 points for getting a perfect 100% on a song
947000	948000	I think
948000	949000	Might have been 10 or 30
949000	951000	But it just seems some of the scores are mis-weighted
951000	954000	That's what you get for having 50 achievements in a damn game
954000	955000	But that's kind of cool
955000	958000	Because I'd rather have that than 10 achievements
958000	960000	That are really hard or really easy
960000	961000	You know what I mean?
961000	963000	It feels a little spread out having the 50
963000	964000	To me
964000	965000	But anyway
965000	968000	Alright, Mandarin
968000	970000	I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week
970000	971000	Because they already talked about games
971000	973000	Are there any games specifically this week you've been into?
973000	977000	We wound up playing doctor and nurse
977000	979000	Oh, you mean video games?
979000	981000	Video games, sweetie, video games
981000	985000	Tom beat Zelda finally
985000	988000	I watched him beat it, sort of
988000	989000	I was in and out of the room
989000	990000	Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?
990000	991000	Yes
991000	992000	Sweet
992000	996000	Other than that we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point
996000	998000	Heck yeah, I want that too
998000	1000000	That's pretty much about it right now
1000000	1004000	Since we've just been busy with other things
1004000	1005000	Like fucking?
1005000	1007000	Like fixing my bike
1007000	1008000	My motorcycle
1008000	1010000	Fixing your bike
1010000	1011000	Yes
1011000	1012000	Do you ride a bike to work?
1012000	1014000	No, not yet
1014000	1015000	Are you going to ride a bike to work?
1015000	1017000	Once I get my license
1017000	1020000	Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?
1020000	1022000	It's something we saw at E3 a couple of years ago
1022000	1024000	It's a little exercise bike but it's a game
1024000	1026000	Where it's on the street
1026000	1028000	But the graphics were kind of horrible if I remember right
1028000	1031000	It looked like
1031000	1034000	God, what was that Sega Master System game?
1034000	1036000	I think it came with every Sega system
1036000	1038000	That was like a motorcycle game
1038000	1039000	I can't remember
1039000	1040000	Hang on?
1040000	1042000	Yes, it was Hang On
1042000	1045000	It looked like Hang On to me
1045000	1046000	Alright
1046000	1049000	DarkShyInChat says Dr. Mario and Peach Live
1049000	1051000	Is that what your house is like, Amanda?
1051000	1053000	Dr. Mario and Peach Live?
1053000	1054000	No
1054000	1055000	Alright
1055000	1058000	Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us
1058000	1059000	I'm looking at chat
1059000	1061000	Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well
1061000	1063000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com
1063000	1065000	Also talking about the achievements
1065000	1066000	Blaze says
1066000	1069000	I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements
1069000	1071000	Microsoft does regulate it to some extent
1071000	1074000	Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?
1074000	1077000	I think 50 is the max and they raised it up to 50
1077000	1078000	Did they?
1078000	1079000	Interesting
1079000	1080000	Let's see
1080000	1081000	JeremyTod1 says
1081000	1083000	I think they should have negative achievements
1083000	1086000	Where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much
1086000	1088000	That would be interesting
1088000	1091000	But I do think having the ghost achievement points is kind of cool
1091000	1093000	Like the ones that are worth nothing
1093000	1095000	That are just stuck on your gamer card
1095000	1097000	You have fallen down a hole, champagne
1097000	1099000	Alright
1099000	1101000	Let's see, anyway
1101000	1104000	Let's go to some housekeeping for tonight
1104000	1106000	I don't really have a lot
1106000	1107000	So I will just say
1107000	1109000	Please listen to our spinoff programming
1109000	1112000	DarkSakura was unable to pump up the volume this week
1112000	1114000	Because Comcast went down, right?
1114000	1116000	Yes, it did
1116000	1118000	Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem
1118000	1120000	But it turned out that it was just a temporary
1120000	1122000	Alright, so Tuesday nights
1122000	1124000	You can listen to DarkSakura take your request
1124000	1126000	7pm or 7.30?
1126000	1127000	I can never remember
1127000	1128000	7.30
1128000	1130000	7.30pm Pacific, right here on orangelauncherady.com
1130000	1132000	Wednesday nights, guys on the show
1132000	1134000	7 o'clock Pacific time
1134000	1136000	Thursday nights, STFU
1136000	1138000	Also at 7 o'clock Pacific time
1138000	1140000	Is there still a club, OLR?
1140000	1141000	There is
1141000	1143000	There is, I put new episodes up there
1143000	1145000	Or reruns
1145000	1147000	Club OLR has been getting low ratings
1147000	1149000	So we're thinking of moving it
1149000	1151000	And putting something else on Friday nights
1151000	1153000	But if you want to save Club OLR
1153000	1155000	Friday nights at 7 o'clock
1155000	1157000	Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings
1157000	1159000	We'll see
1159000	1161000	No, that's right, your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings
1161000	1163000	No, what about your shows?
1163000	1165000	Oh, that's true, one of my shows did
1165000	1167000	No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings
1167000	1169000	That's just the excuse
1169000	1171000	The first case of the Mondays
1171000	1173000	I mean, it's internet radio, people
1173000	1175000	We have low ratings anyway
1175000	1177000	We don't care
1177000	1179000	But we always use that as an excuse
1179000	1181000	The thing is, it takes a long time
1181000	1183000	To create that damn show
1183000	1185000	And wife doesn't like that
1185000	1187000	And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together
1187000	1189000	It's awesome, and unfortunately you can't broadcast it
1189000	1191000	Yeah, I was working on stuff
1191000	1193000	I was actually doing a happy hardcore one
1193000	1195000	But I stopped
1195000	1197000	For some reason
1197000	1199000	I ran out of material
1199000	1201000	Let's see what happens
1201000	1203000	Let's see, Saturday at 7 o'clock Pacific
1203000	1205000	Is Travis Donovan Live
1205000	1207000	Our old buddy from Understation Live does his own show
1207000	1209000	No, he cancelled it
1209000	1211000	I heard about that
1211000	1213000	I heard there was a really nasty April Fools joke
1213000	1215000	He had people calling in, like, crying in the whole works
1215000	1217000	It was awesome
1217000	1219000	And then he said, screw you, April Fools
1219000	1221000	What a little bastard
1221000	1223000	Listen to that little bastard, Travis Donovan
1223000	1225000	On Saturday nights at 7 Pacific
1225000	1227000	Welcome to tonight's gaming news
1227000	1229000	I'll start it off
1229000	1231000	Talking about the Xbox 360
1231000	1233000	Some information has leaked
1233000	1235000	About the spring dashboard update
1235000	1237000	And this leak comes to you
1237000	1239000	Courtesy of GameSpot
1239000	1241000	Good job, guys
1241000	1243000	Yeah, I'm sure it was really leaked
1243000	1245000	It wasn't a planned release or something
1245000	1247000	I'm totally sure that was
1247000	1249000	Well, probably the article went up a couple days before it was supposed to
1249000	1251000	I imagine
1251000	1253000	Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight
1253000	1255000	And that was going to be it
1255000	1257000	Oh wait, no, I think actually he's off because of Easter
1257000	1259000	I've been following him on Twitter
1259000	1261000	I have a Twitter account now
1261000	1263000	So I could be like Major Nelson and Gamer Andy
1263000	1265000	Because I want to be cool like them
1265000	1267000	I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something
1267000	1269000	It's kind of a stalker site
1269000	1271000	Which kind of worries me
1271000	1273000	So I don't post about things as I'm doing them
1273000	1275000	I post about things after the fact
1275000	1277000	You know what I mean?
1277000	1279000	It's really the cheesy thing
1279000	1281000	It asks, what are you doing right now?
1281000	1283000	You're supposed to type in what you're doing right now
1283000	1285000	For instance, I think the last thing I put
1285000	1287000	Is I'm listening to the new Bjork song
1287000	1289000	While I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight
1289000	1291000	You're supposed to use 140 characters or less
1291000	1293000	But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update
1293000	1295000	Or IM to update
1295000	1297000	So it's kind of interesting
1297000	1299000	It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only 150 characters
1299000	1301000	So it forces you to be quick
1301000	1303000	I don't know, it's weird
1303000	1305000	But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it
1305000	1307000	And I've been following him on there
1307000	1309000	And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite
1309000	1311000	What are you doing right now?
1311000	1313000	I'm updating my Twitter account
1313000	1315000	What are you doing right now?
1315000	1317000	I'm updating my Twitter account
1317000	1319000	Alright
1319000	1321000	It's twitter.com.sky
1321000	1323000	How did we get on that?
1323000	1325000	The spring dashboard update
1325000	1327000	Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?
1327000	1329000	No
1329000	1331000	Because I bet you anything this is totally planned
1331000	1333000	Fucking corporate
1333000	1335000	They pay good money to leak the stories
1335000	1337000	I mean, I say this
1337000	1341000	The corporate website does not leak stories, okay?
1341000	1343000	It's not a leak
1343000	1345000	It's a fucking planned PR thing
1345000	1347000	That's disguised as a leak
1351000	1353000	Because there's...no
1353000	1355000	I'm sorry
1355000	1357000	I don't know
1357000	1359000	I want to say you corporate fuckers
1359000	1361000	Even though GameSpot's okay and all
1361000	1363000	It just irritates me
1363000	1365000	It's still news
1365000	1367000	So the update is supposed to come May 7th
1367000	1370000	And Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated
1370000	1372000	Some of you know this is MSM Messenger
1372000	1374000	So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360
1374000	1376000	So if you have people who aren't on
1376000	1378000	Xbox Live
1378000	1380000	You can still communicate to them through MSM Messenger
1380000	1382000	Because they know most people use AIM
1382000	1384000	So they're trying to really take a step up
1384000	1386000	I think with MSM Messenger
1386000	1388000	And what was interesting about that
1388000	1390000	Is I saw in the video that they had posted
1390000	1392000	That you can actually push the button
1392000	1394000	And use Messenger during a game
1394000	1396000	Like you could be playing a game
1396000	1398000	And you know how like right now you can bring up the sidebar
1398000	1400000	And send messages on Xbox Live and all that
1400000	1402000	Well you can bring up like a little chat window
1402000	1404000	And chat with people right in the middle of the game
1404000	1406000	So that's kind of interesting
1406000	1408000	Sorry I could be winning my game
1408000	1410000	But instead I got a pop-up coming
1410000	1412000	I'm talking to you
1412000	1414000	But that could be, I don't know
1414000	1416000	That could be kind of fun for some of those
1416000	1418000	I don't know, little arcade games and stuff
1418000	1420000	That you play, that you take turns
1420000	1422000	I don't know
1422000	1424000	You know how they call it blades
1424000	1426000	When you're going across the 360 menu
1426000	1428000	Marketplace will now have its own blade
1428000	1430000	Users are now getting inline achievement updates
1430000	1432000	Supposedly you're going to be able to see
1432000	1434000	How many points the achievement was
1434000	1436000	What the achievement is
1436000	1438000	It's like you know how right now it says achievement unlock
1438000	1440000	Little sound comes up right
1440000	1442000	You can actually now know what it is you're getting
1442000	1444000	Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get
1444000	1446000	Especially when we did something stupid
1446000	1448000	I fell in a manhole five times
1448000	1450000	Why did that unlock an achievement
1450000	1452000	Low power download mode
1452000	1454000	And auto shutdown
1454000	1456000	For those long movie downloads
1456000	1458000	You can also watch partially downloaded movies
1458000	1460000	Now you don't have to wait for the whole thing to download
1460000	1462000	And again that messenger
1462000	1464000	Will work with up to six friends
1464000	1466000	At once and other little tweaks
1466000	1468000	On the user interface
1468000	1470000	So that is the big spring dashboard update
1470000	1472000	Information leaked to the internet
1472000	1474000	Sounds kind of fun
1474000	1476000	I wish I knew people that actually used MSN
1476000	1478000	Messenger
1478000	1480000	But as it is everybody owns AIM
1480000	1482000	You use it?
1482000	1484000	Every once in a while
1484000	1486000	I have a few contacts that are primarily
1486000	1488000	On there and I just kind of keep it open
1488000	1490000	With a trillion
1490000	1492000	But don't use too many people on there
1492000	1494000	Would you want to talk to me on
1494000	1496000	Xbox while I'm playing Halo
1496000	1498000	Would you like to send me messages like you suck at Halo
1498000	1500000	Rob
1500000	1502000	You suck at Halo Rob
1502000	1504000	No one needs to actually tell you that don't you already know
1504000	1506000	Sadly yes
1506000	1508000	I do know
1508000	1510000	It's not a fucking joke people
1510000	1512000	I really suck at Halo
1512000	1514000	Supposedly
1514000	1516000	In MSN Messenger
1516000	1518000	You're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo
1518000	1520000	It's going to tell you what game I'm playing
1520000	1522000	So you can stalk me more
1522000	1524000	Don't you want to stalk me Mandarin?
1524000	1526000	She's giving me a funny look
1526000	1528000	Anyway there you go spring dashboard update
1528000	1530000	Awesome
1530000	1532000	Now if you're thinking about possibly buying
1532000	1534000	One of those Xbox 360 elite systems
1534000	1536000	There's a few things you might want to know
1536000	1538000	About the HDMI
1538000	1540000	First off that it will ship with
1540000	1542000	HDMI version 1.2
1542000	1544000	As opposed to latest version 1.3
1544000	1546000	Now what does that mean
1546000	1548000	For you
1548000	1550000	Well not too much as far as
1550000	1552000	Video is concerned however
1552000	1554000	Audio though if you want some
1554000	1556000	Really cool audio you're not going to be able to use
1556000	1558000	Dolby TrueHD
1558000	1560000	And DTS HD
1560000	1562000	Master audio streams
1562000	1564000	It's not really a problem I think for most people
1564000	1566000	Most people who I use the HDMI for
1566000	1568000	You know the video
1568000	1570000	And then you know digital out
1570000	1572000	For audio I mean really it's not that big
1572000	1574000	A difference but
1574000	1576000	I mean if you really want to get down to it
1576000	1578000	That's a problem for some people I guess
1578000	1580000	But anyways
1582000	1584000	Other differences include
1584000	1586000	They actually have this
1586000	1588000	New audio lip sync technology
1588000	1590000	I don't really know
1590000	1592000	Where that would come to play with games
1592000	1594000	Better transfer speeds
1594000	1596000	And of course if you were
1596000	1598000	Outputting above 1080p
1598000	1600000	Which you're not going to be doing right now
1600000	1602000	At least not anytime soon
1602000	1604000	Audio lip sync technology would that be like
1604000	1606000	You know how like in Kingdom Hearts
1606000	1608000	Because they didn't bother to resync the lips
1608000	1610000	From the Japanese version
1610000	1612000	The lips are all off sync with the English words
1612000	1614000	Like is that maybe what they're talking about
1614000	1616000	Like maybe you can sync that better
1616000	1618000	Maybe
1618000	1620000	Just audio is really the issue right now
1620000	1622000	I don't know
1622000	1624000	I don't really think that's a big deal
1624000	1626000	I mean
1626000	1628000	Like I
1628000	1630000	Optical is awesome I mean unless you really
1630000	1632000	Are spending the big money for you know
1632000	1634000	Your system or something
1634000	1636000	I don't really think that would be a huge deal
1636000	1638000	But then again you watch it next week
1638000	1640000	There will be a press release from Sony
1640000	1642000	Saying well we support true HD audio
1642000	1644000	We're the fucking next generation
1644000	1646000	You guys are not
1646000	1648000	I mean I can't wait to see
1648000	1650000	The press release because I know what's going to happen
1650000	1652000	Sony is more HD than your mom
1652000	1654000	There's the press release right there
1654000	1656000	Um
1656000	1658000	Yeah
1658000	1660000	So guess what there's some sad news
1660000	1662000	Sniff
1662000	1664000	Apparently
1664000	1666000	Our friends
1666000	1668000	At Rooster Teeth
1668000	1670000	Which as far as
1670000	1672000	I understand was supposed to originally be called
1672000	1674000	Cockbite
1674000	1676000	Rooster Teeth
1676000	1678000	That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite
1678000	1680000	Um
1680000	1682000	They are um
1682000	1684000	Stopping at uh
1684000	1686000	Episode 100 for Red vs Blue
1686000	1688000	They posted it on their
1688000	1690000	On their forum
1690000	1692000	But you want to know what
1692000	1694000	I call bullshit because it was posted on April 1st
1694000	1696000	Ah
1696000	1698000	But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week
1698000	1700000	It has and I don't see
1700000	1702000	Um
1702000	1704000	I've been looking through the whole thing and I don't see
1704000	1706000	Any type of uh
1706000	1708000	Disclaimer
1708000	1710000	Hmm
1710000	1712000	But I still call bullshit
1712000	1714000	They're just going to move on to Halo 3 and do a new
1714000	1716000	Either relaunch Red vs Blue
1716000	1718000	Or do something else
1718000	1720000	It's like you're ending one series and another's beginning
1720000	1722000	It's like you know
1722000	1724000	The end of Star Trek
1724000	1726000	And the beginning of Star Trek The Next Generation
1726000	1728000	There you go that's a good analogy
1728000	1730000	Very very nerdy of you
1730000	1732000	You get kudos
1732000	1734000	But think about this guys
1734000	1736000	In iTunes seriously like if you look up Video Game Podcast
1736000	1738000	Which would you download first
1738000	1740000	The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio
1740000	1742000	Or the podcast called Cockbite
1742000	1744000	Cockbite Radio
1744000	1746000	I don't know
1746000	1748000	It's tempting
1748000	1750000	For five years we might have to change our name
1750000	1752000	We should just call our show
1752000	1754000	The Naked Lesbian Boobs
1754000	1756000	Rock Music
1756000	1758000	And Drug Show
1758000	1760000	It's called Games Games Games
1760000	1762000	I think there already is a show called
1762000	1764000	Games Games Games
1764000	1766000	There's so many
1766000	1768000	I remember when we started podcasting
1768000	1770000	There were maybe like five video game shows
1770000	1772000	We should call it Look Boobies
1772000	1774000	There were like five video game
1774000	1776000	Mandarin did you just show your boobs at studio?
1778000	1780000	There were like maybe five video game
1780000	1782000	Podcasts and all and now there's like five hundred
1782000	1784000	All right
1784000	1786000	She flashed her abdomen at you
1786000	1788000	All right anyway
1788000	1790000	Sigh
1790000	1792000	Anyway
1792000	1794000	Going on to the marketplace
1794000	1796000	Why isn't there more
1796000	1798000	Red vs Blue downloadable in the marketplace
1798000	1800000	I thought they were going to do all these viral videos
1800000	1802000	And things like they have this whole section
1802000	1804000	Of marketplace for viral videos
1804000	1806000	But I can't get Lonely Girl
1806000	1808000	I can't get Alanis's My Humps
1808000	1810000	I can't get any of that YouTube
1810000	1812000	Stuff on
1812000	1814000	Microsoft Marketplace
1814000	1816000	In charge of the backwards compatibility updates
1816000	1818000	Aha touche
1818000	1820000	Good job
1820000	1822000	Well what they will have on marketplace pretty soon
1822000	1824000	Is the Forza 2 demo
1824000	1826000	There were rumors this week
1826000	1828000	That a downloadable demo will be coming
1828000	1830000	The timing though
1830000	1832000	Is still unknown
1832000	1834000	So supposedly though the game
1834000	1836000	Is coming out in May
1836000	1838000	If the information is supposed to be confirmed
1838000	1840000	Soon
1840000	1842000	The demo should be like end of April
1842000	1844000	Right ish early May
1844000	1846000	Maybe
1846000	1848000	I've been hearing that their official
1848000	1850000	Release has been the 15th
1850000	1852000	So
1852000	1854000	Mid April
1854000	1856000	Well probably I'd say late April
1856000	1858000	Cause I was just thinking
1858000	1860000	I can't think of any racing
1860000	1862000	Games on the Xbox 360
1862000	1864000	So I'm really excited to hear
1864000	1866000	That's a joke
1866000	1868000	Cause there's like 50
1868000	1870000	If you want a demo of
1870000	1872000	The second Forza
1872000	1874000	Just play Project Gotham Racing 3
1874000	1876000	More or less
1876000	1878000	Alright
1878000	1880000	MotoGP
1880000	1882000	Anyways
1882000	1884000	So as we mentioned earlier
1884000	1886000	Red Octane
1886000	1888000	And actually they have admitted to it now
1888000	1890000	But apparently there's been some issues
1890000	1892000	With the whammy bars on some of the
1892000	1894000	Guitar Hero 2 controllers
1894000	1896000	Now I personally haven't experienced this yet
1896000	1898000	Since my game is still in the shrink wrap
1898000	1900000	But you know I have picked up
1900000	1902000	The guitar and the
1902000	1904000	Whammy bar feels a little cheap
1904000	1906000	Anyhoo so
1906000	1908000	Apparently the
1908000	1910000	One's affected by
1910000	1912000	There's two skews actually
1912000	1914000	That are defective
1914000	1916000	The first one is
1916000	1918000	Let's see here
1918000	1920000	I believe it's like a 95055
1920000	1922000	And then the other one is 95065
1922000	1924000	And apparently
1924000	1926000	You can see
1926000	1928000	I'm sitting back in the room and I have my explorer controller
1928000	1930000	What'd you say now? What am I looking for?
1930000	1932000	95055 or 95065
1932000	1934000	Fuck!
1934000	1936000	I have a 95065
1936000	1938000	Ha ha! God damn you Loki
1938000	1940000	Ha ha! You stole me
1940000	1942000	This broke as fuck
1942000	1944000	Xbox 360 explorer
1944000	1946000	I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar
1946000	1948000	I'm just gonna take mine apart
1948000	1950000	Take it back
1950000	1952000	Cause you know what I wanna do?
1952000	1954000	I wanna get mad props on the internet
1954000	1956000	And get a distortion pedal
1956000	1958000	Since it can't be that hard to figure out how to
1958000	1960000	Fuck you know
1960000	1962000	That distortion pedal works
1962000	1964000	This is just a damn
1964000	1966000	What is it? Ethernet cord there?
1966000	1968000	Anyways
1968000	1970000	So yeah that's what's up
1970000	1972000	Apparently they want you to return
1972000	1974000	Your guitar
1974000	1976000	And get a new one
1976000	1978000	That's not one of those two models
1978000	1980000	They didn't really say what's defective
1980000	1982000	But if it's giving you crap
1982000	1984000	If you got it from Red Octane
1984000	1986000	You can contact them to get them RMA
1986000	1988000	Or if you purchase it
1988000	1990000	Elsewhere you may need to go bitch them out
1990000	1992000	But either way
1992000	1994000	It's stupid
1994000	1996000	Don't they test this stuff?
1996000	1998000	Shouldn't they test these batches?
1998000	2000000	If there's four different types of guitars
2000000	2002000	Made obviously there were some issues
2002000	2004000	Why revise the product?
2004000	2006000	It's the whammy bar
2006000	2008000	I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar
2008000	2010000	And when I'm playing the game it feels like the whammy bar
2010000	2012000	Has noticed it
2012000	2014000	It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one
2014000	2016000	I could tell
2016000	2018000	It works! It's not completely broken
2018000	2020000	But it doesn't do the wah wah wah
2020000	2022000	Very easily
2022000	2024000	It's either on or it's off
2024000	2026000	That's what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar
2026000	2028000	So yeah
2028000	2030000	Thank you for selling me a bum
2030000	2032000	Xbox 360
2032000	2034000	Hey it's not my fault
2034000	2036000	It's all the launch ones I think are like that
2036000	2038000	This is what I'm saying though
2038000	2040000	Why revise the designs on some product?
2040000	2042000	I mean why revise the design four times?
2042000	2044000	I mean seriously
2044000	2046000	What's the big deal?
2046000	2048000	Unless these are coming from four different production factories
2048000	2050000	Or something like that
2050000	2052000	One in China, one in Malaysia
2052000	2054000	One in Hong Kong
2054000	2056000	And two of those are fucked up or something
2056000	2058000	I don't believe
2058000	2060000	That two would be broken in an exact same way
2060000	2062000	But
2062000	2064000	I don't know
2064000	2066000	Yeah, Sycoon is wondering in our chat room
2066000	2068000	Why are there four different guitars anyway?
2068000	2070000	Kyle Snyder says
2070000	2072000	Why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?
2072000	2074000	How about
2074000	2076000	Test your product and if it's effective
2076000	2078000	Don't send out hundreds of thousands of them
2078000	2080000	SSJ100Matt says
2080000	2082000	Smash it
2082000	2084000	Video tape it and throw it on the OLR YouTube
2084000	2086000	Maybe
2086000	2088000	I'll tell you this
2088000	2090000	If I can unlock all 1000 achievement points
2090000	2092000	Or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero
2092000	2094000	Then I'll smash my controller
2094000	2096000	There's going to be tons of download content though
2096000	2098000	We'll see
2098000	2100000	When is some new DDR content coming up?
2100000	2102000	Because there's just one song pack
2102000	2104000	Don't hold your breath
2104000	2106000	Alright
2106000	2108000	Anyhow
2108000	2110000	At least I can say this
2110000	2112000	I'll say something nice about Red Octane
2112000	2114000	Because I do like Guitar Hero
2114000	2116000	At least they acted on this quickly
2116000	2118000	They realized they screwed up
2118000	2120000	And within a week of the game's release they're acting on it
2120000	2122000	So yay for them
2122000	2124000	It makes me very angsty that I have one of those crappy guitars
2136000	2138000	GS68 says
2138000	2140000	Convert your guitar to a machine gun
2140000	2142000	I'm going to have it implanted on my leg
2142000	2144000	Like Rose McGowan
2144000	2146000	Dude that's hot
2146000	2148000	What's also hot is hell
2148000	2150000	In our Effies of the Week
2150000	2152000	My Effie of the Week
2152000	2154000	Goes to
2156000	2158000	The line at Marie Callender's this morning
2158000	2160000	When I was standing in it
2160000	2162000	You stood between me and my ex Benedict bitches
2164000	2166000	Lowkey
2166000	2168000	Your Effie of the Week
2168000	2170000	Effie of the Week goes to
2170000	2172000	The movie Premonition
2172000	2174000	Because I knew it sucked
2174000	2176000	But yet I went to see it because the wife wanted to see it
2176000	2178000	Now
2178000	2180000	That movie is so horrible
2180000	2182000	I hate Sandra Bullock so much
2182000	2184000	But I got to admit
2184000	2186000	I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie
2186000	2188000	The way the character dies
2188000	2190000	At the end is so like stupid
2190000	2192000	Oh man
2192000	2194000	I just couldn't stop laughing
2194000	2196000	I was going to go into the theater and do that shit
2196000	2198000	Thanks for the spoilers by the way
2198000	2200000	Don't see it, it's a horrible movie
2200000	2202000	My Effie of the Week
2202000	2204000	Goes to the movie Babble
2204000	2206000	Bab-el? Bab-el?
2206000	2208000	Although I actually really like the movie
2208000	2210000	That was way too many pussy shots
2210000	2212000	For one movie
2212000	2214000	And it was the same pussy every time
2214000	2216000	Like I know that girl's vagina
2216000	2218000	Inside and out
2218000	2220000	In glorious HD
2220000	2222000	High definition DVD
2222000	2224000	Thanks to my player in Netflix
2224000	2226000	Wow!
2226000	2228000	Alright
2228000	2230000	Mantrin, do you have any FUs of the Week?
2230000	2232000	Yes, I'd like to say FU
2232000	2234000	To the speakers who stole our most
2234000	2236000	Motorcycle, not that we started
2236000	2238000	Fixing it
2238000	2240000	Because we have to go out
2240000	2242000	And essentially get new bearings
2242000	2244000	Because you rip the pegs
2244000	2246000	Off of that actual
2246000	2248000	Half of the bike properly
2248000	2250000	So, screw you
2250000	2252000	Don't steal shit people
2252000	2254000	Try the same fuckers who broke into my car
2254000	2256000	Like 50 times
2256000	2258000	Alright
2258000	2260000	Well
2260000	2262000	Back to some gaming news
2262000	2264000	Maybe
2264000	2266000	If I feel like it
2266000	2268000	FU to Dark Sakura for being a bitch
2268000	2270000	Hey, you know what?
2270000	2272000	People love my bitchiness
2272000	2274000	Anyway
2274000	2276000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance has 8
2276000	2278000	Downloadable characters on Xbox 360
2278000	2280000	I don't know about anything else
2280000	2282000	Which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one
2282000	2284000	But I don't care
2284000	2286000	The downloadable characters
2286000	2288000	Effective April 10th
2288000	2290000	Are Hulk, Hawkeye which makes me happy
2290000	2292000	Cyclops, Nightcrawler
2292000	2294000	Another one of my favorites
2294000	2296000	Dr. Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth and Venom
2296000	2298000	Venom is cool
2298000	2300000	Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360
2300000	2302000	Has all their abilities
2302000	2304000	Costumes, dialogue
2304000	2306000	Conversations, achievement points
2306000	2308000	But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool
2308000	2310000	If you haven't bought the game yet
2310000	2312000	And you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360
2312000	2314000	I'd wait until next month
2314000	2316000	Because they're going to do
2316000	2318000	Just like the Call of Duty 3
2318000	2320000	Characters packed in
2320000	2322000	Save yourself like 10 bucks
2322000	2324000	Or just play it on PS3
2324000	2326000	Or buy it used
2326000	2328000	Or don't buy it at all
2328000	2330000	That'd be my preference
2330000	2332000	Or come over to my house and bring controllers
2332000	2334000	Because we need more people to play with me
2334000	2336000	Alright
2336000	2338000	But no Wonder Woman
2338000	2340000	That's DC Comics, dummy
2340000	2342000	I learned that last week the hard way
2342000	2344000	I just felt like fucking with you
2344000	2346000	Alright
2346000	2348000	I learned that last week the hard way
2348000	2350000	I just felt like fucking with you
2350000	2352000	When we told you over and over again
2352000	2354000	That Knights is coming out to the Wii
2354000	2356000	And I don't know, somehow that got confirmed again
2356000	2358000	Like blogs were rerunning the story
2358000	2360000	Knights is confirmed yet again
2360000	2362000	Journey into Dreams
2362000	2364000	Or no, Journey of Dreams
2364000	2366000	And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?
2366000	2368000	But one thing we didn't hear that was new this week
2368000	2370000	Is that it's going to use
2370000	2372000	Wii Connect 24 functionality
2372000	2374000	Are you listening, Loki?
2374000	2376000	However
2376000	2378000	It's going to use the forecast channel
2378000	2380000	To bring you the real world seasons
2380000	2382000	So it's going to actually use the forecast channel
2382000	2384000	I'm assuming
2384000	2386000	If it's snowing outside
2386000	2388000	Then it'll be snowing in game
2388000	2390000	If it was snowing at midnight
2390000	2392000	You mean
2392000	2394000	Then it'll be snowing in game
2394000	2396000	Because that forecast channel doesn't update ever
2396000	2398000	It's going to suck if you live in Jamaica
2398000	2400000	And it's sunny all the time
2400000	2402000	Well then maybe you can set it
2402000	2404000	I mean, you can probably turn forecast channel
2404000	2406000	On or off, I imagine, in the game
2406000	2408000	And if it's off, it's just randomized
2408000	2410000	That's what I'm going to do when they have Animal Crossing come out
2410000	2412000	I'm just going to set mine to Antarctica
2412000	2414000	Or something like that
2414000	2416000	Why is it snowing in summer?
2416000	2418000	Because it's cold
2418000	2420000	That's what the forecast channel says
2420000	2422000	Anyways
2422000	2424000	As if this is a big surprise
2424000	2426000	I know
2426000	2428000	New colors of the Wiimote and Nunchucks
2428000	2430000	Are supposedly coming out soon
2430000	2432000	Yeah, big shocker there
2432000	2434000	It's going to be funny though
2434000	2436000	Apparently
2436000	2438000	It comes from a retailer list
2438000	2440000	According to GoNintendo.com
2440000	2442000	And some of the colors available
2442000	2444000	Silver, blue, and pearl pink
2444000	2446000	Both
2446000	2448000	Pink
2448000	2450000	And I bet you anything
2450000	2452000	The console colors are coming as well
2452000	2454000	But my question is though
2454000	2456000	Is this
2456000	2458000	The controllers aren't out there anyways now
2458000	2460000	What's it matter if they're in different colors as well
2460000	2462000	You still can't get them
2462000	2464000	People are going to be
2464000	2466000	Silver is such a weird color too
2466000	2468000	For a controller
2468000	2470000	Mandarin, you did a little
2470000	2472000	Jerk off motion when you heard this story
2472000	2474000	What are your thoughts on the Nunchucks and remotes
2474000	2476000	And different colors
2476000	2478000	I have a remote skin
2478000	2480000	Like the most rubbery things
2480000	2482000	Once I heard about all the remotes
2482000	2484000	Flying off because of sweaty hands
2484000	2486000	I went out and got one and it cuts down
2486000	2488000	So I have a pink remote
2488000	2490000	Just like Nelly does
2490000	2494000	But it does look like your wiimote is wearing a condom
2494000	2496000	I mean I just put that out there
2496000	2498000	Yeah what can I say I like to play safe
2498000	2500000	And to kind of
2500000	2502000	And your wiimote has not gotten AIDS
2502000	2504000	So good job
2504000	2506000	To clarify this also this is coming from a European
2506000	2508000	Retail list apparently
2508000	2510000	According to that
2510000	2512000	It will be shipping on
2512000	2514000	June 29th in the UK
2514000	2516000	So not of course
2516000	2518000	An official confirmation but come on
2518000	2520000	Of course Nintendo is going to do different colored
2520000	2522000	Remotes and stuff
2522000	2524000	I don't know the
2524000	2526000	Silver, blue, and pink that's kind of a weird
2526000	2528000	Combo of colors there
2528000	2530000	Isn't that all the colors of the DS?
2530000	2532000	There's no silver in this
2532000	2534000	Yeah there is the original one was silver
2534000	2536000	Silver-y
2536000	2538000	Silver-ish
2538000	2540000	Those are all DS colors
2540000	2542000	Oh sorry gray
2542000	2544000	Silver
2544000	2546000	Well we can all call it what we want to
2546000	2548000	But that doesn't necessarily make it true
2548000	2550000	Well
2550000	2552000	Something that I think is really stupid
2552000	2554000	You know we weren't really supposed to talk about this
2554000	2556000	You know situation again
2556000	2558000	But um
2558000	2560000	The uh we all remember the
2560000	2562000	Woman that drank all the water
2562000	2564000	And you know
2564000	2566000	Pretty much killed herself
2566000	2568000	How could we forget we freaking live here
2568000	2570000	It was all over the news for like months
2570000	2572000	Well um
2572000	2574000	Basically they um
2574000	2576000	Are not filing any
2576000	2578000	Criminal charges against
2578000	2580000	The radio station
2580000	2582000	Um
2582000	2584000	The district attorney
2584000	2586000	Basically is quoted saying
2586000	2588000	Jennifer Strange was an adult
2588000	2590000	Who voluntarily participated
2590000	2592000	In the radio contest
2592000	2594000	She knew what the contest
2594000	2596000	Involved when she entered it
2596000	2598000	And had the option to stop or discontinue her participation
2598000	2600000	In the radio contest at any time
2600000	2602000	However the civil suit is still
2602000	2604000	In a process
2604000	2606000	And um
2606000	2608000	That morning show though still cancelled
2608000	2610000	The staffers were fired
2610000	2612000	And they still haven't replaced it by the way
2612000	2614000	I think they're still doing that cheesy
2614000	2616000	Make your own playlist
2616000	2618000	And come in and DJ for the morning
2618000	2620000	Like they're trying to get people off the street
2620000	2622000	To fill in cause they like seriously no one will touch
2622000	2624000	That radio station with a ten foot pole right now
2624000	2626000	I would if I could play my own music but unfortunately
2626000	2628000	I actually was going to send in an entry
2628000	2630000	For it but you have to join their little
2630000	2632000	Online club but maybe I should do that
2632000	2634000	I mean wouldn't that be kind of funny
2634000	2636000	We should all send in a playlist
2636000	2638000	And just put Beyonce
2638000	2640000	My chemical romance I don't know just put all the top
2640000	2642000	40 crap on there and get in there
2642000	2644000	And do it wouldn't that be fun
2644000	2646000	No not really cause I don't listen to that station
2646000	2648000	But you know
2648000	2650000	I don't entirely agree with that statement
2650000	2652000	I think that you know she
2652000	2654000	Wasn't fully they didn't fully disclose
2654000	2656000	The risks involved with it
2656000	2658000	I mean yes she is an adult if she was
2658000	2660000	Feeling sick or whatever she could bow out
2660000	2662000	But you know I don't think
2662000	2664000	They fully explain the risks to them
2664000	2666000	As far as you know what
2666000	2668000	What's involved and what could possibly happen
2668000	2670000	And that's all going to come out in this civil lawsuit
2670000	2672000	To be honest it's no surprise
2672000	2674000	To me that a criminal charge
2674000	2676000	Wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying
2676000	2678000	They were set out to kill someone
2678000	2680000	Like they were
2680000	2682000	Going into this contest thinking hey
2682000	2684000	You know what we should do for ratings let's kill someone
2684000	2686000	Well
2686000	2688000	I don't think that would work
2688000	2690000	We thought about it but you know
2690000	2692000	I don't know
2692000	2694000	But still I still think they can
2694000	2696000	Get them on negligence just you know
2696000	2698000	For not disclosing this stuff I mean hell
2698000	2700000	If they can get Pete like McDonald's on that
2700000	2702000	Disclosing that coffee's hot
2702000	2704000	I mean they should be able to get that's a civil lawsuit
2704000	2706000	The owner of McDonald's did not go
2706000	2708000	To jail for a year because the coffee was hot
2708000	2710000	They should cause their fries suck sometimes
2710000	2712000	And they keep hiring
2712000	2714000	These people that don't speak any English
2714000	2716000	And they always fuck up my orders
2716000	2718000	That station will get sued for
2718000	2720000	Eleveny billion dollars it's coming
2720000	2722000	And they will get sold and change their name
2722000	2724000	It's counting down till the day
2724000	2726000	Till that radio station has to change their name
2726000	2728000	And then we will see the headline
2728000	2730000	On the news is at the end of
2730000	2732000	The end
2732000	2734000	Wah wah
2734000	2736000	They're saving that like headline
2736000	2738000	Saving it

2750000	2752000	You love and thrive on all that
2752000	2754000	Information
2754000	2756000	Yeah I know

2758000	2760000	I have release dates
2760000	2762000	See what I was doing was I was buying time
2762000	2764000	While I was pulling up the Japanese release dates
2764000	2766000	Cause I was lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance
2766000	2768000	So let me tell you about all these great games coming out
2768000	2770000	To the Japanese market
2770000	2772000	And you can also horribly
2772000	2774000	Listen to me horribly horribly
2774000	2776000	Butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles
2776000	2778000	Of which it actually does not seem like
2778000	2780000	There's a whole lot coming out over in Japan
2780000	2782000	This week um for Playstation 2
2782000	2784000	There's a game called
2784000	2786000	Grim Grimoire
2786000	2788000	Which is coming out and also
2788000	2790000	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double agent
2790000	2792000	On the Playstation 2 finally gets its way
2792000	2794000	In Japan
2794000	2796000	It's coming out

2798000	2800000	Including some Disney franchises
2800000	2802000	Chicken Little and The Little Mermaid
2802000	2804000	Make its way to Japan
2804000	2806000	Which by the way
2806000	2808000	You have to hear at some point in your life
2808000	2810000	The Little Mermaid stage from Kingdom Hearts
2810000	2812000	In Japanese
2812000	2814000	Makes me cry
2814000	2816000	Makes me cry from laughing so hard
2816000	2818000	Watashi no Relaxuma
2818000	2820000	Is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS
2820000	2822000	Relaxuma sounds cool
2822000	2824000	Relaxuma
2824000	2826000	And Jamie maybe you'd like this
2826000	2828000	Doesn't it look like little bears massaging each other
2828000	2830000	Or something
2830000	2832000	It does
2832000	2834000	It looks like the old bear is reading
2834000	2836000	And the little bear is walking on his back
2836000	2838000	Some folks used to do that
2838000	2840000	To massage
2840000	2842000	That bear is going to murder the other bear
2842000	2844000	With that little pointy red flag
2844000	2846000	He's going to play with his
2846000	2848000	I
2848000	2850000	I call this land in the name of France
2850000	2852000	And stab them through the temple
2852000	2854000	So really not an exciting week in Japan
2854000	2856000	Sorry
2856000	2858000	Well if you're looking for excitement
2858000	2860000	In the United States
2860000	2862000	Well
2862000	2864000	You better wait until next week
2864000	2866000	Although there is one good game coming out this week
2866000	2868000	Super Paper Mario
2868000	2870000	On the Wii
2870000	2872000	That's about it
2872000	2874000	There's a couple PSP games coming out
2874000	2876000	None worth mentioning
2876000	2878000	That is your week
2878000	2880000	Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii
2880000	2882000	Ha
2882000	2884000	Ha
2884000	2886000	But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC
2886000	2888000	That game looks awesome
2888000	2890000	Wasn't that supposed to come out last week
2890000	2892000	I don't know I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week
2892000	2894000	Yeah it's
2894000	2896000	It's just a really
2896000	2898000	Really sad week
2898000	2900000	Well it's really not looking much better
2900000	2902000	For the UK
2902000	2904000	We have
2904000	2906000	Well Fears coming out that's a good game
2906000	2908000	And the Godfather the Dawns edition
2908000	2910000	On PS3
2910000	2912000	Gurumin A Monstrous Adventure
2912000	2914000	On the PSP Harvest Moon DS
2914000	2916000	Hotel Dusk Room 215
2916000	2918000	Pokemon Ranger and Wing Island
2918000	2920000	On Wii
2920000	2922000	Maybe Hotel Dusk
2922000	2924000	Room 215 will do better like in Europe
2924000	2926000	You know how like sometimes with music
2926000	2928000	There's like bands that do way better
2928000	2930000	In Europe that like flop here even though
2930000	2932000	They might be really good
2932000	2934000	I don't know things like Robbie Williams
2934000	2936000	He's big everywhere but people here
2936000	2938000	Don't bat an eyelash at him right
2938000	2940000	Maybe Hotel Dusk 215 will like
2940000	2942000	Catch like wildfire
2942000	2944000	Or maybe you're just saying
2944000	2946000	Yeah cause you're a bitch
2946000	2948000	Hey Rob
2948000	2950000	Guess what
2950000	2952000	You know it's kind of random
2952000	2954000	This is completely random here but you know a game
2954000	2956000	I saw a video for that kind of made it look
2956000	2958000	Fun to play
2958000	2960000	Cabela's African Safari
2960000	2962000	They have it like where you can go into bullet time
2962000	2964000	As you freaking
2964000	2966000	You're diving towards
2966000	2968000	You know I guess a lion
2968000	2970000	Or something like that and you can snipe
2970000	2972000	Lions in the head
2972000	2974000	Africa
2974000	2976000	Although they already said in Africa
2976000	2978000	You're not gonna be hunting animals
2978000	2980000	Which is like the one reason I would
2980000	2982000	Buy the game
2982000	2984000	It'd be awesome if like it's resistance in Africa
2984000	2986000	And you're just blowing crap up
2986000	2988000	Africa
2988000	2990000	Alright well
2990000	2992000	Speaking of games
2992000	2994000	We won't be seeing anytime soon
2994000	2996000	Cause I don't know about you I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa
2996000	2998000	Since E3
2998000	3000000	Here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon
3000000	3002000	Mother 3
3002000	3004000	And just to pour salt in the wounds
3004000	3006000	Guess what Nintendo did this week
3006000	3008000	Nintendo posted the soundtrack
3008000	3010000	On iTunes
3010000	3012000	And no, not the Japanese store
3012000	3014000	You can actually get
3014000	3016000	The Mother 3 soundtrack in the US
3016000	3018000	Store
3018000	3020000	And download some of the songs from Mother 3
3020000	3022000	Wait, what's this
3022000	3024000	Mandarin? You have a game release?
3024000	3026000	Sam & Max episode 5
3026000	3028000	Is gonna be released Thursday
3028000	3030000	Wasn't that already out?
3030000	3032000	I thought episode 5 came out
3032000	3034000	I thought it did too
3034000	3036000	Oh it already released on Thursday
3036000	3038000	Cause GameTap
3038000	3040000	Does roll out their new games on Thursday
3040000	3042000	And I had a friend
3042000	3044000	Who was playing it but I think
3044000	3046000	This friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do
3046000	3048000	On GameTap
3048000	3050000	Cause he's special
3050000	3052000	You getting told?
3052000	3054000	Alright well anyway
3054000	3056000	If you are waiting for Sam & Max
3056000	3058000	Or just don't have GameTap
3058000	3060000	And you want to download some music from Mother 3
3060000	3062000	You can download such gems as
3062000	3064000	We Miss You
3064000	3084000	Music
3084000	3086000	Slow jams of Earthbound
3086000	3088000	Lame
3088000	3090000	I don't know why anyone would be interested in that stupid game
3090000	3092000	Because there are rabid
3092000	3094000	Fucking Mother fans out there
3094000	3096000	On the internet that will
3096000	3098000	Download anything that remotely has to do
3098000	3100000	With Mother
3100000	3102000	We used to have a little cluster from some
3102000	3104000	There was some website dedicated to Mother
3104000	3106000	And the Earthbound series
3106000	3108000	But there was a period of time
3108000	3110000	When there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show
3110000	3112000	Don't you remember that?
3112000	3114000	Nope
3114000	3116000	Well god, you don't care about our listeners do you?
3116000	3118000	Well then fine, new story
3118000	3120000	Anyways
3120000	3122000	Starman.net, that was it
3122000	3124000	Miyamoto
3124000	3126000	Of course inspired by
3126000	3128000	PlayStation Home
3128000	3130000	Wants to expand the world
3130000	3132000	Of the Miis
3132000	3134000	In other words
3134000	3136000	Wants to do more things with them
3136000	3138000	Including
3138000	3140000	Have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them
3140000	3142000	How about you start
3142000	3144000	By
3144000	3146000	Giving third party companies
3146000	3148000	Access to put Miis in their game
3148000	3150000	Would be a good way to expand the experience
3150000	3152000	Or
3152000	3154000	I don't know, how about
3154000	3156000	Do something a little bit more
3156000	3158000	Than just have them wandering around their little
3158000	3160000	White existence in there
3160000	3162000	But yeah
3162000	3164000	He plans on seeing
3164000	3166000	A vast virtual world
3166000	3168000	With the Miis
3168000	3170000	Not starting too well with the
3170000	3172000	Vote for your favorite
3172000	3174000	Mii channel that's supposed to be coming out
3174000	3176000	Eventually
3176000	3178000	A Mare Mii can idol
3178000	3182000	We're Sanjaya Mii
3182000	3184000	Okay
3184000	3186000	Well
3186000	3188000	Anyway
3188000	3190000	Anyway
3190000	3192000	This makes me kind of sad
3192000	3194000	Because
3194000	3196000	Our dear
3196000	3198000	Hero
3198000	3200000	Nomura Tetsuya
3200000	3202000	Is not affiliated
3202000	3204000	With the
3204000	3206000	New Kingdom Hearts
3206000	3208000	Coming out
3208000	3210000	Wait, but we saw that trailer last week right?
3210000	3212000	For some type of
3212000	3214000	Or at least it was tacked on at the end of
3214000	3216000	Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix or whatever
3216000	3218000	So they're going on without them or what?
3218000	3220000	What he's basically telling
3220000	3222000	Dengeki Playstation is
3222000	3224000	And this is a quote
3224000	3226000	First it's not Kingdom Hearts 3
3226000	3228000	Of course because we're calling it a new series
3228000	3230000	It won't be Kingdom Hearts 3
3230000	3232000	Also it's a series so it won't
3232000	3234000	Be just one title
3234000	3236000	Um
3236000	3238000	He's saying that basically he's working
3238000	3240000	On a different story
3240000	3242000	I don't know
3242000	3244000	Not the next Kingdom Hearts
3244000	3246000	It's a spinoff of the Kingdom Hearts series
3246000	3248000	Online, MMO
3248000	3250000	Dude that would be hot
3250000	3252000	I would totally quit World of Warcraft
3252000	3254000	For that
3254000	3256000	I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series
3256000	3258000	Without Disney
3258000	3260000	But why?
3260000	3262000	That's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts
3262000	3264000	In the first place
3264000	3266000	Now we have to play it for the
3266000	3268000	Roxas
3268000	3270000	And Axl
3270000	3272000	Fuck that
3274000	3276000	Well we'll see what happens
3276000	3278000	Dustcap2 makes it funny in chat
3278000	3280000	Kingdom Hearts X1
3280000	3282000	Like Mega Man
3282000	3284000	Get it
3284000	3286000	Laugh
3286000	3288000	Well this is also leaving
3288000	3290000	A lot of people with a huh kind of look
3290000	3292000	Is that Resident Evil 4
3292000	3294000	Has been confirmed for the Wii
3294000	3296000	Um now yes that's Resident Evil
3296000	3298000	4 the game that you could already
3298000	3300000	Play with your GameCube
3300000	3302000	Backwards compatibility
3302000	3304000	Will now be coming out on the Wii
3304000	3306000	This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube
3306000	3308000	Games they could easily redo them for the Wii
3308000	3310000	With the new functionality
3310000	3312000	Well here it is in motion right here
3312000	3314000	Uh you're gonna now be able to
3314000	3316000	Um you know obviously you use the Wii
3316000	3318000	Controls as part of the game
3318000	3320000	It'll have widescreen support although I believe the old one had
3320000	3322000	Widescreen support as well but I guess now you can get
3322000	3324000	Progressive Scan and all that good stuff
3324000	3326000	Um well couldn't the old one do
3326000	3328000	Progressive Scan as well? Could it?
3328000	3330000	I don't remember. I thought so. Interesting
3330000	3332000	So they really aren't changing a lot of it then
3332000	3334000	Well the Wii Mode is gonna be used for close range
3334000	3336000	Attacks uh the speaker will be used
3336000	3338000	For the reload sound effect the one that's in the
3338000	3340000	Little Wii Mode there um if an enemy
3340000	3342000	Approaches you give the Wii Mode a little shake
3342000	3344000	And you can do a close range attack
3344000	3346000	With the knife um otherwise
3346000	3348000	The game has also been modified to take
3348000	3350000	Um the Wii into the account um
3350000	3352000	Some interactive event scenes use the Wii
3352000	3354000	Buttons you have to shake the Wii Mode and part
3354000	3356000	Of it um the producer of the Wii
3356000	3358000	Version uh was talking to Famitsu
3358000	3360000	Magazine and said that uh
3360000	3362000	They want to allow families who play the
3362000	3364000	Wii together to experience Resident Evil
3364000	3366000	So in other words
3366000	3368000	No more chainsaw your face off
3368000	3370000	I guess I guess they're gonna have to do something about that
3370000	3372000	But there are gonna be easy and amateur
3372000	3374000	Difficulty settings to make the game a little
3374000	3376000	Bit easier
3376000	3378000	Also the bonus elements from the Playstation 2
3378000	3380000	Will be in the Wii release so you can do
3380000	3382000	The add a um sequence
3382000	3384000	The another order sequence
3384000	3386000	So that's I guess something
3386000	3388000	That you didn't have on your backwards compatibility
3388000	3390000	I can't
3390000	3392000	They're gonna have to do something about uh
3392000	3394000	Chainsaw man taking off your head though
3394000	3396000	For the family play they're gonna really
3396000	3398000	Need to do something like that about that
3398000	3400000	Oh man that's funny
3400000	3402000	Anyway instead he gives you
3402000	3404000	He gives you flowers
3404000	3406000	Resident Evil Family Edition
3406000	3408000	Anyways
3408000	3410000	So yeah I think it's funny that
3410000	3412000	They were saying that you know you can
3412000	3414000	Redo some of the old GameCube games cause I think
3414000	3416000	Most of the games that have come out recently
3416000	3418000	Especially by Ubisoft um are just
3418000	3420000	Old GameCube games that have been ported
3420000	3422000	Over to the Wii
3422000	3424000	Super Paper Mario to some extent is that I mean
3424000	3426000	Granted they went back and reworked it
3426000	3428000	Twilight Princess is a perfect example
3428000	3430000	Prince of Persia 2 no
3430000	3432000	Hot damn when do you think we're gonna get
3432000	3434000	A Wii game that was actually made for the Wii
3434000	3436000	What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube
3436000	3438000	Game they were thinking about too
3438000	3440000	I don't know
3440000	3442000	That I think they were probably actually doing you know
3442000	3444000	For the Wii but like
3444000	3446000	Prince of Persia Rival Swords
3446000	3448000	Like you have a lot of the
3448000	3450000	You know stuff that's been out
3450000	3452000	Binacle Heroes that's coming out that was a GameCube title
3452000	3454000	Open Season a lot of the movie tie in stuff
3454000	3456000	I don't know it's just bad
3456000	3458000	Anyways
3458000	3460000	Some of our chat room by the way is coming up with new slogans
3460000	3462000	And commercials for Resident Evil 4
3462000	3464000	Like you know that
3464000	3466000	We would like to play
3466000	3468000	Bandit has come up with some new taglines
3468000	3470000	Including
3470000	3472000	We die together
3472000	3474000	And we would like to kill you
3474000	3476000	So there you go
3476000	3478000	Free marketing
3478000	3480000	Anyways
3480000	3482000	There's a rumor
3482000	3484000	That mass shortage
3484000	3486000	Or mass storage
3486000	3488000	Is coming to the Wii
3488000	3490000	Although
3490000	3492000	Unfortunately I think this rumor has been squashed
3492000	3494000	Because
3494000	3496000	It had to do with a press release by a company called
3496000	3498000	ESOL Middleware
3498000	3500000	They have basically
3500000	3502000	A fat driver
3502000	3504000	For the file system
3504000	3506000	And there's another driver for USB host stuff
3506000	3508000	Which apparently
3508000	3510000	Is already being implemented into the Wii
3510000	3512000	So
3512000	3514000	This is probably not the case
3514000	3516000	For right now
3516000	3518000	It is for the
3518000	3520000	I believe the little
3520000	3522000	Flash card you can put in there
3522000	3524000	So
3524000	3526000	Sorry no mass storage for you
3526000	3528000	I'm sure they have to at some point
3528000	3530000	You know do that
3530000	3532000	Poor babies
3532000	3534000	Alright well
3534000	3536000	DarkSakura might use that mass storage device
3536000	3538000	To save her favorite websites
3538000	3540000	When she's surfing the internet
3540000	3542000	Because she likes to surf the internet a lot
3542000	3544000	And she finds her favorite websites
3544000	3546000	And brings them to you in a special statement
3546000	3548000	We call DarkSakura's website of the week
3552000	3554000	Today's website of the week
3554000	3556000	Is one that Rob
3556000	3558000	Frequences often
3558000	3560000	Because I got the idea from him
3560000	3562000	Pornotube.com
3562000	3564000	Home of pterodactyl porn
3564000	3566000	It needs nothing
3566000	3568000	It's pornotube.com
3568000	3570000	Pterodactyl porn
3570000	3572000	You know
3572000	3574000	You want pterodactyl porn
3574000	3576000	Adult only
3576000	3578000	It does not count mental state of adult
3578000	3580000	What's been up with your website of the week lately
3580000	3582000	They've all been like x-rated
3582000	3584000	I have no idea
3584000	3586000	Because it's like
3586000	3588000	Someone's been thinking about
3588000	3590000	Sex
3590000	3592000	No
3592000	3594000	Someone's been um
3594000	3596000	Busy
3596000	3598000	Psycoon says why don't we just make this Rob's website
3598000	3600000	Of the week
3600000	3602000	Oh okay I will think of an original website of the week next week
3602000	3604000	Alright
3604000	3606000	I promise
3606000	3608000	Well DarkSakura frequents the pornotube
3608000	3610000	She's not afraid to get down with the pornotube
3610000	3612000	Alright
3612000	3614000	Well speaking of
3614000	3616000	We talked about GameTap earlier in the show
3616000	3618000	I guess Mandarin clarified
3618000	3620000	That it was on the private server
3620000	3622000	The new Sam & Max
3622000	3624000	Like this Thursday
3624000	3626000	So that's cool
3626000	3628000	Something else that's there hidden away
3628000	3630000	Apparently some Sega Saturn games
3630000	3632000	Are in there
3632000	3634000	There's a game called Bug
3634000	3636000	Which was lame by the way
3636000	3638000	Well nevertheless it was on the Sega Saturn
3638000	3640000	And it's there in GameTap
3640000	3642000	And apparently there's some Easter Egg
3642000	3644000	Games
3644000	3646000	It's part of a promotion GameTap is doing
3646000	3648000	I haven't logged into GameTap in a while
3648000	3650000	I haven't used it in a while
3650000	3652000	Apparently there's some other games hidden away too
3652000	3654000	But those haven't come to light yet
3654000	3656000	But
3656000	3658000	Something that some sharp eyed
3658000	3660000	Folks have noticed is that if you
3660000	3662000	Look at the controls in the game
3662000	3664000	The controls actually mention the shift key
3664000	3666000	So is it possible this is
3666000	3668000	Just a PC version of Bug that's
3668000	3670000	Tucked away
3670000	3672000	Don't know yet if this means that there are actually
3672000	3674000	Saturn games coming
3674000	3676000	But nevertheless it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega
3676000	3678000	Has been a big supporter of
3678000	3680000	GameTap because you know you have a lot of Genesis
3680000	3682000	Games and Master System games and hell you
3682000	3684000	Have Dreamcast games in there
3684000	3686000	So why not Saturn
3686000	3688000	Makes sense
3688000	3690000	SSJ100mad in chat says
3690000	3692000	I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD
3692000	3694000	Sega in chat says
3694000	3696000	GameTap has included the
3696000	3698000	Sega Saturn emulator so you'll get more
3698000	3700000	Saturn games later
3700000	3702000	GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator
3702000	3704000	Oh there you go
3704000	3706000	Cool
3706000	3708000	Well speaking of
3708000	3710000	Emulating stuff
3710000	3712000	A game called Piano Hero
3712000	3714000	On the PC
3714000	3716000	Some guys making it
3716000	3718000	And it's basically a freeware open source
3718000	3720000	Project that lets people with
3720000	3722000	MIDI capable keyboards
3722000	3724000	Play any MIDI file as if it were
3724000	3726000	Like a Guitar Hero
3726000	3728000	Style track
3728000	3730000	Or think back to I don't know keyboard mania
3730000	3732000	However
3732000	3734000	Activision has now
3734000	3736000	Sent a cease and desist order
3736000	3738000	To the guy
3738000	3740000	Behind it
3740000	3742000	Nicholas looks like he had a
3742000	3744000	Peach done
3744000	3746000	Well basically the only thing he has
3746000	3748000	To do which is not too bad
3748000	3750000	Is he has to change the name
3750000	3752000	Because they want to make sure that people
3752000	3754000	Aren't getting confused
3754000	3756000	That it's an actual
3756000	3758000	Official Activision product
3758000	3760000	Or something like that
3760000	3762000	So he can keep on making the game as long as he names it
3762000	3764000	As something else
3764000	3766000	I don't know that's not bad
3766000	3768000	You know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though
3768000	3770000	I don't know
3770000	3772000	Does he really have to change the name?
3772000	3774000	Yeah
3774000	3776000	Basically they've sent a cease and desist
3776000	3778000	Well no no no I'm not saying based on cease and desist
3778000	3780000	But do they really have the legal right to make him change the name?
3780000	3782000	I don't know
3782000	3784000	Maybe unless they have something
3784000	3786000	You know
3786000	3788000	Coming out
3788000	3790000	It says among the various
3790000	3792000	Products Activision publishes
3792000	3794000	Are
3794000	3796000	Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2
3796000	3798000	Video games
3798000	3800000	Activision is the owner of certain
3800000	3802000	Intellectual property rights including
3802000	3804000	Guitar Hero franchise
3804000	3806000	Including but not limited to
3806000	3808000	The trademark Guitar Hero
3808000	3810000	And says
3810000	3812000	Let's see here
3812000	3814000	I'm trying to see exactly what it is
3814000	3816000	It says it comes to attention that you've been using
3816000	3818000	The name Piano Hero in connection with your game
3818000	3820000	That you designed
3820000	3822000	For Halite Studios
3822000	3824000	Where enclosed they print out of your
3824000	3826000	Website showing such
3826000	3828000	In our opinion your use of
3828000	3830000	The name Piano Hero constitutes
3830000	3832000	At least
3832000	3834000	Trademark infringement
3834000	3836000	Delusion and unfair competition
3836000	3838000	With the respect to the trademark
3838000	3840000	Guitar Hero
3840000	3842000	I don't know
3842000	3844000	It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get
3844000	3846000	Named similarly all the time
3846000	3848000	Especially
3848000	3850000	When it comes to a lot of puzzle games
3850000	3852000	I don't know
3852000	3854000	There's a perfect example
3854000	3856000	There's a movie studio out there that does
3856000	3858000	Knock off movies like Snakes on a Train
3858000	3860000	Or for the new
3860000	3862000	Transformers movie
3862000	3864000	Transmorphers
3864000	3866000	There you go
3866000	3868000	Landmine Fairy
3868000	3870000	Suggests Keyboard Villain
3870000	3872000	As a possible name to replace
3872000	3874000	Can they already license Guitar Villain?
3874000	3876000	Not officially
3876000	3878000	It's been licensed but there's no game out on the market yet
3878000	3880000	Which by the way that's one of my favorite chat room names ever
3880000	3882000	Is Landmine Fairy
3882000	3884000	Also Bandit makes a good suggestion
3884000	3886000	Go to Guitar Hero.com
3886000	3888000	It's a site for action figures not associated
3888000	3890000	With Activision
3890000	3892000	They should sue Activision ASAP
3892000	3894000	I agree
3894000	3896000	Turn about the fair play right?
3896000	3898000	Or how about
3898000	3900000	I don't know
3900000	3902000	The fact that I would say it's infringing more on
3902000	3904000	Keyboard Mania
3904000	3906000	Than you know
3906000	3908000	The game itself
3908000	3910000	Alpha
3910000	3912000	Canongram suggests a name that will
3912000	3914000	Probably sell more copies of the game
3914000	3916000	Piano Porno Star
3916000	3918000	Piano Porno Star
3918000	3920000	Piano Porno Star is a pretty awesome name
3920000	3922000	Piano Cockbite
3922000	3924000	And on that note
3924000	3926000	We're going to bring part A to a close here
3926000	3928000	Oh real quick
3928000	3930000	Mandarin you wanted to give a special shout out right?
3930000	3932000	Seggman anyway
3932000	3934000	I just want to give a special shout out to
3934000	3936000	Segg in the chat room
3936000	3938000	He's a friend of mine currently in Boston
3938000	3940000	He was working at Emerson
3940000	3942000	Emerson College
3942000	3944000	He just got a job at Telltale Games
3944000	3946000	Out in San Rafael
3946000	3948000	He's going to be
3948000	3950000	Being the new build engineer
3950000	3952000	For all the Sam & Max episodes
3952000	3954000	From this point
3954000	3956000	Once he starts there from this point forward
3956000	3958000	And I believe he starts next week or
3958000	3960000	Didn't we see
3960000	3962000	Something a while back about
3962000	3964000	Sam & Max they were trying to hire people
3964000	3966000	To port it to Xbox Live or something
3966000	3968000	There was a job posting on the internet
3968000	3970000	Did your friend get that job?
3970000	3972000	Kinda?
3972000	3974000	Something like it?
3974000	3976000	Interesting
3976000	3978000	He will have to come on the show later if he can
3978000	3980000	There might be NDA's at the wazoo
3980000	3982000	Get your friend to come
3982000	3984000	To our show because Sam & Max is pretty cool
3984000	3986000	Also
3986000	3988000	Part B tonight we're bringing back an old favorite
3988000	3990000	We're going to play some match game
3990000	3992000	In Part B tonight
3992000	3994000	So that means we need to get some contestants during the break
3994000	3996000	So we'll take one on the skype line later
3996000	3998000	Don't call yet, we'll take one on the skype line
3998000	4000000	We have to do the game, but we need a chat room contestant
4000000	4002000	So to find a chat room contestant we always
4002000	4004000	Ask a trivia question live here on the program
4004000	4006000	Here is tonight's trivia question
4006000	4008000	We're going to be talking about
4008000	4010000	A new game in Part B
4010000	4012000	Tonight called Rock Band
4012000	4014000	Of course a lot of you guys have heard about this
4014000	4016000	But Rock Band was not the first game
4016000	4018000	That would allow you to put together a full band
4018000	4020000	There was actually an arcade series
4020000	4022000	And I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program
4022000	4024000	For a long time now
4024000	4026000	You know these games very well
4026000	4028000	There used to be three games
4028000	4030000	That would all session together
4030000	4032000	To form your own band
4032000	4034000	So you could play games at the arcade
4034000	4036000	Name them
4036000	4038000	First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat
4038000	4040000	Send a message to Sky in the chat room
4040000	4042000	With the name of the three games
4042000	4044000	To form your own band with in the arcade previously
4044000	4046000	It can all be made
4046000	4048000	Alright so we're going to take a break
4048000	4074000	And we'll see you guys in Part B
