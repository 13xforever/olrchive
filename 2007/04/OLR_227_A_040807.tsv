13949	26547	Tonight, April 8, 2007, details leak on the next Xbox Dashboard update, a new Wii game will make use of the forecast channel, and will Harmonix's new rock band change music games as we know it?
31946	35848	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35888	41692	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gamer culture and what you, the gamer, really want to know.
42132	43073	My name is Rob Roberts.
43113	46055	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46815	47836	I like frappuccinos.
48776	52499	And I like the new, what is it, Cinnamon Dulce one?
52759	53219	Dulce.
53279	53960	Dulce, whatever.
55020	58663	I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it.
58683	59403	And I thought that was wrong.
59423	59883	I thought it was Dulce.
59903	60264	That's like...
62096	62596	Versace.
64617	65117	I guess so.
65157	65877	That's probably true.
66577	68358	Nice reference to my favorite movie ever.
68538	68818	Love it.
69018	70198	I thought you would appreciate that.
70278	74179	Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Launch Radio, Loki.
76159	76680	I'm just kidding.
76740	77060	I don't know.
77340	79220	I had to work into showgirl's segue somehow.
80700	82981	I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl.
83761	84581	Well, then showboy.
86002	86382	Okay.
86622	86902	All right.
87865	91747	Say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl.
91787	92107	I'm not sure.
92127	93428	Are you going to get topless for us tonight?
93908	94228	Maybe.
94409	94749	All right.
94809	95829	Say hello to Amanda.
96169	96870	Hi.
96970	97390	How are you?
97750	98090	I'm good.
98110	98491	How are you?
98711	98951	Good.
99651	102233	I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long, long time, right?
102273	103673	Very little brief snippets.
104214	107075	Don't forget you've got to almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it.
107475	108015	All right.
108076	108496	Very good.
108536	108936	Very good.
109276	113919	So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting and all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right?
113999	114239	Have you?
114379	114879	Yeah.
114919	116100	Oh, okay.
116240	116720	I've been out there.
117048	118709	Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio.
118929	119890	Like, briefly.
120170	122251	Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners.
122291	123351	What type of video games do you like?
123972	125192	Um, I like the Wii.
125793	127413	You like the Wii?
127894	128474	Wii!
128554	129795	I like puzzle games.
130655	135218	That's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff.
135458	136678	What have you been playing on your Wii lately?
137919	138960	Uh, WarioWare.
139780	140260	WarioWare?
140420	140700	Yeah.
140720	141521	It's a fun game.
141541	145343	And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff.
146120	148581	What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?
149821	150501	I don't know.
154142	158623	Like the Bubble Bobble or the thing where you shoot the little marbles.
158963	159323	Bubble Bobble.
159343	160543	You're barely getting picked up, sweetie.
160643	161123	Sorry.
161183	161543	That's all right.
162043	162543	Bubble Bobble.
162784	163564	Bubble Bobble, yes.
163824	164144	All right.
165104	165624	Sounds good.
165684	166284	Puzzle Bobble.
166584	169645	Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide.
169665	170085	Bust a Move.
170105	172646	Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it.
172806	173246	All right.
173286	174746	I also like Bar Games.
175259	176800	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
203277	204437	Alright, sounds like fun.
204657	205497	Well, welcome to the show.
205517	207138	Thank you.
207278	208518	You're in our chat room.
208778	209718	Omega Touch, thank you.
209758	210799	Who said that in chat?
211259	212499	That was... Dark Tetsuya.
212719	213059	Yeah.
213879	215119	Good man, Dark Tetsuya.
215139	216620	I'm sorry, I thought it said D-Teaser.
217560	219720	I'm like, what's the D that you're teasing?
220661	228022	Alright, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on this Sunday night, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight.
228082	232263	She'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate, as she deems appropriate.
232283	232423	Okay.
232763	233003	Alright.
233578	234739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
263669	269155	Like, loudly, because, um, I don't know the machine's a bastard.
269755	273038	I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone.
274900	275681	Rob's got tea.
276582	277543	Sorry, I stepped out for a minute.
277563	278504	We can do that in radio.
278544	280986	What, I heard, you heard, you lost your balls over the week?
281166	284890	No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag.
285170	285511	I see.
286191	286632	No, um.
287676	291077	I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there.
291097	292158	Got in the zone, you know.
292578	293258	Oh, those balls.
293318	295299	You know, don't touch the door thing.
295639	297620	I'd get in the zone and then drain.
299380	302782	So your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone.
303462	304082	And Deadpool.
305683	305963	Alright.
306423	308303	I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics too.
309124	310304	Loki, how was your gaming week?
311845	314886	I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017.
316321	326045	God, this is going to become the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week.
326265	328226	Because it's fun and stupid.
328966	330347	I mean, let's put it this way.
330467	332668	There's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game.
332708	339131	I mean, you can fly up like 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground fine.
339871	341952	You know, like nothing happened.
342152	344013	Helicopter will land down there and do it again.
344953	345073	Um...
346465	353889	So I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, Easy on it.
354529	356650	Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?
356771	357831	You can do two-player co-op.
357851	358291	Oh, there you go.
358511	359752	And it's a lot of fun.
360392	365075	Really, the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them.
365895	373640	And, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on Easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels...
375345	395432	and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet, so you can actually get one weapon, it's called the Genocide Gun that does a million damage to an area of like 72 meters or whatever, and it's just you really have to watch out launching that thing, because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that.
395472	399413	Unfortunately, you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible.
400534	403455	Other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of
404665	408546	What was it?
408607	409267	Honeycomb Beat.
409887	410127	Yeah.
410667	411628	And that was okay.
412488	414309	I'm not very interested in it, though.
414869	415309	Not my thing.
415669	416710	Is that why you gave me your copy?
417150	417370	Yes.
417470	417810	Sweet!
418290	419571	I got free games from Loki today.
420291	420731	Yay!
420911	423292	And then... Now I just have to find my DS.
423392	424793	I seriously cannot find my DS.
425133	427594	I played Crackdown a bit.
427974	428794	That was kind of fun.
431075	433896	I played another game, which I can't talk about, though, right now.
434480	436141	I don't want you to get sued.
436161	437463	Either way, though, it's...
462466	464027	Neat, I guess.
464147	469529	And the leaderboards for it, though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people.
469710	474972	You should come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will because they start doing the commentary.
475732	476393	I like jumping.
477673	479734	My name is Bob and I like to jump.
480535	484377	That's the whole theme of Crackdown, by the way, is to jump everywhere you go.
485257	485537	Wow.
485917	486618	Jump a lot.
486738	490600	I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like the top of bridges and stuff.
490620	491120	That part was fun.
491841	495884	and then, I don't know, just pure killing people.
496564	497225	I like the jumping.
497425	498986	And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories.
499066	500707	I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun.
501627	507091	Looking at some comments from chat room, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made.
508412	513075	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers.
513735	517117	They do have like a versus mode in that and I don't know how well that would be.
517938	521100	Ion671 says, It is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense.
521687	525088	and JeremyTel1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?
525608	526068	Too many.
527549	528129	Alright, there you go.
529029	532510	My gaming week, I played a game called, what was it?
532970	540493	Tidepool Explorer because I went to the Monterey Aquarium because William took me to Monterey this weekend and he surprised me with a nice little weekend thing.
540893	550676	So we went to Monterey and you know, it got me thinking like, they got all these cool little educational things for kids and it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had
551341	553962	Like, you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
554062	554462	Like, remember that?
554522	557603	Rocky's Boots and what were the other MECC games?
558143	559084	Oregon Trail, I guess.
559124	559884	Number Munchers.
559924	561344	Number Munchers, hell yeah.
561384	565726	Like, oh, I'm going to write this whole nostalgia article for the community all-game site.
565746	566126	Turtle.
567026	567326	Turtle?
567747	568807	Oh, or what was that?
568887	569627	What was the language?
569707	570107	Logo?
570227	572308	Was that the language they made us all learn in, like, third grade?
572608	573308	We had the turtle?
573489	573749	Yeah.
573829	577330	Like, drop pen, 30 north or something.
577370	579891	Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn.
581485	586167	So yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was a little game where you walked, but it was like you had two screens.
586587	595051	Like they had four people playing it at once, and you had this big screen in the middle, and then you had a little screen right in front of you, like an old... A picture, what are those, what do they call them?
595691	596952	Tabletop, like Ms.
596992	597472	Pac-Man?
597672	600273	What do they call those games back in the day when they had the... Is it just tabletop?
600293	600613	Cocktail.
600773	601213	Cocktail.
601474	602554	It was like a cocktail machine.
603615	608477	And yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the Tidepools, and on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say...
609724	617167	Pick up, you know, so you could, like, pick up the shell, or you could, you know, throw away, like, if you found a trash can, you could throw it away.
617447	624689	Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to, like, you know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tide pools and what you can't.
625069	625890	So it's just kind of neat.
626190	627010	It's all stingray.
627030	628951	We'll stab you through the heart.
628991	629391	Crikey.
630482	633684	But yeah, William commented, I know he was like, oh, that looks like a DS game.
633864	634485	And it kind of was.
634705	637767	So I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things.
637787	641250	Usually when I see educational games, I try to figure out how to break them.
642951	648776	And then we saw Penguins, and that made me very happy.
648876	650337	Not a video game, like actual live Penguins.
650357	651058	That made me very happy.
651118	653059	That's why we went to the aquarium in the first place.
653279	655861	We need to get you your own copy of Portable Pango.
657523	658283	Oh, I love Pango.
658303	659164	That's one of my favorite games.
659548	660928	Pingu was a Sega game, wasn't it?
660948	661689	I took it in my room.
661729	662569	Wasn't Pingu a Sega game?
662609	663189	Maybe it was.
663209	663569	I think it was.
663589	664870	Now I've got to find out.
664890	666250	Alright, anywho.
685986	686706	Let's see, what else?
686986	691147	Oh, but so actual games I really did play, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.
691207	691507	Hello.
691928	692808	Pango is by Sega.
693128	693408	Thank you.
694448	696189	Was that from Wikipedia or from chat?
696389	697209	No, it was from Google.
697409	698009	All right, sweet.
699049	708332	Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the PlayStation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on.
708672	710532	So I knew to wait and not buy it on PlayStation 2.
710732	713953	So it's been a long time since I played Guitar Hero because the first one kind of wore off for me.
714582	716483	And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2.
716763	717143	It's fun.
717604	720805	Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did.
721706	722026	I don't know.
722066	723767	I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs.
724067	726848	And there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game.
726908	727728	But, you know, it's cool.
728109	730750	I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child of Mine.
730870	731590	I mean, come on.
731770	734212	Like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero?
734232	737293	Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?
737573	739554	It does have a animation thing in the beginning.
739594	740555	I don't know if it's the same as commercial.
740615	741015	Where they're, like...
741502	742022	Guitar Hero 2 is fun.
742062	744324	Graphics, obviously, a step up from the PlayStation 2 because it supports widescreen.
744384	747006	It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics.
747026	748287	The controller itself works pretty good.
767691	768892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
791218	792019	DDR Online Co-op
808721	829553	guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it so you wouldn't be able to really I mean that would be the lagged part whereas DDR you know the way DDR gets away with it is it kind of shows you the steps with or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag but it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that you're playing your own game so I think they could do it they just would have to get creative with how the music track plays you know what I mean
829912	835074	Like, they obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes when you screw up.
835114	836455	It goes, you know, those little things.
836475	841057	Well, didn't they have, like, Amplitude online where you could do co-op with Amplitude and stuff like that?
841137	842217	I'm almost positive they did.
842257	842937	Yeah, of course.
842958	843378	Yeah, yeah.
843518	844138	They had Amplitude.
844698	845939	So I'm pretty sure it can be done.
846619	848200	I don't know.
849560	854502	Devil Kai in chat says, Hey, Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version.
854903	856603	Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.
856643	858324	This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way.
858820	859481	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
872199	873259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
892364	892924	It's good times.
893044	894025	It's kind of expensive, though.
894425	905789	If you already own the PlayStation 2 version, you might want to question, you know, how important is it to you to have it on Next Gen, because I don't know if, I mean, granted, there's a couple new songs, some slightly prettier graphics, and the whole online leaderboards.
906189	909371	You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you.
909711	912812	Oh, speaking of achievement points, real quick, there's some really screwy ones in there.
912872	915653	Like, you fail a song on Easy and get 10 points.
916133	919395	You play a left-handed song and get 10 points.
919415	920395	You beat tutorial and get 10 points.
920822	922643	It seems like some of the scores are misweighted.
923004	926286	Like, I think if you fail a song on easy, it should be one of those ghost achievements.
926646	931510	Like, kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles, where it's just on your record, but it's zero gamer score.
931990	933271	Or Dead or Alive has one, too.
933311	938715	I think if you, like, lose ten battles in a row, that goes on your gamer card, but you don't get any gamer points for it.
939275	944399	And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other, you know, beat a song, perfect.
944559	946941	Because you only get ten points for getting a perfect 100% on a song, I think.
948797	949537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
975605	977746	We went up playing Doctor and Nurse.
978487	980028	Oh, you mean video games.
980469	981509	Video games, sweetie.
981529	982150	Video games.
983931	985553	Tom beat Zelda, finally.
987194	988855	I watched him beat it, sort of.
989035	990056	I was in and out of the room.
990456	991497	Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?
991637	991817	Yes.
992038	992298	Sweet.
993799	997262	Other than that, we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point.
997922	999023	Heck yeah, I want that too.
999043	1003927	That's pretty much about it right now since we've just been busy with other things.
1004827	1005387	Like fucking?
1006027	1008408	Like fixing my bike, my motorcycle.
1009628	1010388	Fixing your bike?
1010908	1011148	Yes.
1011508	1012748	Do you ride a bike to work?
1013248	1014009	No, not yet.
1014669	1015669	Are you going to ride a bike to work?
1016369	1017329	Once I get my license.
1018069	1020430	Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?
1020730	1022490	It's something we saw at E3 a couple years ago.
1022550	1025191	It's a little exercise bike, but it's a game.
1025231	1025751	It's on the screen.
1026271	1029111	But the graphics were kind of horrible, if I remember right.
1030111	1033452	It looked like... God, what was that Sega Master System game?
1034045	1037366	I think it came with every Sega system that was like a motorcycle game.
1038046	1038606	I can't remember.
1038886	1039086	Huh?
1039806	1040226	Hang-On?
1040366	1041367	Yes, it was Hang-On.
1041707	1043087	It looked like Hang-On to me.
1045207	1045507	All right.
1045907	1048668	DarkShy in chat says, Dr. Mario and Peach live.
1049108	1050228	Is that what your house is like, Amanda?
1051349	1053009	Dr. Mario and Peach live?
1053509	1053649	No.
1053929	1054029	No.
1054209	1054409	All right.
1055089	1055369	All right.
1055409	1058230	Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us.
1058270	1059110	I'm looking at chat.
1059450	1061231	Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well.
1061311	1062711	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1063888	1068951	Also talking about the achievements, Blaze says, I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements.
1069992	1071693	Microsoft does regulate it to some extent.
1071973	1074775	Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?
1074895	1077217	I think 50 is the max, and they raised it up to 50.
1077357	1077677	Did they?
1077897	1078798	Hmm, interesting.
1078818	1085662	Let's see, JeremyTodd1 says, I think they should have negative achievements where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much.
1086673	1090476	DarkSakura was unable to do Pump Up the Volume this week because Comcast went down, right?
1115154	1116395	Yes, it did.
1116675	1120417	Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem, but it turned out that it was just a temporary.
1120797	1124579	All right, so Tuesday nights, you can listen to DarkSakura, take your requests, 7 p.m.
1124599	1125160	or 7.30?
1127381	1125160	7.30.
1127681	1128081	7.30 p.m.
1128121	1129802	Pacific, right here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1129842	1133004	Wednesday nights, guys on the show, 7 o'clock Pacific time.
1133804	1137306	Thursday nights, STFU, also at 7 o'clock Pacific time.
1137346	1138187	Is there still a club, OLR?
1139754	1140314	There is.
1140714	1141194	In theory.
1141714	1142115	There is.
1142755	1144915	I put new episodes up there, or reruns.
1145275	1150436	Club OLR's been getting low ratings, so we're thinking of moving it and putting something else on Friday nights.
1150576	1153857	But if you want to save Club OLR, Friday nights at 7 o'clock.
1154277	1156977	Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings.
1157538	1157938	We'll see.
1157958	1158838	It wouldn't be the first.
1159158	1159578	No, that's right.
1159598	1161318	Your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings.
1161338	1162439	No, what about your shows?
1162499	1162979	That's right.
1163099	1163639	Oh, that's true.
1163839	1164519	One of my shows did.
1165393	1167194	No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings.
1167454	1168074	That's just the excuse.
1168094	1169955	Or Extroverse Case of the Mondays.
1170015	1171715	I mean, it's internet radio, people.
1171775	1173516	We have low ratings anyway.
1173576	1174256	We don't care.
1174677	1176937	But, you know, we always use that as an excuse.
1176977	1177618	It's an excuse.
1177658	1183120	The thing is, is it takes a long time to create that damn show, and wife doesn't like that.
1183140	1185601	And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together.
1185641	1186061	It's awesome.
1186081	1187782	And unfortunately, you can't podcast it.
1188022	1189622	Yeah, I was working on stuff.
1189802	1193704	I've got like a... I was actually doing a happy hardcore one, but I...
1194793	1199055	Listen to that little bastard Travis Donovan on Saturday nights at 7 Pacific.
1224036	1224376	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
1250569	1250849	Oh, no.
1250909	1256113	Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight, and that was going to be it, and then GameSpot would... Oh, wait, no.
1256173	1257473	I think actually he's off because of Easter.
1257734	1258834	I've been following him on Twitter.
1259094	1263317	I have a Twitter account now, so I could be like Major Nelson and GamerAndy, because I want to be cool like them.
1263717	1265258	So I have a Twitter account, so I've been following Major Nelson.
1265278	1266619	I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something.
1266659	1270822	It's kind of a stalker site, which kind of worries me, so I don't post about things as I'm doing them.
1270862	1272483	I post about things after the fact.
1272863	1273364	You know what I mean?
1274244	1275625	Like, I just, you know...
1276509	1278410	It's basically, it's this really cheesy thing.
1278690	1280071	It asks, what are you doing right now?
1280531	1282572	And you're supposed to type in what you're doing right now.
1283072	1288434	And for instance, I think the last thing I put is I'm listening to the new Bjork song while I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight.
1288455	1288875	Something like that.
1289135	1290555	You're supposed to use 140 characters or less.
1290836	1295077	But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update or IM to update.
1295518	1296218	So it's kind of interesting.
1296498	1299620	It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only like 150 characters.
1299920	1301200	So it forces you to be quick.
1301640	1301881	I don't know.
1301961	1302281	It's weird.
1302661	1302881	Lame.
1303052	1305673	But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it, and I've been following him on there.
1305953	1307173	And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite.
1307193	1307913	He's like, you should join this.
1307933	1308753	I'm like, okay.
1309674	1310334	What are you doing right now?
1310634	1312434	I'm updating my Twitter account.
1312654	1313534	What are you doing right now?
1313714	1315195	I'm updating my Twitter account.
1315695	1315975	All right.
1317955	1320336	It's Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E, if you want to have me.
1320696	1322736	Anyway, how did we get on that?
1323297	1324777	The Spring Dashboard Update.
1326256	1328157	Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?
1328297	1328577	No.
1329098	1331219	Because I bet you anything this is totally planned.
1331239	1331779	Fucking corporate.
1332220	1334601	I mean... They pay good money to leak the stories.
1335222	1340686	I mean, I say this... Listen, okay, a corporate website does not leak stories, okay?
1341166	1342167	It's not a leak.
1342527	1347310	It's a fucking planned PR thing that's disguised as a leak.
1349872	1352094	Uh... Because there's... No.
1352274	1352314	No.
1352970	1353390	I'm sorry.
1353591	1354631	You know, it's just, I don't know.
1355132	1361997	Again, I want to say you corporate fuckers, even though, you know, GameSpot's okay and all, but, you know, it's just, oh, it just irritates me.
1362017	1362337	It's not a leak.
1362377	1363518	But anyways, it's still news.
1363578	1364879	Yeah, it's still news.
1365199	1370183	So the update is supposed to come May 7th, and Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated.
1370303	1371764	Some of you know this is MSN Messenger.
1372145	1374246	So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360.
1374286	1380010	So if you have people who aren't on Xbox Live, you can still communicate to them through MSN Messenger.
1380071	1380651	So they're trying to really
1380899	1381499	I'm talking to you.
1411650	1412210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1427783	1430346	Um, users are now getting inline achievement updates.
1430386	1435190	Supposedly, um, you're going to be able to see how many points the achievement was, what the achievement is.
1435210	1437292	It's like, you know how right now it says, achievement unlocked.
1437332	1437572	Do-do!
1437733	1438794	A little sound comes up, right?
1439094	1441056	You can actually now know what it is you're getting.
1441076	1443418	Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get?
1443878	1448563	Especially when we did something stupid like, what did she, I fell in a manhole five times, why did that unlock an achievement?
1448883	1449724	You know, so that's that.
1451229	1455071	Low power download mode and auto shutdown for those long movie downloads.
1455652	1458293	You can also watch partially downloaded movies now.
1458333	1459894	You don't have to wait for the whole thing to download.
1460515	1466779	And again, that messenger will work with up to six friends at once and other little tweaks on the user interface.
1466959	1469561	So that is the big spring dashboard update.
1470413	1471694	Information leaked to the internet.
1471914	1472575	Sounds kind of fun.
1472795	1476417	I like the whole, I wish I knew people that actually used MSN Messenger.
1476457	1480260	I might get used to that functionality, but as it is, everybody owns AIM.
1480901	1481881	You use it, Mandarin?
1482762	1483642	Every once in a while.
1483703	1491288	I mean, I have a few contacts that are primarily on there, and I just kind of keep it open with Trillion, but don't use too many people on there.
1492829	1495751	Would you want to talk to me on Xbox while I'm playing Halo?
1495771	1498393	Would you like to send me messages like, you suck at Halo, Rob.
1499755	1500876	You suck at Halo, Rob.
1501516	1502897	No one needs to actually tell you that.
1502977	1503677	Don't you already know?
1505298	1506438	Sadly, yes, I do know.
1506498	1507679	I really know.
1507799	1509019	It's not a fucking joke, people.
1509119	1510300	I really suck at Halo.
1510340	1511040	Like, really bad.
1512681	1513141	But yeah.
1513822	1517624	Supposedly, though, in MSN Messenger, you're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo.
1517964	1521185	Like, it's going to tell you what game I'm playing so you can stalk me more.
1521765	1522846	Don't you want to stalk me, Mandarin?
1523987	1524747	She's giving me a funny look.
1525547	1526348	Anyway, there you go.
1526508	1527368	Spring dashboard update.
1528088	1528349	Awesome.
1529562	1530423	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1548752	1550812	Not too much as far as video is concerned.
1551172	1560814	However, audio, though, if you want some really cool audio, you're not going to be able to use Dolby True HD and DTS HD Master Audio streams.
1561954	1563415	Not really a problem, I think, for most people.
1563475	1570896	Most people probably use the HDMI for the video and then digital out for audio.
1571196	1572456	Really, it's not that big a difference.
1572556	1577657	But, if you really want to get down to it, that's a problem for some people, I guess.
1577817	1577977	But,
1578957	1588524	Anyways, other differences include they actually have this new audio lip sync technology.
1589484	1591866	I don't really know where that would come to play with games.
1593027	1600612	Better transfer speeds, and of course if you were outputting above 1080p, which you're not going to be doing right now, at least not anytime soon.
1600912	1606316	Audio lip sync technology, would that be like, you know how like in Kingdom Hearts, because they didn't bother to re-sync the lips?
1607009	1608170	from the Japanese version.
1608210	1609892	The lips are all off sync with the English words.
1610052	1611533	Like, is that maybe what they're talking about?
1611573	1613455	Like, maybe you can sync that better?
1614155	1614416	Maybe.
1616377	1620281	But yeah, it's basically just audio is really the issue right now.
1622562	1622903	I don't know.
1623043	1624244	I don't really think that's a big deal.
1624304	1628327	I mean, like, optical is awesome.
1628367	1632471	I mean, unless you really are spending the big money for, you know, your system or something.
1633755	1635036	I really think that'd be a huge deal.
1635176	1637678	But then again, you watch it next week.
1637758	1642702	There will be a press release from Sony saying, well, we support true HD audio.
1642822	1644503	We're the fucking next generation.
1645024	1646004	You guys are not.
1646365	1649887	I mean, I can't wait to see the press release because I know it's going to happen.
1649987	1651909	Sony is more HD than your mom.
1652169	1653310	There's the press release right there.
1655746	1656807	Um, yeah.
1657788	1659049	So, guess what?
1659069	1660290	There's some sad news.
1661971	1662292	Sniff.
1663393	1672380	Apparently, um, our friends at, uh, Rooster Teeth, which, as far as I understand, was supposed to originally be called Cockbite.
1674262	1674822	Rooster Teeth.
1675142	1677164	That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite.
1678365	1681868	Um, they are, um, stopping at, uh,
1683553	1684994	Episode 100 for Red vs. Blue.
1685794	1687415	They posted it on their... You're quitting?
1687795	1688415	On their forum.
1688715	1689675	But you want to know what?
1689936	1690116	What?
1690536	1692557	I call it bullshit, because it was posted on April 1st.
1693297	1693417	Ah!
1694377	1696958	But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week, huh?
1697558	1707903	It has, and I don't see... I'm looking through the whole thing, and I don't see any type of disclaimer.
1708323	1708563	Hmm.
1708943	1710944	I would bet anything... But I still call it bullshit.
1711024	1711564	They're just going to...
1712000	1712960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1732475	1733476	But think about this, guys.
1733516	1738158	In iTunes, seriously, if you look up video game podcasts, which would you download first?
1738318	1742401	The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio or the podcast called Cockbite?
1743141	1744022	Cockbite Radio.
1744962	1745403	I don't know.
1745603	1746243	It's tempting.
1746643	1748384	After five years, we might have to change our name.
1749545	1754488	We should just call our show The Naked Lesbian Boobs.
1755280	1757762	Rock Music and Drug Show or something.
1758042	1760464	Call it Games, Games, Games, Games, Games.
1760484	1763106	I think there already is a show called Games, Games, Games.
1764547	1765308	There's so many.
1765648	1769991	I remember when we started podcasting, like there were like maybe like five video game shows in all.
1770011	1771092	We should call it Look Boobies.
1771753	1773134	There were like five video games.
1773954	1776076	Mandra, did you just show your boobs in studio?
1777897	1781100	There were like maybe five video game podcasts in all, and now there's like 500.
1781140	1781640	Stomach.
1783602	1783942	All right.
1784181	1785582	She flashed her abdomen at you.
1786182	1786722	Alright, anyway.
1790944	1791244	Anyway.
1791724	1793505	Anyway, going on to the Marketplace.
1795366	1798127	Why isn't there more Red vs. Blue downloadable in the Marketplace?
1798207	1800648	I thought they were going to do all these viral videos and things.
1801048	1803930	They have this whole section in Marketplace for viral videos.
1804330	1805791	But I can't get Lonely Girl.
1806291	1808011	I can't get Alanis is My Humps.
1808292	1811353	I can't get any of that YouTube stuff on Marketplace.
1812365	1816088	They must have the same team in charge of the backwards compatibility updates
1839767	1842670	The demo should be like end of April, right?
1843110	1843270	Ish?
1843570	1844051	Early May?
1844451	1844751	Maybe?
1844771	1845272	Coming in April.
1846613	1853018	I've been hearing that their official release has been the 15th, so, you know, mid-April.
1854119	1855901	Well, probably, I'd say late April.
1856721	1865569	Because I was just thinking, I can't think of any racing games on the Xbox 360, so I'm really excited to hear we're getting... Project Gotham Racing 3... That's a joke.
1865809	1866790	That's a joke, because there's like 50...
1868926	1873747	If you want a demo of fucking Forza Motorsports 2, just play Project Gotham Racing 3.
1875127	1875607	More or less.
1876447	1876747	Alright.
1877628	1880128	MotoGP.
1880528	1893250	Anyways, so, as we mentioned earlier, Red Octane, and actually they have admitted to it now, but apparently there's been some issues with the whammy bars on some of the Guitar Hero 2 controllers.
1893810	1898151	Now, I personally haven't experienced this yet since my game is still in the shrink wrap, but
1899123	1903789	I have picked up the guitar and the weighing bar feels a little cheap.
1904751	1912921	Anywho, so apparently the ones affected by it, there's two SKUs actually that are defective.
1913522	1916826	The first one is, let's see here.
1917329	1922172	I believe it's like a 95055, and then the other one is 95065.
1923793	1925595	And apparently you can see... Wait, sorry, sorry.
1925655	1927736	I just came back in the room and I have my Explorer controller.
1927776	1928357	What'd you say now?
1928417	1929017	What am I looking for?
1929037	1929097	95055 or 95065.
1929477	1930478	Fuck!
1930718	1933900	I have a 95065.
1934421	1937823	God damn you, Loki.
1937843	1944148	You told me this broke-as-fuck Xbox 360 Explorer controller.
1944188	1945729	I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar.
1945789	1945989	Pshh.
1947315	1948255	I'm just going to take mine apart.
1948516	1948976	Take it back.
1949156	1950296	Because you know what I want to do?
1950396	1963542	I want to get mad props on the internet, and I want to make a distortion pedal, since it can't be that hard to figure out how the fuck that distortion pedal works, since it's just a damn Ethernet cord there.
1965263	1968264	Anyways, so yeah, that's what's up.
1968484	1975627	Apparently, they want you to return your guitar and get a new one that's not one of those two models.
1976684	1981628	They didn't really say what's defective, but if it's giving you crap, that's what you need to do.
1981668	1990073	If you bought it from Red Octane, you can contact them, the GIMRMA, or if you purchase it elsewhere, you may need to go bitch them out.
1991255	1993157	Either way, it's stupid.
1993497	1994658	Don't they test this stuff?
1995038	1996599	I mean, shouldn't they test these batches?
1996659	2000842	If there's four different types of guitars made, obviously there were some issues or something.
2000902	2002564	Why revise the product?
2002664	2003444	It's the whammy bar.
2003484	2004946	I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar.
2005046	2009289	And when I'm playing the game, it feels like the whammy bar doesn't register like it should.
2009709	2010510	Like I noticed it.
2011511	2013972	It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one.
2014513	2014953	I could tell.
2015093	2015874	Like it works.
2016054	2017175	It's not completely broken.
2017574	2020495	But it doesn't do the wah-wah-wah very easily.
2020595	2021856	Like, it's either on or it's off.
2022116	2024817	Like, that's kind of what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar to me.
2025957	2026398	So, yeah.
2029679	2031299	Thank you for selling me a bum Xbox 360 guitar.
2031339	2032300	Hey, it's not my fault.
2032440	2034081	It's all the launch ones, I think, are like that.
2034101	2035761	But why the... This is what I'm saying, though.
2036101	2040063	Why have four different guitar revisions on some product?
2040103	2043184	I mean, why revise the design four times?
2043304	2045045	I mean, seriously, what's the big deal?
2045922	2049685	Unless these are coming from four different production factories or something like that.
2050305	2053127	One in China, one in Malaysia, one in Hong Kong.
2053228	2055209	And two of those are fucked up or something.
2056530	2063115	I don't believe that two would be broken in the exact same way, but I don't know.
2064556	2067858	Yes, iKun is wondering in our chat room, why are there four different guitars anyway?
2068339	2072462	Kyle Snyder says, why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?
2073653	2079238	How about test your product and if it's defective, don't send out hundreds of thousands of them.
2079658	2083661	SSJ100Matt says, smash it, videotape it, and throw it on the OLR YouTube.
2084422	2084702	Maybe.
2085102	2085803	Maybe once I'm done.
2086383	2086924	I'll tell you this.
2087244	2094370	If I can unlock all 1,000 achievement points or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero, then I'll smash my controller and put it on YouTube.
2094390	2096091	There's going to be tons of download content, though.
2096752	2097052	We'll see.
2097853	2100855	Speaking of which, when is some new DDR content coming up?
2100875	2102416	Because there's just a one song pack.
2102436	2102997	Don't hold your breath.
2105635	2106256	RedOctane
2135859	2139682	GS68 says convert your guitar to a machine gun.
2140422	2142904	I'm gonna have it implanted on my leg like Rose McGowan.
2143084	2144085	Dude, that's hot.
2144906	2148689	Alright, what's also hot is hell in our FUs of the week.
2148889	2149589	DarkSakura.
2150710	2160518	My FU of the week goes to the line at Marie Callender's this morning when I was standing in it.
2161538	2163560	You stood between me and my ex-Benedict bitches.
2165600	2167261	Loki, your FU of the week.
2167722	2176608	Um, FU of the week goes to the movie Premonition, because I knew it sucked, but yet I went to see it because, you know, the wife wanted to see it.
2177728	2180030	Now, that movie is so horrible.
2180050	2186394	I hate Sandra Bullock so much, but I gotta admit, I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie.
2187155	2190357	The way the character dies at the end is so, like, stupid.
2191538	2193119	Oh, man, I just couldn't stop laughing.
2193925	2194726	I was going to be in the theater.
2194766	2196687	Thanks for the spoilers, by the way.
2196707	2197127	Who cares?
2197908	2198529	Don't see it.
2198609	2199429	It's a horrible movie.
2201211	2203612	My FU of the week goes to the movie Babel.
2204193	2204653	Babel?
2204813	2205274	Babel?
2205534	2205954	Babel?
2206314	2206735	Babel.
2206895	2207335	Babel.
2208556	2210297	Although I actually really like the movie.
2210598	2213960	That was way too many pussy shots for one movie.
2214421	2216382	And it was the same pussy every time.
2216862	2220105	Like, I know that girl's vagina inside and out.
2221073	2226097	In glorious HD high-definition DVD, thanks to my player in Netflix.
2226677	2227157	Wow!
2228378	2231500	All right, Mandarin, do you have any FUs of the week?
2232541	2238745	Yes, I'd like to say FU to the tweeters who stole our motorcycle now that we, you know, started fixing it.
2238805	2246731	Because, you know, we have to go out and essentially get new bearings, because you ripped the pegs off of that actual motorcycle bike properly.
2246811	2247832	So, screw you.
2251260	2252701	Don't steal shit, people!
2254342	2257105	Probably the same fuckers who broke into my car like 50 times.
2259186	2259566	All right.
2260507	2263149	Well, back to some gaming news, huh?
2264330	2265891	Maybe, if I feel like it.
2266472	2268934	F you to DarkSakura for being a bitch.
2269094	2269955	Hey, you know what?
2270515	2271636	People love my bitchiness.
2272537	2277881	Anyway, Marvel Ultimate Alliance has eight downloadable characters on Xbox 360.
2277981	2279382	I don't know about anything else, just because...
2280203	2282704	which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one, but I don't care.
2283324	2295029	Anyway, the downloadable characters effective April 10th are Hulk, Hawkeye, which makes me happy, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, another one of my favorites, Doctor Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth, and Venom.
2295789	2296409	Venom is cool.
2296810	2297630	That's very cool.
2297690	2305033	Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360, has all their abilities, costumes, dialogue, conversations, achievement points.
2305493	2307894	But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool.
2309025	2319107	If you haven't bought the game yet and you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360, I'd wait until next month because they're going to do, just like the Call of Duty 3, a gold edition of it with the characters packed in.
2319227	2320988	So save yourself like $10.
2321128	2323488	Or just play it on PS3.
2323668	2324368	Or buy it used.
2325989	2327149	Or don't buy it at all.
2327169	2329349	That'd be my preference.
2329469	2333250	Or come over to my house and bring controllers because we need more people to play with me.
2333590	2333910	All right.
2334651	2335571	But no Wonder Woman?
2335631	2336271	No Wonder Woman.
2337614	2339815	That's DC Comics, dummy.
2339975	2341455	I learned that last week the hard way.
2341475	2342515	I just felt like fucking with you.
2343136	2343796	All right.
2345336	2349557	Well, we weren't fucking with you when we told you over and over again that Nights is coming out to the Wii.
2350057	2350518	And I don't know.
2350698	2352638	Somehow that got confirmed again.
2353138	2355179	Like blogs were rerunning the story.
2355599	2357820	Nights is confirmed yet again.
2358100	2359240	Journey into Dreams.
2359320	2360440	Or no, Journey of Dreams.
2360980	2362861	And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?
2363148	2364749	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2391052	2391592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2422150	2422290	Pink!
2422330	2422450	Pink!
2450339	2452840	and I bet you anything the console colors are coming as well.
2453200	2454840	But my question is though is this.
2455720	2457741	The controllers aren't out there anyways now.
2457861	2459901	What's it matter if they're in different colors as well?
2459941	2461042	You still can't get them.
2461342	2466543	I mean, people are going to be... Silver is such a weird color too for like a controller.
2467623	2471284	Mandarin, you did a little jerk-off motion when you heard this story.
2471344	2474785	What are your thoughts on the nunchucks and remotes and different colors?
2475745	2478546	I have a remote skin, like the ones like...
2479614	2480254	Thanks for watching!
2500914	2502495	And your Wiimote has not gotten AIDS.
2502875	2503355	So good job.
2503535	2507558	To clarify this also, this is coming from a European retail list.
2507618	2514142	Apparently, according to that, it will be shipping on June 29th in the UK.
2514342	2518185	So, not, of course, an official confirmation, but come on!
2518585	2522127	Of course Nintendo's going to do different colored, you know, remotes and stuff.
2523528	2527731	I don't know, the silver, blue, and pink, that's kind of a weird combo of colors there.
2527751	2528952	Isn't that all the colors of the DS?
2528972	2529132	Yes.
2530438	2531359	There's no silver in this.
2531379	2532180	Yeah, there is.
2532220	2533441	The original one was silver.
2534281	2534402	Oh.
2534762	2535322	Silvery.
2536063	2536584	Silverish.
2537104	2537504	I guess.
2537524	2538565	Those are all DS colors.
2539766	2539867	Gray.
2539887	2540267	Oh, sorry.
2540387	2540927	Gray.
2541548	2541828	Whatever.
2541868	2542289	It's silver.
2545171	2548374	Well, we can all call it what we want to, but that doesn't necessarily make it true.
2549475	2556441	Well, something that I think is really stupid... You know, we weren't really supposed to talk about this situation again, but...
2559068	2566296	We all remember the woman that drank all the water and, you know, pretty much killed herself.
2566376	2567377	How could we forget?
2567417	2568358	We freaking live here.
2568398	2570500	It was all over the news for like months.
2571738	2579321	Well, basically, they are not filing any criminal charges against the radio station.
2582362	2591405	The district attorney basically is quoted saying, Jennifer Strange was an adult who voluntarily participated in the radio contest.
2591945	2598728	She knew what the contest involved when she entered it and had the option to stop or discontinue her participation in the contest at any time.
2599389	2603093	However, the civil suit is still in process.
2604214	2606797	And that morning show, though, is still canceled.
2606877	2607918	The staffers are fired.
2607938	2608238	I don't know.
2608579	2610421	And they still haven't replaced it, by the way.
2611442	2617488	I think they're still doing that cheesy make your own playlist and come in and DJ for the morning.
2617528	2619931	Like they're trying to get people off the street to fill in because they think.
2620219	2623420	Like, seriously, no one will touch that radio station with a 10-foot pole right now.
2623460	2626942	I wonder if I could play my own music, but unfortunately they have a strict guideline.
2627002	2630903	I actually was going to send in an entry for it, but you have to join their little online club.
2631163	2632224	But maybe I should do that.
2632304	2633464	I mean, wouldn't that be kind of funny?
2633725	2642728	Like, Loki, we should all send in a playlist and just put Beyonce, My Chemical Romance, I don't know, just put all the Top 40 crap on there and get in there and do it.
2642768	2643489	Wouldn't that be fun?
2643849	2646090	No, not really, because I don't listen to that station.
2646750	2646870	But...
2648099	2650180	I don't entirely agree with that statement.
2650220	2655903	I think that they didn't fully disclose the risks involved with it.
2656544	2657524	Yes, she is an adult.
2657564	2659866	If she was feeling sick or whatever, she could bow out.
2660886	2668310	But I don't think they fully explained the risks to them as far as what's involved and what could possibly happen, including death.
2668350	2670451	That's all going to come out in the civil lawsuit.
2670852	2673293	To be honest, it's no surprise to me that a criminal...
2673968	2678512	Dark Charge wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying they were set out to kill someone.
2679112	2683256	Like they were going into this contest thinking, hey, you know what we should do for ratings?
2683296	2684017	Let's kill someone.
2684137	2687620	Well, I don't think that would work.
2688601	2690002	We thought about it, but you know.
2691400	2691720	I don't know.
2692081	2697344	But still, I still think they can get them on negligence just, you know, for not disclosing this stuff.
2697384	2702708	I mean, hell, if they can get, like, McDonald's on not disclosing that coffee's hot, I mean, they should build it.
2702748	2703949	That's a civil lawsuit.
2704710	2708212	The owner of McDonald's did not go to jail for a year because the coffee was hot.
2708312	2710273	They should because their fries suck sometimes.
2710313	2710714	The end.
2711334	2715877	And they keep hiring these people that don't speak any English and they always file my orders.
2715897	2718219	That station will get sued for $11 billion.
2718239	2718639	It's coming.
2718840	2719340	It's coming.
2719780	2722063	and they will get sold and change their name.
2722163	2725646	It's counting down till the days till that radio station has to change their name.
2725766	2728429	And then we will see the headline on the news.
2728750	2730772	Is it the end of the end?
2732073	2733494	Wah, wah.
2733514	2735356	They're saving that headline.
2736497	2739100	Saving it.
2739380	2739681	Love it.
2741623	2742203	All right, well...
2744389	2752635	While we wait for more information on the Jennifer Strange lawsuit stuff, because I know you love and thrive on all that information.
2752795	2754236	There's some of us who actually just don't care.
2754376	2754777	Yeah, I know.
2755357	2756298	I was being facetious.
2756998	2757919	I have release dates.
2758399	2764464	See, what I was doing was I was buying time while I was pulling up the Japanese release dates, because I was a lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance.
2764984	2769348	But now I can tell you about all these great games coming out to the Japanese market.
2769368	2770989	And you can also horribly...
2771778	2775939	Listen to me horribly, horribly butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles.
2776300	2780621	Of which it actually does not seem like there's a whole lot coming out over in Japan this week.
2781001	2786203	For PlayStation 2, there's a game called Grim Grimoire, which is coming out.
2786443	2792105	And also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent on the PlayStation 2 finally gets its way in Japan.
2793406	2796927	Also coming out, there's a couple titles on the DS.
2797512	2798453	Watashi no Relaxuma
2818106	2820747	is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS from the Rocket Cup.
2820787	2821387	Relaxuma sounds fun.
2821507	2822348	Relaxuma.
2822708	2828550	And actually, it looks like, and Jamie, maybe you'd like this, does it look like little bears massaging each other or something?
2829551	2829951	It does.
2830211	2834893	It's like, I don't know, it looks like the old bear is reading and the little bear is walking on his back.
2834973	2838955	Like, you know, some folks used to do that to massage.
2838995	2843017	Or the bear is going to murder the other bear with that little pointy red flag.
2843057	2844817	He's going to play with his... He's like, I...
2847450	2850913	I call this land in the name of France and stab them through the temple.
2851834	2852435	That's hot.
2852455	2854456	So really not an exciting week in Japan, sorry.
2856518	2861302	Well, if you're looking for excitement in the United States, well, sorry.
2862103	2863264	You better wait until next week.
2863664	2868589	Although, there is one good game coming out this week, Super Paper Mario, on the Wii.
2869670	2871551	That's about it, to be honest.
2871631	2873353	I mean, there's a couple PSP games coming out.
2873928	2874708	None worth mentioning.
2875329	2877169	And yeah, that is your week.
2877229	2879410	So buy Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii.
2880171	2880471	Ha!
2882272	2882492	Ha.
2882892	2886333	But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC.
2886353	2887514	That game looks awesome.
2887534	2888894	Wasn't that supposed to come out last week?
2889455	2889795	I don't know.
2890095	2892316	I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week.
2893356	2896738	Yeah, it's just a really, really sad week.
2897638	2901179	Well, it's really not looking much better for the UK.
2901279	2901800	We have...
2903468	2904209	Fear is coming out.
2904269	2904850	That's a good game.
2907052	2908954	Godfather of the Dawns Edition on PS3.
2910055	2912678	Gurumin, A Monstrous Adventure on the PSP.
2912758	2919945	Harvest Moon DS, Hotel Dusk Room 215, Pokemon Ranger, and Wing Island on Wii.
2921046	2924149	Maybe Hotel Dusk Room 215 will do better, like in Europe.
2924960	2925380	Hey Rob, guess what?
2925400	2925480	What?
2925500	2925640	Heart.
2950771	2956774	You know what game I saw a video for that kind of made it look fun to play?
2957614	2959315	Cabela's African Safari.
2960115	2971020	They have it where you can go into bullet time as you're diving towards a lion or something like that and you can snipe lions in the head.
2971300	2977363	Although they already said in Africa you're not going to be hunting animals.
2978496	2980578	Which is like the one reason I would buy the game.
2980598	2985702	It'd be awesome if it's resistance in Africa and you're just blowing crap up.
2986062	2988484	Africa.
2989244	2989845	Alright, well.
2991586	2997070	Speaking of games we won't be seeing anytime soon, because I don't know about you, I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa since E3.
2997711	2999632	But here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon.
2999712	3000573	Mother 3.
3001073	3001734	That's right.
3001994	3005497	And just to pour salt in the wounds, guess what Nintendo did this week?
3006138	3009479	Nintendo posted the soundtrack on iTunes.
3010139	3012359	And no, not the Japanese store.
3012739	3016740	You can actually get the Mother 3 soundtrack in the US store.
3017520	3019540	So you can download some of the songs from Mother 3.
3019600	3022601	Wait, what's this Mandarin?
3022621	3023421	You have a game release?
3024581	3027302	Salmon Max Episode 5 is going to be released Thursday.
3029642	3030402	Wasn't that already out?
3030482	3031802	I thought Episode 5 came out.
3031942	3032602	I thought it did too.
3033783	3035503	Oh, it already released on Thursday.
3036638	3037639	That's on GameTap.
3037659	3039861	Because GameTap does roll out their new games on Thursday.
3040742	3046687	And I had a friend who was playing it, but I think this friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do on GameTap.
3047028	3047788	Because he's special.
3049550	3050331	You getting told?
3050531	3051211	Chatroom's telling you?
3051852	3062482	Alright, well anyway, if you are waiting for Sam and Max or just don't have GameTap and you want to download some music from Mother 3, you can download such gems as We Miss You, The Theme of Love.
3084023	3086025	Slow jams of Earthbound.
3086645	3086965	Lame.
3086985	3090328	I don't know why anyone would want to be interested in that stupid game.
3090388	3099254	Because there are rabid fucking Mother fans out there on the internet that will download anything that remotely has to do with Mother.
3099474	3106119	We used to have a whole cluster from some... There was some website dedicated to Mother in the Earthbound series, and I can't remember the name of it.
3106359	3109982	But there was a period of time when there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show.
3110022	3110662	Don't you remember that?
3111603	3111743	Nope.
3112628	3114610	Well, God, you don't care about our listeners, do you?
3115611	3116131	Well, then, fine.
3116191	3116672	New story.
3117312	3117633	Anyways.
3119034	3119935	Thank you, DarkTetsuya.
3119975	3120795	Starman.net.
3120835	3121236	That was it.
3122677	3131344	Miyamoto, of course, inspired by PlayStation Home, wants to expand the world of the Miis.
3131885	3140272	In other words, he wants to do more things with them, including have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them.
3141397	3147541	How about you start by, I don't know, giving third-party companies access to put Miis in their game?
3147621	3149723	That might be a good way to expand the experience.
3150063	3160089	Or, I don't know, how about do something a little bit more than just have them wandering around their little white existence in there.
3161811	3166714	But yeah, he plans on seeing a vast virtual world with the Miis.
3168183	3174948	They're not starting too well with the, was it that Vote For Your Favorite Me channel that's supposed to be coming out eventually?
3175828	3176148	Who cares?
3176168	3177489	A Mare Me Can Idol?
3180431	3181412	Or Sanjaya Me?
3183033	3183514	Okay.
3185835	3186696	Well, anyway.
3187336	3188237	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
3189978	3191179	This makes me kind of sad.
3192800	3194801	Because our dear hero...
3198047	3206932	Nomura Tetsuya is not affiliated with the new Kingdom Hearts coming out.
3207992	3210153	Wait, but we saw that trailer last week, right?
3210934	3215376	Or at least it was tacked on at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix or whatever?
3215976	3217437	So they're going on without him or what?
3219197	3225160	What he's basically telling a Dengeki PlayStation is, and this is a quote, first, it's not Kingdom Hearts 3.
3225721	3228583	Of course, because we're calling it a new series, it won't be Kingdom Hearts 3.
3230364	3233346	Also, it's a series, so it won't be just one title.
3236208	3239330	He's saying that basically he's working on a different story.
3241031	3241331	I don't know.
3241391	3242552	Not the next Kingdom Hearts.
3244033	3245954	It's a spin-off of the Kingdom Hearts series.
3246034	3246615	Online.
3246835	3246895	MMO.
3246975	3247115	MMO.
3248294	3248534	I bet.
3248554	3249435	That would be hot.
3249455	3249915	MMO.
3250595	3252637	I would totally quit World of Warcraft for that.
3252857	3253277	I don't think so.
3253337	3254078	I think here's what it is.
3254198	3257019	I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series without Disney.
3259261	3259881	But why?
3259961	3262643	I mean, that's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts in the first place.
3262743	3263483	I mean, I don't know.
3263844	3270007	Now we all play it for the Roxas and Axel slash.
3270348	3270908	Fuck that.
3274610	3275411	Well, we'll see what happens.
3275471	3275771	Okay.
3276338	3278219	Dustcap 2 makes it funny in chat.
3278279	3279639	Kingdom Hearts X1.
3281119	3282020	Like Mega Man, get it?
3282060	3282420	Har.
3284120	3284440	Laugh.
3285261	3285661	LOL.
3286761	3289262	Well, this is also leaving a lot of people with a, huh?
3289462	3293503	kind of look, is that Resident Evil 4 has been confirmed for the Wii.
3294563	3301285	Now, yes, that's Resident Evil 4, the game that you could already play with your GameCube backwards compatibility.
3301772	3303333	will now be coming out on the Wii.
3303634	3309078	This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube games, they could easily redo them for the Wii with the new functionality.
3309319	3310920	Well, here it is in motion right here.
3312321	3317165	You're going to now be able to, obviously you use the Wii controls as part of the game.
3317466	3323651	It'll have widescreen support, although I believe the old one had widescreen support as well, but I guess now you can get progressive scan and all that good stuff.
3325072	3326894	Well, couldn't the old one do progressive scan as well?
3327415	3328236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3350055	3352397	Some interactive event scenes use the Wii buttons.
3352657	3354278	You have to shake the Wii mode in part of it.
3355158	3364004	The producer of the Wii version was talking to Famitsu Magazine and said that they want to allow families who play the Wii together to experience Resident Evil.
3364444	3368487	So in other words, no more chainsaw your face off, I guess.
3368507	3370068	I guess they're going to have to do something about that.
3370368	3374891	But there are going to be easy and amateur difficulty settings to make the game a little bit easier.
3376002	3379165	Also, the bonus elements from the PlayStation 2 will be in the Wii release.
3379525	3384129	So you can do the Ada sequence, the Another Order sequence.
3384389	3387712	So that's, I guess, something that you didn't have on your backwards compatibility.
3390334	3395398	They're going to have to do something about Chainsaw Man taking off your head, though, for the family play.
3395458	3397880	They're going to really need to do something like that, about that.
3398861	3401043	Oh, man, that's funny.
3401083	3402764	Instead, he gives you flowers.
3403725	3404806	Resident Evil Family Edition.
3407401	3420535	Anyways, so, yeah, I think it's funny, though, that they were saying that, you know, you can redo some of the old GameCube games, because I think most of the games that have come out recently, especially by Ubisoft, are just old GameCube games that have been ported over to the Wii.
3421316	3423318	Oh, Super Paper Mario, to some extent, is that.
3423358	3424599	I mean, granted, they went back and reworked it.
3424619	3425380	Yeah, Twilight Princess.
3425400	3426601	Twilight Princess, perfect example.
3426641	3426841	True.
3428468	3434273	Prince of Persia 2 Hot damn, when do you think we're going to get a Wii game that was actually made for the Wii?
3434293	3437455	What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube game they were thinking about too?
3438076	3457511	I don't know I think they were probably actually doing for the Wii Prince of Persia Rival Swords A lot of the stuff that's been out Bionicle Heroes that's coming out, that was a GameCube title Open Season, a lot of the movie tie-in stuff I don't know, it's just bad
3457904	3458605	Even... Anyways.
3459225	3463008	Some of our chatroom, by the way, is coming up with new slogans and commercials for Resident Evil 4.
3463348	3465449	Like, you know, that, We would like to play.
3465629	3466370	The whole thing there.
3467591	3471333	Bandit has come up with some new taglines, including, We die together.
3471793	3473835	And, We would like to kill you.
3475576	3476156	So, there you go.
3476217	3476757	Free marketing.
3477397	3477617	Hmm.
3479899	3480179	Anyways.
3480760	3487084	There's a rumor that mass shortage... Or, mass storage is coming to the Wii.
3487104	3487164	Hmm.
3487988	3497275	Um, although, unfortunately, I think this rumor has been squashed because it had to do with a press release by a company called ESOL Middleware.
3498176	3510325	Um, they have, uh, basically a FAT driver, uh, for the file system, and there's another driver for USB host stuff, which apparently is already being implemented into the Wii.
3510485	3514689	So, this is probably not the case, uh, for right now.
3514709	3516390	They said it was for the, um,
3517674	3526224	DarkSakura might use that mass storage device to save her favorite websites she visits when surfing the internet.
3539568	3540629	DarkSakura.com, home of pterodactyl porn.
3540649	3541949	It needs nothing else said about it.
3541969	3542510	It's Pornotube.com.
3569724	3570485	pterodactyl porn.
3571285	3572786	Children, ask your parents for permission.
3572806	3574148	You want pterodactyl porn.
3575749	3576670	Adults only.
3579332	3580713	It does not count mental state of adult life.
3580733	3582194	What's been up with your website of the week lately?
3582214	3583295	They've all been like X-rated.
3583795	3589340	I have no idea, because it's like... Someone's been thinking about sex.
3590140	3590461	No.
3591722	3595445	Someone's been, um... busy.
3595805	3598447	Saikun says, why don't we just make this Rob's website of the week?
3599629	3602151	Okay, I will think of an original website of the week next week.
3602371	3602732	All right.
3603372	3604072	I promise.
3604193	3606254	Well, DarkSakura frequents the porno tube.
3606294	3609136	I mean, she's not afraid to get down with the porno tube.
3609736	3610017	All right.
3611418	3623286	Well, speaking of... We talked about GameTap earlier in the show and kind of how... I guess Mandarin clarified that it was on the private server, the new Sam & Max, but it will be released to the public this Thursday.
3623546	3624007	So that's cool.
3624867	3627229	Something else that's there hidden away, tucked away...
3627645	3630146	Apparently some Sega Saturn games are in there.
3630206	3633326	There's a game called Bug that shows up.
3633346	3634227	Which was lame, by the way.
3634447	3638768	Well, but nevertheless, it was on the Sega Saturn, and it's there in GameTap.
3639128	3641609	And apparently there's some Easter Egg games.
3642009	3643389	It's part of a promotion GameTap's doing.
3643409	3644769	I haven't logged into GameTap in a while.
3644829	3646270	I have it, but I haven't used it in a while.
3646630	3649831	I haven't done it since I did my week on Myst Online a while back.
3650591	3654032	Apparently there's some other games hidden away, too, but those haven't come to light yet.
3655052	3655312	But...
3656644	3664187	Something that some sharp-eyed folks have noticed is that if you look at the controls in the game, the controls actually mention the shift key.
3664567	3668508	So is it possible this is just a PC version of Bug that's tucked away?
3669068	3673010	So, don't know yet if this means that there are actually Saturn games coming.
3673750	3681072	But nevertheless, it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega's been a big supporter of GameTap because, you know, you have a lot of Genesis games and Master System games.
3681372	3683373	And hell, you have Dreamcast games in there.
3683753	3684714	So why not Saturn?
3684734	3685674	It makes sense.
3688166	3691327	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD.
3693368	3698809	Seg in chat says, GameTap has included the Sega Saturn emulator, so you'll get more Saturn games later.
3699289	3701730	GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator.
3702130	3702550	Oh, there you go.
3703291	3703571	Cool.
3704211	3704511	Yay.
3706572	3713554	Well, speaking of emulating stuff, a game called Piano Hero on the PC.
3713654	3714474	Some guy's making it.
3715655	3729803	and it's basically a freeware open source project that lets people with MIDI capable keyboards play any MIDI file as if it were like a Guitar Hero style track or think back to, I don't know, Keyboard Mania.
3731104	3743111	However, Activision has now sent a cease and desist order to the guy behind it, Nicholas, looks like he got a peach done, and
3744065	3772386	well basically the only thing he has to do which is not too bad is he has to change the name because they want to make sure that people aren't getting confused that it's an actual official Activision product or something like that so he can keep on making the game as long as he names it something else I don't know, that's not bad you know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though I don't know does he really have to change the name?
3773610	3776232	Um, yeah, basically they've sent, you know, cease and desist.
3776252	3780695	Well, no, no, no, I'm not saying based on cease and desist, but do they really have the legal right to make them change the name?
3780895	3781256	I don't know.
3782116	3786699	Maybe unless they're, you know, they have something, um, you know, coming out.
3787180	3787500	I don't know.
3789041	3796646	It says among the various products, uh, Activision publishes, um, are Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2 video games.
3796967	3803211	It says as such, Activision is the owner of certain intellectual property rights, including Guitar Hero franchise and
3803703	3806926	including but not limited to the trademark guitar hero.
3807546	3810109	It says, blah, blah, blah.
3810149	3810789	Let's see here.
3810909	3813552	I'm trying to see exactly what it is.
3813592	3825342	It says, it comes to attention that you've been using the name Piano Hero in connection with your game that you designed for Halite Studios where it includes a printout of your website showing such.
3826022	3830806	In our opinion, your use of the name Piano Hero constitutes a...
3832165	3839129	at least trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition with the respect to the trademark guitar hero.
3840550	3841031	I don't know.
3842051	3845834	It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get named similarly all the time.
3847695	3850096	Especially when it comes to a lot of puzzle games.
3850357	3850697	I don't know.
3850717	3852318	I'm just trying to think here.
3852398	3853238	Here's a perfect example.
3853298	3857961	There's a movie studio out there that does knock-off movies like Snakes on a Train.
3858702	3858782	Or...
3859451	3862252	for the new Transformers movie, Transmorphers.
3863293	3864113	See, there you go.
3864173	3864633	Exactly.
3864673	3864973	There you go.
3864993	3865614	It's a great example.
3866694	3866954	Let's see.
3867234	3872257	Landmine Fairy suggests Keyboard Villain as a possible name to replace Guitar Villain.
3872277	3873797	Didn't they already license Guitar Villain?
3873897	3874618	Not officially.
3874878	3880420	I mean, it's been licensed, but there's no game out on the market yet, which, by the way, that's one of my favorite chatroom names ever is Landmine Fairy.
3882181	3883922	Also, Bandit makes a good suggestion.
3884284	3885785	Go to GuitarHero.com.
3885885	3889088	It's a site for action figures not associated with Activision.
3889448	3891570	They should sue Activision ASAP.
3891890	3892290	I agree.
3892631	3893671	Turnabout fair play, right?
3894412	3894612	Yep.
3896914	3907783	Or how about, I don't know, the fact that I would say it's infringing more on keyboard mania than, you know, at least that game actually exists.
3909764	3913447	AlphaCanonGram suggests a name that will probably sell more copies of the game.
3913803	3914884	Piano Pornostar.
3915925	3916825	Piano Pornostar.
3917145	3918526	Piano Pornostar is a pretty awesome name.
3919027	3920067	Piano Cockbite.
3923710	3926332	And on that note, we're going to bring Part A to a close here.
3926592	3927112	Oh, real quick.
3927313	3929054	Mandarin, you wanted to give a special shout-out, right?
3929074	3930415	You haven't been saying much this segment anyway.
3930435	3934878	I just want to give a special shout-out to Seg in the chat room.
3935338	3937760	He's a friend of mine currently in Boston.
3937840	3938841	He was working at Inverson.
3939767	3940547	Emerson College.
3940708	3944970	He just got a job at Telltale Games out in San Rafael.
3946171	3954435	He's going to be being the new build engineer for all the Sam & Max episodes from this point, once he starts there from this point forward.
3955295	3957957	And I believe he starts next week or the following week.
3960029	3962952	Didn't we see something a while back about Sam and Max?
3962992	3965614	They were trying to hire people to port it to Xbox Live or something.
3965634	3967616	There was a job posting on the internet.
3967897	3969178	Did your friend get that job?
3969578	3969859	Maybe?
3970019	3970459	Kinda?
3971280	3971680	Sorta?
3972281	3972982	Something like it?
3973522	3974283	Huh, interesting.
3974743	3975424	Well, that's still cool.
3975664	3977626	Well, he will have to come on the show later if he can.
3977686	3979328	I don't know, there might be NDAs at the Wazoo.
3980088	3983672	So, get your friend to come to our show because Sam and Max is pretty cool.
3984948	3988511	Also, Part B tonight, we're bringing back an old favorite.
3988531	3991353	We're going to play some match game in Part B tonight.
3992033	3994155	So that means we need to get some contestants during the break.
3994475	3996456	So we'll take one on the Skype line later.
3996577	3997097	Don't call yet.
3997137	3998698	We'll take one on the Skype line when we actually do the game.
3998958	4000419	But we need a chatroom contestant.
4000459	4004322	So to find a chatroom contestant, we always ask a trivia question live here on the program.
4004762	4006343	Here is tonight's trivia question.
4007264	4012027	We're going to be talking about a new game in Part B tonight called Rock Band.
4012047	4014069	Of course, a lot of you guys have heard about this.
4014420	4018242	But Rock Band was not the first game that would allow you to put together a full band.
4018962	4025705	There was actually an arcade series, and I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program for a long time now, you know these games very well.
4026005	4032948	There used to be three games that would all session together to form your own band so you could play games at the arcade.
4033488	4033948	Name them.
4034368	4037730	First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat.
4037750	4041171	Send a message to Sky in chat room with the name of the three games.
4041567	4044409	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
4045030	4047992	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
