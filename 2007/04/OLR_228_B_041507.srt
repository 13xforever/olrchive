[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:19,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15, 2007.

5
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:22,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Tax Day to you.

6
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:27,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're thinking, gosh, my taxes were long due.

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.

8
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:34,505
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you've downloaded probably our audio archive, also known as podcasting.

9
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:38,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Lauren's Launch Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in two parts.

10
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want to hear it, you know, even before it's on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.

11
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:52,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6 o'clock.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of be listening around 5.30.

13
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Standard Time, or 9 a.m.

14
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: on Tuesdays, Pacific Time.

15
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.

16
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into some gaming news to talk about.

17
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's start it off.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,151
[SPEAKER_09]: We need our Death March to play, Rob.

19
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

20
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,011
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it playing.

21
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:14,552
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.

22
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:17,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, for a moment, I thought you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars.

23
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:17,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind of cool.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway... Unfortunately, I only have the one... No, I don't even have that.

25
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:23,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I have...

26
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Death to PlayStation 3.

27
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:27,763
[SPEAKER_09]: The 20 gigabyte model is kaput.

28
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:33,906
[SPEAKER_09]: It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so saith Sony.

29
00:01:51,021 --> 00:02:01,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the consumer market said, we like the 60 gigabyte one because the 20 gig one just completely blows my ass.

30
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:07,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20.

31
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:15,494
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I don't know if that's going to make it all this special thing.

32
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,156
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it lasted six months.

33
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you own one of these, right?

34
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:21,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do.

35
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:28,016
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just as good as the fucking 60 gig because there's nothing on their download store to actually put on there.

36
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:32,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not very easy to get videos on there.

37
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:37,181
[SPEAKER_12]: And do I really need wireless internet when it's sitting less than two feet away from a router?

38
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:37,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably not.

39
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:38,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a 60.

40
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:45,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki has like a collector's item now because, you know, those 20 gigs are going to be super rare now.

41
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And do I need the fucking silver, you know, the silver, like,

42
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,950
[SPEAKER_12]: A little pinstripe, whatever.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's the rare one now.

45
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking awesome, yeah.

46
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:03,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Suck that, folks.

47
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:08,934
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like they're admitting that the 20 gig is no longer available.

48
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:11,435
[SPEAKER_12]: It hasn't been available for months now.

49
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:17,756
[SPEAKER_12]: This was something that happened I want to say around January.

50
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since you all found out you can't order one

51
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,549
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice that they're finally copping to that stuff.

52
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:30,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so some other fun stuff.

53
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,532
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

54
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:43,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony is trying to get in on the wireless kind of handheld input devices, very similar to the Wii now.

55
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:48,999
[SPEAKER_12]: And not exactly copying the Wii, but it's a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.

56
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:55,630
[SPEAKER_12]: They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a power glove.

57
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:03,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I don't know, games and stuff.

58
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.

59
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:07,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

60
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it looks kind of cool.

61
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't really give a crap if it's a rip-off of Nintendo or whatever.

62
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,336
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, who cares?

63
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Just make it...

64
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Long as it doesn't suck like the eye toy did, I'm all for it.

65
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:26,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a glove?

66
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a little... So like the power glove?

67
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,951
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not really like the power glove.

68
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:37,556
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for your thumb.

69
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:44,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the middle, there's like... I don't know if it's something that'll cause it to tighten up or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of...

70
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,047
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

71
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing was awesome.

72
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:21,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.

73
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:25,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.

74
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, here's what it's also going to allow you to do.

75
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:39,685
[SPEAKER_12]: It says they're going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending figures.

76
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,867
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can flip off the thing and it will know that.

77
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,732
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people at home and stuff.

78
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:53,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah blah blah.

79
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:55,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Tactile feedback.

80
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.

81
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's basically going to be like VR gloves.

82
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:04,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray.

83
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one thing to say about that.

84
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:07,811
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

85
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:08,512
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so bad.

86
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:19,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I don't know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog Three Speech from Sony has talked about some upcoming PlayStation 3 games.

87
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.

88
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:35,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, that's when we'll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air, foot, and vehicle combat game Warhawk, which is still looking likely to be released over the PlayStation Network rather than the shops.

89
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:39,035
[SPEAKER_02]: First-person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September.

90
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Computer Entertainment Europe

91
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:09,756
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list that has a confirmed US date is Lair.

92
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: That's set for July.

93
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Three Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europe's perspective, but not necessarily ours.

94
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:20,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Lair, I know that's been talked about as a July title.

95
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:21,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Same with Warhawk.

96
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Warhawk's been a July title for a while.

97
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:30,853
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, it's kind of morphed into really different things than before, so who knows when that's coming out.

98
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:38,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope they don't wait that long, because they don't have any exclusives between now and September, if that's the case.

99
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:49,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it should also be noted that 3 Speech said something about Bioshock on the PlayStation 3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, there is currently no indication that Bioshock will come out on the PlayStation 3.

100
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops, we're talking out of our ass.

101
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:58,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a... What was the quote from...

102
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:00,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerks and Oral Bowel Movement.

103
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.

104
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I have some good news.

105
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,609
[SPEAKER_09]: At least this is good for me.

106
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:11,271
[SPEAKER_09]: They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.

107
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:16,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.

108
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,814
[SPEAKER_09]: The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007.

109
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:23,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And there actually is a notice saying that the...

110
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:31,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony Europe site's supposed to already be up.

111
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:44,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to personally think of it as rumor, because it didn't really do all that great in Japan on PSP, but if it's coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.

112
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,416
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is just fucked up.

113
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:52,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course they're going to jump on an opportunity to actually

114
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:53,812
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,421
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out anyways.

116
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:19,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So, starting off on PlayStation 2.

117
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:21,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Raiden 3 is finally making its way out.

118
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's, of course, the arcade shooter game.

119
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2.

120
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the first one really blew.

121
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully this one's not so bad.

122
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:34,774
[SPEAKER_12]: PC port of the plan.

123
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:37,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's coming to PlayStation 2 as well.

124
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,397
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't look very good.

125
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Eureka 7 Vol.

126
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,159
[SPEAKER_12]: 2, the new wave.

127
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that's the new wave.

128
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:49,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, Eureka 7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks okay.

129
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:57,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Red Star, that old acclaimed game that's been in development forever, and now it's finally making its way out on PlayStation 2.

130
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:03,599
[SPEAKER_12]: On the PSP, we have Halo Knights, finally making its way out.

131
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:10,081
[SPEAKER_12]: As well as Pocket Pool, that semi-porn billiards game.

132
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:12,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see here.

133
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.

134
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing on PlayStation 3.

135
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:25,594
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics.

136
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:32,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see here, Mission Blackhawk and Mission Combat Force.

137
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:36,259
[SPEAKER_12]: And a game called Made Man, which got horrible reviews.

138
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, on the Wii, we've got Bust a Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game.

139
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario

140
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,632
[SPEAKER_02]: FateStayNight

141
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Rialta Nua

142
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Coco Host Boo is coming out in Japan.

143
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:05,640
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an anime, Iran High School Club something.

144
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Roses and little girly men.

145
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:11,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a really fucked up little anime.

146
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:16,584

[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm actually, I'm really thinking I'm going to get that game.

155
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,215
[SPEAKER_09]: After playing it at E3 a while back, I thought it was pretty fun.

[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

165
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, back into the news here.

166
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:58,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, we've got some interesting stuff, I know, coming out.

167
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:13,275
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, one thing that's been confirmed to be coming out, and I'm sure this is not a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octane's site, there was a response to, I believe, an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3.

168
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:14,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And it says...

169
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:45,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 3 is headed for the Playstation 2 Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii and it's supposed to be coming out fall 2007 so there you go, yet another release and interesting and according to apparently there was it's been removed from the website as well because we didn't realize that there's another Guitar Hero game coming out this year

170
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:50,280
[SPEAKER_12]: After all, there are some... Was it the 80s edition coming out later this year?

171
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows what else they'll throw in there.

172
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a big surprise.

173
00:14:56,064 --> 00:15:00,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny we haven't heard much on Guitar Hero 80s edition besides that little tidbit you found a couple weeks ago.

174
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:01,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

175
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think we would have heard more about it by now?

176
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:05,969
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

177
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they might push it back?

178
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:07,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

179
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:09,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I already know that.

180
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:10,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

181
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:12,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright then.

182
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:14,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, moving on.

183
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,909
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a fan of music games, then you probably like Owen Don as well.

184
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know he hears Elite Beat Agents.

185
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And Owen Don 2.

186
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: is coming out in Japan on May 17th, is what the Rumblings are saying, is that the game's coming out quite possibly that soon.

187
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet.

188
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life, Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia, Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube, the artist is Hiraiken Popstar.

189
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, one of the cheesiest songs I've ever heard in my life.

190
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it'll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they know it in Japan, Oh and Don.

191
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward to that one.

192
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:09,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually think that, uh, I might definitely pick that one up, except I haven't, you know, picked up the other one either.

193
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:09,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

194
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:13,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this makes me, um, also particularly happy.

195
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

196
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, allergies.

197
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:20,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um, there is, um, uh,

198
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:26,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper.

199
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not second, because there's already a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2.

200
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:42,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Nanon Shah has been quoted saying, we're also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all the family.

201
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, yeah, that one.

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're apparently talking about Parappa.

203
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:52,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Parappa.

204
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I the only one that's not excited about this?

205
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is kind of retarded.

206
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not excited.

207
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:41,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like, throw baby a mile or something like that.

208
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Genetic oddities, those are great.

209
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:50,522
[SPEAKER_12]: That is something, that's a record, you know, but somebody that's like, I have the high score DDR, and you know that's gonna be in there.

210
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that what leaderboards are for?

211
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:54,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought this is what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.

212
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one, though.

213
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:01,208
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know, it's kind of lame.

214
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Sonata Eternal Sonata is what they're calling it over here

215
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

216
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:56,589
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

217
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Way to go.

218
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, with an RPG.

219
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.

220
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave the system on.

221
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:03,454
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

222
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even catch that.

223
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:07,056
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, oh my god, no hard drive and no memory card.

224
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.

225
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:10,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

226
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,121
[SPEAKER_09]: That's lovely.

227
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:20,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else is brilliant is DarkSakura surfing the internet all week long at work, actually.

228
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all she does.

229
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:25,326
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them with you.

230
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:28,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

231
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:37,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?

232
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:44,151
[SPEAKER_09]: The Website of the Week is IkenHouseCheeseburger.com, which is like a Saturday site.

233
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:45,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I love it.

234
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:49,032
[SPEAKER_12]: I visited the site, I didn't get it.

235
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:49,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was cute.

236
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:56,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It's I can has cheese and cheeseburgers spelled C-H-E-E-Z-B-U-R-G-E-R.

237
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:57,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I can has cheeseburger.com.

238
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:05,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over a kitten with the caption, Do not want.

239
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:11,010
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua wearing a Dolphy wig.

240
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, I love scotch.

241
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it goes down, down into my bellies.

242
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, hooray, another cat sight from Jamie.

243
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,018
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's dogs on here, too.

244
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,080
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love Catterday, so... There's a little puppy making us sad faces.

245
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Ate all the cheeseburger.

246
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:27,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Frowning face.

247
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,684
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya is posting his favorite.

248
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,507
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya is posting from I Can Ask Cheeseburger, the entry on April 13th.

249
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Princess in another castle.

250
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

251
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:39,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the cat's worried.

252
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,653
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one of the cat with a Wiimote in his lap saying, I can please has walkthrough.

253
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:45,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they don't.

254
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:56,070
[SPEAKER_02]: iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com Alright, check it out, boys and girls.

255
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: The official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.

256
00:20:59,095 --> 00:20:59,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

257
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Some interesting stuff.

258
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,582
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're looking to try some games out, there's been some demos that have come out on live recently.

259
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:13,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Some that you might not be excited about, some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out.

260
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:14,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray.

261
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:29,129
[SPEAKER_12]: One that actually looked kind of interesting and I haven't gotten to play it yet, Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live, and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command & Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that'll be pretty awesome as well.

262
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:31,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for it.

263
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:40,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed.

264
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:47,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince of Persia Classic.

265
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, it got a 12 plus years age rating.

266
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,585
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be, you know, since there's new Prince of Persia, isn't there a new game coming out somewhat soon?

267
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,110
[SPEAKER_12]: and Not Too Distant Future.

268
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're supposed to be doing one for like the 360 or something.

269
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:06,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.

270
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie we've earlier spoken about on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.

271
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as he doesn't screw up Transformers, I suppose we'll be looking forward to Prince of Persia.

272
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:30,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But if he does screw up Transformers, Brimstone and Fire will rain down upon him.

273
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:32,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

274
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:37,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire and Brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.

275
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire, and this isn't, though, about a dragon.

276
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:47,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.

277
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:50,115
[SPEAKER_09]: GameTap can do Saturn games.

278
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that great?

279
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:58,461
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's actually, also, in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoon's Vi heading out.

280
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:03,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'm sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.

281
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:12,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as it was called, God, why can't I, because Panzer Dragoon Orto was the Dreamcast one.

282
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a start, Jamie, Jesus.

283
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:19,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but Panzer Dragoon RPG was just, like, fucking beautiful.

284
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have that game on Saturn.

285
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, have a cheeseburger.

286
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:23,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that game.

287
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,257
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a cheeseburger game?

288
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:25,518
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

289
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:26,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Bite my butt.

290
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a... I actually do have BurgerTime.

291
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that count?

292
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, BurgerTime's awesome.

293
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,684
[SPEAKER_02]: They have BurgerTime on GameTap.

294
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need.

295
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:38,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The Panzer Dragoon RPG is just like... And, and, and, and, and... Super BurgerTime on GameTap.

296
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:39,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

297
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:44,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once, and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?

298
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:45,437
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

299
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,398
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Sega Love now.

300
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:47,158
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

301
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:47,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega...

302
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:51,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.

303
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, they can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.

304
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so be it.

305
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:01,035
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to talk about that.

306
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:01,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Do not want!

307
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:03,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

308
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,798
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want, though, Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta.

309
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,700
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out now, May 16th.

310
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:15,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.

311
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:18,245
[SPEAKER_02]: To which the entire internet responded,

312
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:19,132
[SPEAKER_12]: 3 WEEKS!

313
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:19,653
[SPEAKER_12]: WEEE!

314
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:38,359
[SPEAKER_12]: and let's see what else.

315
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:47,467
[SPEAKER_12]: New guns, vehicles, gameplay features including the mysterious X button which by the way has been spoiled and it's just an equipment button.

316
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:53,232
[SPEAKER_12]: So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.

317
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:55,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Who fucking cares?

318
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:56,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

319
00:24:56,694 --> 00:25:04,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda yadda yadda.

320
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:10,576
[SPEAKER_12]: So, bye Crackdown, if you haven't yet

321
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:37,093
[SPEAKER_02]: TripMinds.

322
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:39,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting.

323
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add a whole new element to the game.

324
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But they swear it will not be something that's exploitable.

325
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's going to be limited.

326
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,022
[SPEAKER_02]: All that functionality.

327
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

328
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:55,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord knows I could use a shield when I'm playing Halo because I get shot in the face all the time when I'm playing Halo.

329
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it.

330
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Shot in the face is fun.

331
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

332
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:00,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if it's you.

333
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting shot.

334
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get shot in the face.

335
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:03,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

336
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:12,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man vs. is going to the Nintendo DS by way of the Namco Museum.

337
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that cool?

338
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:28,506
[SPEAKER_09]: For anyone who doesn't know, Pac-Man vs. was where you played on your portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man.

339
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,316
[SPEAKER_09]: while you had your Pac-Man controller playing on the main screen.

340
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was the other way around.

341
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:40,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and the one person had Pac-Man on the Game Boy Advance.

342
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:43,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played it.

343
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The ghosts were split on the screen, that's right.

344
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:47,386
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Pac-Man that was on the Game Boy.

345
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:49,527
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I meant.

346
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man could see everything going on.

347
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:55,892
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought it was funny because it was actually really loud when people would play it at my house.

348
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:57,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it fun?

349
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's fun.

350
00:26:58,834 --> 00:26:59,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun.

351
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:03,504
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

352
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:32,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get to play Wi-Fi over the internet?

353
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:37,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man versus on Wi-Fi.

354
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

355
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:40,097
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

356
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:43,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're starting to get late into the show, and we still have not done this segment.

357
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:44,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.

358
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:49,219
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, putting this segment after a story about the Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate.

359
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time to bring on the pain in our FUs of the week.

360
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:05,144
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what's your bitch this week?

361
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I have a rash.

362
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,005
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

363
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:11,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

364
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:12,686
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to your rash?

365
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:13,947
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my rash.

366
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is your rash?

367
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in a private place?

368
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:17,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it in a place where I can see it?

369
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,449
[SPEAKER_02]: No questions asked.

370
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my back.

371
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, on her back.

372
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well that works.

373
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, it's obviously an allergic reaction or something.

374
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:35,916
[SPEAKER_09]: because whenever I have a rash that's an allergic reaction, it gets bloody.

375
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:37,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

376
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'm going to the dermatologist hopefully next week.

377
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,680
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

378
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki!

379
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:47,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh... God, I had an FU earlier.

380
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:50,687
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

381
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Got nothing that really fits off that.

382
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:52,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.

383
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,710
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to hunger?

384
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:56,812
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to world hunger?

385
00:28:57,513 --> 00:28:58,313
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's my hunger.

386
00:28:58,894 --> 00:28:58,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

387
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say I also F you to the fact that I ate all that Pocky.

388
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:05,443
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to make me fat.

389
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,326
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the freaking aquarium.

390
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to the bonus segment live tonight or on all games, it doesn't go to the podcast.

391
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:15,470
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be talking about my aquarium I bought.

392
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And it killed one of my fish.

393
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:21,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.

394
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Bastard filter.

395
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:25,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Bastard aquarium.

396
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart said it would work.

397
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So F you to PetSmart.

398
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:33,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

399
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were nice short FUs this week.

400
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:36,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

401
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

402
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:41,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We will open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.

403
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:47,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking around about.

404
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:51,686
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is...

405
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:54,696
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

406
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Help comes in the form of makeup.

407
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,652
[SPEAKER_12]: In-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.

408
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:25,293
[SPEAKER_12]: The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.

409
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:30,696
[SPEAKER_12]: There are many games in which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.

410
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:37,099
[SPEAKER_12]: A Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so the items can be exchanged with friends and players and so you can do each other's makeup.

411
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this game because it sounds so stupid.

412
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:45,735
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:16,232
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

414
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:44,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you a miniature koi.

415
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, we'll see.

416
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:13,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get Rob a piranha.

417
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

418
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:18,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

419
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,892
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD says, of course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.

420
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about the makeup game.

421
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:28,174
[SPEAKER_02]: GamingNerd says, this sounds like a Sky game.

422
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:28,594
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.

423
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

424
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:29,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm gay?

425
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't do makeup and stuff.

426
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:33,917
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gay.

427
00:32:33,997 --> 00:32:35,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocky's different.

428
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: That's theater.

429
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even really do makeup at Rocky.

430
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

431
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:46,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, Makeup games sell more copies than even GTA.

432
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, video games are no longer violent.

433
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:50,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

434
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, we can hear you.

435
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:56,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

436
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:02,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Bandit in chat says, As long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all win.

437
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:03,171
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

438
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:04,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And Zach liked fatties.

439
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:06,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Sigh.

440
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:08,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to smoke them.

441
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:10,758
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's open up the Skype line.

442
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,318
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.

443
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:14,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We have extra time.

444
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have done a game tonight.

445
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything prepped, though.

446
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:18,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

447
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:22,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take extra calls, I guess, if there's folks that actually want to call us.

448
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.

449
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:31,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

450
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, this is DMN Yes

451
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:12,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiis.

452
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're purposefully holding back, you think?

453
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

454
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:24,196
[SPEAKER_03]: The big talk around wherever I am is, where's the Wiis?

455
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the Wiis?

456
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:30,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get them even more.

457
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that

458
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:39,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's stupid.

459
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:48,999
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win that console war, they need to sell more systems.

460
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially financially, they need to sell two systems for every one of Sony's PS3s.

461
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:59,534
[SPEAKER_03]: and they need to sell three systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.

462
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:06,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but that's not necessarily true because they're making a profit off each system whereas everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.

463
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

464
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Owned by Loki.

465
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:25,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title, I'm surprised Nintendo, you know, has released this game and, you know, the Wii's are still not readily available.

466
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:28,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I don't know.

467
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that there's no point to making a shortage now.

468
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:38,460
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.

469
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

470
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:41,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas.

471
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:47,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But even then it would be stupid to do it around Christmas because then that's when you make your most money.

472
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:50,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't get the point of a forced shortage.

473
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:51,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't understand it.

474
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:53,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't know enough about economics.

475
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:59,222
[SPEAKER_02]: My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.

476
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:00,302
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

477
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:02,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my defense on the matter.

478
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:03,363
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

479
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:04,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

480
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up on STFU this week?

481
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:13,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have a show last week and the week before I wasn't on, so everybody has to suffer because I'm back this week.

482
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:15,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

483
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:16,827
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you giggling about?

484
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are there giggling girls over there?

485
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:20,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget a safe word.

486
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:21,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

487
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:21,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

488
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh.

489
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:25,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought it was a nice safe word.

490
00:36:25,442 --> 00:36:29,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, I forget it's a safe word.

491
00:36:31,884 --> 00:36:32,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah.

492
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:32,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, John.

493
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:34,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie.

494
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.

495
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi, Irene.

496
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: She's running out of the room crying.

497
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, they gotta go anyway.

498
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:45,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I better go call her and comfort her then.

499
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:46,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, ooh, really now?

500
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, gotta go, bye.

501
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.

502
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,123
[SPEAKER_02]: What was going on at 8 on the break?

503
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there a tourney or something?

504
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,845
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.

505
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I just hoard up 2DX and whatnot.

506
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:37,909
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I don't get why Activision does, you know, does wonderful things to your 360, case in point, breaking it after, with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.

507
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:50,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, if you want the, I mean, I don't get it, if you want the whammy bar fixed, you're gonna have to go through an arm and a leg, and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking it.

508
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:54,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.

509
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:59,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I won't have to for a week, so maybe it'll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because I'm going to be gone for a while.

510
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because of my 360 bricks.

511
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:08,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be so mad because I know when I call Microsoft, now they want you to pay to get it fixed.

512
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesn't deserve it.

513
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:14,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about it, Ren.

514
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:21,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand that, but you know it's like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?

515
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:23,696
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a staggering number.

516
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:24,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine out of every ten?

517
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's bullshit.

518
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, somebody's pointing that out here.

519
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,258
[SPEAKER_07]: A 90% brick rate, though.

520
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:31,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It says something about a 90% brick rate.

521
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: A 90% brick rate?

522
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, if that were happening, it would be on the NBC nightly news.

523
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:44,407
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but only for the people who actually download it who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably not... It doesn't represent the entire user base at all.

524
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's bullshit.

525
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:50,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of people on them right now.

526
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

527
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:04,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure it was.

528
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:08,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?

529
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:09,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know.

530
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:19,809
[SPEAKER_02]: How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch brick one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the actual number is, 1%?

531
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:22,749
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it brick one 360?

532
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:23,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

533
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,711
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is that, I mean, it could happen any time.

534
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:29,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically like death.

535
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:30,591
[SPEAKER_07]: It's completely unrelated.

536
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,101
[SPEAKER_07]: is like, you know, the odds of dying in a car accident.

537
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:34,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

538
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:38,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're much higher than actually dying of terrorism.

539
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,563
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

540
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:40,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, shut up.

541
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:41,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Knock it off.

542
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:44,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, here's why this crap is going on.

543
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:47,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.

544
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:50,867
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why you get people saying, oh, 90% of the consoles are breaking after.

545
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:54,969
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.

546
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,089
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I have a 360 form, though, so you can't blame me for that.

547
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:58,350
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it might be that your system died.

548
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:05,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I just saw it on the 360 forums that, you know, from other people are experiencing the same issue.

549
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:08,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but one person... Having to shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.

550
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:13,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but one person has their system crashed and then another person's like, well, mine is crashed recently too.

551
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,822
[SPEAKER_12]: It must be because of Guitar Hero.

552
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:20,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And then other people, my friend's system crashed too.

553
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:25,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now it's broken and it's all because of Guitar Hero.

554
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:26,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that

555
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:28,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to take a bath in my 360.

556
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:28,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.

557
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:41,389
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

558
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:09,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still bricking after they've uninstalled the update and when they're going into the dashboard, which wouldn't even be running the game at all and wouldn't have anything to do with the fucking update.

559
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:11,333
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not related and people are retarded.

560
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:13,354
[SPEAKER_09]: This conversation is giving me a migraine.

561
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, I think we'll leave it at that.

562
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:22,957
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Zaku, thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesn't kill your family, okay?

563
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:24,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

564
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:24,738
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, take care.

565
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:33,084
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and it's killing grandmas across the nation.

566
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:34,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

567
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:34,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

568
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:36,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what's up, guys?

569
00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:37,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, what's on your mind?

570
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:37,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

571
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:40,326
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold him?

572
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:43,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, the Rob D. I'm not dodging you and hold him.

573
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:44,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just messing with you.

574
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:45,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand.

575
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:46,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys play on a bad night.

576
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:47,327
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

577
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Play on like a Monday night.

578
00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:49,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happens on Monday.

579
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.

580
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:51,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroes is back next week.

581
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

582
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,629
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, as a college student...

583
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:59,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Weeknights would be worse, but either way, that's not why I called in.

584
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what's on your mind?

585
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:04,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable content.

586
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:06,244
[SPEAKER_10]: What to you would be a better solution?

587
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: The iTunes model of buying one song apiece, or actually, what's the more egregious offense?

588
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:18,427
[SPEAKER_10]: The three song packs or the cost per song, which to me is also pretty bad.

589
00:42:20,798 --> 00:42:24,241
[SPEAKER_02]: What if those songs end up costing $2 a song?

590
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:25,562
[SPEAKER_10]: About $2.10 per piece.

591
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:28,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think they should be priced.

592
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:37,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I think DDR, even though there's a whole other can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on the disc and people were mad about that, but that aside...

593
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:40,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the pricing scheme over there was somewhat fair.

594
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 100 points a song, so it worked out to be $1.25 or something.

595
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:50,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought a pack of 10, you got a discount, so it only ended up being $1 a song.

596
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:51,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

597
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:59,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, $1 per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download, because I don't want to download every Guitar Hero song.

598
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:01,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and same thing with DDR.

599
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't want Candy, because Candy's been in every freaking DDR game lately.

600
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I want to skip that one, but I have that option.

601
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could just download the Mega Pack and it's kind of included.

602
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:12,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends how many of the songs I want.

603
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the other difference between the DDR packs, is that not only are they cheaper because it's $1.25 a song, but they are new songs, mostly, to the series.

604
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Now about, let's say, three quarters of them are new.

605
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:23,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

606
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:34,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Yeah, I think paying that much, and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I don't remember how much, I think it was about $90.

607
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:36,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Then that's ridiculous.

608
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:37,822
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

609
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:39,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?

610
00:43:39,524 --> 00:43:42,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they're going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the internet?

611
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think, you know, hey, if some sucker's going to buy it, let's keep cranking it out.

612
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:48,130
[SPEAKER_10]: If enough people buy them, not a chance.

613
00:43:50,432 --> 00:43:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it all depends.

614
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:53,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, don't buy it.

615
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:54,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

616
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:59,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song individually.

617
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I don't have to download every song.

618
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:05,884
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they're going to put them in three packs, no way.

619
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:12,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar Hero songs are kind of long.

620
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, DDR songs are short.

621
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:15,888
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, what, a minute and a half, minute 45?

622
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:19,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs.

623
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could be more.

624
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

625
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual song.

626
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:25,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of this PAX stuff.

627
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that.

628
00:44:27,455 --> 00:44:29,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's almost a double offense in their case.

629
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:30,176
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

630
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:35,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Another game I want to play though is the Phoenix Wright, or not the Phoenix Wright game, the Harvey Birdman game.

631
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:36,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a perfect license for Capcom.

632
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they're going to kind of model it after Phoenix Wright, or what do you think it's going to be like?

633
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they could avoid it, honestly.

634
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they'd be almost remiss not to do that.

635
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:47,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection!

636
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see.

637
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:50,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take the case.

638
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Phoenix Wright is popular enough that enough people would get it?

639
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:57,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there'd be enough cross-interests between the two franchises, Phoenix Wright and Harvey Birdman?

640
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:02,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it'd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.

641
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:03,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

642
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:04,546
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

643
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:06,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Rob... Because it depends how they'll do it.

644
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:07,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D., anything else on your mind?

645
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,148
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's about it at all.

646
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,028
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys take some more calls.

647
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:10,388
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

648
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:10,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

649
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:14,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, I'll give your podcast a cheap plug over on allgames.com.

650
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,871
[SPEAKER_02]: You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?

651
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:16,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Five times a week?

652
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:17,211
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of fun.

653
00:45:17,652 --> 00:45:17,892
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

654
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:18,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday to Friday.

655
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much fun.

656
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:20,773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

657
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:21,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks a lot.

658
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:22,134
[SPEAKER_10]: See you guys later.

659
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:22,754
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

660
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:22,994
[SPEAKER_02]: See ya.

661
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call.

662
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:28,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take this call here.

663
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:31,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

664
00:45:31,256 --> 00:45:31,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

665
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Raven Stauffen.

666
00:45:34,418 --> 00:45:34,858
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?

667
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

668
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:38,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just so excited tonight.

669
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

670
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:41,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you picked up my call.

671
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:43,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here you are.

672
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:45,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you get in almost every week you call.

673
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Very rare do you not seem to get in.

674
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be ultra busy.

675
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, there's not a lot of folks calling in.

676
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:56,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The phones are dead except for you right now.

677
00:45:56,299 --> 00:45:57,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got all the other calls.

678
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,940
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

679
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,521
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on my mind?

680
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:00,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

681
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what was... Okay.

682
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:05,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Salmon Max is on my mind.

683
00:46:05,824 --> 00:46:07,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Culture Shock and all the rest.

684
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:10,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It's last season's coming out this month, and I'm so sad.

685
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been playing Salmon Max?

686
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:13,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize you've been playing Salmon Max.

687
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:17,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've been playing Salmon Max since it first came out.

688
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:21,524
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it for those folks that haven't really been playing the series?

689
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:25,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?

690
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you should be playing this game because it's kind of like a text adventure, and you go around places, and the characters are so lovable.

691
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:35,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Sam is so funny.

692
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:37,849
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll go like, holy fish, based on a dance talker.

693
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,829
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on it, chief.

694
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:41,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll hang up the phones like, what's wrong, Sap?

695
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,451
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to sabotage the president.

696
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing something wrong.

697
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has, like, funny dialogue.

698
00:46:48,447 --> 00:47:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: and you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things it's a text event again I know you say you're sad because the series is ending and I think we've all heard the last episode for now is coming out but don't you think that the series has been popular enough that we haven't seen the end of it yet I think season 2 has got to be imminent but I don't know when well I guess that's true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live

699
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:20,845
[SPEAKER_04]: PhoenixRide.com

700
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:54,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I was just running around, just screaming my head off, going like, it's Phoenix Wright 3, they're finally gonna bring it out!

701
00:47:55,429 --> 00:48:04,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been like, holy shit, I hope it comes out soon, because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All, I've been just going, just itching for another one.

702
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:07,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark?

703
00:48:07,711 --> 00:48:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it seems like they're really starting to crank these out.

704
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:13,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.

705
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: If it comes out tomorrow, I'm there.

706
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD is in chat and says, I could envision Raven's Dolphin seeing the news, getting up, screaming, and running around.

707
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:24,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a video on YouTube of this?

708
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:25,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I should.

709
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you should do.

710
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I should just go, oh my god, it's Phoenix Wright!

711
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:32,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

712
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:34,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anything else on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

713
00:48:36,234 --> 00:48:38,215
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing, as usual.

714
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:39,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

715
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.

716
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the Skype line or through that other service?

717
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:49,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

718
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,934
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all live through the Skype line.

719
00:48:52,254 --> 00:48:52,654
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that?

720
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:54,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody patch the show into you or something?

721
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

722
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually did something ingenious if you have time.

723
00:48:58,517 --> 00:49:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me one minute to just tell me, to tell you.

724
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

725
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you got me curious.

726
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,580
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

727
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

728
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:10,904
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone.

729
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:21,107
[SPEAKER_04]: and Rob D showed me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer and that works great and I can hear you.

730
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.

731
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:32,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.

732
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:33,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I called my cell phone.

733
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.

734
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:37,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

735
00:49:37,385 --> 00:49:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's hardcore, Ravens.

736
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:44,806
[SPEAKER_12]: He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically pick up.

737
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:45,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I get it now.

738
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's pretty hardcore.

739
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pretty hardcore.

740
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:51,027
[SPEAKER_09]: A big nerd.

741
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:51,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a big nerd.

742
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.

743
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:54,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

744
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:55,608
[SPEAKER_02]: We take it as a compliment.

745
00:49:56,148 --> 00:49:56,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're crazy.

746
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know this.

747
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:59,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this, but that's okay.

748
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ravensoft, we've got to let you go.

749
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:02,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Take more calls.

750
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:03,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

751
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:03,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

752
00:50:03,597 --> 00:50:09,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, and hopefully they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for all the calls you're making.

753
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:10,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

754
00:50:10,502 --> 00:50:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

755
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:13,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call.

756
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

757
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:15,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

758
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you happy people.

759
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:20,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I can barely hear you.

760
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:21,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a little closer to your mic.

761
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:21,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again.

762
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you happy people.

763
00:50:24,152 --> 00:50:24,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, who's this?

764
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:26,013
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Dark Knight.

765
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:27,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Dark Knight, what's on your mind, buddy?

766
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:29,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much.

767
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:29,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Just...

768
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:36,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just makes me not convinced to still not get one.

769
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:38,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?

770
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not a next-gen owner at all.

771
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:42,877
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

772
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still in the ancient times.

773
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not really.

774
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.

775
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,039
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.

776
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:53,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

777
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you play handhelds at all?

778
00:50:58,742 --> 00:51:00,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I still own a DS, that's the only thing I got.

779
00:51:01,065 --> 00:51:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.

780
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

781
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?

782
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:19,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about it a while back, but like I say, hearing the brick situation and everything just makes me change my mind every time.

783
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:26,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little bit, you know, it is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.

784
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I always said, I'm like, oh, you know, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send their consoles back.

785
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.

786
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it, like, did happen to me.

787
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember ranting about it on the show.

788
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a brick 360 back in, like, February.

789
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,691
[SPEAKER_02]: My first 360 bricked after, like, a week.

790
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:40,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so pissed.

791
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:48,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I can't, it's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation.

792
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,417
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

793
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:52,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now they want to charge the repairs.

794
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,262
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

795
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:56,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.

796
00:51:56,324 --> 00:52:02,408
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill Gates got this, ain't nothing wrong with it.

797
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,751
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet the darn thing's still bricked, I don't know.

798
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:08,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it happens a lot.

799
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

800
00:52:09,614 --> 00:52:12,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird, you know.

801
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't just show up out of the woodwork, you know, suddenly a handful of people all have their consoles go kaput at the same time.

802
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:25,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Phantasy Star Universe and hearing people saying, My room got hacked!

803
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:25,875
[SPEAKER_02]: My room got hacked!

804
00:52:25,915 --> 00:52:27,275
[SPEAKER_02]: My room got hacked!

805
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:27,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Every 20 minutes.

806
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:28,916
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with Phantasy Star Universe?

807
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:50,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's leveled off.

808
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:52,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much hacking going on anymore.

809
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:56,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Just basically money problems in the game and whatnot.

810
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus they updated the lobby again recently.

811
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:05,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you visit all the planets and do all those basic quests?

812
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:08,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're doing S2 missions now.

813
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:13,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot like...

814
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Some areas where you get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.

815
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:20,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else?

816
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:23,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops.

817
00:53:24,056 --> 00:53:24,436
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

818
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:25,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds pretty cool.

819
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.

820
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

821
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:34,803
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that expansion pack coming out.

822
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:35,804
[SPEAKER_02]: When's that supposed to be released?

823
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:39,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the U.S.

824
00:53:39,806 --> 00:53:41,747
[SPEAKER_05]: might see it in December.

825
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:42,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's better than never.

826
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:46,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.

827
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:53,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And so far, from what inside information I got from when the chat regular was here, it looks pretty interesting with the expansion.

828
00:53:54,343 --> 00:53:57,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.

829
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:58,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it so.

830
00:53:58,907 --> 00:54:00,828
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.

831
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:03,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing it enough times as it is.

832
00:54:03,771 --> 00:54:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we appreciate it.

833
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:06,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks so much for the call.

834
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.

835
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, light up.

836
00:54:11,092 --> 00:54:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Gohan in chat, seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight on the phone.

837
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.

838
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:19,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be a little scared too.

839
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:20,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

840
00:54:20,979 --> 00:54:21,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

841
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name's Billy.

842
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Billy.

843
00:54:28,304 --> 00:54:29,284
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you, Billy?

844
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:31,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm eight.

845
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:33,487
[SPEAKER_02]: You're eight, huh?

846
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you doing listening to this program?

847
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,291
[SPEAKER_11]: My daddy said I could.

848
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Your daddy said you could, huh?

849
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?

850
00:54:44,128 --> 00:54:44,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

851
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,250
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of video games do you play, Billy?

852
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:51,714
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mario one.

853
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:53,456
[SPEAKER_02]: You play the Mario one?

854
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:56,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.

855
00:54:56,478 --> 00:54:57,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Mario game is your favorite?

856
00:54:57,999 --> 00:54:58,460
[SPEAKER_11]: The one on the Wii.

857
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the Wii?

858
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:01,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You play Super Paper Mario?

859
00:55:01,943 --> 00:55:04,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?

860
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:09,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what a virtual console is.

861
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:12,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what a virtual console is?

862
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:13,695
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

863
00:55:14,155 --> 00:55:15,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

864
00:55:16,436 --> 00:55:18,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?

865
00:55:21,258 --> 00:55:26,901
[SPEAKER_11]: My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with the Guitar Hero thing.

866
00:55:27,882 --> 00:55:29,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It, like, didn't work.

867
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:32,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And he threw it out the window and...

868
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:40,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window?

869
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:42,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did he throw the guitar out the window?

870
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:50,077
[SPEAKER_02]: He threw the entire Xbox out the window.

871
00:55:51,857 --> 00:55:54,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?

872
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:56,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

873
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:57,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

874
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but there was a flat sound.

875
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.

876
00:56:26,852 --> 00:56:27,773
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want us to do to help?

877
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:30,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, they think it's you calling in, by the way, but you're right here, right?

878
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:31,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not calling in.

879
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:32,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right here.

880
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,117
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right there.

881
00:56:33,297 --> 00:56:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: My voice does not sound like that.

882
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:36,400
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

883
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,343
[SPEAKER_11]: My dad, my daddy thinks Loki's stupid.

884
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:42,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is Loki stupid?

885
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Because my daddy loves Max.

886
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Your daddy loves men?

887
00:56:51,672 --> 00:56:52,312
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Max.

888
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:53,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Max.

889
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your daddy loves Max.

890
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

891
00:56:55,675 --> 00:56:55,935
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

892
00:56:56,388 --> 00:56:56,909
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

893
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:29,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Baby's cool.

894
00:57:30,783 --> 00:57:33,464
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura is cool.

895
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:34,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

896
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:37,927
[SPEAKER_12]: That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.

897
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:39,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

898
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:41,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm great.

899
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:44,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's see.

900
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:50,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain you?

901
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we watch The Lion King?

902
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure you can.

903
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.

904
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.

905
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:09,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the circle of life.

906
00:58:13,412 --> 00:58:14,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm scared.

907
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:16,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm going to hang up now.

908
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,336
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you do that.

909
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:20,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, bye.

910
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:21,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bye.

911
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of our callers was that crank calling us?

912
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:27,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that was DMN?

913
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:29,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say.

914
00:58:29,363 --> 00:58:31,324
[SPEAKER_02]: They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.

915
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:35,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone number.

916
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:36,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who that was, DarkSakura?

917
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:38,448
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a jerk.

918
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us?

919
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:48,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, I was here with the microphone set down, looking at fucking Saturday pictures.

920
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:50,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

921
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

922
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:53,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, call dropped.

923
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again.

924
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:57,889
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always call us on Skype.

925
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

926
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:05,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?

927
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:11,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment now.

928
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:12,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you lose a sock?

929
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Says, who was it?

930
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:13,676
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.

931
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:16,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.

932
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,579
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.

933
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming Nerd says, Sky loves swearing to 8-year-olds.

934
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:28,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty says, if we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch about that makeup.

935
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.

936
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:33,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

937
00:59:33,815 --> 00:59:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

938
00:59:34,876 --> 00:59:35,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Zappy.

939
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:37,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, our match game champion.

940
00:59:37,178 --> 00:59:38,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Zappy, what's on your mind?

941
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, since you brought Potpourri up, you brought this upon yourself.

942
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:44,424
[SPEAKER_06]: How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?

943
00:59:45,525 --> 00:59:48,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.

944
00:59:49,946 --> 00:59:50,226
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened?

945
00:59:50,246 --> 00:59:54,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.

946
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't have no idea.

947
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really mean to be an asshole.

948
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:58,613
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's okay.

949
00:59:58,914 --> 01:00:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.

950
01:00:01,496 --> 01:00:03,157
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's my computer's dying.

951
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:04,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

952
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:09,042
[SPEAKER_09]: The VAIO is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.

953
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:10,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to find it and burn it to a DVD for you?

954
01:00:12,283 --> 01:00:15,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not burn it into a DivX or X video format.

955
01:00:16,026 --> 01:00:16,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I need MPEGs.

956
01:00:17,086 --> 01:00:18,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to do that.

957
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:22,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want it burned as a DVD playing file.

958
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it as just data.

959
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:25,972
[SPEAKER_09]: With that extra crap on it.

960
01:00:26,352 --> 01:00:27,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can do that.

961
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: MPEG.

962
01:00:28,353 --> 01:00:29,094
[SPEAKER_09]: MPEG is better.

963
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:31,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you at least get to see last week's?

964
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:33,136
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't.

965
01:00:33,817 --> 01:00:35,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're behind on the whole season.

966
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:35,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

967
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:37,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But think of it.

968
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,640
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get to have a whole marathon day.

969
01:00:39,943 --> 01:00:42,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Anger Rising here in the Orange Lounge Radio Room.

970
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:45,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Zappy, getting us all mad.

971
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:45,825
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

972
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:47,606
[SPEAKER_02]: What games have you been playing this week, Zappy?

973
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:51,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.

974
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,109
[SPEAKER_02]: You broke your PSP?

975
01:00:53,749 --> 01:00:53,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

976
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,030
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you do that?

977
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I dropped my laptop on the screen.

978
01:00:58,692 --> 01:00:58,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

979
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?

980
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.

981
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's great.

982
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:11,189
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?

983
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty and Ratchet & Clank.

984
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.

985
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:18,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually like it.

986
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?

987
01:01:25,773 --> 01:01:26,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

988
01:01:26,753 --> 01:01:29,474
[SPEAKER_06]: There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.

989
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:32,295
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name of that stuff game?

990
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It completely slipped my mind.

991
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:39,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Metal Gear Solid, but... Subsistence?

992
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:40,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.

993
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wait, no, are that what, Acid?

994
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:46,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what was the other Metal Gear one?

995
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:50,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Metal Gear, it's another one that's on the PlayStation platform.

996
01:01:54,152 --> 01:01:55,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts with an S. Oh, Cyclone Filter.

997
01:01:56,453 --> 01:01:56,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

998
01:01:58,595 --> 01:01:59,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty good one.

999
01:02:00,356 --> 01:02:00,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1000
01:02:00,656 --> 01:02:03,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's Daxter, that's good.

1001
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:06,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there's some good... Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?

1002
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:09,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, I'm not really... Rondo of Blood!

1003
01:02:10,295 --> 01:02:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Two people in the chatroom did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game, so there you go.

1004
01:02:14,736 --> 01:02:17,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And YYZ gives us the mandatory Rondo of Blood!

1005
01:02:17,536 --> 01:02:17,856
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1006
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:23,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.

1007
01:02:24,418 --> 01:02:25,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do my best.

1008
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1009
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1010
01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:28,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

1011
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:33,394
[SPEAKER_02]: See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.

1012
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: He should do that for you.

1013
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:37,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.

1014
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:52,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on... And I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding his laptop.

1015
01:02:53,547 --> 01:02:55,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And so since then, I've actually had a problem with...

1016
01:02:59,130 --> 01:02:59,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The DivX stuff.

1017
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more call.

1018
01:03:03,215 --> 01:03:04,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1019
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:04,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1020
01:03:05,518 --> 01:03:06,739
[SPEAKER_02]: This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.

1021
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:09,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.

1022
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:09,963
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1023
01:03:11,182 --> 01:03:11,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, man.

1024
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,203
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first time calling.

1025
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:18,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have time.

1026
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:24,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show.

1027
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, congratulations.

1028
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, you've been listening for three years and you've never gotten on the show.

1029
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:30,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

1030
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

1031
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Our line doesn't get hammered that much.

1032
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:33,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's all right.

1033
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.

1034
01:03:35,828 --> 01:03:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you want to talk to us about tonight?

1035
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:45,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo is delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.

1036
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.

1037
01:03:47,603 --> 01:03:56,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues.

1038
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:04,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on, whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony...

1039
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:05,739
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

1040
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:37,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the shipping problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't get out enough chips.

1041
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:44,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happened before with, I'm not sure if you know that Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.

1042
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:47,834
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips.

1043
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:53,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And Apple was like, well, fuck you guys, you can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel.

1044
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,562
[SPEAKER_01]: and now you kind of see the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.

1045
01:04:58,042 --> 01:05:06,085
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's an interesting point because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components that go into the system.

1046
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:11,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360 delays previously was that there was like a component?

1047
01:05:12,347 --> 01:05:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't so much... I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip.

1048
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:18,730
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these systems got so slowed down because the factory couldn't produce enough of it.

1049
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,492
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the PlayStation 3 and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really...

1050
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:47,827
[SPEAKER_12]: IBM's fault either it's the fact that Nintendo's retarded it only has one factory building these fucking systems instead of like four factories or even more building systems that's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that right now despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM it's because they're retarded still and they only have one factory producing them despite the fact that most of the components in it are

1051
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:54,279
[SPEAKER_12]: were stuff that was in the GameCube and that they should have tons of and should be really easy to manufacture.

1052
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but one... That's a good point.

1053
01:05:56,721 --> 01:05:57,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.

1054
01:05:57,661 --> 01:06:03,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as, you know, getting enough factories out there to make these damn systems.

1055
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:15,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles, you kind of have to look at it this way.

1056
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,692
[SPEAKER_01]: IBM only has one factory, two.

1057
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:22,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at in this situation?

1058
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:28,772
[SPEAKER_01]: All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the overall picture.

1059
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,073
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no winners.

1060
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:41,022
[SPEAKER_12]: The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wii's because Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360s.

1061
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:42,988
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Kibbles and Bits

1062
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.

1063
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, you know what, that's my thoughts now is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get the system.

1064
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:14,182
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1065
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:16,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares if there's shortages?

1066
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:20,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there and wait.

1067
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:27,504
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June.

1068
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:30,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sucks to be you if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get...

1069
01:07:31,275 --> 01:07:31,816
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1070
01:07:51,972 --> 01:07:52,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Other End of Things, too.

1071
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:53,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever.

1072
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:55,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a catch-22 at the end of the day.

1073
01:07:55,094 --> 01:07:59,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space on my 360.

1074
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:01,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Until they sell porn.

1075
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:03,599
Good point.

1076
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1077
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:07,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.

1078
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:08,583
[SPEAKER_02]: HD porn!

1079
01:08:09,163 --> 01:08:09,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1080
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:11,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales of 360 would go through the roof.

1081
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:12,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, they would whoop the Wii's ass.

1082
01:08:13,165 --> 01:08:18,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about dads across America going to buy a system for their children.

1083
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:26,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high def?

1084
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:27,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn wins, always.

1085
01:08:28,342 --> 01:08:33,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Beyonce, PlayStation 3 makes that the easiest since you can put video files on there pretty simple.

1086
01:08:33,383 --> 01:08:35,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby Formula or WoW Epic Mount?

1087
01:08:36,204 --> 01:08:38,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby Formula, WoW Epic Mount.

1088
01:08:38,705 --> 01:08:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't choose.

1089
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:44,226
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Kibbles and Bits, really good first call, really good point.

1090
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:45,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?

1091
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:48,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that's it, man.

1092
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:48,473
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1093
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:49,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure.

1094
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:49,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure.

1095
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:50,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no problem.

1096
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:51,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for calling.

1097
01:08:51,954 --> 01:08:52,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.

1098
01:08:52,434 --> 01:08:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Call back.

1099
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:53,795
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1100
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:54,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, guys.

1101
01:08:54,675 --> 01:08:54,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1102
01:08:56,536 --> 01:08:56,976
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1103
01:08:57,036 --> 01:08:58,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was a good Skype line tonight.

1104
01:08:58,457 --> 01:09:00,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people we got to hear from there.

1105
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:04,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, our chat room going along there.

1106
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1107
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're talking about Doctor Who now.

1108
01:09:11,442 --> 01:09:13,022
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, is there a Doctor Who debate here?

1109
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:13,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignoring.

1110
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:14,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignoring.

1111
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:14,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1112
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:18,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but... Exterminate!

1113
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:22,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, Remember this lesson in life.

1114
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:29,251
[SPEAKER_02]: When trying to get a Wii, there will always be at least ten diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store that sells it.

1115
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:31,792
[SPEAKER_02]: eBay profiteers.

1116
01:09:33,112 --> 01:09:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a special place in hell waiting for them.

1117
01:09:35,453 --> 01:09:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?

1118
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:39,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but Loki can go first.

1119
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:40,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1120
01:09:41,336 --> 01:09:41,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1121
01:09:42,673 --> 01:09:44,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.

1122
01:09:44,954 --> 01:09:49,975
[SPEAKER_12]: One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have voice chat.

1123
01:09:50,515 --> 01:09:50,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Not true.

1124
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:52,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

1125
01:09:53,936 --> 01:10:01,678
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkAlex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.

1126
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:03,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty awesome.

1127
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:07,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller that looks like a 360 controller.

1128
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't care.

1129
01:10:30,758 --> 01:10:32,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Virtual consoles for Monday.

1130
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:35,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's Revenge.

1131
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:38,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So that'd be kind of neat for the U.S.

1132
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's my Actraiser?

1133
01:10:40,845 --> 01:10:42,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.

1134
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:49,192
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a new game coming to the PlayStation Network that looks exactly like... I cannot remember the damn name.

1135
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:54,115
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on the 360... whatever.

1136
01:10:54,135 --> 01:10:55,156
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think?

1137
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:57,272
[SPEAKER_12]: What that game is?

1138
01:10:57,372 --> 01:10:59,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.

1139
01:11:02,196 --> 01:11:02,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1140
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:05,839
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.

1141
01:11:06,379 --> 01:11:07,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Boom Boom Rocket?

1142
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,241
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not Boom Boom Rocket.

1143
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:08,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Geometry Wars?

1144
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:09,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1145
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:10,563
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not Geometry Wars.

1146
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,203
[SPEAKER_12]: The other one.

1147
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:12,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Mutant Storm Reloaded.

1148
01:11:12,464 --> 01:11:12,945
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it was.

1149
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:13,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?

1150
01:11:13,725 --> 01:11:15,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.

1151
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:22,453
[SPEAKER_12]: For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source for the Half-Life engine.

1152
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Who cares?

1153
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:25,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, this is stupid.

1154
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:30,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.

1155
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:34,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Makes me want to paint... Was it spray-painted red?

1156
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:35,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it was, more or less.

1157
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,942
[SPEAKER_12]: People are retarded.

1158
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:47,569
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the PlayStation.

1159
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,891
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope that is true.

1160
01:11:52,694 --> 01:11:52,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1161
01:11:54,048 --> 01:12:04,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend Brad from PodCulture.

1162
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:06,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Brad!

1163
01:12:07,177 --> 01:12:10,559
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not really news, but it's something that's really cool.

1164
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from TechBlog.

1165
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I should say TechEblog, I should say.

1166
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,585
[SPEAKER_09]: The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.

1167
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:22,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And number ten is the ColecoVision Portable.

1168
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:29,302
[SPEAKER_09]: The NES Station, which is basically Nintendo done up to look like a PS2.

1169
01:12:31,023 --> 01:12:31,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a mod.

1170
01:12:32,943 --> 01:12:40,405
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the N-Pod, which runs NES games.

1171
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

1172
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:44,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually looks kind of cool.

1173
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:44,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I want one.

1174
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:52,068
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a Nomad and then attached a CD player to it.

1175
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: The GameCube2Go, which, yeah, whatever.

1176
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:00,773
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's kind of bizarre.

1177
01:13:01,213 --> 01:13:02,634
[SPEAKER_09]: But neat at the same time.

1178
01:13:03,294 --> 01:13:05,135
[SPEAKER_09]: The NES Plus Sega.

1179
01:13:05,735 --> 01:13:08,076
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.

1180
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:10,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The handheld Atari Jaguar.

1181
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:11,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Next!

1182
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Only good game on that was Tempest.

1183
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini.

1184
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, whatever.

1185
01:13:19,122 --> 01:13:19,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Dreamcast Portable.

1186
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:21,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

1187
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:22,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And PlayStation 2 Portable.

1188
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.

1189
01:13:26,811 --> 01:13:27,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1190
01:13:29,932 --> 01:13:30,792
[SPEAKER_09]: He brought it over.

1191
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:31,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It worked.

1192
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:31,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1193
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:32,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is cool.

1194
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:33,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want a GameX.

1195
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:34,753
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1196
01:13:34,973 --> 01:13:35,593
[SPEAKER_09]: A GameX.

1197
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:36,333
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is that?

1198
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:38,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me find a picture of it.

1199
01:13:38,774 --> 01:13:41,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another handheld chopped-up system.

1200
01:13:42,095 --> 01:13:42,815
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no time.

1201
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:43,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1202
01:13:44,596 --> 01:13:45,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of stories.

1203
01:13:45,516 --> 01:13:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of steam.

1204
01:13:46,276 --> 01:13:46,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of time.

1205
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:48,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

1206
01:13:48,697 --> 01:13:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1207
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:51,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that your last story?

1208
01:13:51,878 --> 01:13:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1209
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1210
01:13:54,089 --> 01:13:55,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to pull the thing.

1211
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a portable NES player.

1212
01:13:59,993 --> 01:14:00,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And Game Gear.

1213
01:14:01,694 --> 01:14:02,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And stuff.

1214
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1215
01:14:05,797 --> 01:14:06,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob!

1216
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and give everyone's... What?

1217
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:10,240
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1218
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I will kill you.

1219
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I have some cheeseburger, please?

1220
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:15,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1221
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:16,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and give everybody's final thought.

1222
01:14:17,404 --> 01:14:19,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.

1223
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1224
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:20,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday.

1225
01:14:21,367 --> 01:14:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

1226
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:22,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I have class.

1227
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:23,208
[SPEAKER_09]: No pump up the volume.

1228
01:14:24,357 --> 01:14:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: There may not be guys on the show Wednesday because of my trips.

1229
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be a very quiet week on Orange Lingerie.

1230
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan live this week.

1231
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.

1232
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1233
01:14:36,707 --> 01:14:36,968
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1234
01:14:37,888 --> 01:14:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, next week's show should be very interesting because DarkSakura and I will be at Disneyland Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1235
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:45,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Sunday.

1236
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:48,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving Thursday.

1237
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:49,358
[SPEAKER_02]: On Sunday.

1238
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, too confusing.

1239
01:14:51,139 --> 01:14:53,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be pulling into town just when the show is about to start.

1240
01:14:53,928 --> 01:14:58,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So next week could very well be the Loki show with hilarious commentary from DarkSakura and Skye.

1241
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So won't that be fun, Loki?

1242
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:01,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think Loki should come with us.

1243
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:02,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1244
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Loki would come with us.

1245
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:05,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?

1246
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:05,812
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1247
01:15:06,052 --> 01:15:06,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You make me sad.

1248
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:08,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you want to ride Rockin' California Screamin'?

1249
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:09,653
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1250
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:10,713
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1251
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:11,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Boring.

1252
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so boring.

1253
01:15:13,294 --> 01:15:14,835
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.

1254
01:15:14,855 --> 01:15:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can't say I blame him.

1255
01:15:16,155 --> 01:15:16,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Play games.

1256
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:17,336
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1257
01:15:18,196 --> 01:15:20,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.

1258
01:15:20,877 --> 01:15:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

1259
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:28,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force 2 on Blade Season 2.

1260
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:31,920
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1261
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the best wallpaper ever.

1262
01:15:33,921 --> 01:15:35,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I just posted links to it in the chatroom.

1263
01:15:37,123 --> 01:15:39,144
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is penguins!

1264
01:15:41,106 --> 01:15:43,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.

1265
01:15:44,408 --> 01:15:45,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a dick.

1266
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:46,329
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
