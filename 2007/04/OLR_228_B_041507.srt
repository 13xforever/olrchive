Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,640
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15th, 2007.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,800
Happy tax day to you and if youíre thinking, ìGosh, my taxes were long due.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Iím actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.î Thatís because youíve downloaded probably

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,360
our audio archive, also known as podcasting.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,120
Well, Orange Lounge Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
two parts.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,080
Or, if you want to hear it even before itís on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,160
B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,360
Monday nights at 6 oíclock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,920
oíclock, so just kind of be listening around 5.30 Pacific Standard Time or 9 a.m. on Tuesdays

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Pacific Time.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,520
You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,200
Alright, letís give us some gaming news to talk about, so letís start it off.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
We need our Death March to play, Rob.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Why?

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
We need playing.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Thatís all I got.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,640
I thought for a moment you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars, so that

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
was kind of cool.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
AnywayÖ

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,040
Unfortunately, I only have the one, no, I donít even have that.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,120
I have this.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:43,360
Okay, Death to PlayStation 3, the 20GB model is kaput.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,440
It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so sayeth Sony.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:59,960
Basically, the consumer market said, ìWe like the 60GB one because the 20GB one just

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:11,800
completely blows my ass.î So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20, however,

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,680
I donít know if thatís going to make it all this special thing, so it lasted six months.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
You own one of these, right?

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes, I do.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,400
And itís just as good as the fucking 60GB, because thereís nothing on the download

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,560
store to actually put on there, and itís not very easy to get videos on there.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,760
And do I really need wireless internet when itís sitting less than two feet away from

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
a router?

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Probably not.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
It has a 60.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
Well, Loki has a collectorís item now, because those 20GBs are going to be super rare now.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,400
And do I need the fucking silver molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there?

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
A little pinstripe?

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I donít know.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
Now, thatís the rare one now, right?

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,000
Iím fucking awesome, yeah!

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Suck that, folks!

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah, itís more like theyíre admitting that the 20GB is no longer available.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,160
It hasnít been available for months now, but this was something that happened.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,640
I want to say around January.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Well, since you all found out, you canít order one.

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,520
Itís nice that theyíre finally copping to that stuff.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,080
Anyways, so some other fun stuff.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,520
Letís see here.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:42,640
Sony is trying to get in on the wireless, kind of handheld input devices, very similar

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,360
to the Wii now.

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,600
Not exactly copying the Wii, but itís a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,040
They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,360
Power Glove, and itís supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I donít

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,520
know, games and stuff, virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,120
I donít know, I think it looks kind of cool.

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,060
And I donít really give a crap if itís a ripoff of Nintendo or whatever.

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,760
At this point, who cares?

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,820
Just make it, as long as it doesnít suck like the iToy did, Iím all for it.

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
So itís a glove?

67
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Yeah, itís like a littleÖ

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
So like the Power Glove?

69
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,820
Itís so bad.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,360
Itís not really like the Power Glove.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,200
It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
your thumb.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,840
And then thereís like, I donít know if itís something that will cause it to tighten up

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,200
or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of almost feel objects and stuff.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,680
So say, for example, I wanted to grab a virtual boob, I could do that and it would feel like

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Iím grabbing a virtual boob.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,480
So thatís what they needed to do with this.

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Yeah.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,120
Did you ever play with thatÖ What was that thing?

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,800
They had it at the E3 Outpost and it was at E3 in Kensha Hall.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
The Novant Falcon?

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Was that what it was called?

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
It sounds kind ofÖ It said the Novant Falcon wasnít a glove, it was this little ball.

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
That thing was awesome.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,440
together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,480
So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
Well hereís what itís also going to allow you to do.

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,120
It says theyíre going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,200
input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending

91
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,280
figures so you can flip off the thing and it will know that.

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I think it would be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people in like home

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
and stuff.

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,880
It means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah, blah, blah, tactile

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,000
feedback and means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,760
So yeah, itís basically going to be like VR gloves.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,840
Hooray!

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960
I have one thing to say about that.

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
What?

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Itís so bad.

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Anyhow, I donít know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog 3Speech

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,380
from Sony has talked about some upcoming Playstation 3 games.

103
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,600
Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,560
ìThatís when weíll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,960
game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air-foot vehicle combat game Warhawk,

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,920
which is still looking likely to be released over the Playstation Network rather than the

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
shops.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,120
First person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September as well as the first

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Playstation 3 version of Ratchet and Clank.î Kind of interesting because you think about,

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,320
ìOkay, well, thatís about the time weíre supposed to get the real version of Playstation

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,240
Home as well and everything.î It almost sounds like Playstation 3 is just going to hold on

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
to everything until the next Christmas season.

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,720
All the more reason for Halo to come out in September.

114
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,160
Now, something to consider though is that 3Speech is a semi-official blog handled by

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list

116
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,000
that has a confirmed U.S. date is Lair.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,120
Thatís set for July.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,400
So the 3Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europeís perspective, but not necessarily

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
us.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,920
Lair, I know thatís been talked about as a July title, same with Warhawk.

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,760
Warhawkís been a July title for a while, but then again, itís kind of morphed into

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,440
really different things than before, so who knows when thatís coming out.

123
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,320
I hope they donít wait that long because they donít have any exclusives between now

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,360
and September, if thatís the case.

125
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,840
Well, it should also be noted that 3Speech said something about BioShock on the Playstation

126
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,960
3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, ìThere is currently

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,300
no indication that BioShock will come out on the Playstation 3.î Oops, weíre talking

128
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
out of our ass.

129
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:59,920
Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a, what was the quote from Clerks and

130
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Oral Bow movement?

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,480
I really donít know.

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,320
Well, I have some good news, at least this is good for me.

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,000
They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,120
I think thatís great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:27,520
The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007 and there actually is a notice saying that the

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,040
Sony Europe site, I suppose, has already been up.

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:39,640
So Iím going to personally think of it as a rumor because it didnít really do all that

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,960
great in Japan on PSP, but if itís coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,800
The game is just fucked up.

140
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,440
Of course, theyíre going to jump on an opportunity to actually have another game that uses the

141
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
6-axis.

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,520
It actually uses the 6-axis and use it well, I hope.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
I donít know.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
We can hope.

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Hold our breath, maybe.

146
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,720
Kind of screwed other things up, but okie dokie.

147
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Anyways, weíve got some stuff coming out this week.

148
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Not a whole lot, not really a lot that you may be looking for, but itís coming out anyways.

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,520
So starting off on PlayStation 2, Raiden 3 is finally making its way out and thatís,

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,040
of course, the arcade shooter game.

151
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,440
Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2, and I know the first one really blew, hopefully this oneís

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
not so bad.

153
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:40,960
PC port of The Plan, and thatís coming to PlayStation 2 as well, didnít look very good.

154
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Eureka!

155
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,560
7 Volume 2, the new wave, I believe thatís the new wave.

156
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Anyways, Eureka!

157
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,600
7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks ok.

158
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Red Star, that old claim game thatís been in development forever and now itís finally

159
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,880
making its way out in PlayStation 2.

160
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,480
On the PSP, we have Hollow Knights finally making its way out, as well as Pocket Pool,

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:18,400
that semi-porn billiards game, and letís see here, nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.

162
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:27,440
Nothing on PlayStation 3, and letís see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics,

163
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,960
letís see here, Mission Blackhawk, and Mission Combat Force, and a game called Made Man,

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,600
which got horrible reviews.

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,680
Finally, on the Wii, weíve got Bust-a-Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game, but of course

166
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,080
the big stuffís going to be coming out on the DS, and weíve got Pokemon Diamond and

167
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,240
Pearl finally making its way out, as well as a Sudoku game, Tundoku.

168
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,040
Thatís it.

169
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,680
Alright, over in Japan, theyíre having these following releases, for April 19th on the

170
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,040
Wii, Super Paper Mario, they get their version of Super Paper Mario, Furu Park is coming

171
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
out as well, looks like a little skating game with little chibi characters, thatís also

172
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
coming out on the Wii.

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,800
I guess Tony Hawk maybe not as popular over there as Furu Park, at least not Furi Furi

174
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,260
Park, which is what I almost read.

175
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,800
Starting on the PlayStation 3, nothing really to note on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 still

176
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,240
getting a little bit of love, theyíre getting a game called Fate Stay Night, Rialta Nua

177
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,280
is coming out on April 19th, and theyíve got a special edition, its own memory card,

178
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,840
this is based on the Type-Moon Sukihime novel game that was released a couple years ago,

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,960
itís anime, manga, figurines, etc., etc., so some of you guys that really follow anime

180
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,280
are probably looking forward to that, so thatís coming out this week.

181
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Also coming out, Oruan Coco Host Buu is coming out in Japan, thatís an anime, Oruan High

182
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,800
School Club something, little roses, and little girly men, yeah, itís a really fucked up

183
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
little anime.

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,960
Alright, well if you want the little fucked up game that goes with it, itís coming out

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,840
on the PlayStation 2 this week.

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,720
Also on the Nintendo DS, letís see, what are you getting over there, Gaouken Alice

187
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,800
Waku Waku Happy Friends, thatís coming out from Kidís Station on the DS this week, April

188
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,800
19th, that looks like another anime game, my birthday has a lot of fun stuff on it,

189
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,160
thatís all they get out there, Wi-Fi Tao Senkai No Dare Demo, you might think thatís

190
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,640
an accessory but itís not, oh itís Clubhouse Games, thatís what it is, itís the Japanese

191
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,120
version of Clubhouse Games, there you go.

192
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
Once I saw the box art I was like, hey thatís just Clubhouse Games, so they get that this

193
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,560
week on the DS, PSP, thereís your big releases this week, Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition

194
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,840
coming out in Japan this week, so check that out.

195
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:11,400
Thatís some pretty crazy stuff, now on the 20th for the UK we have Final Fantasy V Advance

196
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:19,960
for GBA, God of War 2 on PlayStation 2, we have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP,

197
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,760
The Red Star, Iím actually really thinking Iím going to get that game, after playing

198
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,400
it at E3 a while back I thought it was pretty fun, Capcom Puzzle World on PSP, Cube on PSP,

199
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,360
Diddy Kong Racing DS, Free Running on PSP, Hard Rock Casino on PlayStation 2 and PSP,

200
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,440
Capcom US Navy Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 PSP, and Tony Hawkís Project 8 on PSP.

201
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:57,400
Sweet, anyways, back into the news here, of course weíve got some interesting stuff coming

202
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,120
out, of course one thing thatís been confirmed to be coming out, and Iím sure this is not

203
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,560
a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octaneís site there was a response to I believe

204
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,400
an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3, and it says Guitar Hero 3, and Guitar Hero

205
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:25,440
3 is headed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and itís supposed

206
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:34,920
to be coming out Fall 2007, so there you go, yet another release, and interesting, and

207
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,320
according to, apparently there was, itís been removed from the website as well, because

208
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,300
yeah, we didnít realize that there was another Guitar Hero game coming out this year, I mean

209
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,840
after all there are some, was it the 80ís edition coming out later this year, and who

210
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,680
knows what else theyíll throw in there, so not a big surprise.

211
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,360
Itís funny we havenít heard much on Guitar Hero 80ís edition besides that little tidbit

212
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,800
you found a couple weeks ago, itís weird, you would think we would have heard more about

213
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
it by now.

214
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
No.

215
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,280
You think they might push it back?

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah, I already know that, yeah.

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,440
Oh, okay, alright then, letís see, moving on, if youíre a fan of music games then youíd

218
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,440
probably like Ohndan as well, so we know hereís Elite Beat Agents, and Ohndan 2 is coming

219
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
out in Japan on May 17th is what the rumblings are saying, is that the gameís coming out

220
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,160
quite possibly that soon, some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet,

221
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:42,540
Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia,

222
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,280
Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube,

223
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,880
the artist is Hirai Ken, Popstar, itís one of the cheesiest songs Iíve ever heard in

224
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,280
my life, so, but itíll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they

225
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,520
know it in Japan, Ohndan, so, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward

226
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,880
to that one.

227
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,600
I actually think that I might definitely pick that one up, except I havenít picked up the

228
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,320
other one either, but anyway.

229
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,960
Well, now this makes me also particularly happy, excuse me, sorry, allergies, anyway,

230
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:29,000
there is a talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper, well, not second because

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,160
thereís only a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2, Nana Oncha has been

232
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,000
quoted saying, weíre also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,600
the family, and they said, yeah, that one, so theyíre apparently talking about Parappa.

234
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:59,880
Hmm, letís see, well, you know thereís some, a new Parappa sequel would be kind of cool,

235
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,920
one thing thatís not so cool, but, you know, once again, trying to milk something, Guinness

236
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Book of World Records, they are releasing a video game edition, hooray, so youíre going

237
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:22,060
to have a book thatís going to have a bunch of gaming achievements in it, awesome.

238
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,840
Am I the only one thatís not excited about this, I think this is kind of retarded.

239
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Iím not excited.

240
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,880
I thought this was with Twin Galaxies.

241
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,280
I would rather know about people who have like the worldís longest fingernails, and

242
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
you know, can bench press a car.

243
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,480
Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like throw baby a mile or something

244
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
like that.

245
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Genetic oddities, those are great.

246
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,880
Believe it or not, thatís a record, you know, but somebody thatís like, I have the high

247
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,520
score DDR, and you know thatís going to be in there.

248
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,880
Isnít that what leaderboards are for?

249
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,920
I thought this was what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.

250
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one though.

251
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,420
So, I donít know, itís kind of lame.

252
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,720
People are listening to all that Twin Galaxies drama on another program, I could give two

253
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,120
shits about video game high scores these days, I mean seriously.

254
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,920
I donít know, well whatever, there will be some people that are into that, hooray for

255
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
them.

256
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,640
Hopefully a lot more people are into this, because I know thereís a lot of people that

257
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,640
are excited about this game, itís called Trusty Bell, and theyíre getting a special

258
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,560
Xbox 360 pack in Japan for Trusty Bell.

259
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,120
Theyíre calling it something else different over here though, right?

260
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Eternal Sonata.

261
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,640
Thank you, Eternal Sonata is what theyíre calling it over here, but in Japan itís Trusty

262
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,040
Bell, and theyíre getting a whole Xbox 360 pack that will come with the game, Trusty

263
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,880
Bell, and of course a controller and all that good stuff.

264
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,920
Obviously theyíre thinking this is one of those games like Blue Dragon that might push

265
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,960
some consoles, so they are bundling it all together.

266
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,440
Itís going to be fucking awesome since you canít save anything because thereís no memory

267
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
card and itís a core system.

268
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Awesome!

269
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
You suck, Pete.

270
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I didnít even catch that, thatís great.

271
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,560
Way to go, yeah with an RPG, Iím just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.

272
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Thatís awesome.

273
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,400
Thatís awesome, I didnít even catch that, thereís no, oh my God, no hard drive and

274
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,040
no memory card.

275
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Brilliant.

276
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Good job.

277
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Thatís lovely.

278
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Well, what else is brilliant is Dark Sakura surfing the internet all week long at work

279
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
actually, thatís all she does.

280
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,960
No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them

281
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,720
with you in this little segment we call Dark Sakuraís Website of the Week.

282
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,200
And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, Dark Sakura?

283
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:46,160
The website of the week is ICanHasCheeseburger.com, which is like a Caturday site, I love it.

284
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,920
I visited the site, I didnít get it, I thought it was cute.

285
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:58,600
Itís ICanHasCheeseburger.com and cheeseburger is spelled C-H-E-E-Z-V-U-R-G-E-R, ICanHasCheeseburger.com.

286
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,960
The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over

287
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,640
a kitten with the caption, ìDo not want.î Thereís also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua

288
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,880
wearing a dolphin wig, it says, ìI love scotch, here it goes down, down into my bellies.î

289
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,480
I was just like hooray, another cat site from Jamie.

290
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,120
And thereís dogs on here too, thereís a little puppy making his sad faces, ate all

291
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,040
the cheeseburger brownie face.

292
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,240
Dark Tetsuya is posting his favorite, Dark Tetsuya is posting from ICanHasCheeseburger

293
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,040
the entry on April 13th, ìPrincess in another castle, sorry.î I guess the cats are wearing

294
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
it.

295
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,840
Thereís one of a cat with a wiimote in his lap saying, ìI can please have a walk through.î

296
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,360
So, there you go.

297
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,440
ICanHasCheeseburger.com, what is it, ICanHasCheeseburgers, is that what it is?

298
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
ICanHasCheeseburger.com.

299
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,560
Alright, check it out boys and girls, the official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.

300
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,800
Some interesting stuff, if youíre looking to try some games out, thereís been some

301
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,560
demos that have come out on live recently, some that you might not be excited about,

302
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,880
some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out, hooray.

303
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Some that actually look kind of interesting and havenít gotten to play yet, Monster Madness

304
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,480
Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command

305
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,400
and Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that would be pretty awesome as well.

306
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
Look for it.

307
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed,

308
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,160
sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince

309
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,840
of Persia Classic, for the record it got a 12 plus years age rating.

310
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,520
But that would be, you know, since thereís new Prince of Persia, isnít there a new game

311
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,200
coming out somewhat soon, in the not too distant future?

312
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,840
Yeah, theyíre supposed to be doing what for like 360 or something.

313
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,960
So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.

314
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me

315
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,380
a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie weíve earlier spoken about

316
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,320
on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.

317
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,360
So as long as he doesnít screw up Transformers, I suppose weíll be looking forward to Prince

318
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
of Persia.

319
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,320
But if he does screw up Transformers, there will be hell to pay.

320
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,600
Brimstone and fire will rain down upon him.

321
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Yes.

322
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,120
Fire and brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.

323
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,520
Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire and this isnít though about

324
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
a dragon.

325
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,840
So anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.

326
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,000
GameTap can do Saturn games, isnít that great?

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,200
But itís actually also in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoonís V.I. heading

328
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
out.

329
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,160
Now, Iím sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.

330
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,200
Or as it was calledóGod, why canít IóBecause Panzer Dragoon Orta was theó

331
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
Itís a start, Jamie, Jesus.

332
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,880
I know, but the Panzer Dragoon RPG was just like fucking beautiful.

333
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,120
You know, I have that game on Saturn.

334
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,840
Here, have a cheeseburger.

335
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
I have that game.

336
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,320
You have a cheeseburger game?

337
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,960
No, bite my butt.

338
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,320
I have aóI actually do have BurgerTime.

339
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Does that count?

340
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Dude, BurgerTime is awesome.

341
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
They have BurgerTime on GameTap.

342
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Thatís all you need.

343
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
But Panzer Dragoon RPG is just likeó

344
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Super BurgerTime on GameTap.

345
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I know.

346
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,080
I didnít even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once

347
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,840
and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?

348
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
What is this?

349
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
We have Sega Love now.

350
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
What is this?

351
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Sega!

352
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,800
Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.

353
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Good.

354
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
They can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.

355
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,120
All right, so be it.

356
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,120
You donít want to talk about that.

357
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Do not want!

358
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
Exactly.

359
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,800
You might want, though, Halo 3 multiplayer beta.

360
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:15,960
Itís coming out now May 16th and will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.

361
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,460
To which the entire internet responded, ìThree weeks!

362
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Win!î

363
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:29,080
The beta will contain three multiplayer maps of Valhalla High Ground and Snowbound, graphically

364
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,680
improved since the first multiplayer screenshots, and they will only be playable in matchmaking

365
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,480
only.

366
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,840
And letís see what else.

367
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,760
New guns, vehicles, gameplay features, including the mysterious X button, which, by the way,

368
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,960
has been spoiled, and itís just an equipment button.

369
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,440
So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.

370
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,120
Who fucking cares?

371
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Whatever.

372
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,640
Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda

373
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,600
yadda yadda, wonderful.

374
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,920
So buy Crackdown if you havenít yet.

375
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, I was going to share with you all a little bit about what the X button does in

376
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,360
the Halo 3 beta, but Loki kind of ruined it, so thank you, Loki, for being a bastard.

377
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
But if you didnít already hear, yeah, you get the bubble.

378
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,600
Itís all confirmed over on Bungie.net.

379
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Just look for a post that Frankie made on April 13th.

380
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Itís all right there.

381
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,840
It gives a little hints about whatís going on.

382
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,160
Thereís going to be a shield, the whole bubble shield thing, and whatever, trip mines.

383
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Itís going to be interesting, itís going to add a whole new element to the game, but

384
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,840
they swear it will not be, like, something thatís, you know, exploitable.

385
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,240
You know, itís something thatís going to be limited, all that functionality.

386
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,400
So weíll see.

387
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Lord knows I could use a shield when Iím playing Halo, because I get shot in the face

388
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,840
all the time when Iím playing Halo.

389
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I donít like it.

390
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,360
Shot in the face is fun.

391
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Not really.

392
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Not if itís you.

393
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Itís getting shot.

394
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
I donít get shot in the face.

395
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,560
But something, though, that is, I think, pretty neat is Pac-Man Versus is going to the Nintendo

396
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,880
DS by way of the Namco Museum.

397
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
Isnít that cool?

398
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:24,600
For anyone who doesnít know, Pac-Man Versus was a, it was like where you played on your

399
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,480
portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man while you had your Pac-Man controller

400
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
playing on the main screen.

401
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I thought it was the other way around.

402
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,640
I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and then one person had Pac-Man

403
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,800
on the, or Game Boy Advance.

404
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I never played it.

405
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,080
No, the ghosts were split on the screen, thatís right, and it was Pac-Man that was on the

406
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Game Boy.

407
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
You know what I meant.

408
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,160
Pac-Man could see everything going on, but I thought it was funny because it was actually

409
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,240
really loud when people would play it at my house and be like, ìIs it fun?î

410
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Was it fun?

411
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Yeah, itís fun.

412
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Itís pretty fun.

413
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,520
But itís going to be a, it has the multiplayer packed in as 20 bucks and also will include

414
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,880
Dig Dug 2, Xevious, Pac-Man, Mappy, Galaxian, Galaga, and Tower of Druaga.

415
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
Which a lot of those are shit games, but.

416
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,000
I love Xevious and Mappy and Galaxian.

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,760
Those games are cool, but Tower of Druaga, have you ever actually played it?

418
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
It sucks.

419
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
No, but I have a sticker for it.

420
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Alright, well it sucks.

421
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,880
I want the Valkyrie game.

422
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,040
Actually I have the Valkyrie game on TurboGrafx.

423
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,000
But do you get to play Wi-Fi, like over the internet?

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,640
That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man Versus on Wi-Fi.

425
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Probably not.

426
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,320
Alright, well, weíre starting to get late into the show and we still have not done this

427
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,160
segment and I donít know, for some reason putting this segment after a story about the

428
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,880
Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate, so itís time to bring on the pain in our

429
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
FUs of the week.

430
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,560
Dark Sakura, whatís your bitch this week?

431
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:09,800
Um, I have a rash.

432
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Thatís it.

433
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Thatís it?

434
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
F you to your rash?

435
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,300
F you to my rash.

436
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Where is your rash?

437
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Is it in a private place?

438
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,320
Or is it a place where I can see it?

439
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
No questions asked.

440
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Itís on my back.

441
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
On her back, okay.

442
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,800
Itís obviously an allergic reaction to something, because whenever I have a rash thatís an

443
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
allergic reaction, it gets bloody.

444
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Ew.

445
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,800
So yeah, Iím going to the dermatologist, hopefully next week.

446
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Thatíll be fun.

447
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Lucky!

448
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
God, I had an FU earlier.

449
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
I donít know.

450
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Iíve got nothing.

451
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Iím really pissed off at.

452
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Iím hungry.

453
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
F you to hunger?

454
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah.

455
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
F you to world hunger?

456
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
No, itís my hunger.

457
00:28:51,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Iím going to say I also F you toÖ F you to the fact that I ate all that pocky, thatís

458
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
going to make me fat.

459
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,880
F you to the freaking aquarium that IÖ if you listen to the bonus segment live tonight

460
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,040
or on all games that doesnít go to podcasts, youíre going to be talking about my aquarium

461
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,880
I bought, and it killed one of my fish, so F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed

462
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,960
my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.

463
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,280
Bastard filter.

464
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Bastard aquarium.

465
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart

466
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
said it would work.

467
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
So F you to PetSmart.

468
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Thatís it.

469
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,320
Those were nice short FUs this week.

470
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Yes.

471
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Good times.

472
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,680
Weíll open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.

473
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,380
Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking

474
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
around about.

475
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,720
I donít even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is a girly putting

476
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,280
up or putting on makeup game.

477
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,520
So itís called Cosmetic Paradise, and itís a makeup adventure game, and you live in the

478
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:10,000
magical land of cosmetics and must undergo a trial before becoming a queen.

479
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,700
Their heroine must help the townís ladies when they want to confess their love to boys.

480
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,560
Help comes in the form of makeup.

481
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,720
It says in-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.

482
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,640
The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.

483
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,040
There are mini games which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.

484
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,520
The Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so that items can be exchanged with friends and players

485
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,200
and so you can do each otherís makeup.

486
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,680
I want this game because it sounds so stupid.

487
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,520
Come on Dark Sakura, get the makeup game and play with me.

488
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,880
We can do each otherís makeup.

489
00:30:51,880 --> 00:31:00,960
This is one of the strangest attempts to get that girl gamer demographic that no one seems

490
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
to get.

491
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,560
I donít know, Dark Sakura, will this make you want to play video games?

492
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,940
The makeup game?

493
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:24,640
You can visit the world of Katwa and Cosmetica?

494
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,960
What if you could do the gothic Lolita thing with the makeup?

495
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
That would be awesome.

496
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,600
If I could play Be Gothic Lolita the game, then I would definitely do that.

497
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,440
Thatís great.

498
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,480
In chat, theyíre asking who died, Zach or Kelly, because my two fish were named Zach

499
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,800
and Kelly because my aquarium is named Bayside.

500
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,060
Kelly died.

501
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Kelly was the fat one.

502
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,700
She got sucked right up in the filter, so I fear for Zach because Zach was kind of scrawny,

503
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
so heís the littler fish.

504
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,240
I get sucked up and just shop right back out again.

505
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,320
I know, Iím kind of worried about that, but he wonít be alive by the time I get back

506
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
from LA.

507
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,500
Either heíll get sucked into the filter tonight or X4 wonít feed him.

508
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
One of the two will happen.

509
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,440
Well, you can leave the fish in there and heíll just eat the other fish.

510
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,000
I get you a miniature koi.

511
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Weíll see.

512
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,120
Letís get Rob a piranha.

513
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,640
Thatíd be cool.

514
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Letís see.

515
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,000
The Rob D says, ìOf course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.î

516
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Talking about the makeup game.

517
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,520
Gaming Nerd says, ìThis sounds like a sky game, LOL.î

518
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,840
What, because Iím gay?

519
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,920
Dude, I donít do makeup and stuff.

520
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Thatís gay.

521
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.

522
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Thatís different.

523
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Thatís theater.

524
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,320
I donít even really do makeup at Rocky.

525
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,280
Letís see, Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, ìMakeup games sell more copies than even

526
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
GTA.

527
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,160
Oh my God, video games are no longer violent.î

528
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Interesting.

529
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,720
Hi, we can hear you.

530
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,000
Letís see.

531
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,680
Bandit in chat says, ìAs long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all

532
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
win.î There we go.

533
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
Zach liked fatties.

534
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Yeah, I like to smoke them.

535
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,840
All right, letís open up the Skype line.

536
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,400
If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.

537
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
We have extra time.

538
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
We should have done a game tonight.

539
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,320
I donít have anything prepped though.

540
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Oh well.

541
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,080
Weíll take extra calls, I guess, if thereís folks that actually want to call us.

542
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,980
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always call us on the regular telephone

543
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
as well.

544
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,560
Thatís 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

545
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,120
You can ask us about any of the news we talked about tonight or if you have a comment or

546
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
whatever.

547
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,560
Or you know what, you can just ask us anything tonight.

548
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,160
We have a lot of extra time.

549
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Who cares?

550
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,920
Itís potpourri night here on the phones.

551
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,360
Hi, youíre on OrangeLoungeRadio.

552
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Whoís this?

553
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Good evening.

554
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
This is DMN.

555
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Hi, DMN.

556
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Whatís up?

557
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,920
Iím calling about one of your stories at the top of the show regarding Nintendo and

558
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,160
their shortages of Wiiís.

559
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Yes.

560
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,920
I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve

561
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,840
the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiiís.

562
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,440
So theyíre purposefully holding back, you think?

563
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,640
I do.

564
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,240
The big talk around wherever I am is whereís the Wiiís, whereís the Wiiís.

565
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,920
Nintendo is trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get

566
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,400
them even more.

567
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
Is that right?

568
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,000
What is your opinion on that?

569
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,620
Is that right?

570
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,520
I think itís stupid.

571
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,520
They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win

572
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,400
that console war, they need to sell more systems, especially financially.

573
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,400
They need to sell two systems for every one of Sonyís PS3 and they need to sell three

574
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,920
systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.

575
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,880
Yeah, but thatís not necessarily true because theyíre making a profit off each system whereas

576
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,360
everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.

577
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
That is true.

578
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,880
Owned by Loki.

579
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,000
And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title,

580
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Iím surprised Nintendo has released this game and Wiiís are still not readily available.

581
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
I donít know.

582
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,540
I would think that thereís no point to making a shortage now.

583
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,600
You donít hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.

584
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I donít know.

585
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,680
Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas, but even then it would be stupid

586
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,440
to do it around Christmas because then thatís when you make your most money.

587
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,920
So I donít get the point of a forced shortage.

588
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,440
I just donít understand it.

589
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,520
Maybe I donít know enough about economics.

590
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,480
My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.

591
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
What?

592
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,240
Thatís just my two cents on the matter.

593
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Anything else?

594
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Whatís up on STFU this week?

595
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,800
We didnít have a show last week and the week before I wasnít on so everybody has to suffer

596
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
because Iím back this week.

597
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Congrats.

598
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,960
What are you giggling about?

599
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,080
Why are there giggling girls over there?

600
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
I forget Safeword.

601
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
I donít get it.

602
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Bondage!

603
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Oh.

604
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Oh.

605
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
I thought I was thinking Safeword.

606
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,560
Itís a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, ìI forget Safeword.î

607
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Yeah.

608
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Hi, John.

609
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Hi, Jamie.

610
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,920
No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.

611
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,320
Oh, hi Irene.

612
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,840
Sheís running out of the room crying.

613
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
All right.

614
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,280
I better go call her and talk to her then.

615
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Oh, really now?

616
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Gotta go.

617
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Bye.

618
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
You so just got caught.

619
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
All right.

620
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Letís take another call.

621
00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:09,200
Hi, youíre on Orange

622
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Jersey.

623
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,960
Youíre always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.

624
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
What was going on at the end of the break?

625
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
Was there a tourney or something?

626
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
No.

627
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,680
A massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.

628
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,400
But yeah, just word of 2DX and whatnot.

629
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:33,800
But yeah, I donít get why Activision does wonderful things to your 360, case in point,

630
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,760
breaking it with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.

631
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,400
So basically, if you want theóI mean, I donít get it.

632
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,760
If you want the whammy bar fixed, youíre going to have to go through an arm and a leg

633
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,600
and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking.

634
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,520
I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.

635
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,600
Luckily, I wonít have to for a week.

636
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
So maybe itíll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because Iím going to be gone

637
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
for a while.

638
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,600
But Iím afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because if my 360 breaks, Iím going to be so mad

639
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,960
because I know when I call Microsoft, like now they want you to pay to get it fixed.

640
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,120
Iím going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesnít deserve

641
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
it.

642
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Think about it, Ryan.

643
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Yeah, I understand that.

644
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,120
But you know itís like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?

645
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
What?

646
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,720
Thatís a staggering number.

647
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
9 out of every 10?

648
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Yeah, thatís bullshit.

649
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
Yeah, somebodyís pointed that out here.

650
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
A 90% break rate though.

651
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,720
It says something about a 90% break rate.

652
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,120
A 90% break rate?

653
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Come on.

654
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
If that were happeningó

655
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
I know.

656
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,080
No, but only for the people who actually downloaded, who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably

657
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
notó

658
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I know.

659
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
No, thatís notó

660
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,360
It doesnít represent the entire user base at all.

661
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
But thereís likeó

662
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Yeah, thatís bullshit.

663
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,420
Iím telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of

664
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,760
people on them right now.

665
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,080
That game is selling like crazy.

666
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,200
I know that youíre not supposed to judge sales of a game based on a leaderboard, but

667
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
you kind of can.

668
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
You kind of can.

669
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
But think about it.

670
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,360
Donít you think it was a rush job to get Guitar Hero 2 to the 360 in the first place?

671
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, Iím sure it was.

672
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,840
Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?

673
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
I want to know.

674
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I mean, of theó

675
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:18,960
How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch break one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the

676
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,240
actual number is?

677
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
1%, whatever.

678
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,800
How does it break one 360?

679
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,040
I had no idea.

680
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,520
All I know is that no matteróI mean, it could happen anytime.

681
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Itís completely unrelated.

682
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Itís basically like death.

683
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,120
Itís like the odds of dying in a car accident.

684
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,360
You know, theyíre much higher than actually dying of terrorism.

685
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
What?

686
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Okay, shut up.

687
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Knock it off.

688
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Listen.

689
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,040
Hereís why this crap is going on.

690
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,720
Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.

691
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,160
Thatís why you get people saying, ìOh, 90% of the consoles are breaking afteróî No,

692
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,840
itís because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.

693
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,520
Thatís why I have a little 360-form, so you canít blame me for that.

694
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
No, it might be that your system died.

695
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
All right?

696
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,920
You can put it on the 360-forms from other people who are experiencing the same issue.

697
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Yeah, but one personó

698
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,680
And they shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.

699
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,800
Yeah, but one person has their system crash and then another person is like, ìWell, why

700
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
did this crash since day two?

701
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,400
It must be because of Guitar Hero.î And then other people, ìOh, my friendís system crashed

702
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,640
too.î I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now itís broken and itís all because

703
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
of Guitar Hero.

704
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Well, thatís besides the point.

705
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,640
I just want to take a bath in my 360.

706
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,960
Non-Microsoft, I donít get how a non-Microsoft update can actually break a 360.

707
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I donít either.

708
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Thatís the first time.

709
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,240
I mean, thatís the first time I heard of that.

710
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,840
I heard of Microsoft doing that to other unlucky ones and thatís why Iím worried.

711
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,200
Iím holding off on the 360 because of that, because of the fact that any update can break

712
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,320
my system and I have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to get it replaced.

713
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Itís not even worth the time and effort.

714
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,280
Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still breaking after theyíve uninstalled

715
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,040
the update and when theyíre going into the dashboard, which wouldnít even be running

716
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,280
the game at all and wouldnít have anything to do with the fucking update.

717
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,560
So itís not related and people are retarded.

718
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
This conversation is giving me a migraine.

719
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,160
Oh, well, I think weíll leave it at that.

720
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
All right, Zaku.

721
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,200
Thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesnít kill your family, okay?

722
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
All right.

723
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
All right.

724
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,840
Take care.

725
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,960
The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and itís killing grandmas across the nation.

726
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,520
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.

727
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Whoís this?

728
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Hey, whatís up, guys?

729
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Hi, whatís on your mind?

730
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
Whoís this?

731
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,680
This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold them?

732
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,760
Hello, the Rob D. Iím not dodging you and hold them.

733
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
I understand.

734
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I understand.

735
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,840
You guys play on a bad night, God.

736
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Play on like a Monday night.

737
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Nothing happens on Monday.

738
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Oh, fuck.

739
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Heroes is back next week.

740
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Never mind.

741
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,040
Actually, as a college student, weeknights would be worse, but either way, thatís not

742
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
what I call them.

743
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
All right.

744
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Whatís on your mind?

745
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,240
Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable

746
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
content.

747
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,480
What to you would be a better solution, the iTunes model of buying one song a piece or

748
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,360
actually whatís the more egregious offense, the three-song packs or the cost per song,

749
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,640
which to me is also pretty bad?

750
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,360
One of those songs ended up, but they ended up costing $2 a song, right?

751
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,880
About $2.10 per piece, per song.

752
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Okay.

753
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,560
I think it should just be, they should be priced, I think DDR, even though thereís

754
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,640
a whole another can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on

755
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,240
the disk and people were mad about that, but that aside, I think the pricing scheme over

756
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
there was somewhat fair.

757
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,520
It was, what, 100 points a song, so it worked out to be, what, $1.25 or something?

758
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,960
So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought like a pack of 10, you got a discount,

759
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,160
so it only ended up being like a dollar a song.

760
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I like that.

761
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Yeah.

762
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,280
A dollar per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download

763
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,640
because I donít want to download every Guitar Hero song.

764
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,840
Right, and same thing with DDR is that, you know what, maybe I donít want Candy because

765
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,560
Candyís been in every freaking DDR game lately, so maybe I want to skip that one, but I have

766
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,840
that option, or I could just download the Mega Pack and itís kind of included.

767
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,120
It depends how many of the songs I want, but hereís the other difference between the DDR

768
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,940
packs is that not only are they cheaper because itís $1.25 a song, but they are new songs

769
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,280
mostly to the series.

770
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,280
About, letís say, three quarters of them are new, right?

771
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,560
Yeah, I think paying that much and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy

772
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,240
all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I donít remember how much, I think

773
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,540
it was about $90, then thatís ridiculous.

774
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
What do you think?

775
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,540
Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?

776
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,440
Do you think theyíre going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the

777
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,460
internet or do you think, you know, hey, if some suckerís going to buy it, letís keep

778
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
cranking it out?

779
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,160
If enough people buy them, not a chance.

780
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,800
So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, donít buy it.

781
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,840
Exactly, and honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song

782
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
individually.

783
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,040
I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I donít have to download every

784
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
song.

785
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,320
But if theyíre going to put them in three packs, no way.

786
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,920
I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar

787
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,520
Hero songs are kind of long.

788
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,280
You know, DDR songs are short, theyíre like, what, a minute and a half, a minute and 45,

789
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,880
so you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs

790
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
so they could be more.

791
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,160
I would, youíre right, Iíd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual

792
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
song.

793
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
But none of this packs stuff.

794
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I donít like that.

795
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,560
Yeah, I think itís almost a double offense in their case.

796
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,760
Another game I want to play, though, is the Phoenix Ride, or not the Phoenix Ride game,

797
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,040
the Harvey Birdman game.

798
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,880
I think thatís a perfect license for Capcom.

799
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,920
Yeah, do you think theyíre going to kind of model it after Phoenix Ride or what do

800
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
you think itís going to be like?

801
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,400
I donít think they could avoid it, honestly.

802
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I think that theyíd be almost remiss not to do that.

803
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Objection!

804
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
I guess weíll see.

805
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Iíll take the case.

806
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,840
Do you think Phoenix Ride is popular enough that enough people would get it, like thereíd

807
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,920
be enough cross-interest between the two franchises, Phoenix Ride and Harvey Birdman?

808
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,320
Maybe itíd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.

809
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I guess thatís true.

810
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
All right, well, RobÖ

811
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,600
It depends how theyíll do it.

812
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,080
Rob D., anything else on your mind?

813
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
No, thatís about it.

814
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Iíll let you guys take some more calls.

815
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
All right, sounds good.

816
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,120
Iíll give your podcast a cheap plug over on AllGames.com.

817
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,320
You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?

818
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Five times a week?

819
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Yeah, itís a lot of fun.

820
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
All right.

821
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Monday to Friday.

822
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Itís so much fun.

823
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
All right.

824
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah, thanks a lot.

825
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
See you guys later.

826
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
No problem.

827
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
See you.

828
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Letís go to another call.

829
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Weíll take this call here.

830
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,360
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

831
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Whoís this?

832
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Itís Raven Stoffman!

833
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Ah!

834
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
What do you want?

835
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Iím sorry.

836
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,400
Iím just so excited tonight.

837
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,080
Why is that?

838
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,720
Because you picked up my call.

839
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,040
Well, here you are.

840
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,880
You get in almost every week you call.

841
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,520
Very rare do you not seem to get in.

842
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,800
We have to be ultra busy.

843
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,520
Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, thereís

844
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,520
not a lot of folks calling in.

845
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,600
So, here you go.

846
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,280
The phones are dead except for you right now.

847
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,680
I think weíve got all the other calls.

848
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,920
So, whatís on your mind?

849
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Whatís on my mind?

850
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Yeah.

851
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Oh, what was?

852
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Okay.

853
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,840
Sam and Max is on my mind, Culture Shock and all the rest.

854
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,320
This last season is coming out this month and Iím so sad.

855
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Have you been playing Sam and Max?

856
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,160
I didnít realize youíve been playing Sam and Max.

857
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,200
Oh, Iíve been playing Sam and Max since it first came out.

858
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,720
How is it for those folks that havenít really been playing the series?

859
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,320
Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?

860
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,560
Dude, you should be playing this game because itís kind of like a text adventure and you

861
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,520
go around places and the characters are so lovable.

862
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,920
If Sam is so funny, weíll go like, ìHoly fish, based on a dance talker.

863
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Weíre on it, chief.î And he will hang up the phones like, ìWhatís wrong, sap?

864
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,800
We have to sabotage the president.

865
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,560
Heís doing something wrong.î And it has like funny dialogue.

866
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,880
And you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things, itís a text adventure

867
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
game.

868
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,440
I know you say youíre sad because the series is ending and I think weíve all heard, you

869
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,400
know, the last episode for now is coming out.

870
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,500
But donít you think that the series has been popular enough that we havenít seen the end

871
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,240
of it yet?

872
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,720
I think season two has got to be imminent, but I donít know when.

873
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,560
Well, I guess thatís true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live?

874
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,680
Oh, I hope so.

875
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,080
Iím heavily addicted to this game now.

876
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,980
Would you play through it again if it came out on Xbox Live or Wii or anything like that?

877
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:33,200
I think I would, but it wouldnít be enjoyable unless they had like something new in it.

878
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,120
Anything else youíve been playing this week?

879
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,440
Did you talk about Phoenix Wright?

880
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,480
My computer overheated if you talked about it.

881
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,720
We did mention at the end of part A in our last caller just mentioned Phoenix Wright.

882
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,240
Are you a Phoenix Wright fan?

883
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,560
Oh my God, I was just running around just screaming my head off going like, ìItís

884
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Phoenix Wright 3!

885
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,240
Theyíre finally going to bring it out!î I was like, ìHoly shit, I hope it comes out

886
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,640
soon because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All,î Iíve been just

887
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
going just itching for another one.

888
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,400
Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark because it seems like theyíre

889
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
really starting to crank these out?

890
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,320
Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.

891
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,760
If it comes out tomorrow, Iím there.

892
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,840
The Rob Dís in chat says, ìI could envision Ravenstaufen seeing the news, getting up screaming

893
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,200
and running around.î Do you have a video on YouTube of this?

894
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
I should.

895
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Thatís what you should do.

896
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,200
I should just go, ìOh my God, itís Phoenix Wright!î I should put it in the alt key.

897
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Exactly.

898
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,120
All right, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaufen?

899
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,960
One more thing, as usual.

900
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,440
I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.

901
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,160
Through the Skype line or through that other service?

902
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,720
No, no, no, all live through the Skype line.

903
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,800
Did somebody patch the show into you or something?

904
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,840
No, no.

905
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,640
I actually did something ingenious if you have time.

906
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,720
Just give me one minute to tell me, to tell you.

907
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
Okay.

908
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,920
You got me curious, what is up?

909
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
Okay.

910
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,400
My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone and Rob D showed

911
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,120
me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer, and that

912
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,320
works great and I can hear you.

913
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,840
While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.

914
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,120
So, you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.

915
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,480
No, I called my cell phone.

916
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.

917
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
Oh, my gosh.

918
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
Wow, that's hardcore, Ravenstaufen.

919
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,440
He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically

920
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
pick up.

921
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
I think I get it now.

922
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
Mm-hmm.

923
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,800
But that's pretty hardcore.

924
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,800
You're pretty hardcore.

925
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
A big nerd.

926
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Yeah, a big nerd.

927
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,000
Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.

928
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Well, thank you.

929
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You're taking us to compliment.

930
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But you're crazy.

931
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
You do know this.

932
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,640
I know this, but that's okay.

933
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,920
All right, Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go.

934
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Take more calls.

935
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
That is fine.

936
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Bye.

937
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
Enjoy.

938
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,280
Hopefully, they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for

939
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,280
all the calls they're making.

940
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Okay.

941
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
All right.

942
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Let's go to another call.

943
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

944
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Who's this?

945
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Hello, all you happy people.

946
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,160
Hey, I can barely hear you.

947
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Get a little closer to your mic.

948
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Try again.

949
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Hello, all you happy people.

950
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
Hey, who's this?

951
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
This is Dark Knight.

952
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Hey, Dark Knight.

953
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
What's on your mind, buddy?

954
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Nothing much.

955
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:35,880
Just hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just make me not convinced to still

956
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
not get one.

957
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,680
So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?

958
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,440
I am not a next gen owner at all.

959
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
At all.

960
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,640
You're still in the ancient times.

961
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
Well, not really.

962
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,560
I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.

963
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,800
The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.

964
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,320
Do you play handhelds at all?

965
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
I still own a DS.

966
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
It's the only thing I got.

967
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,520
DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.

968
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,160
Do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?

969
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Thinking about it a while back, but like I said, hearing the brick situation and everything

970
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,640
just makes me cut and change my mind every time.

971
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,840
It is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.

972
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,360
I always said, oh, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send

973
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
their consoles back.

974
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,960
You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.

975
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,840
Then it did happen to me, and I remember ranting about it on the show.

976
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,040
I got a brick 360 back in February.

977
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,720
My first 360 bricked after like a week.

978
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,800
I was so pissed.

979
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:50,200
It's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation, you know what I mean?

980
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,000
Especially now they want to charge you their beer.

981
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
What's that?

982
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,320
I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.

983
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,160
As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill

984
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Gates got this name.

985
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,040
There ain't nothing wrong with it.

986
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,520
Yet the darn thing is still bricked, I don't know.

987
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
It happens a lot.

988
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Well, I don't know.

989
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,520
I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird.

990
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,500
People don't just show up out of the woodwork, suddenly a handful of people all have their

991
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,280
consoles go kaput at the same time because of Guitar Hero.

992
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,000
But I would think that Microsoft has this stuff trended, and if something's going on,

993
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,120
you're going to hear something about it on Monday.

994
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,280
I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Fantasy Star University

995
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,440
and hearing people say, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, every

996
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
20 minutes.

997
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,280
Speaking of which, you're still following Fantasy Star Universe, right?

998
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280
Yes.

999
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
What news is going on over there?

1000
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,860
Because I kind of abandoned the game, but I know it's still going strong.

1001
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,360
What's up with Fantasy Star Universe?

1002
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,520
Right now, it's leveled off.

1003
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:57,160
Not much hacking going on anymore, just basically money problems in the game and whatnot, plus

1004
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,960
they updated the lobby again recently.

1005
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,800
Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you've visited all the planets

1006
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,160
and do all those basic quests?

1007
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,360
Yes, we're doing S2 missions now.

1008
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,320
Most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot, like some areas where

1009
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,880
they get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.

1010
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
What else then?

1011
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,560
We've got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops, that's all.

1012
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,560
Sounds pretty cool.

1013
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,560
All right, Wayne.

1014
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,560
Yes?

1015
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.

1016
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,620
Oh, that's right.

1017
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,840
There's that expansion pack coming out.

1018
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,960
When's that supposed to be released?

1019
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,880
Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the US might

1020
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,880
see it in December.

1021
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,360
I guess that's better than never.

1022
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
Yes.

1023
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,960
I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.

1024
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,400
So far, from what inside information I got from one of the chat regulars here, it looks

1025
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,240
pretty interesting with the expansion.

1026
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,960
Well, spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.

1027
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Make it so.

1028
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,400
We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.

1029
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,600
I'm doing it enough times as it is.

1030
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,600
All right.

1031
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
We appreciate it.

1032
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
All right.

1033
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,600
Thanks so much for the call.

1034
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.

1035
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
No problem.

1036
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
You too.

1037
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
All right.

1038
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,320
Thank you so much for the call and in chat seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight

1039
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,320
on the phone.

1040
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,320
Oh, man.

1041
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.

1042
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,040
I'd be a little scared too.

1043
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Hi.

1044
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1045
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Who's this?

1046
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,040
Hi.

1047
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,040
My name's Billy.

1048
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,360
Hi, Billy.

1049
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
How old are you, Billy?

1050
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,560
I'm eight.

1051
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,080
You're eight, huh?

1052
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,000
And what are you doing listening to this program?

1053
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,840
My daddy said I could.

1054
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,240
Your daddy said you could, huh?

1055
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,280
Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?

1056
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,720
Yeah.

1057
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,600
What kind of video games do you play, Billy?

1058
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,120
The Mario one.

1059
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,480
You play the Mario one?

1060
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,880
Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.

1061
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,880
Which Mario game is your favorite?

1062
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880
The one on the Wii.

1063
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,240
The one on the Wii?

1064
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,400
You play Super Paper Mario or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?

1065
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,640
I don't know what the virtual console is.

1066
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,360
You don't know what a virtual console is?

1067
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
No.

1068
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Okay.

1069
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:21,280
Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?

1070
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,920
My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with a guitar hero thing.

1071
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:37,480
It didn't work and he threw it out the window and I don't know what to do.

1072
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,840
Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window or did he throw the guitar out the window?

1073
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,080
I think the Xbox.

1074
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,680
He threw the entire Xbox out the window?

1075
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,920
Yeah.

1076
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,120
Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?

1077
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,640
I think he hit a kitten.

1078
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,640
Really?

1079
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Yeah.

1080
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,840
There was a flat sound.

1081
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,560
That's sad.

1082
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,080
Nobody likes a flat pussy.

1083
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,080
I don't know what to ask this kid.

1084
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,000
So why are you calling us to tell us your dad is throwing things at the neighborhood

1085
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
animals?

1086
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,160
Shouldn't you call the cops if it's that concerning?

1087
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:26,920
Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.

1088
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,040
What do you want us to do to help?

1089
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,720
Loki, they think it's you calling him, by the way, but you're right here, right?

1090
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,720
I'm not calling him.

1091
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
He's right here.

1092
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
He's right there.

1093
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
My voice does not sound like that.

1094
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:41,520
My dad, my daddy, thinks Loki's stupid.

1095
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,120
Why is Loki stupid?

1096
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,840
Because my daddy loves Max.

1097
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,680
Your daddy loves men?

1098
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,040
No, Max.

1099
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,040
Oh, Max.

1100
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,880
Oh, your daddy loves Max.

1101
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,880
Okay.

1102
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,880
No.

1103
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,880
That's true.

1104
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,880
My daddy said that.

1105
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,720
No, my daddy is not like you, Sky.

1106
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,720
Oh, okay.

1107
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,040
Oh, you know what that is at eight years old.

1108
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
I see.

1109
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
You're very perceptive for eight.

1110
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,040
Are you a Mensa member, Billy?

1111
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
No.

1112
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,040
What's a Mensa?

1113
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,040
Don't worry.

1114
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,040
It's nothing.

1115
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,800
It's a club for smart people.

1116
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,080
It's nothing like Menzies.

1117
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,520
That's all you need to know.

1118
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,120
So what else are we going to ask this kid about?

1119
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,840
Oh, don't even go there, Dark Soccer.

1120
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
So well, since we're babysitting-

1121
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Baby's cool.

1122
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,840
What?

1123
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,520
Dark Soccer is cool.

1124
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
Actually if you meet her-

1125
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
Well, that-

1126
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
She's a real bitch, but-

1127
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,520
That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.

1128
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
Hey!

1129
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,520
I'm great.

1130
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Okay.

1131
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,160
Let's see.

1132
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,040
I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain

1133
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,760
you?

1134
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,800
Can we watch The Lion King?

1135
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Sure you can.

1136
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Yes.

1137
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,440
We'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.

1138
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,040
I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.

1139
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,040
It's the circle of life.

1140
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,920
I'm scared.

1141
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,320
I think I'm going to hang up now.

1142
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
All right.

1143
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
You do that.

1144
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Okay.

1145
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Bye.

1146
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
All right.

1147
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Thank you.

1148
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
Bye.

1149
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,880
Which number of callers was that crank calling us?

1150
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,720
Do you think that was DMN or-

1151
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
I can't say.

1152
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,920
They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.

1153
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,840
So whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone.

1154
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
You know who that was, DarkSakura?

1155
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,960
You're a jerk.

1156
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,240
Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us through his magic-

1157
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Excuse me.

1158
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,920
I was here with the microphone set down looking at fucking Caturday pictures.

1159
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,920
Telepathy.

1160
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
Hi.

1161
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,920
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1162
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
Who's this?

1163
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
Uh-oh.

1164
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,960
Call dropped.

1165
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Try again.

1166
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,720
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1167
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,920
You can always call us on Skype.

1168
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,040
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1169
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,720
Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?

1170
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,760
I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment

1171
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
now.

1172
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,240
DidYouLoseASock says, Who was it?

1173
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
That was funny.

1174
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,240
Let's see.

1175
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,440
GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.

1176
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,120
GamingNerd says, Sky loves swearing to eight-year-olds.

1177
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,860
Misty says, If we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch a

1178
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,860
bitch about that makeup.

1179
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,600
Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.

1180
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,600
Hi.

1181
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,600
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1182
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,600
Who's this?

1183
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,600
It's Zappi.

1184
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,600
Hey, our match game champion.

1185
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Zappi, what's on your mind?

1186
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,400
Well, since you brought Pop Pury up, you brought this upon yourself.

1187
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,600
How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?

1188
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:50,080
It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.

1189
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,080
What happened?

1190
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,720
Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.

1191
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,280
Oh, I didn't have no idea.

1192
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,080
I didn't really mean to be an asshole.

1193
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
No, it's okay.

1194
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,560
Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.

1195
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,800
No, it's My Computer's Dying.

1196
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,920
Aww.

1197
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,040
The Vio is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.

1198
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,940
Do you want me to find it and burn it into a DVD for you?

1199
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,840
I do not burn it into a Divix or X-video format.

1200
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,840
I need MPEGs.

1201
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,880
I don't know how to do that.

1202
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,320
I don't want it burned as a DVD-playing file.

1203
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,280
I want it as just data without extra crap on it.

1204
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,280
I think I can do that.

1205
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,280
I don't know.

1206
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,280
Okay, MPEG.

1207
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,280
MPEG is the winner.

1208
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
I'll try.

1209
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,280
All right.

1210
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,280
Did you at least get to see last week's?

1211
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
No, I didn't.

1212
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Oh, you're behind on the whole season.

1213
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
Yes.

1214
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
But think of it.

1215
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,000
You'll get to have a whole marathon day.

1216
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,920
Oh, I can see anger rising here in the Orange Lawns radio room.

1217
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,280
Good job, Zappi, getting us all mad.

1218
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,400
No, I'm just kidding.

1219
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,880
What games have you been playing this week, Zappi?

1220
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,240
Not since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.

1221
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
You broke your PSP?

1222
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
Yeah.

1223
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,640
How'd you do that?

1224
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,040
I dropped my laptop on the screen.

1225
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,040
Ouch.

1226
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,040
So, what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?

1227
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,800
I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.

1228
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, that's great.

1229
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,120
What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?

1230
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,680
Call of Duty and Ratchet and Clank.

1231
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,960
A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.

1232
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,880
I actually like it.

1233
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,920
What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?

1234
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,520
There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.

1235
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
There's a...

1236
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
Let's name that stealth game.

1237
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,800
It completely slipped my mind.

1238
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,720
Not Metal Gear Solid, but...

1239
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
Subsistence?

1240
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
No.

1241
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
Oh, wait.

1242
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
No, duh.

1243
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,720
Is that what?

1244
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,720
Acid?

1245
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,680
What was the other Metal Gear one?

1246
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,680
It's not Metal Gear.

1247
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:54,160
It's the number one that's on the PlayStation platform.

1248
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,600
It starts with an S. A Cyclone Filter.

1249
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,720
Oh, okay.

1250
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,120
That's a pretty good one.

1251
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
Cool.

1252
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,920
Also, there's Daxter.

1253
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,920
That's good.

1254
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,920
All right.

1255
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,920
There's some good...

1256
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,920
Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?

1257
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,920
Uh, no.

1258
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,920
I'm not really...

1259
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,360
Rondo of Blood!

1260
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,600
Two people in chat room did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game,

1261
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,600
so there you go.

1262
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,200
And why is he giving us the mandatory Rondo of Blood?

1263
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
So there you go.

1264
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,200
All right.

1265
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,160
Well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, Dark

1266
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,160
Sakura.

1267
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,160
I do my best.

1268
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,160
All right.

1269
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Take care, buddy.

1270
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
All right.

1271
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Bye-bye.

1272
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,480
See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.

1273
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,480
He should do that for you.

1274
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,440
Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.

1275
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,960
It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on...

1276
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,320
I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he

1277
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,060
had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding

1278
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,600
his laptop.

1279
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:00,160
And so since then, I've actually had a problem with the Divix stuff, so...

1280
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
All right.

1281
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
One more call.

1282
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Hi.

1283
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,160
You're on Orange Lawn.

1284
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,160
I'll show you.

1285
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,160
Who's this?

1286
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,160
This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.

1287
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,160
Hey!

1288
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,160
DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.

1289
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,160
What's on your mind, buddy?

1290
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,160
Nothing much, man.

1291
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,160
This is my first time calling.

1292
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,400
I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have

1293
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
time.

1294
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,680
I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show,

1295
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,680
so...

1296
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
Wow.

1297
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,680
Congratulations.

1298
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
Jeez.

1299
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
You've been listening for three years, and you've never gotten on the show.

1300
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,120
Well, there you go.

1301
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
What the hell?

1302
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
Our line doesn't get hammered that much.

1303
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Well, that's all right.

1304
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,920
Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.

1305
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,600
What did you want to talk to us about tonight?

1306
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,160
Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo...

1307
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,520
How Nintendo's delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.

1308
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,840
Of course, yeah.

1309
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,800
Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't

1310
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,720
blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues,

1311
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,360
because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on,

1312
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:06,160
whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony, regarding to all these

1313
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
delays.

1314
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
That's IBM.

1315
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:15,400
I'm not sure if you guys know this, but IBM is really the main supplier for the chipsets

1316
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,920
for all three of the next-gen systems, and because of their chips that is all based on

1317
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,360
the PowerPC model, in effect, they're all kind of borrowing from one another, and all

1318
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,760
the chipsets are all coming from out of the same factory, and so in a way, any of the

1319
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,920
shipment problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't

1320
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,600
get out enough chips, and it happened before with, but I'm not sure if you know that

1321
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,680
Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.

1322
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,240
That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips, and Apple was like, well,

1323
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,240
fuck you guys.

1324
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,720
You can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel, and now you kind of see

1325
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,680
the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.

1326
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,400
You know, that's an interesting point, because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game

1327
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,920
companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components

1328
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,960
that go into the system, and for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360

1329
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,080
delays previously, was that there was like a component?

1330
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,280
I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip, but I noticed one of these systems got

1331
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,920
so slowed down, because the factory couldn't produce enough of it, unless it was 360 last

1332
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,920
year.

1333
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,920
It was the PlayStation 3, and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really IBM's fault

1334
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,920
either.

1335
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,080
It's the fact that Nintendo's retarded, and it only has one factory building these

1336
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,080
fucking systems, instead of like four factories, or even more building systems.

1337
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,120
That's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that

1338
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,600
right now, despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM.

1339
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,840
It's because they're retarded still, and they only have one factory producing them, despite

1340
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:50,760
the fact that most of the components in it were stuff that was in the GameCube, and that

1341
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,200
they should have tons of, and should be really easy to manufacture.

1342
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah, but one-

1343
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
That's a good point.

1344
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

1345
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,320
I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as getting enough factories out

1346
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:07,920
there to make these damn systems, but I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look

1347
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,640
at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles,

1348
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,240
you kind of have to look at it this way.

1349
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,880
IBM only has one factory, too, so in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at

1350
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
in this situation?

1351
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,360
All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the whole overall picture.

1352
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,600
There's no winners.

1353
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:37,680
The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wiis, because

1354
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,960
Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360, so they're just

1355
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,200
going to pretty much switch from making 360s into Wiis, because it's all third-party factories

1356
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,200
anyways.

1357
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,800
So that's the rumor, at least.

1358
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,840
Hopefully that's actually the case, and they're not actually just sandbagging all this stuff

1359
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,840
until Christmas.

1360
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,120
Well, we could only hope, man.

1361
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,080
You know what, though?

1362
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,600
Do you have your Wii, DJ Kibbles and Bitch?

1363
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,600
Yeah.

1364
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,560
Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.

1365
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,560
Exactly.

1366
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,560
You know what?

1367
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,880
That's my thoughts now, is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get

1368
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,880
the system.

1369
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,880
You know what?

1370
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,360
Who cares if there are shortages?

1371
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there

1372
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
and wait.

1373
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,360
But you know what?

1374
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,360
I agree.

1375
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,000
You know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with

1376
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,480
this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June, well, it sucks to be you

1377
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,680
if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get a console, you know, you don't get

1378
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,000
the free internet browser or whatever, you know?

1379
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,320
It would suck.

1380
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,880
Yeah, you know, I mean, at the same time, though, when you are an early adopter, you

1381
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,000
do kind of get fucked over later on in the case of, like, the 360 Elite bullshit that's

1382
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
going down.

1383
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
True.

1384
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Or the Red Rings of Death.

1385
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,600
We did get to play our systems a year in advance, but, you know, look at the other end of things

1386
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
too.

1387
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,360
So, whatever, it's a catch-22 at the end of the day.

1388
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,240
Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space

1389
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,240
on my 360.

1390
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,840
Until they sell porn.

1391
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,440
Good point.

1392
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,760
Oh, God, please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.

1393
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,760
HD porn!

1394
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,080
Oh, my God, sales of 360 would go through the roof, seriously, they would whoop the

1395
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,080
Wii's ass.

1396
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:19,200
I mean, I think about, you know, dads across America going to buy a system for their children.

1397
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,520
Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have

1398
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,840
fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high death!

1399
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Porn wins, always.

1400
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,360
Well, Viance, PlayZ3 makes that the easiest, since you can put, like, video files on there

1401
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,640
pretty simple.

1402
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,440
Baby formula, or wow epic mount?

1403
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,000
Baby formula, wow epic mount, I just can't choose.

1404
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,560
DJ Kibbles N Bits, really good first call, really good point.

1405
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,400
Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?

1406
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,920
Oh, no, that's it, man, that's it.

1407
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,920
It's a pleasure, it's a pleasure.

1408
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,120
Well, no problem, thanks so much for calling, any time, call back.

1409
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,520
All right, take care, guys.

1410
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,520
Later!

1411
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,760
All right, well, that was a good Skype line tonight, lots of people we got to hear from

1412
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:09,840
there, and of course our chat room going along there, let's see, I think they're talking

1413
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,600
about Doctor Who now.

1414
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,480
Dark Sakura, is there a Doctor Who debate?

1415
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,480
Ignoring.

1416
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
Ignoring?

1417
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,480
I see.

1418
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,480
I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but...

1419
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
Exterminate!

1420
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,120
Legend of Zaku says, remember this lesson in life, when trying to get a Wii, there will

1421
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,600
always be at least 10 diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store

1422
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
that sells it.

1423
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,200
eBay profiteers.

1424
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,960
Have a special place in hell waiting for them.

1425
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,400
All right, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?

1426
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,600
Yes, but Loki can go first.

1427
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,600
All right.

1428
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Okay.

1429
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,800
Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.

1430
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,320
One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have

1431
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,600
voice chat.

1432
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
Not true.

1433
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,960
Let's see here.

1434
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:03,160
Dark Alex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.

1435
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,160
So that's pretty awesome.

1436
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,120
Get the run homebrew and the latest games.

1437
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:14,320
There's a rumor that Dragon Ball Online, Xbox 360 edition is coming, and I don't know, I

1438
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:21,680
guess they're basing that off of a posting for job opening on Game Job, and I don't know,

1439
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,400
that's kind of interesting I guess.

1440
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:31,000
Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller, looks like a 360 controller, don't care.

1441
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,200
Virtual consoles for Monday, apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's

1442
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,880
Revenge.

1443
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,320
So that would be kind of neat for the US.

1444
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
Where's my Actraiser?

1445
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,520
Well it doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.

1446
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,960
There's a new game coming to the Playstation Network that looks exactly like, I cannot

1447
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:56,480
remember the damn name, it's on the 360, whatever, what do you think?

1448
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,480
What that game is?

1449
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,080
Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.

1450
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,080
I don't know.

1451
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,440
No, it looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.

1452
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,440
Boom Boom Rocket?

1453
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,440
It's not Boom Boom Rocket.

1454
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,440
Geometry Wars?

1455
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,440
I don't know.

1456
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,440
No, not Geometry Wars, the other one.

1457
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,000
Like, Mutant Storm Reloaded, that's what it was.

1458
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?

1459
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,600
Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.

1460
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:23,440
For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source, for the Half-Life engine, who

1461
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:31,800
cares, and, oh, this is stupid, Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.

1462
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Makes me want to paint.

1463
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,320
Was it spray painted red?

1464
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,120
Yes, it was, more or less.

1465
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
People are retarded.

1466
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,680
And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox

1467
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,160
Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the Playstation.

1468
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,360
So I hope that is true.

1469
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,120
Alright.

1470
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:04,640
Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend, Brad, from

1471
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,640
PodCulture.

1472
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,280
Yay, Brad.

1473
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,840
This is, it's not really news, but it's something that's really cool.

1474
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,880
It's from Tech Blog, sorry, I should say Tech e-blog, I should say.

1475
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,800
The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.

1476
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,960
Number ten is the Cliccovision Portable, the NES station, which is basically a Nintendo

1477
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,160
don't have to look like a PS2, just a mod.

1478
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:43,560
There's the N-Pod, which is a, it runs NES games, it's interesting, it actually looks

1479
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,440
kind of cool, I want one.

1480
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,720
There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a nomad,

1481
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,960
and then attached a CD player to it.

1482
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:02,360
The GameCube ToGo, which, yeah, whatever, that one's kind of bizarre, but neat at the

1483
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,360
same time.

1484
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,360
The NES Plus Sega, that's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.

1485
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,000
The handheld Atari Jaguar, next!

1486
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,660
Only good game on that was Tempest.

1487
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:19,120
Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, yeah, whatever.

1488
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,200
Dreamcast Portable, that's kind of cool, and PlayStation 2 Portable.

1489
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:30,080
I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.

1490
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,080
He brought it over, it worked, it was pretty cool, I think that this is cool, I still want

1491
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,080
a game axe.

1492
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
A what?

1493
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
A game axe.

1494
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
What the hell is that?

1495
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,140
Let me find a picture of it.

1496
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,160
It's another handheld, chopped up system.

1497
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,160
But there's no time!

1498
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
That was it!

1499
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
We're out of stories!

1500
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,160
We're out of steam!

1501
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,160
We're out of time!

1502
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,240
So that's it, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1503
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,240
Was that your last story?

1504
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,240
I'm sorry.

1505
01:13:53,240 --> 01:14:00,040
Okay, I'm trying to pull up the thing, it's a portable NES player.

1506
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,720
End game gear.

1507
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,720
And stuff.

1508
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,720
Anyway.

1509
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,720
Rob!

1510
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Rob.

1511
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,720
Let's go around and get everyone's...

1512
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,720
Rob.

1513
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,720
What?

1514
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,720
Rob.

1515
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,720
I will kill you.

1516
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,080
Can I have a cheeseburger, please?

1517
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,560
That's it, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1518
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,360
Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.

1519
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360
What's that?

1520
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,360
Tuesday.

1521
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Yeah?

1522
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,360
I have class.

1523
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,440
No pump on the volume.

1524
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,680
There may not be guys on a show Wednesday, because of my trips, so it's going to be a

1525
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,840
very quiet week on Orange Laundrio, but at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan

1526
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,840
live this week.

1527
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,160
And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.

1528
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,160
Interesting.

1529
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,160
Yeah.

1530
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Alright.

1531
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,920
Also, next week's show should be very interesting, because Dark Soccer and I will be at Disneyland

1532
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:48,360
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or not Sunday, we're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving

1533
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,360
Thursday.

1534
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
On Sunday.

1535
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,360
Yeah, anyway.

1536
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,360
Too confusing.

1537
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,000
So we'll be pulling into town just when the show's about to start, so next week could

1538
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,320
very well be the Loki show, with hilarious commentary from Dark Soccer and Sky, so won't

1539
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,320
that be fun, Loki?

1540
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,320
Yeah.

1541
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
Still think Loki should come with us.

1542
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,320
I know.

1543
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,320
I wish Loki would come with us.

1544
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,320
Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?

1545
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,320
No.

1546
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,320
You make me sad.

1547
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,320
Don't you want to ride a, you know, Rockin' California Screamin'?

1548
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,320
No.

1549
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,320
Alright.

1550
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,320
I know.

1551
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,320
He's so boring.

1552
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,040
He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.

1553
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
Guess I can't say I blame him.

1554
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,040
Play games.

1555
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,040
Alright.

1556
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,640
Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.

1557
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,640
Loki, your final thought.

1558
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,480
Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force

1559
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,880
2 on Blade Season 2.

1560
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,120
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

1561
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:37,120
I have the best wallpaper ever, and I just posted links to it in the chatroom.

1562
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,160
My final thought is penguins.

1563
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,800
And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.

1564
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
You're a dick.

1565
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
That's it.

1566
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,640
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1567
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,080
You guys are awesome for sitting through the entirety three hours of our program every

1568
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080

You guys are what motivates us to do Orange Launch Radio here every week for free.

1570
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,200

We really appreciate it.

1575
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,880

1576
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:41,440
