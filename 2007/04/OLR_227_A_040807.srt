00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:26,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 8, 2007, details leak on the next Xbox Dashboard update, a new Wii game will make use of the forecast channel, and will Harmonix's new rock band change music games as we know it?

2
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:35,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:41,692
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and gamer culture and what you, the gamer, really want to know.

4
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:43,073
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:46,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:47,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I like frappuccinos.

7
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:52,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like the new, what is it, Cinnamon Dulce one?

8
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Dulce.

9
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:53,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Dulce, whatever.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it.

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that was wrong.

12
00:00:59,423 --> 00:00:59,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was Dulce.

13
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:00,264
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like...

14
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:02,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Versace.

15
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:05,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

16
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:05,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably true.

17
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice reference to my favorite movie ever.

18
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:08,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

19
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you would appreciate that.

20
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Launch Radio, Loki.

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to work into showgirl's segue somehow.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl.

25
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then showboy.

26
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:26,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

27
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:26,902
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

28
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:31,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl.

29
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:32,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

30
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get topless for us tonight?

31
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:34,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

32
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:34,749
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

33
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:35,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Amanda.

34
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:36,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

35
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,390
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

37
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,491
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

38
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:38,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

39
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long, long time, right?

40
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:43,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little brief snippets.

41
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget you've got to almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it.

42
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,015
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

43
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:48,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

44
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:48,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

45
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting and all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right?

46
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:54,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you?

47
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:54,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

48
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been out there.

50
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:58,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio.

51
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:59,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, briefly.

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners.

53
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,351
[SPEAKER_06]: What type of video games do you like?

54
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:05,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like the Wii.

55
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the Wii?

56
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii!

57
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I like puzzle games.

58
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:15,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff.

59
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you been playing on your Wii lately?

60
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, WarioWare.

61
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,260
[SPEAKER_06]: WarioWare?

62
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game.

64
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff.

65
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,581
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?

66
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

67
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:38,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Bubble Bobble or the thing where you shoot the little marbles.

68
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:39,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Bobble.

69
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:40,543
[SPEAKER_06]: You're barely getting picked up, sweetie.

70
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:41,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

71
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:41,543
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

72
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:42,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Bubble Bobble.

73
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:43,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble Bobble, yes.

74
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:44,144
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

75
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:45,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

76
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:46,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Bobble.

77
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide.

78
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Bust a Move.

79
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it.

80
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:53,246
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

81
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like Bar Games.

82
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

83
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sounds like fun.

84
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:25,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, welcome to the show.

85
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:27,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

86
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:28,518
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in our chat room.

87
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:29,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Omega Touch, thank you.

88
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:30,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Who said that in chat?

89
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That was... Dark Tetsuya.

90
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

91
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Good man, Dark Tetsuya.

92
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I thought it said D-Teaser.

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what's the D that you're teasing?

94
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:48,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on this Sunday night, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight.

95
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:52,263
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate, as she deems appropriate.

96
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:52,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

97
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

98
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:54,739
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

99
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, loudly, because, um, I don't know the machine's a bastard.

100
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:33,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone.

101
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's got tea.

102
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:37,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I stepped out for a minute.

103
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:38,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do that in radio.

104
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,986
[SPEAKER_06]: What, I heard, you heard, you lost your balls over the week?

105
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,890
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag.

106
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

107
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um.

108
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:51,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there.

109
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Got in the zone, you know.

110
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:53,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, those balls.

111
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:55,299
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, don't touch the door thing.

112
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd get in the zone and then drain.

113
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone.

114
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And Deadpool.

115
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:05,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

116
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics too.

117
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

118
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017.

119
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:26,045
[SPEAKER_06]: God, this is going to become the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week.

120
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's fun and stupid.

121
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's put it this way.

122
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,668
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game.

123
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can fly up like 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground fine.

124
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like nothing happened.

125
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Helicopter will land down there and do it again.

126
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:45,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

127
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:53,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, Easy on it.

128
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?

129
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do two-player co-op.

130
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:58,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

131
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot of fun.

132
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:05,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them.

133
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:13,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on Easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels...

134
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet, so you can actually get one weapon, it's called the Genocide Gun that does a million damage to an area of like 72 meters or whatever, and it's just you really have to watch out launching that thing, because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that.

135
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible.

136
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of

137
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:48,546
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

138
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Honeycomb Beat.

139
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:50,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

140
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was okay.

141
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very interested in it, though.

142
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:55,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my thing.

143
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:56,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why you gave me your copy?

144
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

145
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet!

146
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I got free games from Loki today.

147
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

148
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And then... Now I just have to find my DS.

149
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:04,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously cannot find my DS.

150
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Crackdown a bit.

151
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:08,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of fun.

152
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I played another game, which I can't talk about, though, right now.

153
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want you to get sued.

154
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, though, it's...

155
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Neat, I guess.

156
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:49,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And the leaderboards for it, though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people.

157
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You should come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will because they start doing the commentary.

158
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jumping.

159
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Bob and I like to jump.

160
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:04,377
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole theme of Crackdown, by the way, is to jump everywhere you go.

161
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:05,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

162
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:06,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump a lot.

163
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like the top of bridges and stuff.

164
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That part was fun.

165
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:15,884
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, I don't know, just pure killing people.

166
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the jumping.

167
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories.

168
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun.

169
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:27,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at some comments from chat room, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made.

170
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:33,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, Hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers.

171
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:37,117
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have like a versus mode in that and I don't know how well that would be.

172
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:41,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Ion671 says, It is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense.

173
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: and JeremyTel1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?

174
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many.

175
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there you go.

176
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,510
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week, I played a game called, what was it?

177
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:00,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Tidepool Explorer because I went to the Monterey Aquarium because William took me to Monterey this weekend and he surprised me with a nice little weekend thing.

178
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:10,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to Monterey and you know, it got me thinking like, they got all these cool little educational things for kids and it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had

179
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

180
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:14,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember that?

181
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocky's Boots and what were the other MECC games?

182
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon Trail, I guess.

183
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:19,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Number Munchers.

184
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Number Munchers, hell yeah.

185
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:25,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I'm going to write this whole nostalgia article for the community all-game site.

186
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Turtle.

187
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:27,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Turtle?

188
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, or what was that?

189
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:29,627
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the language?

190
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:30,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Logo?

191
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the language they made us all learn in, like, third grade?

192
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:33,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the turtle?

193
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:33,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

194
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, drop pen, 30 north or something.

195
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn.

196
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:46,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was a little game where you walked, but it was like you had two screens.

197
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:55,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they had four people playing it at once, and you had this big screen in the middle, and then you had a little screen right in front of you, like an old... A picture, what are those, what do they call them?

198
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:56,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Tabletop, like Ms.

199
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:57,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man?

200
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,273
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they call those games back in the day when they had the... Is it just tabletop?

201
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:00,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocktail.

202
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Cocktail.

203
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a cocktail machine.

204
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:08,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the Tidepools, and on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say...

205
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:17,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick up, you know, so you could, like, pick up the shell, or you could, you know, throw away, like, if you found a trash can, you could throw it away.

206
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:24,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to, like, you know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tide pools and what you can't.

207
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:25,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just kind of neat.

208
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all stingray.

209
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,951
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll stab you through the heart.

210
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Crikey.

211
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:33,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, William commented, I know he was like, oh, that looks like a DS game.

212
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:34,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of was.

213
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:37,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things.

214
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:41,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually when I see educational games, I try to figure out how to break them.

215
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:48,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we saw Penguins, and that made me very happy.

216
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a video game, like actual live Penguins.

217
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That made me very happy.

218
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we went to the aquarium in the first place.

219
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get you your own copy of Portable Pango.

220
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love Pango.

221
00:10:58,303 --> 00:10:59,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite games.

222
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:00,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Pingu was a Sega game, wasn't it?

223
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:01,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I took it in my room.

224
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't Pingu a Sega game?

225
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:03,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was.

226
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:03,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was.

227
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I've got to find out.

228
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anywho.

229
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else?

230
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:31,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but so actual games I really did play, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.

231
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:31,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

232
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:32,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Pango is by Sega.

233
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

234
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that from Wikipedia or from chat?

235
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:37,209
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was from Google.

236
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,009
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, sweet.

237
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:48,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the PlayStation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on.

238
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:50,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So I knew to wait and not buy it on PlayStation 2.

239
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been a long time since I played Guitar Hero because the first one kind of wore off for me.

240
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2.

241
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

242
00:11:57,604 --> 00:12:00,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did.

243
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:02,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

244
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs.

245
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game.

246
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:07,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's cool.

247
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child of Mine.

248
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

249
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero?

250
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?

251
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have a animation thing in the beginning.

252
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's the same as commercial.

253
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they're, like...

254
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 2 is fun.

255
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Graphics, obviously, a step up from the PlayStation 2 because it supports widescreen.

256
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:27,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics.

257
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The controller itself works pretty good.

258
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,892
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

259
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Online Co-op

260
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:49,553
[SPEAKER_06]: guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it so you wouldn't be able to really I mean that would be the lagged part whereas DDR you know the way DDR gets away with it is it kind of shows you the steps with or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag but it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that you're playing your own game so I think they could do it they just would have to get creative with how the music track plays you know what I mean

261
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:55,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes when you screw up.

262
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes, you know, those little things.

263
00:13:56,475 --> 00:14:01,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, didn't they have, like, Amplitude online where you could do co-op with Amplitude and stuff like that?

264
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost positive they did.

265
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:02,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course.

266
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

267
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,138
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Amplitude.

268
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:05,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty sure it can be done.

269
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

270
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Devil Kai in chat says, Hey, Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version.

271
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.

272
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,324
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way.

273
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,481
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

274
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,259
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

275
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:52,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good times.

276
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of expensive, though.

277
00:14:54,425 --> 00:15:05,789
[SPEAKER_06]: If you already own the PlayStation 2 version, you might want to question, you know, how important is it to you to have it on Next Gen, because I don't know if, I mean, granted, there's a couple new songs, some slightly prettier graphics, and the whole online leaderboards.

278
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you.

279
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, speaking of achievement points, real quick, there's some really screwy ones in there.

280
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:15,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you fail a song on Easy and get 10 points.

281
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You play a left-handed song and get 10 points.

282
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:20,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You beat tutorial and get 10 points.

283
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:22,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like some of the scores are misweighted.

284
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:26,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think if you fail a song on easy, it should be one of those ghost achievements.

285
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:31,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles, where it's just on your record, but it's zero gamer score.

286
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Dead or Alive has one, too.

287
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:38,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you, like, lose ten battles in a row, that goes on your gamer card, but you don't get any gamer points for it.

288
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other, you know, beat a song, perfect.

289
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you only get ten points for getting a perfect 100% on a song, I think.

290
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:49,537
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

291
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We went up playing Doctor and Nurse.

292
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean video games.

293
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:21,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, sweetie.

294
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:22,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games.

295
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom beat Zelda, finally.

296
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched him beat it, sort of.

297
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in and out of the room.

298
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?

299
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

300
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:32,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

301
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point.

302
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah, I want that too.

303
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:43,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much about it right now since we've just been busy with other things.

304
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fucking?

305
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fixing my bike, my motorcycle.

306
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:50,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Fixing your bike?

307
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:51,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

308
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:52,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ride a bike to work?

309
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:54,009
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

310
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:55,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to ride a bike to work?

311
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get my license.

312
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?

313
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we saw at E3 a couple years ago.

314
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little exercise bike, but it's a game.

315
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:05,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the screen.

316
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:09,111
[SPEAKER_06]: But the graphics were kind of horrible, if I remember right.

317
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:13,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like... God, what was that Sega Master System game?

318
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it came with every Sega system that was like a motorcycle game.

319
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:18,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember.

320
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:19,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

321
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:20,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang-On?

322
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:21,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was Hang-On.

323
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,087
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like Hang-On to me.

324
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:25,507
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

325
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkShy in chat says, Dr. Mario and Peach live.

326
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what your house is like, Amanda?

327
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Mario and Peach live?

328
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

329
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,029
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

330
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:34,409
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

331
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:35,369
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

332
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us.

333
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at chat.

334
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well.

335
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

336
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:48,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Also talking about the achievements, Blaze says, I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements.

337
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:51,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft does regulate it to some extent.

338
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?

339
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 50 is the max, and they raised it up to 50.

340
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:57,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they?

341
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:58,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, interesting.

342
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:05,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, JeremyTodd1 says, I think they should have negative achievements where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much.

343
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:10,476
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura was unable to do Pump Up the Volume this week because Comcast went down, right?

344
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it did.

345
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:40,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem, but it turned out that it was just a temporary.

346
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:44,579
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Tuesday nights, you can listen to DarkSakura, take your requests, 7 p.m.

347
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,160
[SPEAKER_06]: or 7.30?

348
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:45,160
7.30.

349
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,081
[SPEAKER_06]: 7.30 p.m.

350
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific, right here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

351
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:53,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday nights, guys on the show, 7 o'clock Pacific time.

352
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:57,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday nights, STFU, also at 7 o'clock Pacific time.

353
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there still a club, OLR?

354
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:00,314
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

355
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:01,194
[SPEAKER_05]: In theory.

356
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:02,115
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

357
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I put new episodes up there, or reruns.

358
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:10,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Club OLR's been getting low ratings, so we're thinking of moving it and putting something else on Friday nights.

359
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:13,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to save Club OLR, Friday nights at 7 o'clock.

360
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings.

361
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:17,938
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

362
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:18,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be the first.

363
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,578
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's right.

364
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings.

365
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:22,439
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what about your shows?

366
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:22,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

367
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:23,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's true.

368
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my shows did.

369
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,194
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings.

370
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:28,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the excuse.

371
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:29,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Extroverse Case of the Mondays.

372
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's internet radio, people.

373
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We have low ratings anyway.

374
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't care.

375
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,937
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we always use that as an excuse.

376
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:37,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an excuse.

377
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is, is it takes a long time to create that damn show, and wife doesn't like that.

378
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together.

379
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:46,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

380
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, you can't podcast it.

381
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was working on stuff.

382
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:53,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got like a... I was actually doing a happy hardcore one, but I...

383
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to that little bastard Travis Donovan on Saturday nights at 7 Pacific.

384
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:24,376
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

385
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:50,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

386
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:56,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight, and that was going to be it, and then GameSpot would... Oh, wait, no.

387
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I think actually he's off because of Easter.

388
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:58,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been following him on Twitter.

389
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:03,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Twitter account now, so I could be like Major Nelson and GamerAndy, because I want to be cool like them.

390
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:05,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a Twitter account, so I've been following Major Nelson.

391
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:06,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something.

392
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a stalker site, which kind of worries me, so I don't post about things as I'm doing them.

393
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:12,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I post about things after the fact.

394
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:13,364
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

395
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I just, you know...

396
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically, it's this really cheesy thing.

397
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It asks, what are you doing right now?

398
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're supposed to type in what you're doing right now.

399
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And for instance, I think the last thing I put is I'm listening to the new Bjork song while I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight.

400
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:28,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

401
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,555
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to use 140 characters or less.

402
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:35,077
[SPEAKER_06]: But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update or IM to update.

403
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of interesting.

404
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:39,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only like 150 characters.

405
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So it forces you to be quick.

406
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

407
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:42,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird.

408
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:42,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Lame.

409
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,673
[SPEAKER_06]: But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it, and I've been following him on there.

410
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite.

411
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, you should join this.

412
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:48,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay.

413
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:50,334
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing right now?

414
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm updating my Twitter account.

415
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:53,534
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing right now?

416
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm updating my Twitter account.

417
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:55,975
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

418
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E, if you want to have me.

419
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, how did we get on that?

420
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,777
[SPEAKER_06]: The Spring Dashboard Update.

421
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:08,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?

422
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:08,577
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

423
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I bet you anything this is totally planned.

424
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:11,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking corporate.

425
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... They pay good money to leak the stories.

426
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:20,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I say this... Listen, okay, a corporate website does not leak stories, okay?

427
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a leak.

428
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:27,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking planned PR thing that's disguised as a leak.

429
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:32,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh... Because there's... No.

430
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

431
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

432
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:34,631
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's just, I don't know.

433
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:41,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I want to say you corporate fuckers, even though, you know, GameSpot's okay and all, but, you know, it's just, oh, it just irritates me.

434
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:42,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a leak.

435
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:43,518
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, it's still news.

436
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's still news.

437
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:50,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So the update is supposed to come May 7th, and Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated.

438
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you know this is MSN Messenger.

439
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360.

440
00:22:54,286 --> 00:23:00,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have people who aren't on Xbox Live, you can still communicate to them through MSN Messenger.

441
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:00,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to really

442
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:01,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking to you.

443
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,210
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:50,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, users are now getting inline achievement updates.

445
00:23:50,386 --> 00:23:55,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, um, you're going to be able to see how many points the achievement was, what the achievement is.

446
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know how right now it says, achievement unlocked.

447
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:57,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Do-do!

448
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:58,794
[SPEAKER_06]: A little sound comes up, right?

449
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,056
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually now know what it is you're getting.

450
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get?

451
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when we did something stupid like, what did she, I fell in a manhole five times, why did that unlock an achievement?

452
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,724
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so that's that.

453
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:15,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Low power download mode and auto shutdown for those long movie downloads.

454
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:18,293
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also watch partially downloaded movies now.

455
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,894
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to wait for the whole thing to download.

456
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:26,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that messenger will work with up to six friends at once and other little tweaks on the user interface.

457
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the big spring dashboard update.

458
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:31,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Information leaked to the internet.

459
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds kind of fun.

460
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:36,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the whole, I wish I knew people that actually used MSN Messenger.

461
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:40,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I might get used to that functionality, but as it is, everybody owns AIM.

462
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:41,881
[SPEAKER_06]: You use it, Mandarin?

463
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:43,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Every once in a while.

464
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:51,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a few contacts that are primarily on there, and I just kind of keep it open with Trillion, but don't use too many people on there.

465
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want to talk to me on Xbox while I'm playing Halo?

466
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:58,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to send me messages like, you suck at Halo, Rob.

467
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:00,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck at Halo, Rob.

468
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:02,897
[SPEAKER_03]: No one needs to actually tell you that.

469
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:03,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you already know?

470
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:06,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, yes, I do know.

471
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:07,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I really know.

472
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a fucking joke, people.

473
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I really suck at Halo.

474
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, really bad.

475
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:13,141
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.

476
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:17,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, though, in MSN Messenger, you're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo.

477
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:21,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's going to tell you what game I'm playing so you can stalk me more.

478
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:22,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you want to stalk me, Mandarin?

479
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:24,747
[SPEAKER_06]: She's giving me a funny look.

480
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:26,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there you go.

481
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:27,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Spring dashboard update.

482
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:28,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

483
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,423
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

484
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much as far as video is concerned.

485
00:25:51,172 --> 00:26:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: However, audio, though, if you want some really cool audio, you're not going to be able to use Dolby True HD and DTS HD Master Audio streams.

486
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really a problem, I think, for most people.

487
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:10,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people probably use the HDMI for the video and then digital out for audio.

488
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it's not that big a difference.

489
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:17,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But, if you really want to get down to it, that's a problem for some people, I guess.

490
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:17,977
[SPEAKER_05]: But,

491
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:28,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, other differences include they actually have this new audio lip sync technology.

492
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:31,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know where that would come to play with games.

493
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:40,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Better transfer speeds, and of course if you were outputting above 1080p, which you're not going to be doing right now, at least not anytime soon.

494
00:26:40,912 --> 00:26:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Audio lip sync technology, would that be like, you know how like in Kingdom Hearts, because they didn't bother to re-sync the lips?

495
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Japanese version.

496
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,892
[SPEAKER_06]: The lips are all off sync with the English words.

497
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is that maybe what they're talking about?

498
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:53,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe you can sync that better?

499
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:54,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

500
00:26:56,377 --> 00:27:00,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's basically just audio is really the issue right now.

501
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:02,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

502
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:04,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really think that's a big deal.

503
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:08,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, optical is awesome.

504
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you really are spending the big money for, you know, your system or something.

505
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that'd be a huge deal.

506
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,678
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, you watch it next week.

507
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:22,702
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a press release from Sony saying, well, we support true HD audio.

508
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the fucking next generation.

509
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:26,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are not.

510
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:29,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't wait to see the press release because I know it's going to happen.

511
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:31,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is more HD than your mom.

512
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:33,310
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the press release right there.

513
00:27:35,746 --> 00:27:36,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.

514
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:39,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So, guess what?

515
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some sad news.

516
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:42,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Sniff.

517
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, um, our friends at, uh, Rooster Teeth, which, as far as I understand, was supposed to originally be called Cockbite.

518
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:54,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Rooster Teeth.

519
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:57,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite.

520
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:01,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they are, um, stopping at, uh,

521
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:04,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 100 for Red vs. Blue.

522
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:07,415
[SPEAKER_03]: They posted it on their... You're quitting?

523
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:08,415
[SPEAKER_03]: On their forum.

524
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to know what?

525
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:10,116
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

526
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:12,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it bullshit, because it was posted on April 1st.

527
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:13,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah!

528
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:16,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week, huh?

529
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, and I don't see... I'm looking through the whole thing, and I don't see any type of disclaimer.

530
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

531
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I would bet anything... But I still call it bullshit.

532
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:31,564
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to...

533
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

534
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:53,476
[SPEAKER_06]: But think about this, guys.

535
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:58,158
[SPEAKER_06]: In iTunes, seriously, if you look up video game podcasts, which would you download first?

536
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:02,401
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio or the podcast called Cockbite?

537
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Cockbite Radio.

538
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:05,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

539
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:06,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tempting.

540
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:08,384
[SPEAKER_06]: After five years, we might have to change our name.

541
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:14,488
[SPEAKER_06]: We should just call our show The Naked Lesbian Boobs.

542
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Music and Drug Show or something.

543
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Call it Games, Games, Games, Games, Games.

544
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there already is a show called Games, Games, Games.

545
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many.

546
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:29,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when we started podcasting, like there were like maybe like five video game shows in all.

547
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:31,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We should call it Look Boobies.

548
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,134
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like five video games.

549
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:36,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandra, did you just show your boobs in studio?

550
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:41,100
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like maybe five video game podcasts in all, and now there's like 500.

551
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Stomach.

552
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:43,942
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

553
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,582
[SPEAKER_03]: She flashed her abdomen at you.

554
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:46,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

555
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:51,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

556
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, going on to the Marketplace.

557
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:58,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't there more Red vs. Blue downloadable in the Marketplace?

558
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were going to do all these viral videos and things.

559
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,930
[SPEAKER_06]: They have this whole section in Marketplace for viral videos.

560
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't get Lonely Girl.

561
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get Alanis is My Humps.

562
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:11,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get any of that YouTube stuff on Marketplace.

563
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:16,088
[SPEAKER_05]: They must have the same team in charge of the backwards compatibility updates

564
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:42,670
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo should be like end of April, right?

565
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Ish?

566
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Early May?

567
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:44,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

568
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming in April.

569
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:53,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing that their official release has been the 15th, so, you know, mid-April.

570
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, probably, I'd say late April.

571
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:05,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was just thinking, I can't think of any racing games on the Xbox 360, so I'm really excited to hear we're getting... Project Gotham Racing 3... That's a joke.

572
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:06,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a joke, because there's like 50...

573
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:13,747
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a demo of fucking Forza Motorsports 2, just play Project Gotham Racing 3.

574
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:15,607
[SPEAKER_05]: More or less.

575
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:16,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

576
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,128
[SPEAKER_05]: MotoGP.

577
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:33,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so, as we mentioned earlier, Red Octane, and actually they have admitted to it now, but apparently there's been some issues with the whammy bars on some of the Guitar Hero 2 controllers.

578
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I personally haven't experienced this yet since my game is still in the shrink wrap, but

579
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:43,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I have picked up the guitar and the weighing bar feels a little cheap.

580
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:52,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, so apparently the ones affected by it, there's two SKUs actually that are defective.

581
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is, let's see here.

582
00:31:57,329 --> 00:32:02,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's like a 95055, and then the other one is 95065.

583
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:05,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently you can see... Wait, sorry, sorry.

584
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I just came back in the room and I have my Explorer controller.

585
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,357
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you say now?

586
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:09,017
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I looking for?

587
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:09,097
[SPEAKER_05]: 95055 or 95065.

588
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:10,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck!

589
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:13,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a 95065.

590
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you, Loki.

591
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:24,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You told me this broke-as-fuck Xbox 360 Explorer controller.

592
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:25,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar.

593
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:25,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Pshh.

594
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:28,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to take mine apart.

595
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it back.

596
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know what I want to do?

597
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:43,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get mad props on the internet, and I want to make a distortion pedal, since it can't be that hard to figure out how the fuck that distortion pedal works, since it's just a damn Ethernet cord there.

598
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so yeah, that's what's up.

599
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:55,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they want you to return your guitar and get a new one that's not one of those two models.

600
00:32:56,684 --> 00:33:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't really say what's defective, but if it's giving you crap, that's what you need to do.

601
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:10,073
[SPEAKER_05]: If you bought it from Red Octane, you can contact them, the GIMRMA, or if you purchase it elsewhere, you may need to go bitch them out.

602
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, it's stupid.

603
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:14,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't they test this stuff?

604
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, shouldn't they test these batches?

605
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,842
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's four different types of guitars made, obviously there were some issues or something.

606
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:22,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Why revise the product?

607
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:23,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the whammy bar.

608
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:24,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar.

609
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I'm playing the game, it feels like the whammy bar doesn't register like it should.

610
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:30,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I noticed it.

611
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one.

612
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:34,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell.

613
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it works.

614
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:37,175
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not completely broken.

615
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:40,495
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't do the wah-wah-wah very easily.

616
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:41,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's either on or it's off.

617
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:44,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's kind of what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar to me.

618
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

619
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for selling me a bum Xbox 360 guitar.

620
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:52,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's not my fault.

621
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the launch ones, I think, are like that.

622
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: But why the... This is what I'm saying, though.

623
00:33:56,101 --> 00:34:00,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Why have four different guitar revisions on some product?

624
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:03,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why revise the design four times?

625
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:05,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, what's the big deal?

626
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:09,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless these are coming from four different production factories or something like that.

627
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:13,127
[SPEAKER_06]: One in China, one in Malaysia, one in Hong Kong.

628
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And two of those are fucked up or something.

629
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that two would be broken in the exact same way, but I don't know.

630
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:27,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, iKun is wondering in our chat room, why are there four different guitars anyway?

631
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Kyle Snyder says, why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?

632
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:39,238
[SPEAKER_05]: How about test your product and if it's defective, don't send out hundreds of thousands of them.

633
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:43,661
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, smash it, videotape it, and throw it on the OLR YouTube.

634
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:44,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

635
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:45,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe once I'm done.

636
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:46,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you this.

637
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:54,370
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can unlock all 1,000 achievement points or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero, then I'll smash my controller and put it on YouTube.

638
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,091
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be tons of download content, though.

639
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:57,052
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

640
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, when is some new DDR content coming up?

641
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's just a one song pack.

642
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:02,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hold your breath.

643
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:06,256
[SPEAKER_06]: RedOctane

644
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,682
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 says convert your guitar to a machine gun.

645
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna have it implanted on my leg like Rose McGowan.

646
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's hot.

647
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:48,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's also hot is hell in our FUs of the week.

648
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:49,589
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

649
00:35:50,710 --> 00:36:00,518
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to the line at Marie Callender's this morning when I was standing in it.

650
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:03,560
[SPEAKER_03]: You stood between me and my ex-Benedict bitches.

651
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your FU of the week.

652
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:16,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, FU of the week goes to the movie Premonition, because I knew it sucked, but yet I went to see it because, you know, the wife wanted to see it.

653
00:36:17,728 --> 00:36:20,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that movie is so horrible.

654
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:26,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Sandra Bullock so much, but I gotta admit, I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie.

655
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:30,357
[SPEAKER_05]: The way the character dies at the end is so, like, stupid.

656
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, I just couldn't stop laughing.

657
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:34,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to be in the theater.

658
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:36,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the spoilers, by the way.

659
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:37,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

660
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't see it.

661
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:39,429
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a horrible movie.

662
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:43,612
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to the movie Babel.

663
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:44,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Babel?

664
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:45,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Babel?

665
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:45,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Babel?

666
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:46,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Babel.

667
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:47,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Babel.

668
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I actually really like the movie.

669
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:53,960
[SPEAKER_06]: That was way too many pussy shots for one movie.

670
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the same pussy every time.

671
00:36:56,862 --> 00:37:00,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know that girl's vagina inside and out.

672
00:37:01,073 --> 00:37:06,097
[SPEAKER_06]: In glorious HD high-definition DVD, thanks to my player in Netflix.

673
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:07,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

674
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:11,500
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Mandarin, do you have any FUs of the week?

675
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'd like to say FU to the tweeters who stole our motorcycle now that we, you know, started fixing it.

676
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:26,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, we have to go out and essentially get new bearings, because you ripped the pegs off of that actual motorcycle bike properly.

677
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:27,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So, screw you.

678
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't steal shit, people!

679
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:37,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably the same fuckers who broke into my car like 50 times.

680
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:39,566
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

681
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:43,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to some gaming news, huh?

682
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, if I feel like it.

683
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,934
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to DarkSakura for being a bitch.

684
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:49,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

685
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:51,636
[SPEAKER_03]: People love my bitchiness.

686
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:57,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Marvel Ultimate Alliance has eight downloadable characters on Xbox 360.

687
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:59,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about anything else, just because...

688
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one, but I don't care.

689
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:15,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the downloadable characters effective April 10th are Hulk, Hawkeye, which makes me happy, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, another one of my favorites, Doctor Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth, and Venom.

690
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:16,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Venom is cool.

691
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.

692
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:25,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360, has all their abilities, costumes, dialogue, conversations, achievement points.

693
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool.

694
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:39,107
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't bought the game yet and you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360, I'd wait until next month because they're going to do, just like the Call of Duty 3, a gold edition of it with the characters packed in.

695
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:40,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So save yourself like $10.

696
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just play it on PS3.

697
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:44,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Or buy it used.

698
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Or don't buy it at all.

699
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:49,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be my preference.

700
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:53,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Or come over to my house and bring controllers because we need more people to play with me.

701
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

702
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:55,571
[SPEAKER_06]: But no Wonder Woman?

703
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,271
[SPEAKER_06]: No Wonder Woman.

704
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That's DC Comics, dummy.

705
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:01,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned that last week the hard way.

706
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I just felt like fucking with you.

707
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:03,796
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

708
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:09,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we weren't fucking with you when we told you over and over again that Nights is coming out to the Wii.

709
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:10,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

710
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:12,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Somehow that got confirmed again.

711
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:15,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Like blogs were rerunning the story.

712
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Nights is confirmed yet again.

713
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Journey into Dreams.

714
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, Journey of Dreams.

715
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?

716
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

717
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:51,592
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

718
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Pink!

719
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Pink!

720
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,840
[SPEAKER_05]: and I bet you anything the console colors are coming as well.

721
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,840
[SPEAKER_05]: But my question is though is this.

722
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The controllers aren't out there anyways now.

723
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,901
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it matter if they're in different colors as well?

724
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You still can't get them.

725
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:06,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people are going to be... Silver is such a weird color too for like a controller.

726
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:11,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandarin, you did a little jerk-off motion when you heard this story.

727
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,785
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on the nunchucks and remotes and different colors?

728
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:18,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a remote skin, like the ones like...

729
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

730
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:42,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And your Wiimote has not gotten AIDS.

731
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So good job.

732
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:47,558
[SPEAKER_05]: To clarify this also, this is coming from a European retail list.

733
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:54,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, according to that, it will be shipping on June 29th in the UK.

734
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:58,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not, of course, an official confirmation, but come on!

735
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:02,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course Nintendo's going to do different colored, you know, remotes and stuff.

736
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, the silver, blue, and pink, that's kind of a weird combo of colors there.

737
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:08,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that all the colors of the DS?

738
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:09,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

739
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:11,359
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no silver in this.

740
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:12,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is.

741
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,441
[SPEAKER_06]: The original one was silver.

742
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:14,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

743
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:15,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Silvery.

744
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:16,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Silverish.

745
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:17,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

746
00:42:17,524 --> 00:42:18,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all DS colors.

747
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:19,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Gray.

748
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:20,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

749
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:20,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Gray.

750
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:21,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

751
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:22,289
[SPEAKER_06]: It's silver.

752
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:28,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can all call it what we want to, but that doesn't necessarily make it true.

753
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:36,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something that I think is really stupid... You know, we weren't really supposed to talk about this situation again, but...

754
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:46,296
[SPEAKER_03]: We all remember the woman that drank all the water and, you know, pretty much killed herself.

755
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:47,377
[SPEAKER_06]: How could we forget?

756
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,358
[SPEAKER_06]: We freaking live here.

757
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all over the news for like months.

758
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, basically, they are not filing any criminal charges against the radio station.

759
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:11,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The district attorney basically is quoted saying, Jennifer Strange was an adult who voluntarily participated in the radio contest.

760
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:18,728
[SPEAKER_03]: She knew what the contest involved when she entered it and had the option to stop or discontinue her participation in the contest at any time.

761
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:23,093
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the civil suit is still in process.

762
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And that morning show, though, is still canceled.

763
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:27,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The staffers are fired.

764
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

765
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:30,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And they still haven't replaced it, by the way.

766
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:37,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're still doing that cheesy make your own playlist and come in and DJ for the morning.

767
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:39,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're trying to get people off the street to fill in because they think.

768
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:43,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, seriously, no one will touch that radio station with a 10-foot pole right now.

769
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if I could play my own music, but unfortunately they have a strict guideline.

770
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:50,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually was going to send in an entry for it, but you have to join their little online club.

771
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:52,224
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe I should do that.

772
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:53,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wouldn't that be kind of funny?

773
00:43:53,725 --> 00:44:02,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Loki, we should all send in a playlist and just put Beyonce, My Chemical Romance, I don't know, just put all the Top 40 crap on there and get in there and do it.

774
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:03,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be fun?

775
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,090
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really, because I don't listen to that station.

776
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:06,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

777
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't entirely agree with that statement.

778
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they didn't fully disclose the risks involved with it.

779
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:17,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, she is an adult.

780
00:44:17,564 --> 00:44:19,866
[SPEAKER_05]: If she was feeling sick or whatever, she could bow out.

781
00:44:20,886 --> 00:44:28,310
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they fully explained the risks to them as far as what's involved and what could possibly happen, including death.

782
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all going to come out in the civil lawsuit.

783
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:33,293
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, it's no surprise to me that a criminal...

784
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Charge wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying they were set out to kill someone.

785
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:43,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they were going into this contest thinking, hey, you know what we should do for ratings?

786
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:44,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's kill someone.

787
00:44:44,137 --> 00:44:47,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't think that would work.

788
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:50,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought about it, but you know.

789
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:51,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

790
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:57,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I still think they can get them on negligence just, you know, for not disclosing this stuff.

791
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:02,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hell, if they can get, like, McDonald's on not disclosing that coffee's hot, I mean, they should build it.

792
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:03,949
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a civil lawsuit.

793
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,212
[SPEAKER_06]: The owner of McDonald's did not go to jail for a year because the coffee was hot.

794
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:10,273
[SPEAKER_06]: They should because their fries suck sometimes.

795
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:10,714
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

796
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:15,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And they keep hiring these people that don't speak any English and they always file my orders.

797
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That station will get sued for $11 billion.

798
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:18,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.

799
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.

800
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,063
[SPEAKER_06]: and they will get sold and change their name.

801
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's counting down till the days till that radio station has to change their name.

802
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:28,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we will see the headline on the news.

803
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the end of the end?

804
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:33,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah, wah.

805
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,356
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saving that headline.

806
00:45:36,497 --> 00:45:39,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Saving it.

807
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

808
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:42,203
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well...

809
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:52,635
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for more information on the Jennifer Strange lawsuit stuff, because I know you love and thrive on all that information.

810
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:54,236
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some of us who actually just don't care.

811
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

812
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:56,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I was being facetious.

813
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I have release dates.

814
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,464
[SPEAKER_06]: See, what I was doing was I was buying time while I was pulling up the Japanese release dates, because I was a lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance.

815
00:46:04,984 --> 00:46:09,348
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I can tell you about all these great games coming out to the Japanese market.

816
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also horribly...

817
00:46:11,778 --> 00:46:15,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to me horribly, horribly butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles.

818
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Of which it actually does not seem like there's a whole lot coming out over in Japan this week.

819
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:26,203
[SPEAKER_06]: For PlayStation 2, there's a game called Grim Grimoire, which is coming out.

820
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent on the PlayStation 2 finally gets its way in Japan.

821
00:46:33,406 --> 00:46:36,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, there's a couple titles on the DS.

822
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Watashi no Relaxuma

823
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,747
[SPEAKER_06]: is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS from the Rocket Cup.

824
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Relaxuma sounds fun.

825
00:47:01,507 --> 00:47:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Relaxuma.

826
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:08,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, it looks like, and Jamie, maybe you'd like this, does it look like little bears massaging each other or something?

827
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:09,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

828
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:14,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I don't know, it looks like the old bear is reading and the little bear is walking on his back.

829
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:18,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, some folks used to do that to massage.

830
00:47:18,995 --> 00:47:23,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the bear is going to murder the other bear with that little pointy red flag.

831
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to play with his... He's like, I...

832
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I call this land in the name of France and stab them through the temple.

833
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:32,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

834
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:34,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So really not an exciting week in Japan, sorry.

835
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:41,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're looking for excitement in the United States, well, sorry.

836
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:43,264
[SPEAKER_05]: You better wait until next week.

837
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:48,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, there is one good game coming out this week, Super Paper Mario, on the Wii.

838
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it, to be honest.

839
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:53,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a couple PSP games coming out.

840
00:47:53,928 --> 00:47:54,708
[SPEAKER_05]: None worth mentioning.

841
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:57,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that is your week.

842
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:59,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So buy Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii.

843
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:00,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

844
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:02,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha.

845
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:06,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC.

846
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:07,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That game looks awesome.

847
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that supposed to come out last week?

848
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:09,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

849
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week.

850
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:16,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just a really, really sad week.

851
00:48:17,638 --> 00:48:21,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's really not looking much better for the UK.

852
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:21,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We have...

853
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear is coming out.

854
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:24,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good game.

855
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Godfather of the Dawns Edition on PS3.

856
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Gurumin, A Monstrous Adventure on the PSP.

857
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:39,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvest Moon DS, Hotel Dusk Room 215, Pokemon Ranger, and Wing Island on Wii.

858
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Hotel Dusk Room 215 will do better, like in Europe.

859
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Rob, guess what?

860
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:45,480
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

861
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:45,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart.

862
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:16,774
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what game I saw a video for that kind of made it look fun to play?

863
00:49:17,614 --> 00:49:19,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Cabela's African Safari.

864
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: They have it where you can go into bullet time as you're diving towards a lion or something like that and you can snipe lions in the head.

865
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they already said in Africa you're not going to be hunting animals.

866
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:40,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is like the one reason I would buy the game.

867
00:49:40,598 --> 00:49:45,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be awesome if it's resistance in Africa and you're just blowing crap up.

868
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Africa.

869
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:49,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well.

870
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:57,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of games we won't be seeing anytime soon, because I don't know about you, I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa since E3.

871
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:59,632
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon.

872
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:00,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother 3.

873
00:50:01,073 --> 00:50:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

874
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to pour salt in the wounds, guess what Nintendo did this week?

875
00:50:06,138 --> 00:50:09,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo posted the soundtrack on iTunes.

876
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:12,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, not the Japanese store.

877
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:16,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually get the Mother 3 soundtrack in the US store.

878
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can download some of the songs from Mother 3.

879
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what's this Mandarin?

880
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:23,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a game release?

881
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:27,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Salmon Max Episode 5 is going to be released Thursday.

882
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:30,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that already out?

883
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:31,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Episode 5 came out.

884
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:32,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it did too.

885
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it already released on Thursday.

886
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:37,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on GameTap.

887
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Because GameTap does roll out their new games on Thursday.

888
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:46,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a friend who was playing it, but I think this friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do on GameTap.

889
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:47,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he's special.

890
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You getting told?

891
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:51,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom's telling you?

892
00:50:51,852 --> 00:51:02,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well anyway, if you are waiting for Sam and Max or just don't have GameTap and you want to download some music from Mother 3, you can download such gems as We Miss You, The Theme of Love.

893
00:51:24,023 --> 00:51:26,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Slow jams of Earthbound.

894
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Lame.

895
00:51:26,985 --> 00:51:30,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why anyone would want to be interested in that stupid game.

896
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:39,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are rabid fucking Mother fans out there on the internet that will download anything that remotely has to do with Mother.

897
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to have a whole cluster from some... There was some website dedicated to Mother in the Earthbound series, and I can't remember the name of it.

898
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:49,982
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was a period of time when there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show.

899
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you remember that?

900
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:51,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

901
00:51:52,628 --> 00:51:54,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, God, you don't care about our listeners, do you?

902
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:56,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, fine.

903
00:51:56,191 --> 00:51:56,672
[SPEAKER_06]: New story.

904
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:57,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

905
00:51:59,034 --> 00:51:59,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, DarkTetsuya.

906
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:00,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Starman.net.

907
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

908
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:11,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Miyamoto, of course, inspired by PlayStation Home, wants to expand the world of the Miis.

909
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, he wants to do more things with them, including have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them.

910
00:52:21,397 --> 00:52:27,541
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you start by, I don't know, giving third-party companies access to put Miis in their game?

911
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:29,723
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be a good way to expand the experience.

912
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:40,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, I don't know, how about do something a little bit more than just have them wandering around their little white existence in there.

913
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:46,714
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, he plans on seeing a vast virtual world with the Miis.

914
00:52:48,183 --> 00:52:54,948
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not starting too well with the, was it that Vote For Your Favorite Me channel that's supposed to be coming out eventually?

915
00:52:55,828 --> 00:52:56,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

916
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:57,489
[SPEAKER_05]: A Mare Me Can Idol?

917
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:01,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Sanjaya Me?

918
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

919
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:06,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway.

920
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:08,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

921
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,179
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes me kind of sad.

922
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Because our dear hero...

923
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:26,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Nomura Tetsuya is not affiliated with the new Kingdom Hearts coming out.

924
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, but we saw that trailer last week, right?

925
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:35,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least it was tacked on at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix or whatever?

926
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:37,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going on without him or what?

927
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:45,160
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's basically telling a Dengeki PlayStation is, and this is a quote, first, it's not Kingdom Hearts 3.

928
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:48,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, because we're calling it a new series, it won't be Kingdom Hearts 3.

929
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:53,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's a series, so it won't be just one title.

930
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:59,330
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying that basically he's working on a different story.

931
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:01,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

932
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the next Kingdom Hearts.

933
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,954
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a spin-off of the Kingdom Hearts series.

934
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:06,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Online.

935
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:06,895
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO.

936
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: MMO.

937
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:08,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet.

938
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:09,435
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hot.

939
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:09,915
[SPEAKER_03]: MMO.

940
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I would totally quit World of Warcraft for that.

941
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:13,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

942
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I think here's what it is.

943
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:17,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series without Disney.

944
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:19,881
[SPEAKER_06]: But why?

945
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:22,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts in the first place.

946
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

947
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:30,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we all play it for the Roxas and Axel slash.

948
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:30,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

949
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens.

950
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:35,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

951
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Dustcap 2 makes it funny in chat.

952
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Kingdom Hearts X1.

953
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Mega Man, get it?

954
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Har.

955
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Laugh.

956
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:45,661
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

957
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:49,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is also leaving a lot of people with a, huh?

958
00:54:49,462 --> 00:54:53,503
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of look, is that Resident Evil 4 has been confirmed for the Wii.

959
00:54:54,563 --> 00:55:01,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, yes, that's Resident Evil 4, the game that you could already play with your GameCube backwards compatibility.

960
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:03,333
[SPEAKER_06]: will now be coming out on the Wii.

961
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:09,078
[SPEAKER_06]: This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube games, they could easily redo them for the Wii with the new functionality.

962
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here it is in motion right here.

963
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:17,165
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to now be able to, obviously you use the Wii controls as part of the game.

964
00:55:17,466 --> 00:55:23,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll have widescreen support, although I believe the old one had widescreen support as well, but I guess now you can get progressive scan and all that good stuff.

965
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, couldn't the old one do progressive scan as well?

966
00:55:27,415 --> 00:55:28,236
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

967
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Some interactive event scenes use the Wii buttons.

968
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:54,278
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to shake the Wii mode in part of it.

969
00:55:55,158 --> 00:56:04,004
[SPEAKER_06]: The producer of the Wii version was talking to Famitsu Magazine and said that they want to allow families who play the Wii together to experience Resident Evil.

970
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, no more chainsaw your face off, I guess.

971
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:10,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're going to have to do something about that.

972
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:14,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are going to be easy and amateur difficulty settings to make the game a little bit easier.

973
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:19,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the bonus elements from the PlayStation 2 will be in the Wii release.

974
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:24,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can do the Ada sequence, the Another Order sequence.

975
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:27,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, I guess, something that you didn't have on your backwards compatibility.

976
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:35,398
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have to do something about Chainsaw Man taking off your head, though, for the family play.

977
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,880
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to really need to do something like that, about that.

978
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:41,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, that's funny.

979
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, he gives you flowers.

980
00:56:43,725 --> 00:56:44,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Resident Evil Family Edition.

981
00:56:47,401 --> 00:57:00,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so, yeah, I think it's funny, though, that they were saying that, you know, you can redo some of the old GameCube games, because I think most of the games that have come out recently, especially by Ubisoft, are just old GameCube games that have been ported over to the Wii.

982
00:57:01,316 --> 00:57:03,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Super Paper Mario, to some extent, is that.

983
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:04,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, they went back and reworked it.

984
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Twilight Princess.

985
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Twilight Princess, perfect example.

986
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:06,841
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

987
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:14,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Prince of Persia 2 Hot damn, when do you think we're going to get a Wii game that was actually made for the Wii?

988
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:17,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube game they were thinking about too?

989
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I think they were probably actually doing for the Wii Prince of Persia Rival Swords A lot of the stuff that's been out Bionicle Heroes that's coming out, that was a GameCube title Open Season, a lot of the movie tie-in stuff I don't know, it's just bad

990
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:38,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Even... Anyways.

991
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:43,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of our chatroom, by the way, is coming up with new slogans and commercials for Resident Evil 4.

992
00:57:43,348 --> 00:57:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, that, We would like to play.

993
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:46,370
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing there.

994
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:51,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Bandit has come up with some new taglines, including, We die together.

995
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And, We would like to kill you.

996
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

997
00:57:56,217 --> 00:57:56,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Free marketing.

998
00:57:57,397 --> 00:57:57,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

999
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:00,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1000
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:07,084
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a rumor that mass shortage... Or, mass storage is coming to the Wii.

1001
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:07,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1002
00:58:07,988 --> 00:58:17,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, although, unfortunately, I think this rumor has been squashed because it had to do with a press release by a company called ESOL Middleware.

1003
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:30,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they have, uh, basically a FAT driver, uh, for the file system, and there's another driver for USB host stuff, which apparently is already being implemented into the Wii.

1004
00:58:30,485 --> 00:58:34,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is probably not the case, uh, for right now.

1005
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: They said it was for the, um,

1006
00:58:37,674 --> 00:58:46,224
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura might use that mass storage device to save her favorite websites she visits when surfing the internet.

1007
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:00,629
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com, home of pterodactyl porn.

1008
00:59:00,649 --> 00:59:01,949
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs nothing else said about it.

1009
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:02,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Pornotube.com.

1010
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: pterodactyl porn.

1011
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:32,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Children, ask your parents for permission.

1012
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: You want pterodactyl porn.

1013
00:59:35,749 --> 00:59:36,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Adults only.

1014
00:59:39,332 --> 00:59:40,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not count mental state of adult life.

1015
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:42,194
[SPEAKER_06]: What's been up with your website of the week lately?

1016
00:59:42,214 --> 00:59:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: They've all been like X-rated.

1017
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:49,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea, because it's like... Someone's been thinking about sex.

1018
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,461
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1019
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:55,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's been, um... busy.

1020
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:58,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Saikun says, why don't we just make this Rob's website of the week?

1021
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will think of an original website of the week next week.

1022
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:02,732
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1023
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:04,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise.

1024
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:06,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, DarkSakura frequents the porno tube.

1025
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:09,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she's not afraid to get down with the porno tube.

1026
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1027
01:00:11,418 --> 01:00:23,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of... We talked about GameTap earlier in the show and kind of how... I guess Mandarin clarified that it was on the private server, the new Sam & Max, but it will be released to the public this Thursday.

1028
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:24,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's cool.

1029
01:00:24,867 --> 01:00:27,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else that's there hidden away, tucked away...

1030
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:30,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently some Sega Saturn games are in there.

1031
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a game called Bug that shows up.

1032
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:34,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was lame, by the way.

1033
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:38,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but nevertheless, it was on the Sega Saturn, and it's there in GameTap.

1034
01:00:39,128 --> 01:00:41,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently there's some Easter Egg games.

1035
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of a promotion GameTap's doing.

1036
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:44,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't logged into GameTap in a while.

1037
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:46,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it, but I haven't used it in a while.

1038
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done it since I did my week on Myst Online a while back.

1039
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's some other games hidden away, too, but those haven't come to light yet.

1040
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:55,312
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1041
01:00:56,644 --> 01:01:04,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that some sharp-eyed folks have noticed is that if you look at the controls in the game, the controls actually mention the shift key.

1042
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:08,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it possible this is just a PC version of Bug that's tucked away?

1043
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:13,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So, don't know yet if this means that there are actually Saturn games coming.

1044
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:21,072
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega's been a big supporter of GameTap because, you know, you have a lot of Genesis games and Master System games.

1045
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:23,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And hell, you have Dreamcast games in there.

1046
01:01:23,753 --> 01:01:24,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not Saturn?

1047
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:25,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense.

1048
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,327
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD.

1049
01:01:33,368 --> 01:01:38,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Seg in chat says, GameTap has included the Sega Saturn emulator, so you'll get more Saturn games later.

1050
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:41,730
[SPEAKER_06]: GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator.

1051
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:42,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.

1052
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:43,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1053
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:44,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1054
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:53,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of emulating stuff, a game called Piano Hero on the PC.

1055
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:54,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guy's making it.

1056
01:01:55,655 --> 01:02:09,803
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's basically a freeware open source project that lets people with MIDI capable keyboards play any MIDI file as if it were like a Guitar Hero style track or think back to, I don't know, Keyboard Mania.

1057
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Activision has now sent a cease and desist order to the guy behind it, Nicholas, looks like he got a peach done, and

1058
01:02:24,065 --> 01:02:52,386
[SPEAKER_05]: well basically the only thing he has to do which is not too bad is he has to change the name because they want to make sure that people aren't getting confused that it's an actual official Activision product or something like that so he can keep on making the game as long as he names it something else I don't know, that's not bad you know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though I don't know does he really have to change the name?

1059
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, basically they've sent, you know, cease and desist.

1060
01:02:56,252 --> 01:03:00,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, no, no, I'm not saying based on cease and desist, but do they really have the legal right to make them change the name?

1061
01:03:00,895 --> 01:03:01,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1062
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:06,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe unless they're, you know, they have something, um, you know, coming out.

1063
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:07,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1064
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:16,646
[SPEAKER_05]: It says among the various products, uh, Activision publishes, um, are Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2 video games.

1065
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It says as such, Activision is the owner of certain intellectual property rights, including Guitar Hero franchise and

1066
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:26,926
[SPEAKER_05]: including but not limited to the trademark guitar hero.

1067
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:30,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, blah, blah, blah.

1068
01:03:30,149 --> 01:03:30,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1069
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:33,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see exactly what it is.

1070
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:45,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, it comes to attention that you've been using the name Piano Hero in connection with your game that you designed for Halite Studios where it includes a printout of your website showing such.

1071
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:50,806
[SPEAKER_05]: In our opinion, your use of the name Piano Hero constitutes a...

1072
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:59,129
[SPEAKER_05]: at least trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition with the respect to the trademark guitar hero.

1073
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1074
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:05,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get named similarly all the time.

1075
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:10,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when it comes to a lot of puzzle games.

1076
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:10,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1077
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:12,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to think here.

1078
01:04:12,398 --> 01:04:13,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a perfect example.

1079
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:17,961
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a movie studio out there that does knock-off movies like Snakes on a Train.

1080
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:18,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Or...

1081
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:22,252
[SPEAKER_05]: for the new Transformers movie, Transmorphers.

1082
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,113
[SPEAKER_06]: See, there you go.

1083
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:24,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1084
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:24,973
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1085
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:25,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great example.

1086
01:04:26,694 --> 01:04:26,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1087
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:32,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Landmine Fairy suggests Keyboard Villain as a possible name to replace Guitar Villain.

1088
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:33,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they already license Guitar Villain?

1089
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:34,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Not officially.

1090
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:40,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's been licensed, but there's no game out on the market yet, which, by the way, that's one of my favorite chatroom names ever is Landmine Fairy.

1091
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Bandit makes a good suggestion.

1092
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:45,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to GuitarHero.com.

1093
01:04:45,885 --> 01:04:49,088
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a site for action figures not associated with Activision.

1094
01:04:49,448 --> 01:04:51,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They should sue Activision ASAP.

1095
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:52,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1096
01:04:52,631 --> 01:04:53,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Turnabout fair play, right?

1097
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:54,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1098
01:04:56,914 --> 01:05:07,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Or how about, I don't know, the fact that I would say it's infringing more on keyboard mania than, you know, at least that game actually exists.

1099
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:13,447
[SPEAKER_06]: AlphaCanonGram suggests a name that will probably sell more copies of the game.

1100
01:05:13,803 --> 01:05:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Piano Pornostar.

1101
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:16,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Piano Pornostar.

1102
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:18,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Piano Pornostar is a pretty awesome name.

1103
01:05:19,027 --> 01:05:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Piano Cockbite.

1104
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, we're going to bring Part A to a close here.

1105
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:27,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, real quick.

1106
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:29,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandarin, you wanted to give a special shout-out, right?

1107
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:30,415
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't been saying much this segment anyway.

1108
01:05:30,435 --> 01:05:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give a special shout-out to Seg in the chat room.

1109
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:37,760
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a friend of mine currently in Boston.

1110
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,841
[SPEAKER_02]: He was working at Inverson.

1111
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:40,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerson College.

1112
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: He just got a job at Telltale Games out in San Rafael.

1113
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:54,435
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be being the new build engineer for all the Sam & Max episodes from this point, once he starts there from this point forward.

1114
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:57,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe he starts next week or the following week.

1115
01:06:00,029 --> 01:06:02,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we see something a while back about Sam and Max?

1116
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,614
[SPEAKER_06]: They were trying to hire people to port it to Xbox Live or something.

1117
01:06:05,634 --> 01:06:07,616
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a job posting on the internet.

1118
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Did your friend get that job?

1119
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:09,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

1120
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:10,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Kinda?

1121
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:11,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorta?

1122
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:12,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like it?

1123
01:06:13,522 --> 01:06:14,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh, interesting.

1124
01:06:14,743 --> 01:06:15,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's still cool.

1125
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:17,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he will have to come on the show later if he can.

1126
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, there might be NDAs at the Wazoo.

1127
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:23,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So, get your friend to come to our show because Sam and Max is pretty cool.

1128
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:28,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Part B tonight, we're bringing back an old favorite.

1129
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:31,353
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play some match game in Part B tonight.

1130
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:34,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means we need to get some contestants during the break.

1131
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:36,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take one on the Skype line later.

1132
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:37,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't call yet.

1133
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:38,698
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take one on the Skype line when we actually do the game.

1134
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need a chatroom contestant.

1135
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:44,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So to find a chatroom contestant, we always ask a trivia question live here on the program.

1136
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:46,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is tonight's trivia question.

1137
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be talking about a new game in Part B tonight called Rock Band.

1138
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, a lot of you guys have heard about this.

1139
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But Rock Band was not the first game that would allow you to put together a full band.

1140
01:06:58,962 --> 01:07:05,705
[SPEAKER_06]: There was actually an arcade series, and I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program for a long time now, you know these games very well.

1141
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:12,948
[SPEAKER_06]: There used to be three games that would all session together to form your own band so you could play games at the arcade.

1142
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:13,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Name them.

1143
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:17,730
[SPEAKER_06]: First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat.

1144
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a message to Sky in chat room with the name of the three games.

1145
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1146
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
