00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and what you, the gamer, really want to know

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I like Frappuccinos

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I like the new Cinnamon Dulce one

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Dulce

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me, Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought that was wrong, I thought it was Dulce

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's like, um, Versace

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I guess so, that's probably true

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Nice reference to my favorite movie ever, love it

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought you would appreciate that

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Lounge Radio, Loki!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm just kidding, I don't know, I had to work in a showgirl's segue somehow

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl, but

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well then showboy

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alright, well say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl, I'm not sure, are you gonna get topless for us tonight?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, say hello to Amanda

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hi

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How are you?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm good, how are you?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Good, now you haven't been on the, I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long long time, right?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Very little brief snippets

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't forget you gotta almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Alright, very good, very good

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right? Have you?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've been out there

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like, briefly

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners, what type of video games do you like?

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I like the Wii

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You like the Wii?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wii!

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I like puzzle games, that's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What have you been playing on your Wii lately?

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Uh, WarioWare

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WarioWare?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's a fun game

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Um, like, the Bubble Bobble, or the thing where you shoot the little marbles up at the-

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Bubble Bobble, you're barely getting picked up, sweetie, you can see yourself in-

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sorry

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right, Bubble Bobble

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bubble Bobble, yes

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sounds good

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's Puzzle Bobble

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide-

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bust a Move

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alright

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I also like bar games, like the little, like, where you put a quarter in and you get a game and you have to, like-

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, like the touch screen games at the bars?

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's an arcade game that's very popular that people don't talk about very often

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Those little, what do they call that, the Quartermaster, what are those things called?

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Touch Something?

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Touch Master, I think

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Touch Master, I don't know what the hell they're called

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Like the one where you have to, like, where you have to get, like, all the groups of, like, two or three or more color blocks and reduce them

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I like that, like the blockus, or no, I don't know if it's blockus, something

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright, sounds like fun

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, welcome to the show

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're in our-

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mega Touch

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're in our chat room under your-

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Omega Touch, thank you, whoever, who said that in chat?

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That was, um-

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Dark Tetsuya

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good man, Dark Tetsuya

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry, I thought it said D Teaser

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm like, what do you, what's the D that you're teasing?

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, um, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on the Sunday night, chat.orangelaungeradio.com

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And, uh, Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight, she'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As she deems appropriate

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Alright, um, let's go around and talk about our gaming weeks, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Pretty non-existent given that I was, um, doing my, uh, last few, uh, massages this week

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Um, I actually did finish my final on Tuesday, and, um, however, I am getting back into, uh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance because, um, Deadpool is awesome

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Um, I, uh, for anyone who has access to my live journal, I put a, uh, link up there of, like, the funniest thing ever

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Um, and I've been, um, screaming at our Twilight Zone pinball machine, like, loudly, because, um, I don't know, the machine's a bastard

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Rob's got tea

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sorry, I stepped out for a minute, we can do that in radio, what, I heard you lost your balls over the week?

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I see

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, um, I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there, got into the zone, you know

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, those balls

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, don't touch the door thing

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'd get in the zone and then drain

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So, your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And Deadpool

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics, too

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Um, I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2070

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
God, this is gonna become the new, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because it's fun and stupid

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, let's put it this way, there's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game, I mean, you can fly up, it's like, 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground, fine

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just, you know, like nothing happened, helicopter will land down there and do it again

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Um, so I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, easy on it

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can do two player co-op

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, there you go

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And it's a lot of fun, really the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And, um, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on the easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels, um, and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So, you can actually get one weapon, it's called the genocide gun, that does a million damage, like, to an area of like 72 meters or whatever

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's just, you really have to watch out launching that thing because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Unfortunately you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Um, other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of, what was it, um, uh, Honeycomb Beats, yeah, and that was okay, I'm not very interested in it though, not my thing

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Was that why you gave me your copy?

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sweet! I got free games from Loki today

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yay!

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then, um

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now I just have to find my DS, I seriously cannot find my DS

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I played, um, played Crackdown a bit, that was kind of fun, um, I played another game, which I can't talk about though right now, due to an NDA, but it wasn't as fun as it would seem

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait a minute, when did Loki start listening to NDAs on this program? This is something, what happened?

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't think this stuff wasn't associated with an NDA right now

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, it's a game for the Xbox Live, um, or not the Xbox Live, the games for Windows Live Beta, they're doing that cross-

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Lawsuit

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Cross play thing, and there's a game you play to test it, and it's stupid, but

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't want you to get sued

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Either way though, it's neat, I guess, I was, and the leaderboards for it though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Should, um, come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will, cause they start doing the commentary

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I like jumping, my name is Bob, and I like to jump

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's the whole theme of Crackdown by the way, is to jump everywhere you go

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wow

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Jump a lot

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like at the top of bridges and stuff

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That part was fun

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And then, um, I don't know, just pure killing people

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I like the jumping

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Looking at some comments from Chatroom, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Uh, JeremyTau1 says, hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
They do have like a versus mode in that, I don't know how well that would be

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ion671 says, it is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And JeremyTau1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Too many

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Alright, there you go

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Um, my gaming week, I played a game called, uh, what was it?

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Tidepool Explorer

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because I went to the Monterey Aquarium

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Because William took me to Monterey this weekend and it surprised me with a nice little weekend thing

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So we went to Monterey and um, and you know, it got me thinking like

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They got these cool little educational things for kids

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Uh, like you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Remember that, Rocky's Boots, and what were the other MECC games?

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oregon Trail, I guess

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Number Munchers

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Number Munchers, hell yeah

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like, oh, I'm gonna write this whole Nostalgia article for the community all-game site

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Turtle

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Turtle?

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, or what was that, what was the language? Logo?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Was that the language they made us all learn in like third grade?

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We had the turtle?

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like, drop pen, 30 north or something

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Um, so yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was the little game where you walk

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But it was like, it was like you had two screens

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like, they had four people playing it at once

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And you had this big screen in the middle

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And then you had a little screen right in front of you

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like an old, uh, picture one of those, um, what do they call them?

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tabletop, like Ms. Pac-Man?

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What do they call those games back in the day when they had the, is it just tabletop?

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cocktail?

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Cocktail, it was like a cocktail machine

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And uh, yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the tidepools

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Um, pick up, you know, uh, so you could like pick up the shell

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or you could, you know, throw away, like if you found a trash can you could throw it away

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to like

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tidepools and what you can't

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So it's just kind of neat

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This old stingray will stab you through the heart

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Crikey! Um, but yeah, William commented, I know he was like

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, that looks like a DS game, and it kind of was

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Usually when I see educational games I try to figure out how to break them, but you know

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And then we saw, we saw, um, um, penguins

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And that made me very happy, not a video game, like actual live penguins

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That made me very happy, that's why we went to the aquarium in the first place

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We need to get you like your own copy of Portable Pango

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, I love Pango, that's one of my favorite games, it's a good game

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Alright, it's on that Konami game thing

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is it really? Sweet!

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh wait, not Puyen, Puyen's different

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, maybe it's Puyen

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, Puyen's way different, Puyen's like the free little pig

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Puyen's like the dumb little bubble game

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, I had that when I was 64

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wait, I don't know, it says on the back

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Pango was a Sega game, wasn't it? I took it in my room

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wasn't Pango a Sega game?

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Maybe it was

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think it was

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Um, now I've got to find out

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Nah

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Alright, anywho, uh, let's see, what else?

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, but so actual games I really did play, uh, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, hello

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Pango is by Sega

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you, um, was that from Wikipedia? Or from chat?

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No, it was from Google

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Alright, sweet

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Um, Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the Playstation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I knew to wait and not buy it on Playstation 2, so it's been a long time since I've played Guitar Hero

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because the first one kind of wore off for me

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2, it's fun

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know, I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs, and there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But, you know, it's cool

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child in mind

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, come on, like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero 2?

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It does have a animation thing in the beginning, I don't know if it's the same as commercial

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Where they're, like, uh, fighting off a meteor or something like that?

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not sure, but there's unlockable videos, I haven't unlocked them yet though

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That was awesome, that actually kind of would make me want to buy the game, because it's kind of badass

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, Guitar Hero 2 is fun

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Graphics, obviously a step up from the Playstation 2 because it supports widescreen

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The controller itself works pretty good

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
My whammy bar seems screwy, but now I'm hearing there's a recall

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I bet you anything I got one of those guitars

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I did

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Did you really?

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I haven't played it yet, so

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Shit

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We'll check mine live on air a little later

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you have one, I probably have one too, because ours came from the same place

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, they basically said it was, like, two different versions of it or something

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's, like, I think it's something probably easy to fix, but, you know

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I knew my whammy bar seemed screwy for some reason, but anyway

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But, uh, yeah, I mean, there's lots of stuff to unlock

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I like the leaderboards

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I hear a lot of people saying they can't do online co-op though

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They can't do online co-op because, heaven forbid, lag gets in the game

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But then I'm thinking, well, DDR kind of has online co-op, and that works, even with the lag

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean, granted, guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you wouldn't be able to really, I mean, that would be the lagged part

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Whereas DDR, you know, the way DDR gets away with it

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is it kind of shows you the steps with, or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're playing your own game

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I think they could do it

268
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They just would have to get creative with how the music track plays

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know what I mean?

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When you screw up, it goes, you know, those little things

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well then they have, like, amplitude online

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have to displace those

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And where you could do co-op with amplitude and stuff like that

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm almost positive they did

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, they had amplitude

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I'm pretty sure it can be done

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know

279
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
DevilKai in chat says

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It does seem like the pick is a little bit different

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you're getting lag, I would urge you to go into the video options

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hit start and go into the video options

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And you can actually calibrate your screen

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Because some HDTVs have the lag

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because of the upscaling or whatever it does

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You really shouldn't have that on an Xbox 360 though

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because it has a native HD signal

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I know either way

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you're getting screwy lag

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can go in and calibrate it

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But it's a little hard to find

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You wouldn't know that unless you read the manual

297
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So check that out

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Anyway, Guitar Hero 2, I do recommend it

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Especially if you don't already own the PS2 version

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's good times

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's kind of expensive though

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If you already own the PS2 version

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You might want to question how important is it to you to have it on next gen

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because I don't know

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Granted, there's a couple new songs

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Some slightly prettier graphics and the whole online leaderboards

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, speaking of achievement points real quick

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There's some really screwy ones in there

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You fail a song on easy and get 10 points

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You play a left-handed song and get 10 points

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You beat tutorial and get 10 points

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It seems like some of the scores are mis-weighted

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think if you fail a song on easy

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It should be one of those ghost achievements

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Where it's just on your record

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's zero gamer score

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Or Dead or Alive has one too

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think if you lose 10 battles in a row

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That goes on your gamer card

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But you don't get any gamer points for it

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Beat a song, perfect

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Because you only get 10 points for getting a perfect 100% on a song

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Might have been 10 or 30

328
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But it just seems some of the scores are mis-weighted

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's what you get for having 50 achievements in a damn game

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But that's kind of cool

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because I'd rather have that than 10 achievements

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That are really hard or really easy

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You know what I mean?

334
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It feels a little spread out having the 50

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
To me

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But anyway

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Alright, Mandarin

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because they already talked about games

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Are there any games specifically this week you've been into?

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We wound up playing doctor and nurse

342
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, you mean video games?

343
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Video games, sweetie, video games

344
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Tom beat Zelda finally

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I watched him beat it, sort of

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was in and out of the room

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sweet

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Other than that we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Heck yeah, I want that too

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's pretty much about it right now

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Since we've just been busy with other things

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like fucking?

355
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like fixing my bike

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
My motorcycle

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Fixing your bike

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Do you ride a bike to work?

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, not yet

361
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you going to ride a bike to work?

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Once I get my license

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's something we saw at E3 a couple of years ago

365
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's a little exercise bike but it's a game

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Where it's on the street

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But the graphics were kind of horrible if I remember right

368
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It looked like

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
God, what was that Sega Master System game?

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think it came with every Sega system

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That was like a motorcycle game

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't remember

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Hang on?

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, it was Hang On

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It looked like Hang On to me

376
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Alright

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
DarkShyInChat says Dr. Mario and Peach Live

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is that what your house is like, Amanda?

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Dr. Mario and Peach Live?

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Alright

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm looking at chat

384
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Also talking about the achievements

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Blaze says

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Microsoft does regulate it to some extent

390
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?

391
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think 50 is the max and they raised it up to 50

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Did they?

393
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Interesting

394
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's see

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
JeremyTod1 says

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think they should have negative achievements

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That would be interesting

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But I do think having the ghost achievement points is kind of cool

400
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Like the ones that are worth nothing

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That are just stuck on your gamer card

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You have fallen down a hole, champagne

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Alright

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's see, anyway

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's go to some housekeeping for tonight

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't really have a lot

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So I will just say

408
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Please listen to our spinoff programming

409
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
DarkSakura was unable to pump up the volume this week

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Because Comcast went down, right?

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes, it did

412
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But it turned out that it was just a temporary

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Alright, so Tuesday nights

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can listen to DarkSakura take your request

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
7pm or 7.30?

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can never remember

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
7.30

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
7.30pm Pacific, right here on orangelauncherady.com

420
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Wednesday nights, guys on the show

421
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
7 o'clock Pacific time

422
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thursday nights, STFU

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Also at 7 o'clock Pacific time

424
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is there still a club, OLR?

425
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There is

426
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There is, I put new episodes up there

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Or reruns

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Club OLR has been getting low ratings

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So we're thinking of moving it

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And putting something else on Friday nights

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But if you want to save Club OLR

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Friday nights at 7 o'clock

433
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings

434
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We'll see

435
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, that's right, your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No, what about your shows?

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, that's true, one of my shows did

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's just the excuse

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The first case of the Mondays

441
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, it's internet radio, people

442
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We have low ratings anyway

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We don't care

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But we always use that as an excuse

445
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The thing is, it takes a long time

446
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
To create that damn show

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And wife doesn't like that

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's awesome, and unfortunately you can't broadcast it

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, I was working on stuff

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was actually doing a happy hardcore one

452
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But I stopped

453
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For some reason

454
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I ran out of material

455
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's see what happens

456
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's see, Saturday at 7 o'clock Pacific

457
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Is Travis Donovan Live

458
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Our old buddy from Understation Live does his own show

459
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No, he cancelled it

460
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I heard about that

461
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I heard there was a really nasty April Fools joke

462
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He had people calling in, like, crying in the whole works

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It was awesome

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then he said, screw you, April Fools

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What a little bastard

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Listen to that little bastard, Travis Donovan

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
On Saturday nights at 7 Pacific

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Welcome to tonight's gaming news

469
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll start it off

470
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Talking about the Xbox 360

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Some information has leaked

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
About the spring dashboard update

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And this leak comes to you

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Courtesy of GameSpot

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Good job, guys

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, I'm sure it was really leaked

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It wasn't a planned release or something

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm totally sure that was

479
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, probably the article went up a couple days before it was supposed to

480
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I imagine

481
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight

482
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And that was going to be it

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh wait, no, I think actually he's off because of Easter

484
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I've been following him on Twitter

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have a Twitter account now

486
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I could be like Major Nelson and Gamer Andy

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because I want to be cool like them

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something

489
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's kind of a stalker site

490
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Which kind of worries me

491
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So I don't post about things as I'm doing them

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I post about things after the fact

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know what I mean?

494
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's really the cheesy thing

495
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It asks, what are you doing right now?

496
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're supposed to type in what you're doing right now

497
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
For instance, I think the last thing I put

498
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Is I'm listening to the new Bjork song

499
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
While I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight

500
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're supposed to use 140 characters or less

501
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update

502
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Or IM to update

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So it's kind of interesting

504
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only 150 characters

505
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So it forces you to be quick

506
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know, it's weird

507
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I've been following him on there

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What are you doing right now?

511
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm updating my Twitter account

512
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you doing right now?

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm updating my Twitter account

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Alright

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's twitter.com.sky

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
How did we get on that?

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The spring dashboard update

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?

519
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because I bet you anything this is totally planned

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Fucking corporate

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They pay good money to leak the stories

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I mean, I say this

524
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The corporate website does not leak stories, okay?

525
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's not a leak

526
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's a fucking planned PR thing

527
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's disguised as a leak

528
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Because there's...no

529
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry

530
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know

531
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I want to say you corporate fuckers

532
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Even though GameSpot's okay and all

533
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It just irritates me

534
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's still news

535
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So the update is supposed to come May 7th

536
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated

537
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Some of you know this is MSM Messenger

538
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So if you have people who aren't on

540
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Xbox Live

541
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You can still communicate to them through MSM Messenger

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because they know most people use AIM

543
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So they're trying to really take a step up

544
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think with MSM Messenger

545
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And what was interesting about that

546
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Is I saw in the video that they had posted

547
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That you can actually push the button

548
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And use Messenger during a game

549
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Like you could be playing a game

550
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And you know how like right now you can bring up the sidebar

551
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And send messages on Xbox Live and all that

552
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well you can bring up like a little chat window

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And chat with people right in the middle of the game

554
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So that's kind of interesting

555
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sorry I could be winning my game

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But instead I got a pop-up coming

557
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm talking to you

558
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But that could be, I don't know

559
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That could be kind of fun for some of those

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't know, little arcade games and stuff

561
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That you play, that you take turns

562
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know

563
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know how they call it blades

564
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
When you're going across the 360 menu

565
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Marketplace will now have its own blade

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Users are now getting inline achievement updates

567
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Supposedly you're going to be able to see

568
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How many points the achievement was

569
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What the achievement is

570
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's like you know how right now it says achievement unlock

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Little sound comes up right

572
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You can actually now know what it is you're getting

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Especially when we did something stupid

575
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I fell in a manhole five times

576
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Why did that unlock an achievement

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Low power download mode

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And auto shutdown

579
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
For those long movie downloads

580
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You can also watch partially downloaded movies

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Now you don't have to wait for the whole thing to download

582
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And again that messenger

583
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Will work with up to six friends

584
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
At once and other little tweaks

585
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
On the user interface

586
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So that is the big spring dashboard update

587
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Information leaked to the internet

588
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Sounds kind of fun

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I wish I knew people that actually used MSN

590
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Messenger

591
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But as it is everybody owns AIM

592
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You use it?

593
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Every once in a while

594
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have a few contacts that are primarily

595
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
On there and I just kind of keep it open

596
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
With a trillion

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But don't use too many people on there

598
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Would you want to talk to me on

599
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Xbox while I'm playing Halo

600
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Would you like to send me messages like you suck at Halo

601
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Rob

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You suck at Halo Rob

603
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No one needs to actually tell you that don't you already know

604
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Sadly yes

605
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I do know

606
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not a fucking joke people

607
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I really suck at Halo

608
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Supposedly

609
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In MSN Messenger

610
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo

611
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's going to tell you what game I'm playing

612
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So you can stalk me more

613
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Don't you want to stalk me Mandarin?

614
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
She's giving me a funny look

615
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Anyway there you go spring dashboard update

616
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Awesome

617
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Now if you're thinking about possibly buying

618
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
One of those Xbox 360 elite systems

619
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There's a few things you might want to know

620
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
About the HDMI

621
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
First off that it will ship with

622
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
HDMI version 1.2

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
As opposed to latest version 1.3

624
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Now what does that mean

625
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
For you

626
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Well not too much as far as

627
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Video is concerned however

628
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Audio though if you want some

629
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Really cool audio you're not going to be able to use

630
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Dolby TrueHD

631
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And DTS HD

632
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Master audio streams

633
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's not really a problem I think for most people

634
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Most people who I use the HDMI for

635
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You know the video

636
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And then you know digital out

637
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
For audio I mean really it's not that big

638
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
A difference but

639
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean if you really want to get down to it

640
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That's a problem for some people I guess

641
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But anyways

642
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Other differences include

643
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They actually have this

644
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
New audio lip sync technology

645
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't really know

646
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Where that would come to play with games

647
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Better transfer speeds

648
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And of course if you were

649
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Outputting above 1080p

650
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Which you're not going to be doing right now

651
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
At least not anytime soon

652
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Audio lip sync technology would that be like

653
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You know how like in Kingdom Hearts

654
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Because they didn't bother to resync the lips

655
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
From the Japanese version

656
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The lips are all off sync with the English words

657
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like is that maybe what they're talking about

658
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like maybe you can sync that better

659
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Maybe

660
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Just audio is really the issue right now

661
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know

662
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't really think that's a big deal

663
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I mean

664
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like I

665
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Optical is awesome I mean unless you really

666
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Are spending the big money for you know

667
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Your system or something

668
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't really think that would be a huge deal

669
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But then again you watch it next week

670
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
There will be a press release from Sony

671
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Saying well we support true HD audio

672
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We're the fucking next generation

673
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You guys are not

674
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I mean I can't wait to see

675
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The press release because I know what's going to happen

676
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Sony is more HD than your mom

677
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There's the press release right there

678
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Um

679
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah

680
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So guess what there's some sad news

681
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Sniff

682
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Apparently

683
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Our friends

684
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
At Rooster Teeth

685
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Which as far as

686
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I understand was supposed to originally be called

687
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Cockbite

688
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Rooster Teeth

689
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite

690
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Um

691
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They are um

692
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Stopping at uh

693
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Episode 100 for Red vs Blue

694
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They posted it on their

695
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
On their forum

696
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But you want to know what

697
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I call bullshit because it was posted on April 1st

698
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ah

699
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week

700
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It has and I don't see

701
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Um

702
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I've been looking through the whole thing and I don't see

703
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Any type of uh

704
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Disclaimer

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hmm

706
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But I still call bullshit

707
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They're just going to move on to Halo 3 and do a new

708
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Either relaunch Red vs Blue

709
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Or do something else

710
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's like you're ending one series and another's beginning

711
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's like you know

712
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The end of Star Trek

713
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And the beginning of Star Trek The Next Generation

714
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There you go that's a good analogy

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Very very nerdy of you

716
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You get kudos

717
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But think about this guys

718
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In iTunes seriously like if you look up Video Game Podcast

719
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Which would you download first

720
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio

721
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Or the podcast called Cockbite

722
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Cockbite Radio

723
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't know

724
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's tempting

725
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
For five years we might have to change our name

726
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We should just call our show

727
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The Naked Lesbian Boobs

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Rock Music

729
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And Drug Show

730
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's called Games Games Games

731
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think there already is a show called

732
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Games Games Games

733
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There's so many

734
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I remember when we started podcasting

735
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
There were maybe like five video game shows

736
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We should call it Look Boobies

737
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
There were like five video game

738
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Mandarin did you just show your boobs at studio?

739
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
There were like maybe five video game

740
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Podcasts and all and now there's like five hundred

741
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
All right

742
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
She flashed her abdomen at you

743
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
All right anyway

744
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sigh

745
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Anyway

746
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Going on to the marketplace

747
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Why isn't there more

748
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Red vs Blue downloadable in the marketplace

749
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I thought they were going to do all these viral videos

750
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And things like they have this whole section

751
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Of marketplace for viral videos

752
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But I can't get Lonely Girl

753
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I can't get Alanis's My Humps

754
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I can't get any of that YouTube

755
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Stuff on

756
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Microsoft Marketplace

757
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
In charge of the backwards compatibility updates

758
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Aha touche

759
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Good job

760
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well what they will have on marketplace pretty soon

761
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is the Forza 2 demo

762
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
There were rumors this week

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That a downloadable demo will be coming

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The timing though

765
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Is still unknown

766
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So supposedly though the game

767
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Is coming out in May

768
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If the information is supposed to be confirmed

769
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Soon

770
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The demo should be like end of April

771
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Right ish early May

772
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Maybe

773
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I've been hearing that their official

774
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Release has been the 15th

775
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So

776
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Mid April

777
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Well probably I'd say late April

778
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Cause I was just thinking

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I can't think of any racing

780
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Games on the Xbox 360

781
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So I'm really excited to hear

782
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That's a joke

783
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Cause there's like 50

784
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you want a demo of

785
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The second Forza

786
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Just play Project Gotham Racing 3

787
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
More or less

788
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Alright

789
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
MotoGP

790
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Anyways

791
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So as we mentioned earlier

792
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Red Octane

793
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And actually they have admitted to it now

794
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But apparently there's been some issues

795
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
With the whammy bars on some of the

796
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Guitar Hero 2 controllers

797
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Now I personally haven't experienced this yet

798
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Since my game is still in the shrink wrap

799
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But you know I have picked up

800
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The guitar and the

801
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Whammy bar feels a little cheap

802
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Anyhoo so

803
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Apparently the

804
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
One's affected by

805
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There's two skews actually

806
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That are defective

807
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The first one is

808
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let's see here

809
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I believe it's like a 95055

810
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And then the other one is 95065

811
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And apparently

812
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You can see

813
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm sitting back in the room and I have my explorer controller

814
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What'd you say now? What am I looking for?

815
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
95055 or 95065

816
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Fuck!

817
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I have a 95065

818
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Ha ha! God damn you Loki

819
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Ha ha! You stole me

820
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This broke as fuck

821
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Xbox 360 explorer

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm just gonna take mine apart

824
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Take it back

825
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Cause you know what I wanna do?

826
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I wanna get mad props on the internet

827
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And get a distortion pedal

828
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Since it can't be that hard to figure out how to

829
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Fuck you know

830
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That distortion pedal works

831
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is just a damn

832
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What is it? Ethernet cord there?

833
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Anyways

834
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So yeah that's what's up

835
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Apparently they want you to return

836
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Your guitar

837
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And get a new one

838
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's not one of those two models

839
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They didn't really say what's defective

840
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But if it's giving you crap

841
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
If you got it from Red Octane

842
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You can contact them to get them RMA

843
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Or if you purchase it

844
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Elsewhere you may need to go bitch them out

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But either way

846
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's stupid

847
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't they test this stuff?

848
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Shouldn't they test these batches?

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
If there's four different types of guitars

850
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Made obviously there were some issues

851
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Why revise the product?

852
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's the whammy bar

853
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar

854
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And when I'm playing the game it feels like the whammy bar

855
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Has noticed it

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one

857
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I could tell

858
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It works! It's not completely broken

859
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But it doesn't do the wah wah wah

860
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Very easily

861
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's either on or it's off

862
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar

863
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So yeah

864
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Thank you for selling me a bum

865
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Xbox 360

866
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Hey it's not my fault

867
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's all the launch ones I think are like that

868
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
This is what I'm saying though

869
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Why revise the designs on some product?

870
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I mean why revise the design four times?

871
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I mean seriously

872
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What's the big deal?

873
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Unless these are coming from four different production factories

874
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Or something like that

875
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
One in China, one in Malaysia

876
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
One in Hong Kong

877
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And two of those are fucked up or something

878
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't believe

879
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That two would be broken in an exact same way

880
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But

881
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I don't know

882
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, Sycoon is wondering in our chat room

883
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Why are there four different guitars anyway?

884
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Kyle Snyder says

885
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?

886
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
How about

887
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Test your product and if it's effective

888
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't send out hundreds of thousands of them

889
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
SSJ100Matt says

890
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Smash it

891
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Video tape it and throw it on the OLR YouTube

892
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Maybe

893
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll tell you this

894
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
If I can unlock all 1000 achievement points

895
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero

896
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Then I'll smash my controller

897
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There's going to be tons of download content though

898
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
We'll see

899
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
When is some new DDR content coming up?

900
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Because there's just one song pack

901
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Don't hold your breath

902
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Alright

903
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Anyhow

904
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
At least I can say this

905
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll say something nice about Red Octane

906
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Because I do like Guitar Hero

907
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
At least they acted on this quickly

908
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They realized they screwed up

909
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And within a week of the game's release they're acting on it

910
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So yay for them

911
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It makes me very angsty that I have one of those crappy guitars

912
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
GS68 says

913
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Convert your guitar to a machine gun

914
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm going to have it implanted on my leg

915
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Like Rose McGowan

916
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Dude that's hot

917
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
What's also hot is hell

918
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
In our Effies of the Week

919
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
My Effie of the Week

920
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Goes to

921
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The line at Marie Callender's this morning

922
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
When I was standing in it

923
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You stood between me and my ex Benedict bitches

924
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Lowkey

925
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Your Effie of the Week

926
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Effie of the Week goes to

927
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The movie Premonition

928
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because I knew it sucked

929
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But yet I went to see it because the wife wanted to see it

930
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Now

931
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That movie is so horrible

932
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I hate Sandra Bullock so much

933
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But I got to admit

934
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie

935
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The way the character dies

936
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
At the end is so like stupid

937
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh man

938
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I just couldn't stop laughing

939
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I was going to go into the theater and do that shit

940
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Thanks for the spoilers by the way

941
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Don't see it, it's a horrible movie

942
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
My Effie of the Week

943
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Goes to the movie Babble

944
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Bab-el? Bab-el?

945
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Although I actually really like the movie

946
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That was way too many pussy shots

947
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
For one movie

948
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And it was the same pussy every time

949
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Like I know that girl's vagina

950
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Inside and out

951
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In glorious HD

952
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
High definition DVD

953
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Thanks to my player in Netflix

954
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Wow!

955
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Alright

956
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Mantrin, do you have any FUs of the Week?

957
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes, I'd like to say FU

958
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
To the speakers who stole our most

959
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Motorcycle, not that we started

960
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Fixing it

961
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Because we have to go out

962
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And essentially get new bearings

963
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Because you rip the pegs

964
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Off of that actual

965
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Half of the bike properly

966
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So, screw you

967
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't steal shit people

968
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Try the same fuckers who broke into my car

969
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Like 50 times

970
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Alright

971
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Well

972
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Back to some gaming news

973
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Maybe

974
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If I feel like it

975
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
FU to Dark Sakura for being a bitch

976
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey, you know what?

977
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
People love my bitchiness

978
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Anyway

979
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance has 8

980
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Downloadable characters on Xbox 360

981
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't know about anything else

982
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one

983
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But I don't care

984
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The downloadable characters

985
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Effective April 10th

986
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Are Hulk, Hawkeye which makes me happy

987
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Cyclops, Nightcrawler

988
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Another one of my favorites

989
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Dr. Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth and Venom

990
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Venom is cool

991
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360

992
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Has all their abilities

993
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Costumes, dialogue

994
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Conversations, achievement points

995
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool

996
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
If you haven't bought the game yet

997
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360

998
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'd wait until next month

999
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Because they're going to do

1000
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Just like the Call of Duty 3

1001
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Characters packed in

1002
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Save yourself like 10 bucks

1003
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Or just play it on PS3

1004
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Or buy it used

1005
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Or don't buy it at all

1006
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That'd be my preference

1007
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Or come over to my house and bring controllers

1008
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Because we need more people to play with me

1009
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Alright

1010
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But no Wonder Woman

1011
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's DC Comics, dummy

1012
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I learned that last week the hard way

1013
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I just felt like fucking with you

1014
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Alright

1015
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I learned that last week the hard way

1016
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I just felt like fucking with you

1017
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
When we told you over and over again

1018
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That Knights is coming out to the Wii

1019
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I don't know, somehow that got confirmed again

1020
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Like blogs were rerunning the story

1021
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Knights is confirmed yet again

1022
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Journey into Dreams

1023
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or no, Journey of Dreams

1024
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?

1025
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But one thing we didn't hear that was new this week

1026
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Is that it's going to use

1027
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Wii Connect 24 functionality

1028
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Are you listening, Loki?

1029
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
However

1030
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's going to use the forecast channel

1031
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
To bring you the real world seasons

1032
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So it's going to actually use the forecast channel

1033
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm assuming

1034
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
If it's snowing outside

1035
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Then it'll be snowing in game

1036
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
If it was snowing at midnight

1037
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You mean

1038
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then it'll be snowing in game

1039
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Because that forecast channel doesn't update ever

1040
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's going to suck if you live in Jamaica

1041
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And it's sunny all the time

1042
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well then maybe you can set it

1043
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I mean, you can probably turn forecast channel

1044
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
On or off, I imagine, in the game

1045
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And if it's off, it's just randomized

1046
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That's what I'm going to do when they have Animal Crossing come out

1047
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm just going to set mine to Antarctica

1048
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Or something like that

1049
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Why is it snowing in summer?

1050
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Because it's cold

1051
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That's what the forecast channel says

1052
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Anyways

1053
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
As if this is a big surprise

1054
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I know

1055
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
New colors of the Wiimote and Nunchucks

1056
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Are supposedly coming out soon

1057
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, big shocker there

1058
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's going to be funny though

1059
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Apparently

1060
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It comes from a retailer list

1061
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
According to GoNintendo.com

1062
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And some of the colors available

1063
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Silver, blue, and pearl pink

1064
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Both

1065
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Pink

1066
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And I bet you anything

1067
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The console colors are coming as well

1068
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But my question is though

1069
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Is this

1070
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The controllers aren't out there anyways now

1071
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What's it matter if they're in different colors as well

1072
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You still can't get them

1073
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
People are going to be

1074
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Silver is such a weird color too

1075
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
For a controller

1076
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Mandarin, you did a little

1077
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Jerk off motion when you heard this story

1078
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What are your thoughts on the Nunchucks and remotes

1079
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And different colors

1080
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I have a remote skin

1081
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like the most rubbery things

1082
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Once I heard about all the remotes

1083
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Flying off because of sweaty hands

1084
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I went out and got one and it cuts down

1085
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So I have a pink remote

1086
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Just like Nelly does

1087
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But it does look like your wiimote is wearing a condom

1088
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I mean I just put that out there

1089
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah what can I say I like to play safe

1090
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And to kind of

1091
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And your wiimote has not gotten AIDS

1092
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So good job

1093
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
To clarify this also this is coming from a European

1094
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Retail list apparently

1095
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
According to that

1096
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It will be shipping on

1097
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
June 29th in the UK

1098
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So not of course

1099
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
An official confirmation but come on

1100
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Of course Nintendo is going to do different colored

1101
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Remotes and stuff

1102
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I don't know the

1103
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Silver, blue, and pink that's kind of a weird

1104
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Combo of colors there

1105
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Isn't that all the colors of the DS?

1106
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
There's no silver in this

1107
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah there is the original one was silver

1108
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Silver-y

1109
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Silver-ish

1110
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Those are all DS colors

1111
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh sorry gray

1112
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Silver

1113
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Well we can all call it what we want to

1114
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But that doesn't necessarily make it true

1115
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Well

1116
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Something that I think is really stupid

1117
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You know we weren't really supposed to talk about this

1118
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know situation again

1119
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But um

1120
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The uh we all remember the

1121
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Woman that drank all the water

1122
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And you know

1123
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Pretty much killed herself

1124
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
How could we forget we freaking live here

1125
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It was all over the news for like months

1126
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well um

1127
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Basically they um

1128
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Are not filing any

1129
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Criminal charges against

1130
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The radio station

1131
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Um

1132
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The district attorney

1133
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Basically is quoted saying

1134
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Jennifer Strange was an adult

1135
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Who voluntarily participated

1136
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In the radio contest

1137
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
She knew what the contest

1138
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Involved when she entered it

1139
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And had the option to stop or discontinue her participation

1140
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
In the radio contest at any time

1141
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
However the civil suit is still

1142
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
In a process

1143
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And um

1144
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That morning show though still cancelled

1145
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The staffers were fired

1146
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And they still haven't replaced it by the way

1147
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I think they're still doing that cheesy

1148
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Make your own playlist

1149
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And come in and DJ for the morning

1150
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like they're trying to get people off the street

1151
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
To fill in cause they like seriously no one will touch

1152
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That radio station with a ten foot pole right now

1153
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I would if I could play my own music but unfortunately

1154
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I actually was going to send in an entry

1155
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
For it but you have to join their little

1156
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Online club but maybe I should do that

1157
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean wouldn't that be kind of funny

1158
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We should all send in a playlist

1159
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And just put Beyonce

1160
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
My chemical romance I don't know just put all the top

1161
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
40 crap on there and get in there

1162
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And do it wouldn't that be fun

1163
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No not really cause I don't listen to that station

1164
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But you know

1165
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't entirely agree with that statement

1166
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think that you know she

1167
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Wasn't fully they didn't fully disclose

1168
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The risks involved with it

1169
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I mean yes she is an adult if she was

1170
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Feeling sick or whatever she could bow out

1171
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But you know I don't think

1172
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They fully explain the risks to them

1173
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
As far as you know what

1174
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
What's involved and what could possibly happen

1175
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And that's all going to come out in this civil lawsuit

1176
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
To be honest it's no surprise

1177
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
To me that a criminal charge

1178
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying

1179
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
They were set out to kill someone

1180
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like they were

1181
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Going into this contest thinking hey

1182
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You know what we should do for ratings let's kill someone

1183
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Well

1184
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I don't think that would work

1185
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
We thought about it but you know

1186
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know

1187
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But still I still think they can

1188
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Get them on negligence just you know

1189
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
For not disclosing this stuff I mean hell

1190
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
If they can get Pete like McDonald's on that

1191
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Disclosing that coffee's hot

1192
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I mean they should be able to get that's a civil lawsuit

1193
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The owner of McDonald's did not go

1194
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
To jail for a year because the coffee was hot

1195
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
They should cause their fries suck sometimes

1196
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And they keep hiring

1197
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
These people that don't speak any English

1198
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And they always fuck up my orders

1199
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That station will get sued for

1200
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Eleveny billion dollars it's coming

1201
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And they will get sold and change their name

1202
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's counting down till the day

1203
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Till that radio station has to change their name

1204
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And then we will see the headline

1205
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
On the news is at the end of

1206
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The end

1207
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Wah wah

1208
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They're saving that like headline

1209
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Saving it

1210
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Ahh love it

1211
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Alright

1212
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well um

1213
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
While we wait for more information

1214
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
On the Jennifer Strange

1215
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Lawsuit stuff cause I know you just

1216
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You love and thrive on all that

1217
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Information

1218
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah I know

1219
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I was being facetious

1220
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I have release dates

1221
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
See what I was doing was I was buying time

1222
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
While I was pulling up the Japanese release dates

1223
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Cause I was lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance

1224
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So let me tell you about all these great games coming out

1225
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
To the Japanese market

1226
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And you can also horribly

1227
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Listen to me horribly horribly

1228
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles

1229
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Of which it actually does not seem like

1230
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
There's a whole lot coming out over in Japan

1231
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
This week um for Playstation 2

1232
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000

1233
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Grim Grimoire

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Which is coming out and also

On the Playstation 2 finally gets its way

1237
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
In Japan

1238
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's coming out

1239
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
There's a couple titles on the DS

1240
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Including some Disney franchises

1241
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Chicken Little and The Little Mermaid

1242
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Make its way to Japan

1243
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Which by the way

1244
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You have to hear at some point in your life

1245
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The Little Mermaid stage from Kingdom Hearts

1246
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
In Japanese

1247
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Makes me cry

1248
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Makes me cry from laughing so hard

1249
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Watashi no Relaxuma

1250
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS

1251
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Relaxuma sounds cool

1252
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Relaxuma

1253
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And Jamie maybe you'd like this

1254
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Doesn't it look like little bears massaging each other

1255
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Or something

1256
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It does

1257
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It looks like the old bear is reading

1258
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And the little bear is walking on his back

1259
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Some folks used to do that

1260
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
To massage

1261
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
That bear is going to murder the other bear

1262
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
With that little pointy red flag

1263
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
He's going to play with his

1264
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I

1265
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I call this land in the name of France

1266
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And stab them through the temple

1267
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So really not an exciting week in Japan

1268
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Sorry

1269
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Well if you're looking for excitement

1270
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In the United States

1271
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Well

1272
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You better wait until next week

1273
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Although there is one good game coming out this week

1274
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Super Paper Mario

1275
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
On the Wii

1276
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's about it

1277
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
There's a couple PSP games coming out

1278
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
None worth mentioning

1279
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That is your week

1280
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii

1281
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Ha

1282
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Ha

1283
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC

1284
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That game looks awesome

1285
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Wasn't that supposed to come out last week

1286
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week

1287
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yeah it's

1288
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's just a really

1289
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Really sad week

1290
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well it's really not looking much better

1291
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
For the UK

1292
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We have

1293
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Well Fears coming out that's a good game

1294
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And the Godfather the Dawns edition

1295
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
On PS3

1296
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Gurumin A Monstrous Adventure

1297
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
On the PSP Harvest Moon DS

1298
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Hotel Dusk Room 215

1299
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Pokemon Ranger and Wing Island

1300
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
On Wii

1301
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Maybe Hotel Dusk

1302
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Room 215 will do better like in Europe

1303
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You know how like sometimes with music

1304
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
There's like bands that do way better

1305
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
In Europe that like flop here even though

1306
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
They might be really good

1307
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't know things like Robbie Williams

1308
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
He's big everywhere but people here

1309
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Don't bat an eyelash at him right

1310
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe Hotel Dusk 215 will like

1311
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Catch like wildfire

1312
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Or maybe you're just saying

1313
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah cause you're a bitch

1314
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Hey Rob

1315
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Guess what

1316
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You know it's kind of random

1317
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This is completely random here but you know a game

1318
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I saw a video for that kind of made it look

1319
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Fun to play

1320
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Cabela's African Safari

1321
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
They have it like where you can go into bullet time

1322
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
As you freaking

1323
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You're diving towards

1324
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You know I guess a lion

1325
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Or something like that and you can snipe

1326
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Lions in the head

1327
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Africa

1328
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Although they already said in Africa

1329
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You're not gonna be hunting animals

1330
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Which is like the one reason I would

1331
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Buy the game

1332
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It'd be awesome if like it's resistance in Africa

1333
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And you're just blowing crap up

1334
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Africa

1335
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Alright well

1336
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Speaking of games

1337
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We won't be seeing anytime soon

1338
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Cause I don't know about you I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa

1339
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Since E3

1340
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon

1341
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Mother 3

1342
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And just to pour salt in the wounds

1343
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Guess what Nintendo did this week

1344
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Nintendo posted the soundtrack

1345
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
On iTunes

1346
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And no, not the Japanese store

1347
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
You can actually get

1348
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
The Mother 3 soundtrack in the US

1349
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Store

1350
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And download some of the songs from Mother 3

1351
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Wait, what's this

1352
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Mandarin? You have a game release?

1353
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Sam & Max episode 5

1354
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Is gonna be released Thursday

1355
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Wasn't that already out?

1356
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I thought episode 5 came out

1357
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I thought it did too

1358
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh it already released on Thursday

1359
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Cause GameTap

1360
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Does roll out their new games on Thursday

1361
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And I had a friend

1362
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Who was playing it but I think

1363
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do

1364
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
On GameTap

1365
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Cause he's special

1366
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You getting told?

1367
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Alright well anyway

1368
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If you are waiting for Sam & Max

1369
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Or just don't have GameTap

1370
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And you want to download some music from Mother 3

1371
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You can download such gems as

1372
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
We Miss You

1373
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Music

1374
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Slow jams of Earthbound

1375
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Lame

1376
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I don't know why anyone would be interested in that stupid game

1377
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Because there are rabid

1378
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Fucking Mother fans out there

1379
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
On the internet that will

1380
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Download anything that remotely has to do

1381
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
With Mother

1382
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We used to have a little cluster from some

1383
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
There was some website dedicated to Mother

1384
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And the Earthbound series

1385
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But there was a period of time

1386
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
When there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show

1387
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Don't you remember that?

1388
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Nope

1389
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Well god, you don't care about our listeners do you?

1390
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well then fine, new story

1391
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Anyways

1392
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Starman.net, that was it

1393
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Miyamoto

1394
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Of course inspired by

1395
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
PlayStation Home

1396
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Wants to expand the world

1397
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Of the Miis

1398
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
In other words

1399
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Wants to do more things with them

1400
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Including

1401
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them

1402
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
How about you start

1403
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
By

1404
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Giving third party companies

1405
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Access to put Miis in their game

1406
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Would be a good way to expand the experience

1407
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Or

1408
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I don't know, how about

1409
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Do something a little bit more

1410
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Than just have them wandering around their little

1411
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
White existence in there

1412
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But yeah

1413
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
He plans on seeing

1414
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
A vast virtual world

1415
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
With the Miis

1416
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Not starting too well with the

1417
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Vote for your favorite

1418
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Mii channel that's supposed to be coming out

1419
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Eventually

1420
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
A Mare Mii can idol

1421
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We're Sanjaya Mii

1422
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Okay

1423
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Well

1424
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Anyway

1425
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Anyway

1426
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This makes me kind of sad

1427
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Because

1428
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Our dear

1429
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Hero

1430
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Nomura Tetsuya

1431
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Is not affiliated

1432
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
With the

1433
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
New Kingdom Hearts

1434
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Coming out

1435
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Wait, but we saw that trailer last week right?

1436
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
For some type of

1437
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Or at least it was tacked on at the end of

1438
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix or whatever

1439
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So they're going on without them or what?

1440
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
What he's basically telling

1441
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Dengeki Playstation is

1442
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And this is a quote

1443
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
First it's not Kingdom Hearts 3

1444
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Of course because we're calling it a new series

1445
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It won't be Kingdom Hearts 3

1446
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Also it's a series so it won't

1447
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Be just one title

1448
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Um

1449
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He's saying that basically he's working

1450
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
On a different story

1451
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I don't know

1452
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Not the next Kingdom Hearts

1453
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's a spinoff of the Kingdom Hearts series

1454
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Online, MMO

1455
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Dude that would be hot

1456
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I would totally quit World of Warcraft

1457
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
For that

1458
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series

1459
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Without Disney

1460
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But why?

1461
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts

1462
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In the first place

1463
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Now we have to play it for the

1464
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Roxas

1465
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And Axl

1466
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Fuck that

1467
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Well we'll see what happens

1468
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Dustcap2 makes it funny in chat

1469
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Kingdom Hearts X1

1470
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Like Mega Man

1471
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Get it

1472
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Laugh

1473
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Well this is also leaving

1474
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
A lot of people with a huh kind of look

1475
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Is that Resident Evil 4

1476
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Has been confirmed for the Wii

1477
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Um now yes that's Resident Evil

1478
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
4 the game that you could already

1479
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Play with your GameCube

1480
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Backwards compatibility

1481
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Will now be coming out on the Wii

1482
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube

1483
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Games they could easily redo them for the Wii

1484
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
With the new functionality

1485
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Well here it is in motion right here

1486
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Uh you're gonna now be able to

1487
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Um you know obviously you use the Wii

1488
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Controls as part of the game

1489
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It'll have widescreen support although I believe the old one had

1490
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Widescreen support as well but I guess now you can get

1491
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Progressive Scan and all that good stuff

1492
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Um well couldn't the old one do

1493
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Progressive Scan as well? Could it?

1494
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I don't remember. I thought so. Interesting

1495
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So they really aren't changing a lot of it then

1496
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Well the Wii Mode is gonna be used for close range

1497
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Attacks uh the speaker will be used

1498
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
For the reload sound effect the one that's in the

1499
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Little Wii Mode there um if an enemy

1500
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Approaches you give the Wii Mode a little shake

1501
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And you can do a close range attack

1502
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
With the knife um otherwise

1503
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
The game has also been modified to take

1504
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Um the Wii into the account um

1505
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Some interactive event scenes use the Wii

1506
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Buttons you have to shake the Wii Mode and part

1507
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Of it um the producer of the Wii

1508
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Version uh was talking to Famitsu

1509
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Magazine and said that uh

1510
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
They want to allow families who play the

1511
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Wii together to experience Resident Evil

1512
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So in other words

1513
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
No more chainsaw your face off

1514
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I guess I guess they're gonna have to do something about that

1515
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But there are gonna be easy and amateur

1516
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Difficulty settings to make the game a little

1517
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Bit easier

1518
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Also the bonus elements from the Playstation 2

1519
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Will be in the Wii release so you can do

1520
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The add a um sequence

1521
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
The another order sequence

1522
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So that's I guess something

1523
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That you didn't have on your backwards compatibility

1524
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I can't

1525
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
They're gonna have to do something about uh

1526
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Chainsaw man taking off your head though

1527
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
For the family play they're gonna really

1528
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Need to do something like that about that

1529
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Oh man that's funny

1530
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Anyway instead he gives you

1531
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
He gives you flowers

1532
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Resident Evil Family Edition

1533
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Anyways

1534
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So yeah I think it's funny that

1535
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
They were saying that you know you can

1536
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Redo some of the old GameCube games cause I think

1537
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Most of the games that have come out recently

1538
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Especially by Ubisoft um are just

1539
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Old GameCube games that have been ported

1540
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Over to the Wii

1541
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Super Paper Mario to some extent is that I mean

1542
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Granted they went back and reworked it

1543
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Twilight Princess is a perfect example

1544
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Prince of Persia 2 no

1545
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Hot damn when do you think we're gonna get

1546
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
A Wii game that was actually made for the Wii

1547
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube

1548
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Game they were thinking about too

1549
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't know

1550
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That I think they were probably actually doing you know

1551
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
For the Wii but like

1552
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Prince of Persia Rival Swords

1553
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Like you have a lot of the

1554
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You know stuff that's been out

1555
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Binacle Heroes that's coming out that was a GameCube title

1556
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Open Season a lot of the movie tie in stuff

1557
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't know it's just bad

1558
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Anyways

1559
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Some of our chat room by the way is coming up with new slogans

1560
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And commercials for Resident Evil 4

1561
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like you know that

1562
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
We would like to play

1563
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Bandit has come up with some new taglines

1564
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Including

1565
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We die together

1566
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And we would like to kill you

1567
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So there you go

1568
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Free marketing

1569
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Anyways

1570
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
There's a rumor

1571
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That mass shortage

1572
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Or mass storage

1573
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Is coming to the Wii

1574
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Although

1575
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Unfortunately I think this rumor has been squashed

1576
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Because

1577
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It had to do with a press release by a company called

1578
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
ESOL Middleware

1579
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
They have basically

1580
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
A fat driver

1581
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
For the file system

1582
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And there's another driver for USB host stuff

1583
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Which apparently

1584
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Is already being implemented into the Wii

1585
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So

1586
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
This is probably not the case

1587
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
For right now

1588
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It is for the

1589
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I believe the little

1590
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Flash card you can put in there

1591
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So

1592
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Sorry no mass storage for you

1593
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm sure they have to at some point

1594
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You know do that

1595
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Poor babies

1596
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Alright well

1597
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
DarkSakura might use that mass storage device

1598
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
To save her favorite websites

1599
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
When she's surfing the internet

1600
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Because she likes to surf the internet a lot

1601
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And she finds her favorite websites

1602
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And brings them to you in a special statement

1603
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
We call DarkSakura's website of the week

1604
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Today's website of the week

1605
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Is one that Rob

1606
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Frequences often

1607
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Because I got the idea from him

1608
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Pornotube.com

1609
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Home of pterodactyl porn

1610
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It needs nothing

1611
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It's pornotube.com

1612
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Pterodactyl porn

1613
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You know

1614
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You want pterodactyl porn

1615
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Adult only

1616
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It does not count mental state of adult

1617
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
What's been up with your website of the week lately

1618
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They've all been like x-rated

1619
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I have no idea

1620
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Because it's like

1621
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Someone's been thinking about

1622
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Sex

1623
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
No

1624
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Someone's been um

1625
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Busy

1626
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Psycoon says why don't we just make this Rob's website

1627
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Of the week

1628
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Oh okay I will think of an original website of the week next week

1629
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Alright

1630
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I promise

1631
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Well DarkSakura frequents the pornotube

1632
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
She's not afraid to get down with the pornotube

1633
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Alright

1634
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Well speaking of

1635
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We talked about GameTap earlier in the show

1636
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I guess Mandarin clarified

1637
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That it was on the private server

1638
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The new Sam & Max

1639
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Like this Thursday

1640
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So that's cool

1641
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Something else that's there hidden away

1642
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Apparently some Sega Saturn games

1643
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Are in there

1644
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
There's a game called Bug

1645
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Which was lame by the way

1646
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Well nevertheless it was on the Sega Saturn

1647
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And it's there in GameTap

1648
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And apparently there's some Easter Egg

1649
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Games

1650
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's part of a promotion GameTap is doing

1651
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I haven't logged into GameTap in a while

1652
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I haven't used it in a while

1653
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Apparently there's some other games hidden away too

1654
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But those haven't come to light yet

1655
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But

1656
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Something that some sharp eyed

1657
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Folks have noticed is that if you

1658
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Look at the controls in the game

1659
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The controls actually mention the shift key

1660
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So is it possible this is

1661
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Just a PC version of Bug that's

1662
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Tucked away

1663
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Don't know yet if this means that there are actually

1664
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Saturn games coming

1665
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But nevertheless it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega

1666
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Has been a big supporter of

1667
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
GameTap because you know you have a lot of Genesis

1668
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Games and Master System games and hell you

1669
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Have Dreamcast games in there

1670
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So why not Saturn

1671
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Makes sense

1672
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
SSJ100mad in chat says

1673
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD

1674
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Sega in chat says

1675
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
GameTap has included the

1676
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Sega Saturn emulator so you'll get more

1677
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Saturn games later

1678
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator

1679
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh there you go

1680
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Cool

1681
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Well speaking of

1682
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Emulating stuff

1683
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
A game called Piano Hero

1684
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
On the PC

1685
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Some guys making it

1686
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And it's basically a freeware open source

1687
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Project that lets people with

1688
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
MIDI capable keyboards

1689
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Play any MIDI file as if it were

1690
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Like a Guitar Hero

1691
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Style track

1692
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Or think back to I don't know keyboard mania

1693
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
However

1694
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Activision has now

1695
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Sent a cease and desist order

1696
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
To the guy

1697
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Behind it

1698
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Nicholas looks like he had a

1699
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Peach done

1700
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Well basically the only thing he has

1701
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
To do which is not too bad

1702
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Is he has to change the name

1703
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Because they want to make sure that people

1704
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Aren't getting confused

1705
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That it's an actual

1706
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Official Activision product

1707
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Or something like that

1708
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So he can keep on making the game as long as he names it

1709
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
As something else

1710
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I don't know that's not bad

1711
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
You know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though

1712
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I don't know

1713
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Does he really have to change the name?

1714
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah

1715
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Basically they've sent a cease and desist

1716
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Well no no no I'm not saying based on cease and desist

1717
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But do they really have the legal right to make him change the name?

1718
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't know

1719
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Maybe unless they have something

1720
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You know

1721
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Coming out

1722
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It says among the various

1723
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Products Activision publishes

1724
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Are

1725
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2

1726
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Video games

1727
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Activision is the owner of certain

1728
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Intellectual property rights including

1729
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Guitar Hero franchise

1730
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Including but not limited to

1731
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The trademark Guitar Hero

1732
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And says

1733
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let's see here

1734
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm trying to see exactly what it is

1735
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It says it comes to attention that you've been using

1736
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
The name Piano Hero in connection with your game

1737
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
That you designed

1738
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
For Halite Studios

1739
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Where enclosed they print out of your

1740
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Website showing such

1741
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
In our opinion your use of

1742
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The name Piano Hero constitutes

1743
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
At least

1744
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Trademark infringement

1745
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Delusion and unfair competition

1746
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
With the respect to the trademark

1747
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Guitar Hero

1748
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I don't know

1749
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get

1750
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Named similarly all the time

1751
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Especially

1752
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
When it comes to a lot of puzzle games

1753
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I don't know

1754
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There's a perfect example

1755
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
There's a movie studio out there that does

1756
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Knock off movies like Snakes on a Train

1757
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Or for the new

1758
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Transformers movie

1759
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Transmorphers

1760
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
There you go

1761
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Landmine Fairy

1762
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Suggests Keyboard Villain

1763
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
As a possible name to replace

1764
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Can they already license Guitar Villain?

1765
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Not officially

1766
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It's been licensed but there's no game out on the market yet

1767
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Which by the way that's one of my favorite chat room names ever

1768
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Is Landmine Fairy

1769
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Also Bandit makes a good suggestion

1770
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Go to Guitar Hero.com

1771
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's a site for action figures not associated

1772
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
With Activision

1773
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
They should sue Activision ASAP

1774
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I agree

1775
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Turn about the fair play right?

1776
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Or how about

1777
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I don't know

1778
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
The fact that I would say it's infringing more on

1779
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Keyboard Mania

1780
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Than you know

1781
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The game itself

1782
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Alpha

1783
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Canongram suggests a name that will

1784
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Probably sell more copies of the game

1785
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Piano Porno Star

1786
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Piano Porno Star

1787
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Piano Porno Star is a pretty awesome name

1788
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Piano Cockbite

1789
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And on that note

1790
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
We're going to bring part A to a close here

1791
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Oh real quick

1792
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Mandarin you wanted to give a special shout out right?

1793
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Seggman anyway

1794
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I just want to give a special shout out to

1795
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Segg in the chat room

1796
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
He's a friend of mine currently in Boston

1797
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
He was working at Emerson

1798
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Emerson College

1799
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
He just got a job at Telltale Games

1800
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Out in San Rafael

1801
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
He's going to be

1802
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Being the new build engineer

1803
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
For all the Sam & Max episodes

1804
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
From this point

1805
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Once he starts there from this point forward

1806
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And I believe he starts next week or

1807
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Didn't we see

1808
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Something a while back about

1809
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Sam & Max they were trying to hire people

1810
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
To port it to Xbox Live or something

1811
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
There was a job posting on the internet

1812
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Did your friend get that job?

1813
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Kinda?

1814
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Something like it?

1815
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Interesting

1816
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
He will have to come on the show later if he can

1817
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
There might be NDA's at the wazoo

1818
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Get your friend to come

1819
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
To our show because Sam & Max is pretty cool

1820
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Also

1821
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Part B tonight we're bringing back an old favorite

1822
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
We're going to play some match game

1823
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
In Part B tonight

1824
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So that means we need to get some contestants during the break

1825
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So we'll take one on the skype line later

1826
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Don't call yet, we'll take one on the skype line

1827
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
We have to do the game, but we need a chat room contestant

1828
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So to find a chat room contestant we always

1829
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Ask a trivia question live here on the program

1830
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Here is tonight's trivia question

1831
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
We're going to be talking about

1832
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
A new game in Part B

1833
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Tonight called Rock Band

1834
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Of course a lot of you guys have heard about this

1835
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But Rock Band was not the first game

1836
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That would allow you to put together a full band

1837
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There was actually an arcade series

1838
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program

1839
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
For a long time now

1840
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You know these games very well

1841
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
There used to be three games

1842
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
That would all session together

1843
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
To form your own band

1844
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So you could play games at the arcade

1845
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Name them

1846
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat

1847
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Send a message to Sky in the chat room

1848
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
With the name of the three games

1849
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
To form your own band with in the arcade previously

1850
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It can all be made

1851
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Alright so we're going to take a break

1852
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And we'll see you guys in Part B
