5893	14743	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15464	19088	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19850	21571	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
48186	53048	For match game, he will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later on in the program.
53088	53909	We'll tell you when to call.
54469	57191	But, in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.
57971	66415	Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday, and everyone is all excited about it.
66775	70777	It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.
71038	77881	And this is the brand new EA Harmonix kind of co-game there.
78356	80498	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
108581	109981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
133062	136103	Was there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies of it?
136203	141884	Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals involved with it, according to some rumors.
142004	151727	But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.
151747	153547	And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.
153727	155207	This is so innovative.
155868	157448	So innovative.
157688	159748	It's not innovative at all.
160129	161729	Well, to an extent, though.
162344	175791	If they do make it playable over the internet and you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked ass.
175991	177111	The keyboard was pretty good.
177832	178352	I have to say that.
178372	180333	If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.
181073	183615	But the drum controller for home, not that hot.
183695	185976	Guitar controller for home, not that hot.
185996	188137	The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.
188635	189876	Session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania
218124	223708	Now, for those people that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing, I don't want to sing.
223989	225370	It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.
225410	231714	I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing, is fucking, Konami, wake up, where the fuck have you been?
231774	236258	You've missed a train, and the next train, and the next train, as far as music games go.
236298	242703	You're letting these people, I mean, you had the whole market cornered for this stuff, and now you're just kind of letting it slip away.
243823	244904	I don't know what they're thinking.
244984	246025	What's the big deal?
246085	247246	I mean, they really should have
247944	249404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
267039	267880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
293613	294414	It's not original.
294554	294994	I don't care.
295014	298718	If they want to improve on it, great, that's awesome.
299199	301301	But it's not fucking original.
301461	309871	If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.
310603	315307	GS68 says Konami wailed on In The Groove and pump it up, but his pretending Guitar Hero doesn't exist.
315608	326597	That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In The Groove should have done to DDR, and that is, you know, completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone of Guitar Freaks.
326777	332182	They, you know, the only similarities between the game is they both have guitar controllers in their rhythm games.
332583	335225	You know, otherwise, you know, they gave it the more amplitude look,
335592	337573	Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero
361457	362718	Yes, it is going to turn into this.
362738	364218	But I like the harmonics now.
364559	369361	This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, Neversoft, you can have Guitar Hero.
369441	371162	We're going to go work on something bigger and better.
371202	372602	That's smart harmonics to me.
372642	373163	I think so.
373303	376064	And I'm curious to see what it's going to become.
376364	381047	But here's my thing is people bitch about having to buy like $600 systems and stuff.
381147	389211	Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got leaked out there from GameStop
390632	395636	They were saying that they were starting to do pre-orders on stuff because they'll pre-order games that don't exist yet.
396917	401881	But let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something like that.
402081	404122	You're spending $200 on a fucking game.
404523	408005	I mean, that's a little much for me, I would think.
408025	410227	Well, people are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.
410267	410927	Why not?
411068	414570	Yeah, but still, they drop another just for one game.
414810	418273	You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.
419686	421087	I'm just going to get them all anyway.
422207	423828	Because you're a peripheral whore.
424028	424768	But I want to ask you.
424789	425269	I am.
425749	429110	You know, this is very interesting, and I think this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue.
429411	441256	Because you guys have to realize, six years ago, flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks.
441997	444118	I mean, literally, the three of us were playing this band thing.
444198	446399	And insert random other person on another guitar.
446439	449861	Well, you know, but still, we were kind of doing this a long time ago.
449881	453203	We have a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.
453323	460106	Now, nobody look at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us on the machine.
460166	461307	So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?
461327	464669	Because, you know, he doesn't seem to care for it because it's not original.
464689	470952	I'm a little disappointed, though, that they just didn't fully rip it off and do, like, a keyboard as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.
471674	476458	and I generally kind of like the idea because, you know, well, it's a guitar, freaks, drum, music.
476478	477439	What do you think, DarkSakura?
478660	488908	I honestly, I think it's going to be fun because it's the closest we're going to get in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind of, you know, bullshit.
489608	492711	But it's the closest we're going to get over here.
492751	496394	It'll make it, you know, I think it'll really catch on.
496434	497715	I think that it's going to be a big thing.
498063	500165	You know, I am a little disappointed, though, in Konami.
500185	504749	Just a little bit, because they used to be so edgy with, like, you know, DDR and then Karaoke Revolution.
504829	507010	No one had even thought about doing something like that.
507491	512675	Or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.
513135	516919	And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh!
516959	517299	games.
517379	521662	I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom!
521682	525005	Just, like, totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside.
525025	527127	You know, come out with the next big thing, you know.
527591	542276	I think the other killer about this, though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DER, well, some DER, some Carrier Revolution.
542336	549118	I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty good.
549158	549778	They're solid.
549818	554360	I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and
554670	555230	I just hope it's diverse.
555250	556830	I don't want to play all these emo bands.
556930	558251	One emo song once in a while is kind of fun.
584913	591294	I wouldn't mind a little bit of that, but I don't want a whole game full of that.
591354	600216	I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some new classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today.
600236	601476	I kind of hope they find a balance.
602537	602977	We'll see, though.
603757	605137	And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it.
605297	606457	There should be a keyboard, though.
606557	613799	I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but I understand why it's not there, but it doesn't make me any less sad.
614994	616195	Do you know what I want to know?
616795	616975	What?
617135	627139	This is kind of stupid, but you're going to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going to be USB on the 360.
627179	630361	They're lacking one USB port for that.
631561	632262	That's going to be a problem.
633062	634843	They need a wireless mic?
634923	637684	I don't know.
637724	640986	I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.
641106	641446	Whatever.
641486	641806	Whatever.
643052	645193	Well, I think this is kind of cool.
645413	658381	During the conference for Rock Band, the Harmonix CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.
659662	662263	It was actually specified he said it without hesitation.
663044	670428	He's quoted saying, we will at some time bring Rock Band to every important platform, and Harmonix would be...
672395	675056	tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms.
675576	676697	And he likes the Wiimote.
680178	686960	Well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that platform, except playing online is going to suck because Nintendo will make you put in friend codes.
687140	694543	And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks or something like that.
694623	695463	It will never work.
696384	698144	Just make new peripherals.
698844	700485	They could do a Taiko no Tatsujin on...
701462	704003	Beatmania 2DX trying to relaunch that off the ground in arcades in the U.S.
728493	728893	Beatmania 2DX Gold
747594	753596	Well, according to this user on BomaniStyle.com, Brazoliange, I probably mispronounced that horribly, sorry.
754416	758097	This guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there.
758597	763819	And she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it.
764699	768780	And that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations.
768800	771461	But they're having problems finding a distributor right now in the U.S.
771761	773882	and has not seen an easy way to import them.
774802	777423	They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.
778196	806021	Konami or Betsen is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September and this lady I guess is looking into that so Dave and Busters they want to buy 2DX Gold they're glad to see there's a client base and they're looking into purchasing machines if you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support all the information is over there at BomaniStyle.com but pretty interesting it'll be interesting if that game finally took off here but I don't know it's a bit of a novelty I love Beatmania 2DX but
807411	815914	I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.
816274	832459	Put in anything Timbaland produced in there or mix it with some new techno like Faster Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff and trance and dance and it'll be huge.
832878	833578	They don't know.
833839	834439	That would never work.
834559	838622	And what they need to do is they need to reinvent the whole damn franchise for the U.S.
838662	839322	if they're going to do that.
839382	845166	They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing instead of just having keys and stuff.
845507	848389	Actually, just have turntables and mixer and stuff like that.
848489	852972	More like Kraken DJ or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.
853052	860077	Easy to DJ, though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with...
861178	862779	Beatmania, 2DX, or something like that.
862799	872647	They just need to make it... Because right now, people, when they see that, they're all, well, that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.
872667	873327	Kraken DJ.
874188	875449	Kraken DJ is a good example.
875709	878131	But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast.
878211	880773	Maybe it was just because the songs in there were not recognizable at all.
881213	882094	But I don't know.
882114	883355	Something about 2DX kept me on.
883395	887238	They had a great... Even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,
887597	888358	My birthday is in two weeks.
914867	915107	Really?
915227	916828	And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.
916988	917448	Yes, we are.
917548	918069	Yay!
918409	919169	Rockin' Space Mountain.
919649	920350	Hell yeah!
920830	922291	But we'll be back in time for the show.
922791	923171	Hopefully.
923511	924692	Otherwise, we're doing it live from I-5.
924912	927273	Uh, hi!
927513	928994	This is me, and I'm driving.
930034	930815	Goddammit!
931075	932235	Fucking SUV!
932575	933276	Goddammit!
933476	935117	Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.
935317	937478	Goddammit, motherfuckers!
939058	940059	That will be me, won't it?
940695	951463	So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the PlayStation 3 20 gigabyte system, that's skew at least.
952804	960850	Well, Sony style is no longer carrying the 20 gig system, and that's kind of interesting, and that kind of further backs up with everybody else.
961010	968456	Either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done with it, or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling anymore.
969145	996089	um the 20 gig at least is not selling and i know for a lot of um retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore so i don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20 gig system probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there but i think they're done 20 gig system it's my opinion and uh actually i think what i was trying to read here um
997577	1003440	Joystick, I believe, contacted SonyStyle and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month.
1004361	1007002	And they said they're not getting any more.
1007102	1008723	You could go out and find one, though.
1009623	1011044	Has anyone checked the Metreon store?
1012665	1013085	I don't know.
1014106	1016027	But I know my 20 gig's awesome.
1017327	1018908	You don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit.
1019989	1020689	Just plug it in.
1021009	1022330	Plug the damn thing in.
1022350	1024811	Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play.
1025171	1026672	And then I'll talk hardware.
1028319	1028739	Exactly.
1030279	1046464	Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they actually are both not coming out in May, as we have been told.
1046784	1056126	They still have a 2007 release, but Sony isn't really saying much about it, so we'll just
1056678	1060200	I guess keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.
1060460	1061041	Probably Summer.
1062902	1064283	I don't think they have anything else coming out.
1064883	1066564	I mean, Lair, Heavenly Sword.
1067885	1069006	I don't think they have anything really.
1069086	1070446	Well, I guess Warhawk.
1070907	1071927	Ooh, Warhawk.
1072328	1074449	Oh, joyandrapture.com.
1075329	1076010	Let's see.
1076130	1081813	Let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking waited until 2008 to launch the system.
1082594	1083594	Write that up there on the board.
1083915	1084535	All right, there we go.
1087225	1091869	Yeah, now we have, you know, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.
1093331	1097094	But, you know, one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam.
1097175	1099977	You know, sometimes a lot of people give this system a lot of crap.
1100297	1103981	But the PSP is still chugging along, and now it's chugging along at a lower price.
1104021	1105823	That's been people's number one bitch about the system.
1105863	1107324	Well, now the core system is only $169.99.
1107765	1108786	That is a drop from the $199.99.
1111792	1112372	and DarkSakura.com.
1145080	1145420	Touche.
1174489	1181776	and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking with phones and stuff like that.
1182316	1185499	Not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.
1185619	1188241	Unfortunately, there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.
1188762	1192185	So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?
1192885	1194427	I don't know, probably a while.
1195127	1200332	But yeah, there's a YouTube video up out there, so if you want to see it in action.
1201479	1206344	You can do that, but of course, if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.
1209146	1209506	Alright.
1212850	1213330	You know what?
1213911	1214071	What?
1214091	1215552	I think we should all just move anyway.
1216273	1216753	Just move?
1217194	1217774	Yeah, why not?
1218355	1218935	Make our own country.
1218955	1219696	What brought that on?
1220096	1223760	And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any games.
1223980	1224420	Yay!
1224520	1225721	Games more expensive!
1225922	1226522	Awesome!
1226963	1227263	Anyway.
1228527	1236431	There's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final Fantasy XIII available on the PlayStation 3 Network.
1238232	1251599	Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this spring, thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year, the honor will go to the PlayStation Network.
1252139	1256021	As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.
1256362	1256882	That'd be funny.
1257835	1262137	Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing, though.
1262537	1266599	Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?
1267059	1267439	Right.
1267459	1268519	That would be something else.
1268559	1272201	It might hit Japan's store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.
1272841	1273661	Not necessarily.
1274662	1278563	Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the U.S., right?
1279023	1279703	Well, there's ways.
1282315	1284697	There's... Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.
1284977	1286678	Yeah, but then all the text isn't Japanese.
1286698	1287279	Who cares?
1287439	1288760	It doesn't matter.
1290461	1290801	All right.
1291401	1292963	Well, another who cares for me.
1293003	1303830	You know, we've been talking a lot this episode about Guitar Hero, and Hands-On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.
1304931	1309654	You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar Hero on the cell phone?
1309674	1310475	Because you know it's going to suck.
1311363	1315927	I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, rhythm games, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks.
1317048	1319330	So why would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?
1321152	1322873	People should stop gaming on cell phones.
1323714	1324675	Hey, I play Luminous.
1325696	1326697	Yeah, Luminous is okay.
1327117	1332042	Tell that to fucking NVIDIA, or not NVIDIA, Nokia.
1332722	1333123	Nokia.
1333363	1334023	Yeah, Nokia.
1334344	1336806	The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.
1337587	1337887	That's it.
1338735	1339596	We don't need anything else.
1339956	1340336	You know what?
1340376	1341637	Cell phone game is pretty awesome.
1341677	1345059	It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive.
1345079	1350403	Instead of trying to play your stupid mobile games at red lights.
1352084	1352424	Anyways.
1353005	1354506	Apply Makeup, the game.
1357147	1357748	That's horrible.
1358048	1359529	Actually, I think they do have a game like that, too.
1359669	1360069	Do they really?
1360109	1360570	Like Barbie?
1360590	1361070	Scary enough.
1361090	1361830	Barbie cell phone game?
1362471	1364913	Have you seen women driving down the road and they're putting makeup on?
1364953	1366494	I've totally seen this in traffic.
1366534	1367714	Lipstick on the rear view mirror.
1367734	1368475	It's like, DRIVE!
1371656	1372356	Yeah, anyways.
1372796	1378938	Yeah, a little bit of makeup is not going to transform you from, you know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen.
1378998	1386780	So, anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little bit.
1388040	1396723	There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, John Tam...
1398092	1399873	who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.
1399893	1404514	I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy that you got?
1404574	1409416	I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Launch YouTube.
1409896	1414058	If you look at our account, you can see this guy that got the smackdown here.
1414078	1417959	Anyway, so the, yeah, settlement has been reached.
1418600	1425222	They are no longer able to, there's some interesting stuff I read on this because it didn't make any sense at all.
1426095	1426936	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1445555	1453039	Another part of the injunction, I guess, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer based games for the next year.
1453440	1458963	Nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero 2 until six months after the game's release.
1461304	1462185	And some other stuff like that.
1465247	1465987	That kind of sucks.
1466247	1469689	Oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos for a while.
1471971	1472451	This is what
1473015	1474716	DarkSakura, who sent us anthrax this week?
1504338	1504841	My mother.
1506289	1506993	How evil of her.
1507195	1507436	Okay.
1508241	1511103	First email, hi, it's Zayd from London again.
1512004	1516007	I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition.
1516487	1520430	I was reading about it on the net and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.
1521151	1528716	Also, I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any idea if us Brits will get that too?
1529357	1532479	Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?
1532639	1534781	Always have a good one, Zayd Mohamed.
1536115	1539998	Oh, and last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.
1540038	1540839	I hope this one is better.
1541600	1543101	Yeah, I'm a bitch.
1543461	1545203	Don't even bother.
1545403	1549186	Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where DarkSakura's admitting she's a bitch?
1550527	1551428	No, I'm proud.
1551628	1551909	Heart.
1552749	1553410	Hey, Rob.
1553770	1553950	What?
1554150	1555932	Broken heart!
1556052	1556272	Bitch.
1557133	1559135	Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, yes, it's happening.
1559295	1561717	We don't know much, but we talked about it in Part A, right?
1561977	1562878	So go download Part A.
1563668	1568412	Um, as far as DVD playback on the Wii, um, well, I think that's been announced previously.
1568932	1570894	How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?
1571554	1572235	Hooray!
1572715	1574757	That could be the tenth DVD player in my house.
1575537	1580080	But, you know, for the little kid with the Wii in his bedroom, you know, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.
1582863	1583403	Yes, Loki.
1584123	1585244	Gateway to Porn!
1585505	1586285	That's what it is!
1586385	1587426	Gateway to Porn!
1587486	1591129	Now that can play all the porn DVDs, so it's Gateway to Porn.
1591989	1592590	Hooray!
1594433	1596654	Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?
1597934	1598774	Eventually, I'm sure.
1598914	1600495	Yes, but six months later than us.
1600835	1602795	Because Nintendo hates you.
1604015	1606296	Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.
1608216	1608596	Anyway.
1609076	1609977	Next email, please, Rob.
1610197	1613617	I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.
1613837	1615798	I feel sorry for you guys.
1616478	1617678	Something to do with the Revolutionary War.
1617698	1619739	We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.
1619759	1620679	We'll figure something out.
1621620	1624643	We got an email from Ron Says Don't Call Him Cute.
1626625	1628567	We call Ron... He was the young one.
1629548	1632631	Aww, the cute little kid that emailed us a Pokemon.
1632691	1634973	Next email from AZHP.
1636178	1650625	Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast waiting for my vector calculus class to start, and Rob started playing Blow My Whistle, I inadvertently began bobbing my head, and before I knew it, I was breakdancing outside the classroom.
1651005	1651946	And then the music stopped.
1652366	1653587	I was sad.
1654167	1656088	Sad face.
1656668	1664572	But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2, and for that I wanted to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.
1664752	1665793	We lived confused.
1667233	1676201	That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little bit of it and makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.
1677663	1678864	Oh, but I do, I do, I do.
1678904	1680946	That song was horrible.
1681306	1682147	Next email!
1682327	1683028	Alright, yes.
1683188	1683908	Dear LLR crew,
1693427	1696928	First of all, congratulations to DarkSakura for graduating and getting certified.
1696948	1697328	You rock.
1697468	1698468	I know, thank you.
1699049	1700109	Finally, someone else says it.
1700649	1705050	Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program is produced.
1705870	1709431	Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.
1709651	1713312	I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.
1713853	1716393	Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?
1716873	1717033	Yeah.
1717273	1722055	Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner, but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland.
1722255	1722795	Yeah, it was.
1724582	1751416	It seems that I have recently begun to crave pinball mightily, and while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate a proper table with flippers and steel balls, and lanes and bumpers in popular culture tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.
1752148	1758972	It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate, and so I put the question to you, where might I find good local pinball?
1759752	1761433	Not at RBGL, shit.
1762174	1763434	Oh, there's a PS on here.
1763635	1765676	My profound thanks, WarriorBob.
1766456	1770438	PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's house.
1770859	1775141	But I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking creepy.
1776062	1778563	PPS, Byright promised me pinball once that they were liars.
1778763	1780244	Because Byright's a piece of crap!
1781162	1782944	Um, Scandia had a bunch of machines.
1783224	1784606	I haven't been there in a long time, though.
1785226	1786428	Uh, off Madison and I-80.
1786448	1788250	Have you seen the weird thing that they've got up there now?
1788270	1791032	Their new little, like, we're gonna throw you up in the air thing?
1791313	1792174	That ride they have?
1792214	1793355	That thing is scary looking.
1793455	1796238	As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.
1796298	1798420	What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.
1798480	1804206	Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my god, Scandia has got this new ride called...
1804486	1805868	The motherfucking eyesore.
1806929	1809311	Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.
1809411	1810292	It's called the pooflinger.
1810332	1812034	Hey, email, right?
1812474	1813635	Yes, but I want to say real quick.
1813936	1818500	The last time I went to Scandia, which granted was a couple years ago, they have like seven pinball machines there.
1818780	1819881	RVGL's machines are shit.
1820102	1820902	They don't have anything now.
1821083	1821924	They have like two machines.
1823365	1827209	Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.
1828354	1829335	And I'm not even joking.
1829475	1830675	I sadly wouldn't doubt that.
1831016	1836439	Honestly, it really, she has like at least six or seven operational machines and they're free.
1836859	1843043	At present, I have, and not all of them are mine because unfortunately Dan's friend Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.
1843343	1844364	So we have a Bride of Pinbot.
1844944	1847426	We've got, what else do I have?
1847486	1856191	I have Bride of Pinbot, Judge Dredd, Whodunit, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Guns and Roses, Star Trek The Next Generation.
1856231	1856871	What the fuck?
1857372	1857812	What is that?
1858754	1861256	Xtifer and Nelly are in here because they're waiting for Match Game.
1861356	1863838	And since we haven't acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.
1864218	1867680	They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher.
1868341	1872323	And apparently Xtifer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.
1872744	1873344	That was Nelly.
1873664	1874224	Oh, it was Nelly.
1874265	1876126	But then Xtifer drew this little... It looks like a bone.
1876366	1878487	But then it drew I heart bunny.
1879008	1880569	And there's this picture of a bunny there.
1880589	1881489	I think it's supposed to be a cat.
1881729	1883270	With a teeny tiny penis.
1883511	1885952	With a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.
1886433	1886533	What?
1892989	1895189	Only X can bring this show to a screeching halt.
1895269	1895890	Next email!
1896450	1897370	I was still answering his question.
1898691	1902332	I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch.
1902372	1904893	Johnny Mnemonic and Creature from the Black Lagoon.
1905613	1907934	Honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.
1908034	1910194	If you want to play, you've got my number.
1911695	1913155	It won't be creepy if you call.
1913836	1914956	I have friends at my house.
1915979	1918340	It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.
1918401	1921582	DarkSakura owns a gun anyway, so she'll... I own several.
1921823	1922403	And knives.
1923844	1924964	And I know how to use them.
1925965	1928447	And if you think I'm joking, no.
1928567	1932009	I actually... Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?
1933249	1934370	Knife-wielding snakes.
1934730	1935811	No, I asked for a Beretta.
1936131	1937192	They should have a gun spork.
1939153	1939673	Any more emails?
1940394	1940694	Yes!
1941174	1941715	There's three more.
1943776	1943876	Um...
1947852	1948092	Okay.
1948732	1949573	Hey, OLR.
1949693	1951653	First, I want to say that I love the podcast.
1951673	1953453	I hope you guys continue it for a long time.
1954034	1958274	Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.
1958655	1973478	I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there that, A, appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower, but not something that would bore them like Roller Coaster Tycoon, B, do not have a frustrating learning curve, C, are $25 American or less.
1975881	1978843	and Dee do not have a monthly fee such as World of Warcraft.
1978903	1979724	That about covers it.
1979844	1980685	Thanks, GamerDad.
1982166	1986910	I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.
1987291	1988912	It is over $25.
1989333	1993776	However, you will not have a registration fee.
1994477	1996999	Aren't there parental controls available for Guild Wars?
1997019	1999461	You can censor the dirty language and stuff.
1999502	2000582	You can censor it out.
2001463	2005345	Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment.
2006286	2012149	Considering that I pay $14 a month for World of Warcraft, after four months you've paid for the game, pretty much.
2013810	2019814	Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.
2019834	2021335	I would assume that you don't have a Mac.
2021815	2027839	So I would recommend that you play, I don't know, actually Star Wars Battlefront 2 maybe.
2027899	2029900	It's a bit old and it might be cheap now.
2030322	2031803	Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.
2031823	2038545	That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.
2038665	2040466	If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, Tetranet.
2040586	2040966	Tetranet.
2041046	2042607	Isn't that kind of a violent game?
2060550	2065593	I know you said the Rollercoaster Tycoon would bore them, but Civilization is a heck of a lot of fun.
2089401	2090481	I played it when I was 12, the original one.
2120069	2121289	and use that as your criteria.
2121429	2123210	Mandarin, you have any suggestions?
2123250	2123770	I saw one.
2124810	2130332	Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though that the first episode is $32, each of the following are only $9.
2130432	2142735	And they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts, which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kids' time on the computer to like, you know, an hour or so.
2143376	2148017	It'll give them a little bit more play time throughout the whole thing versus other games where it's, you know, takes...
2152201	2157503	Don't kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, even for kids, boy or girl.
2158143	2160004	And they do really well.
2160784	2162265	Shut up.
2162365	2165006	I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad.
2165166	2168147	That you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie.
2168547	2170668	But apparently Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad.
2171028	2171328	Not bad.
2173288	2173408	Oh.
2174689	2174869	Sorry.
2175526	2177468	I was incorrect about the price, and I'm getting corrected here.
2177528	2182612	The season is $32, and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying the season.
2183072	2187255	But again, I said it's still a really good game, and it's kid-friendly.
2188756	2189417	Or you get GameTap.
2191138	2199485	You know, also, keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.
2200145	2203748	You know, I would say, you know, really...
2205299	2211464	Take those interests and look for things that associate with those interests that are within your price frame and have the criteria.
2211904	2216688	I mean, now, one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere... Okay, Rob.
2217609	2219711	Hero, I heart, pussy, Hitler.
2222053	2228278	There's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this page.
2228638	2230219	I'm going to pretend I never saw that.
2230239	2231540	Would you like to confiscate this note?
2232721	2233121	Frame it.
2233161	2233782	Hang it on your fridge.
2234284	2235624	Oh, Amanda needs to see Pussy Hitler.
2235925	2237425	I'll let Amanda guard it for me.
2241166	2242187	I'm sorry, Gamer Dad.
2242247	2244448	I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of thought.
2244768	2245328	Sorry, Gamer Dad.
2245348	2246028	Blame Rob.
2246208	2249749	You and your 13-year-old kids sound pretty cool, but we got Pussy Hitler in studio.
2250730	2252590	He said both of his sons were 13.
2252631	2253511	I wonder if they're twins.
2254051	2254331	Maybe.
2254611	2258092	So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together, too.
2259013	2261974	So, from the Rob D.,
2264585	2269047	I just listened to your April Fool's Day joke, and I gotta say, I'm cracking up like crazy.
2269607	2276070	I really shouldn't be laughing at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta and Matilda sent me over the edge.
2276770	2278311	Good idea, and it was pretty funny.
2278951	2279611	That said, Ms.
2279651	2282753	Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming, besides Ms.
2282793	2283833	Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.
2284574	2288335	She's just an independent woman in an open relationship.
2288755	2289876	She and Pac-Man have a kid.
2289916	2291036	Don't you remember the old cartoons?
2291456	2292497	Well, yeah, they did suck.
2293260	2294080	I think Goki was a better name.
2294100	2294221	Ermac.
2315572	2317994	Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show.
2318074	2322657	OLR has become a weekly fixture on my iPod, and its space on there is well-deserved.
2322997	2326180	Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do, and I'll keep on listening.
2326320	2326860	Smile face.
2327701	2328181	The rubdy.
2328661	2331243	Roberta's really glad to hear that you're a big fan.
2331263	2332484	You sound like Christy Alley.
2333345	2335346	And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.
2336287	2338168	I think Loki said it best.
2338188	2339189	You sounded like Christy Alley.
2340510	2340890	Let's see.
2341991	2343451	I didn't have to do a damn thing.
2344031	2350493	Not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most of the Internet's April Fool's joke this year.
2350573	2352274	I think we seriously have one of the better ones.
2352334	2352794	I'm sorry.
2353634	2354735	I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.
2354775	2355535	We had a great joke.
2356095	2357056	I think that mine were great.
2357096	2359256	We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.
2359336	2361637	So visit dig.com and dig our episode.
2361657	2364258	By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.
2364418	2367559	I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.
2369411	2369611	Right now.
2369631	2377856	While you're digging in there, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's because they poked fun at MySpace, which was kind of amusing.
2378456	2379437	Who wants to touch it?
2381738	2381919	Oh.
2382859	2383800	This is not a joke.
2383840	2384560	Who wants to touch it?
2384960	2389503	Ah, it's the Christmas check finally making its way.
2390184	2393666	It got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally.
2394046	2397668	Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account filled up.
2397688	2398248	Fun, fun, fun.
2398869	2399029	So...
2400203	2406889	I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to Kristen for being, like, freaking rad.
2408450	2409170	Okay, now I'm done.
2410031	2411832	Being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.
2412533	2413774	Alright, what?
2413794	2416736	Alright, yeah, the 8-bit tie was awesome.
2417257	2418938	I know, I heard they're going to make it for real.
2419138	2419659	That's awesome.
2419739	2420139	I want one.
2420339	2421300	Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?
2422182	2425603	Alright, chat.orangelonsradio.com if you want to join our chat room.
2425643	2430365	I gave you the link there to dig where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.
2431806	2433827	Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.
2433867	2434907	They didn't have one this year.
2434967	2436608	Yeah, whatever happened to that?
2436768	2437548	They did have one.
2438743	2440104	Rob found the joke, so Rob wins a no prize.
2466189	2472411	for anyone who is an old... Okay, I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.
2473691	2474591	Stop, okay.
2474751	2475431	Extrovert Drew.
2475451	2477152	We have extrovert Nelly in the room.
2477192	2480653	Now they can talk and not pass giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.
2480813	2482673	No, but it says, I heart mangina.
2483173	2485174	It looks like goat say that he drew on there.
2485674	2489835	Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and you fools can leave?
2490355	2490655	All right.
2491556	2491896	Heart.
2492456	2492696	All right.
2493683	2495003	Quick, more video game stories.
2495463	2496644	This one's about violence.
2497164	2498144	Everybody likes violence.
2499705	2501045	Well, let's see.
2501125	2509627	There was a study recently that was done that looked at 120 children before and after a 20-minute Quake 2 session.
2509647	2513748	The study was done by Swineburn University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.
2515368	2521570	And it said that while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending on their emotional state before playing,
2521909	2525730	The majority of kids were not affected by the game violence at all.
2526450	2530651	So in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they won't act out on it after they play a video game.
2530671	2531232	Who would have thought?
2553427	2554368	Who would have thunk it?
2555088	2559130	Anyways, well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.
2559630	2561411	Well, I like violent games, I don't know who wouldn't.
2561892	2570256	But apparently the Parappa the Rapper creator, he wants less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.
2570296	2578961	I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but... Anyways, apparently Masaya Matsuura, creator of Parappa the Rapper...
2579582	2580182	That's all I've got.
2580202	2580662	That's all I've got.
2596858	2612330	He was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers and also basically said at the recent Australian GO3 conference, making good games that everybody can play is a very high priority.
2614552	2614912	I don't know.
2615893	2616573	It's interesting.
2616653	2623799	He was saying also that he wants faster TVs because I guess he's talking about the delay between, you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.
2625629	2626329	More rhythm games.
2626369	2626989	Who would have thought it?
2629750	2631211	How about we just get another Parappa sequel?
2631251	2632511	Oh, I hit myself in the chin.
2632751	2634452	I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.
2634812	2635672	More Parappa!
2635772	2637513	Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.
2638493	2639153	Well, guess what?
2641314	2641534	What?
2642214	2642654	Chicken butt.
2643054	2652337	Anyway, they have signed up, though, and honestly, I don't really give two shits about the game, because I really don't give two shits about the movie either.
2654210	2660275	Peter Cullen and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers game.
2660635	2661096	Now, now, now.
2661416	2667341	The new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.
2667781	2668062	Really?
2668422	2669803	Why all the hate for Transformers?
2671545	2681453	Because seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.
2682865	2711353	maybe I'm gonna see it I haven't said I'm not gonna see it I will and I'll reserve my judgment my final judgment for when I see it but right now it doesn't seem right so I don't know but if Starscream is fucking awesome as usual because I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream when I was little so it better if it's cool then I'll go see it it's awesome and they have it I think it's on the internet
2712216	2713396	Too bad his voice actor's dead.
2715097	2715977	He was Cobra Commander.
2716957	2717757	COBRA!
2739232	2742414	I just want to have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.
2742454	2743414	I think that would be awesome.
2745775	2746155	Sorry.
2747736	2749817	Drink like some Drano and then you'll sound like him.
2751478	2753279	Alright kids, do you know what time it is?
2754940	2755660	Ice cream!
2755860	2757701	No, but almost as good.
2762023	2764545	It's time to play the match game!
2764625	2766906	Video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2800800	2802920	Remember the way match, wouldn't that be funny if no one called?
2804401	2805801	Remember the way, oh good, we already got a call.
2806181	2807822	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
2808402	2808962	It's Zappy.
2809622	2811223	Zappy, what's on your mind, buddy?
2812063	2814364	I'm just hoping I don't lose at the match game.
2814464	2817625	Alright, well you got in first, congratulations, you're going to play a match game with us tonight.
2818425	2819966	I know I'm not going to get any matches at all.
2820066	2823307	That's alright, people usually don't here on the match game, but that's alright.
2823717	2823997	Zappy vs. GS68
2851954	2859596	Alright, celebrity number one is somebody you haven't really seen on this show a whole lot, but she's back tonight here to match some questions with you.
2859916	2860797	Say hello to Mandarin!
2861877	2862837	Hi!
2864258	2867619	Alright, that was a very somewhat non-sexy hi.
2869619	2872160	How are you guys doing?
2872200	2875861	Do you have any clubs or organizations you'd like to plug while you're here?
2876875	2879056	Charity you're playing for.
2879096	2882438	Charity, um, get Rob Lane more?

2886180	2889381	Anyway, also joining us tonight is celebrity number two.
2890022	2894684	You know him for such films as, what did Orko in chat say?
2894704	2895764	That was like the best thing ever.
2896425	2898086	By the way, that's one of my favorite nicknames ever.
2900327	2904769	He's been in such films as Pussy Hitler and Penis Stalin vs. Mangina.
2905464	2907045	Say hello to Extifer!
2907886	2909046	Hello everybody.
2909807	2913109	And the microphone has been placed in guest number three's boobies!
2913529	2915671	Wait, wait, what?
2915751	2917252	Oh, what charity are you playing for, Extifer?
2918052	2919273	The Boobies of America.
2919293	2921935	We can't hear, you gotta get... The Boobies of America!
2921955	2923075	Alright, the Boobies of America.
2923596	2931561	Alright, um, guest number three tonight is known for her massive cleavage that stores microphones in them.
2932097	2934559	and also known on this program as The Wife.
2934819	2935680	Say hello to Nellie.
2936641	2937061	Hello.
2937381	2938902	What charity are you playing for tonight, Nellie?
2939523	2940944	Battered Wives of America.
2940964	2941844	All right.
2942305	2946228	Celebrity number four is the often outspoken guest of Orange Lounge Radio.

2984316	2984696	It's me.
2985437	2986537	And I'm playing for the...
2987628	2988849	Oh, do you want me to do it as Roberta?
2989069	2990110	No, no, no.
2990370	2992332	Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?
2992592	2993954	Because we don't like Christy Alley.
2993994	2994314	All right.
2994995	2996176	Well, I'm playing... Christy Alley, whatever.
2996196	2999579	Well, my charity is the Save Fat Actress TV Show Foundation.
2999619	3001180	That's my charity.
3001680	3004143	All right, so... Oh, we had a guy on the phone.
3004183	3005464	Zappy, are you still there, or did you hang up?
3005904	3006585	Nope, I'm still here.
3006625	3007145	Hi, Zappy.
3007165	3008326	So, do you know how the game works?
3009067	3009227	Yeah.
3009527	3013711	All right, we're going to be asking you some questions, and you've got to tell us what goes in the blank...
3014358	3015279	and everybody here in studio.
3015299	3019022	Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer?
3019042	3021224	I will try to remember.
3021764	3021965	Right.
3022245	3025508	If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.
3025548	3026548	You ready for your first clue?
3027189	3027469	Mm-hmm.
3027689	3028390	All right, here we go.
3028890	3030071	Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.
3030091	3033334	You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.
3033374	3034936	All right, here is question number one.
3035616	3036657	There's four questions tonight.
3037398	3042402	Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2 but got a defective controller.
3043380	3046902	Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.
3047543	3054808	Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know, I'll make this game more exciting.
3055428	3058130	I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
3063674	3066516	Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.
3066576	3069017	Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.
3069778	3073020	Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know,
3073462	3074663	I'll make this game more exciting.
3074723	3077004	I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
3078085	3078986	Celebrities are thinking.
3083929	3085310	And I'm gonna say, ding.
3085530	3086171	Alright.
3086271	3087532	Mandarin's thinking.
3087552	3089633	Mandarin's doing research on Wikipedia.
3089793	3090914	Alright, Mandarin's...
3104466	3105107	X4, you good?
3106508	3107689	I'm good.
3108370	3109070	Loki, you good?
3109871	3110251	I'm good.
3110292	3110832	DarkSakura?
3112614	3113354	All right, here it is.
3114555	3116257	I have to make sure our chatter got it, too.
3116417	3116858	Okay, there we go.
3116918	3117518	All right, here we go.
3117538	3120081	Do you have an answer, Zappy, yet?
3120861	3121041	Yeah.
3121202	3121822	Okay, here we go.
3122042	3122403	I know.
3122783	3124244	I'll make this game more exciting.
3124625	3126787	I'll install five fret buttons on a... Dildo.
3128513	3130414	Dildo, says Zappy.
3130574	3132376	I just hope the chatroom doesn't fail me.
3132436	3132856	Good answer.
3132876	3133876	All right, there we go.
3133977	3136138	And GS68 said, Weemote.
3136878	3139020	So we have Dildo and Weemote.
3139100	3140821	Let's go around and see who's a match.
3140861	3142922	Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?
3144023	3144784	It was a very close.
3144824	3146705	I said a gigantic horse dildo.
3147245	3148706	Gigantic horse dildo.
3148746	3149347	Judges.
3149807	3150747	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3150827	3151708	All right, good job.
3151768	3152969	Zappy, off to a great start.
3152989	3154070	You matched on the very first one.
3154750	3155070	All right.
3155651	3155811	Extifer.
3155831	3156091	Extifer.
3156755	3158036	Five fret buttons on A?
3158716	3160737	I said strand of asshole hair.
3161678	3163139	Strand of asshole hair.
3165100	3165961	Wow, okay.
3166041	3167081	Dirty asshole hair.
3167141	3168562	I don't know how I got that one.
3168602	3169903	Do I get that one, judges?
3170023	3174105	No, unfortunately no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.
3174146	3174446	All right.
3175426	3182651	Nelly, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.
3185888	3188711	The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.
3189331	3191433	Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.
3192114	3205886	All right, Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A. You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.
3206348	3208589	and Dildo, another match for Zappy.
3208649	3209690	Good job, Zappy.
3209830	3211031	Two to nothing.
3211071	3212272	Sorry, GS68.
3212592	3214993	That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.
3215454	3216114	DarkSakura.
3216354	3220937	I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.
3221077	3221537	There you go.
3221597	3223258	Dildo, three to nothing.
3223318	3223819	Ding, ding, ding.
3223859	3224239	All right.
3224299	3224979	Wow, Zappy.
3225680	3226801	You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.
3227261	3227521	All right.
3227841	3231584	My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say Dildo because this is my thing.
3231664	3233885	I said a Pringles can because I like food.
3233905	3234765	What?
3236182	3237563	5 red buttons on a Pringles can.
3237683	3241965	I like that I expanded for this.
3242486	3242766	Alright.
3243206	3244427	Did expanded give you that answer?
3244947	3245147	Yeah.
3245587	3245827	Alright.
3246088	3252151	Well, Pringles cans, you know, Pringles suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth some.
3252331	3255232	Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.
3255292	3259135	You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.
3259155	3259475	You ready?
3260275	3260815	Alright, here we go.
3261156	3261956	Question number two.
3262937	3263437	Loki...
3264164	3271008	Thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this year's E3 event.
3272188	3282333	When Loki walked through the door, though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when he exclaimed, Wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.
3288416	3291138	Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3 event.
3291840	3295082	But when he walked through the door, he realized that Namco had the last laugh.
3295422	3298004	He exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.
3309831	3311732	This isn't E3, this is a blank.
3313013	3315474	The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question.
3315514	3318576	I'll just have to, like, do charades or something.
3322265	3322665	I did straight.
3322705	3323846	All right.
3325146	3326207	This is an E3.
3326247	3326987	This is a blank.
3327407	3328848	DarkSakura needs clarification.
3329428	3329548	Oh.
3329728	3331469	Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?
3332109	3332389	All right.
3332609	3332849	Yes.
3333350	3333670	All right.
3334030	3335391	Do you understand the question, Zappy?
3335431	3335951	Am I crazy?
3336531	3337591	No, I completely understand.
3337611	3337792	All right.
3337812	3338172	Thank you.
3338232	3338792	I'm not crazy.
3338832	3339092	All right.
3339692	3340133	Ding.
3340813	3341113	Ding.
3341153	3341973	Nelly, ding.
3342073	3342814	Extrovert, ding.
3342974	3343674	Mandarin, ding.
3344134	3345015	DarkSakura, ding.
3345055	3345915	Loki, ding.
3346195	3346455	All right.
3346495	3346875	Here we go.
3347696	3348096	Zappy.
3349662	3354824	Loki exclaimed, this is an E3, this is a... Porno convention.
3355204	3357145	A porno convention.
3357245	3361026	All right, and GS68 said, a gay bar.
3361566	3364047	All right, so we have porno convention and gay bar.
3364547	3366268	Mandarin, what did you say?
3366308	3372650	This is an E3, this is a... I think they both might actually get it, because mine's a combination, a gay orgy.
3373490	3376891	A gay orgy, not going to work.
3377011	3378592	I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.
3379893	3384775	Xtifer, this is an E3, this is... A Frankie Muniz convention.
3385135	3386856	A Frankie Muniz convention.
3386916	3391918	Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.
3391998	3394519	It's almost like a gay bar, but no, it doesn't work.
3395960	3408085	Nelly, this is an E3, this is a... The funny thing is, is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all-naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife.
3409952	3411313	DarkSakura,
3440183	3441104	Orgy of Suck.
3441784	3445906	An orgy of suck that's almost like a gay bar, but no.
3446806	3447067	All right.
3448187	3452509	And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something?
3452989	3456211	It's like, damn, why is there all these women here?
3456271	3457051	This sucks.
3457232	3458312	Where are the games?
3458492	3458792	All right.
3458852	3459933	Although maybe I would say that.
3460113	3462334	My answer, this is an E3.
3462674	3464415	This is a gay bathhouse.
3465596	3465876	I don't know.
3465896	3467076	Is that a match with gay bar?
3467097	3467917	No.
3470067	3477789	I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.
3477969	3480089	Why would they have a Frankie Muniz convention?
3480289	3481730	Nelly says yes, I say yes.
3485250	3487831	DarkSakura says no, Loki says no.
3488011	3488711	Sorry, GS68.
3488831	3490551	No, Loki said yes.
3490891	3494752	Gay bathhouse and gay bar, are they the same thing, DarkSakura?
3495826	3497288	DarkSakura.com
3514358	3515279	That's true, they do have a pool.
3515299	3523104	Because with the match game, the person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people choosing for him again.
3523244	3526546	Only in certain years they did that, and then they didn't do that in a few years.
3526566	3527347	That's cheating, then.
3527567	3527947	No, it's not.
3528067	3528527	You're cheating.
3528567	3529948	Shut up, Nellie.
3530369	3530929	Hey, look.
3531770	3535252	If I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her until she did it.
3535292	3535712	Rob!
3536433	3536673	What?
3537293	3538074	Get in your place.
3539254	3539995	Answer the thing.
3540135	3540876	Sorry, Miss Jamie.
3541436	3542437	Alright, question.
3542517	3542837	Right.
3543713	3545195	Watch it all break out the paddle again.
3545435	3546676	Question number three.
3546856	3548037	The Robby Goodstick.
3549098	3550459	Oh, this is a question about Jamie.
3550479	3551100	This should be good.
3551600	3552061	Yay!
3552501	3553222	You ready, Zappy?
3553762	3554042	Yep.
3554102	3554643	Three to one.
3554663	3555784	You feeling the heat a little bit?
3556525	3557145	I'm not ready.
3557185	3557545	All right.
3557866	3558266	Here we go.
3559147	3564412	While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pinbot machine for sale.
3565372	3570597	The machine costs $1,000, though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.
3571618	3579162	Being the ever-clever game collector and negotiator, though, Jamie told the salesman, I really want that pinbot machine.
3579742	3581783	I would trade you my blank for it.
3586486	3587106	Where's my music?
3591308	3593990	I really want that pinbot machine.
3594110	3596031	I would trade you my blank for it.
3597532	3597892	All right.
3598572	3600013	Dang, this one's easy for me.
3601707	3602907	Uh-oh, did I copy-paste that to GS68?
3602967	3608529	Oh, never mind, he got it anyway.
3608649	3610289	I would trade you my blank for it.
3610549	3611069	Ding.
3613370	3614170	X-Force said ding.
3615610	3616031	Ding.
3616371	3616931	DarkSakura?
3617211	3617511	All right.
3618451	3619111	That was quick.
3620432	3623492	When the question's about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.
3623552	3625073	All right, I would trade you my blank for it.
3626013	3629814	Zappy, I would trade you my... Massage table.
3630327	3631968	Massage Table.
3632048	3633248	Okay, Massage Table.
3635109	3636490	That is something very precious to her.
3637010	3640532	All right, GS68 said... I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.
3640732	3646034	GS68 said, I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.
3646054	3647395	Which is great because it'll got me.
3647535	3647995	Ha ha.
3649796	3652918	It could be... Well, what about your behind virginity?
3654778	3656119	Ew, we're not going there, Rob.
3656139	3657860	How about your behind virginity?
3659811	3663373	Rob, you just ruined my answer.
3663433	3663993	Alright, shut up.
3665474	3666194	Mandarin.
3667134	3668715	We have virginity and massage table.
3669635	3670635	I want that pinball machine.
3670696	3674957	I would trade you my... Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.
3675657	3677918	Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.
3677958	3679399	Is that a match with massage table?
3681580	3683020	That goes with massage services.
3683460	3684161	I say no.
3684221	3684961	That's a half a point.
3685821	3686742	Half a point!
3686842	3687262	I say no.
3688804	3690405	The table is what you do it with.
3690425	3690605	Fine.
3690925	3691806	Half a point for Zappy.
3692686	3693207	I'm outvoted.
3693727	3694167	Half a point.
3694948	3696689	See, now I have to write half.
3697089	3697669	Alright, there we go.
3698269	3698790	Extra fur.
3698930	3699710	I want that pin on me.
3700831	3702372	I went for the most obvious.
3702472	3708395	I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.
3710957	3715199	It's amazing that DarkSakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.
3717123	3720405	Frankie Munoz's ass... She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.
3720465	3722786	A strand of Frankie Munoz's asshole hair in a Pringles can.
3723906	3727188	You know, that's actually one of my prized treasures.
3728748	3733090	All right, Nellie, I would trade you a... I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.
3734390	3735411	B-Imon, all right.
3736471	3737632	Loki, well, see, I would have matched.
3737652	3738172	I would have got a point.
3738232	3745395	Loki, I would trade you my... Well, where would, you know, one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Babies?
3746381	3750243	Iraqi Suicide Baby, which DarkSakura also happens to own one.
3750903	3755344	DarkSakura, I would trade you my husband for it.
3756905	3760186	And my answer was, I really want that pinball machine.
3760266	3762327	I would trade you my husband for it.
3762407	3764208	I also said husband, so there it is.
3764948	3766549	Husband was the answer to go with in that round.
3767409	3767749	All right.
3768569	3769690	One more question.
3770070	3770830	You ready, Zappy?
3771430	3771631	Yep.
3771891	3772111	All right.
3772131	3775472	Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.
3779228	3794379	Xtifer played the Lord of the Rings online MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.
3795379	3800743	He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?
3801383	3805026	I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank messages.
3811778	3812679	Lord of the Rings.
3813179	3816201	I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
3830691	3832512	All right, GS68 has an answer.
3832812	3833273	I'm ding.
3833293	3837135	How about the other celebrities?
3837175	3839277	All right, let me read the question again, see if it inspires some folks.
3840282	3844865	Extover played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.
3845425	3849007	He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?
3849548	3852430	I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
3859554	3860615	This is the best song ever.
3863416	3866058	Okay, Nelly finally dinged.
3866238	3866618	Extover?
3867159	3867799	Sure, ding.
3868179	3869100	Mandarin, eh, ding.
3869160	3869400	All right.
3869798	3872259	We have some very apathetic celebrities.
3872319	3873039	Last question, though.
3873059	3873419	Here we go.
3873459	3876100	Before this segment gets drawn on way too long, as if it hasn't already.
3877340	3877940	Zappy.
3879080	3879800	Lord of the Rings.
3879960	3883261	I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... A slut.
3883941	3884702	A slut.
3885522	3885802	Okay.
3886002	3886462	A slut.
3886542	3886962	There you go.
3887762	3892864	GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.
3893724	3896364	Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.
3896404	3896624	All right.
3896644	3898945	Let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.
3899298	3904780	Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game again unless a creator sent me... Pussy.
3905360	3905920	Pussy!
3906381	3907341	Is that a match for slut?
3907361	3909922	I don't know where you're coming from.
3910302	3911803	No, because the slut could be male or female.
3913183	3916264	Alright, Extifer, true story though, you did play the game, right?
3916304	3916544	Yeah.
3916664	3917105	And it sucked?
3917785	3918725	It sucked balls.
3919185	3920026	What was so bad about it?
3921026	3926048	Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.
3926890	3928390	I don't know, I don't like purple balls.
3928771	3931231	Like, if you're going to suck my balls, be gentle.
3931611	3941034	Alright, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me my butt virginity back.
3942875	3945415	Because I'm pretty loose down there.
3946476	3948536	I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.
3954338	3955278	Oh, this show sucks.
3956336	3958337	Shit just falls right out of me.
3958417	3959097	It's horrible.
3959417	3962579	I should get a colostomy bag.
3966540	3977105	Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless your creator's chatroom is just exploding with, oh my god, oh god, oh.
3977845	3981226	That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.
3981987	3985468	Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.
3991726	3999069	Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.
3999509	4002510	His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.
4002810	4005991	A very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly, but unfortunately not a match.
4006511	4016755	Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creator sent me... I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie Muna's butt hair in a Pringles can.
4017215	4018836	In a Pringles can, all right.
4020486	4021107	DarkSakura.
4021367	4022547	And NakedSweatyManslut.
4023168	4024368	And NakedSweatyManslut.
4024448	4025809	I think that's a match with slut.
4026489	4027549	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
4027649	4029030	So Zappy, you got another point.
4029930	4034492	I think Mandarin should get it because pussy is a slut.
4034632	4035372	No, that doesn't count.
4035772	4037213	DarkSakura actually used the word slut.
4037233	4037653	It doesn't matter.
4037713	4044676	Zappy's still going to win anyway because GS68 would somehow have to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't see happening.
4045116	4047337	But my answer, just so you know, was...
4047830	4053652	Frankie Munez as B. Hyman, which was not a match, but probably almost matched Loki's answer.
4054032	4058413	So Zappy, by a score of 4.5 to 1, you win!
4058833	4061854	Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.
4062134	4062935	Yeah, you did pretty good.
4062955	4064875	That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.
4064915	4065475	Congratulations.
4065495	4066656	It's all thanks to the chat room.
4066796	4074038	Yes, and just think, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.
4075057	4076238	I feel so special.
4076758	4077819	Alright, well congratulations.
4078039	4080741	Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?
4081362	4081562	Alright.
4081782	4084204	In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?
4084724	4084905	Good.
4085265	4086206	Any other comments you want to give?
4086226	4087406	Not really.
4087447	4089168	Alright, well have a good week, Zappy.
4089188	4090189	Alright, thanks.
4090749	4092851	And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.
4093911	4095433	A nice effort from GS68.
4097354	4099055	And Extifer and Nelly have left.
4099996	4100617	Thank God.
4102577	4105618	Normality can come back and resume with the program.
4106659	4107019	Wow.
4109580	4110801	Let's get back to some game news.
4115683	4123967	If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.
4124407	4130210	They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.
4130973	4134294	So let's see, I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.
4134314	4141395	They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original console back from Microsoft.
4141735	4146737	Faster service, you get it back within five business days, and other enhanced customer care operations.
4147277	4150197	A new pledge from Xbox to you for your three rings of death.
4152878	4153638	That's all I have.
4154818	4157579	Anyways, some other fun stuff.
4158792	4168939	Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't downloaded it in another territory like I did.
4169800	4173723	But you get to play three single-player missions and get to check that out.
4173983	4175444	It's an okay average game.
4176485	4181308	But hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that anyway, so kind of worth checking out.
4181728	4185631	It's definitely a lot better than Chromehounds, that is for sure.
4186392	4188253	So if you're looking for a mech combat game,
4188660	4189000	There you go.
4189400	4189701	Why?
4190681	4192082	Why is it better than Chromehounds?
4192162	4193083	It's a lot faster.
4193103	4196225	I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for God's sakes.
4196925	4198846	Plus, you know, overall it looks good.
4199507	4201028	Just Chromehounds is very slow.
4201308	4202269	Just slow in everything.
4203349	4208352	Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words for snow in Inuit?
4209753	4217258	No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which makes you go really fast, and then like a quick boost.
4219488	4220088	Quick Boost.
4220948	4223109	Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.
4223149	4226529	The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets.
4226629	4233070	And then the super boost is just, you know, your typical anime, you know, robot flying over the ocean type thing.
4234571	4236711	Can you put two explicit tags on a show?
4237771	4238531	I was just wondering.
4239251	4239491	What?
4239852	4242292	You know, rated C for Christopher and N for Nelly.
4242632	4243772	Yeah, NC-17.
4243812	4245232	Somebody in chat already made that joke.
4245493	4246093	Nelly, Christopher, 17.
4246133	4247373	There you go.
4247413	4248273	All right.
4248949	4250271	Skyplane will be open very soon, kids.
4250751	4255817	Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack.
4256117	4267010	That's the Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn up mountain, and Trial Point, which is a modern day office complex.
4267759	4273880	with a background of a busy day, you know, behind a busy city behind it.
4275501	4277681	You can download it on Live Marketplace.
4278441	4279582	Actually, it's already up.
4279602	4280642	It was up there on the 6th.
4281482	4282942	It's 400 Microsoft points.
4284183	4285563	So, I'd say give it a try.
4285603	4286423	Lost Planet's pretty cool.
4288664	4289244	That is all.
4289264	4292425	Hey, Rob.
4292705	4294305	Sorry, I'm just checking the ratings right now.
4295197	4298538	And we really did lose five listeners during the Match Game segment live.
4298558	4298698	Yeah.
4301058	4301779	That was great.
4302699	4302999	All right.
4303039	4305799	The Skype line is open.
4305819	4307260	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4307300	4313621	Now, in seriousness, we usually start to lose a handful of people this late in the show.
4313641	4315042	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4315302	4319943	Or you can always call us on the Skype line as well.
4319963	4321243	The username is Orange Lounge Radio.
4321653	4331259	I want to play something for you guys real, real quick, though, because DMN left us a message, because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play for you guys, because you can leave us voicemails during the week.
4332680	4334301	Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.
4334742	4335762	This is DMN.
4336643	4339425	I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.
4339905	4347110	I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't, because I got forced to run a Soul Calibur III tournament.
4347682	4352485	So I killed the guy who didn't do it, and yeah, we're all good.
4352946	4356928	But I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here.
4358249	4360010	Hopefully one more from Closing Ceremonies.
4360390	4361411	Which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.
4361451	4367015	I want you guys to know how much people love Orange Lounge Radio, even if I force them to be crazy about it.
4367475	4370177	But yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.
4370357	4370857	Bye.
4372839	4374960	So live from SoccerCon, there's DMN.
4375515	4377696	Apparently there's fans of Orange Launch Radio at Sakuracom.
4378897	4379677	Sorry we couldn't come.
4380738	4383199	I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to Sakuracom.
4383219	4383719	Something happened.
4383799	4385620	We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out.
4386441	4387841	So maybe next year.
4388542	4389662	Let's go to Skyblind in the meanwhile.
4390203	4390983	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4391003	4391283	Who's this?
4392064	4393264	It's Legend of Zaku.
4393464	4394305	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
4394325	4394785	How you doing?
4395685	4396106	Pretty good.
4396426	4398667	Can you put two explicit tags on a podcast, do you think?
4400148	4400268	Um...
4401474	4405416	I'm not sure if that would... I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.
4406516	4407737	Anyways... Right, what's on your mind?
4407757	4416340	You heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonix is basically trying to give Konami a run for its money.
4416861	4418501	Right.
4419022	4421102	Also for the fact that Konami is lazy.
4421843	4424504	They haven't even shown any real initiative as trying to...
4425080	4425460	and many more.
4452051	4455754	Just for the fact that they're announcing that game after Rockman.
4456415	4462821	So it's like, they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries to release.
4463902	4465864	Just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.
4466124	4469327	To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?
4469507	4470228	I don't think it is.
4470348	4473471	I mean, at least Konami still has the Japanese market, if not now.
4473531	4474051	Right, of course.
4474672	4477795	Of course, they have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that
4478909	4483553	The way Harmonix managed to get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.
4484033	4485454	They have commercials for it.
4486254	4491378	And that and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in right now.
4493140	4496222	Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.
4496282	4497663	It was a huge, huge risk.
4498143	4501426	When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it was.
4501526	4505989	I know it was, but I mean, as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
4506827	4522030	So, you have, I mean, that was a damn good risk at best, but it's like, they need a lot more marketing if they want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, just to catch up to Harmonix's, you know...
4524816	4537613	So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides Karaoke Revolution, which they may not be known for much longer, If they want to push something like Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, they have to get a lot of marketing and a lot of American...
4538314	4540936	I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.
4540996	4543877	How could Konami make Beatmania a success in this country?
4565543	4594108	well they really have to focus on on basically licenses you know pick up like really good licenses you know like you know stuff like you know really good trance and techno and stuff like that and maybe like you know some decent hip-hop or something but yes you have to definitely push you know they have to do some more marketing they have to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost just like they did with DDR
4595267	4595447	All right.
4595467	4598188	Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.
4598208	4598848	We appreciate it.
4599108	4599388	All right.
4599408	4599709	Later, buddy.
4599729	4599909	Bye.
4600009	4600109	Bye.
4600249	4600649	All right.
4615987	4617688	Blackboy makes an interesting statement in chat.
4617708	4625711	He says, I love that because this is a Bomani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because another company improved on something that Bomani pioneered.
4627092	4628072	I wouldn't say I'm mad.
4628432	4631014	I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.
4631234	4634495	It made a great formula even better.
4634595	4641598	I mean, I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing to take, and it paid off.
4642038	4643359	So I can't be mad at that.
4643871	4645212	Hey, it's Ron, what's up everyone?
4672975	4673956	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4690862	4694584	An arcade machine right in front of people and people demonstrating it.
4694824	4705530	Seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks more easy, more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to me one of the reasons why they brought it over.
4705850	4713154	Yes, the other machines, the other franchises are risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is just like, you know what, hey, we did our thing.
4713414	4714175	Let's just call it a night.
4714195	4715115	Let's work on other stuff.
4715495	4718517	So you're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off
4719458	4721600	trying to Americanize guitar freaks in Germany.
4721620	4735028	I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods, the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming out with.
4735048	4735948	Yeah, exactly.
4736209	4741172	I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.
4741232	4744394	I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?
4744554	4744854	I mean...
4746368	4753993	They probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX or maybe Guitar Freaks or something like that.
4756135	4768583	By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple sources and contacts that I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as far as the home version went.
4769150	4778157	So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem to be, like, that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Ranma, that, you know, even though they could go for it, they're not choosing to.
4778798	4779078	I don't know.
4779398	4779899	Exactly.
4780039	4787324	I mean, with the much money they've made off the B-Mani games, for them to bring over B-Mani, it wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?
4788225	4790567	FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.
4790627	4796792	Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis' problem, is to think that arcades are relevant enough to give a fuck.
4797205	4800147	Arcades are dead in the US, that's why they don't give a fuck.
4800408	4811737	Interesting point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar Hero and this Rock Band game would be made for a console on the outset.
4812196	4812736	Kind of interesting.
4813317	4822901	Yeah, exactly, because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men.
4822981	4834126	It was a Konami game, and now, nowadays, the only place you can find a half-decent arcade if you're in a big town where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little podunk corner place, you know?
4834766	4835266	It's sad.
4835306	4837127	I really hope arcades have a resurgence.
4837287	4837807	I really do.
4838108	4838488	I miss them.
4838548	4838948	Exactly.
4839864	4844846	I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.
4846066	4846966	Any other thoughts, Ranma?
4848847	4851548	That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.
4852748	4853189	Sure, why not?
4853909	4855149	Okay, this is really dirty.
4856129	4859171	Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.
4859211	4860111	How much worse can we get?
4860151	4860571	Go for it.
4861471	4866013	Okay, what does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?
4866333	4866593	What?
4867733	4869394	A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.
4872199	4878120	Bye Ranma, thanks for the call.
4878721	4881081	Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?
4882001	4884442	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4885302	4886082	Hey guys, how you doing?
4886102	4886683	This is Bandit.
4887263	4888263	Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?
4889123	4895905	Hey, what you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever be popular in this country.
4896765	4897185	Why is that?
4897325	4901066	I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, I mean, if you look at that game...
4902608	4912453	What the other couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now.
4912493	4916476	I mean, that game takes too much time to learn and things like that.
4916856	4918557	I mean, way too much dedication.
4918577	4923620	The casual gamer is not going to just walk into a place throwing 50 cents and just
4924488	4928110	Be great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?
4928291	4930312	But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard, too?
4930692	4945522	I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of dumbed-down modes, which Beatmania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place, because when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing Beatmania down.
4945862	4949425	But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?
4950287	4953149	Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.
4953230	4957573	I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.
4958734	4968603	I mean, you can see, I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.
4969343	4972626	Damn, I played, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?
4972666	4974068	Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.
4974408	4974928	That sounds hard.
4974948	4977631	I'm trying to think if Buckethead does that one.
4977891	4978071	Huh.
4979895	4980595	Well, anything else?
4982876	4983836	No, that's it for now.
4984456	4986156	And anything non-music?
4986176	4988477	Because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.
4988517	4990037	Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?
4991617	4996158	Right now, I mean, I picked up a... I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.
4996378	4999279	I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but I just haven't made that leap.
5000179	5002679	So I picked up God of War about a month ago.
5002699	5004520	I picked up God of War 2 when it came out.
5004680	5005540	Played through both of them.
5005560	5006100	They're really good.
5006857	5009438	I would definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet.
5009498	5013279	I mean, it's been maybe a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.
5014319	5016480	I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.
5017260	5020021	Well, there's that and Devil May Cry Collection.
5020261	5021722	It's like all three games for like $29.
5021762	5021902	Nice.
5021942	5023762	Definitely get that too.
5024062	5024482	Just might.
5024502	5026083	All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.
5026923	5027303	All right, bye guys.
5027323	5027843	All right, take care.
5028984	5029484	One more call.
5029504	5029924	What do you say?
5030024	5030284	One more.
5031125	5031945	You guys okay?
5032065	5032645	You guys doing all right?
5033451	5033711	Yes!
5034092	5046399	Sorry, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.
5046499	5049921	Alright, let's do one more call.
5050662	5051822	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio, who's this?
5052903	5054404	Hey guys, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.
5054604	5056025	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?
5057245	5060608	Uh, this whole damn argument is, like, pissing me off now.
5060968	5061108	Why?
5062802	5069285	Alright, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different things at the same time, they're the same thing.
5070806	5077209	First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level.
5079070	5082432	And I've done this, I've proven this by actually trying the game the other day.
5082852	5087294	Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four.
5088531	5091372	Guitar Hero actually passed me by missing half the damn song.
5091832	5093412	That's the first thing I've seen the difference.
5093552	5097793	Well, hold on, though, because doesn't the arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?
5098773	5099853	Stop breathing into the mic, please.
5099873	5100433	Yeah, careful.
5100453	5103074	You're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.
5104274	5104554	Sorry.
5104694	5105054	That's all right.
5106014	5110155	But, yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the arcade difficulty setting?
5111215	5115616	Yes, but most arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.
5116624	5120528	I don't really know too many arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right there, you know?
5122129	5123811	That's my first thought.
5125172	5127194	And then the second thought is also the song list.
5127995	5136542	And people keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freak's song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and very few American stuff that people recognize.
5137243	5142468	While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada yada yada, I can play this.
5143154	5143974	True, very true.
5145055	5150017	Something I've said kind of distinguishes the games that make Guitar Hero more successful here, yeah?
5150817	5159761	Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that both the difficulty level and the song list.
5159942	5163183	You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games.
5163243	5164604	I mean, you have DDR in your nickname.
5164804	5166344	What do you think of Rock Band?
5166364	5167505	Is it something you're going to check out?
5168410	5173891	I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't have much of an idea what it was about.
5175611	5181132	Real quickly, imagine, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?
5181452	5183353	Well, imagine doing that online.
5183653	5186393	Take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.
5187934	5193815	So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
5194015	5194695	But on the internet.
5195835	5196055	Hmm.
5197954	5201075	and Guitar Hero type songs.
5202875	5211536	That wouldn't be so bad, actually, because one thing people keep forgetting is that no game has actually included a karaoke type thing.
5211896	5215517	So that would actually make it different at the same time.
5216497	5216957	That's true.
5217938	5220618	Because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time.
5220678	5223979	Okay, now we have drums, guitars, and singers.
5225879	5226079	That's
5227284	5227964	It could be interesting.
5228104	5228445	We'll see.
5228785	5231026	Well, I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.
5232727	5233047	All right.
5233627	5234168	Take care, buddy.
5234188	5234948	Thanks for the perspective.
5235568	5236149	Hey, thanks, man.
5236269	5236689	No problem.
5237009	5237229	Later.
5237870	5238090	Later.
5238650	5238970	All right.
5239350	5241411	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
5241431	5242472	Thanks to those that called in.
5242492	5248575	If you didn't get through, though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.
5248675	5250356	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
5251217	5255779	And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every week?
5256206	5256426	GameSpot
5275706	5281189	about a keyboard controller attachment that they're going to be coming out.
5282009	5284070	And it looks very legit coming from them.
5284110	5287532	And I do remember seeing like a patent or some sort of picture a while back.
5288312	5296076	And I believe Gamers Reports were also saying that they ran a story months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.
5296356	5300298	So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely.
5300318	5300398	Okay.
5301013	5307218	And that would kind of tie into that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.
5308319	5315145	Let's see, other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit, that Drawn to Life.
5315345	5320309	It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet.
5321190	5325334	And it looks a little bit like, what was it, that...
5326318	5329640	Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that.
5329760	5337444	But you actually doodle stuff onto your DS and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.
5338044	5338885	So that's kind of neat.
5339405	5340366	I'm looking forward to that.
5340386	5342007	And they're also making a Worms 2 apparently.
5343627	5349811	Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP.
5351198	5356061	And apparently it's Triple Triad, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.
5357402	5361345	I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy IX.
5362025	5364046	But interesting nonetheless, I guess.
5364747	5371471	Then there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison trying to auction off PS3 at a rock concert.
5372112	5374793	Apparently he failed, and it was funny.
5375994	5378255	One dollar!
5378396	5380417	Area 51 is being made into a Hollywood movie.
5381089	5382651	Don't care.
5383151	5396626	The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be kind of an on-rails shooter game, or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.
5396646	5398388	So that's kind of neat.
5398789	5399950	Hopefully that'll come out soon.
5402236	5411181	Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.
5411841	5416104	Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there in the market, though, so it should be interesting.
5417544	5418585	And that's it.
5420046	5420326	All right.
5421707	5425289	I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat, and I cannot pronounce.
5425309	5427230	Is this supposed to be like lead speak for Havoc 1792?
5427490	5428410	I think that's what it is, H4V0C.
5428430	5428851	I think it's Havoc.
5431567	5445591	Havoc1792, EliteSpeak, sent me this article on Achieve360Points.com that shows the Halo 2 achievements because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite so it has achievements there.
5446251	5453013	And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well if you were playing the backwards compatibility eventually.
5453913	5455714	Well, it looks like, you know, the basics are
5456021	5459842	You get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of the single player game you go through.
5460442	5464103	Then you get some other achievement points if you, you know, actually beat the game.
5464483	5467844	And then, of course, there's your various multiplayer points.
5468224	5474945	Steal an occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running riot, all that stuff.
5475246	5484208	But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.
5484628	5485788	There's a Ninja achievement.
5486104	5491107	And then there's also a legend achievement, and that's what you get when you complete the game on legendary difficulty.
5491547	5492968	But here's the thing that I think is cool.
5493309	5497431	Not those achievements, but the fact that then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.
5498472	5499933	One is called Flaming Ninja.
5500433	5502875	Kill somebody that has the ninja achievement.
5503355	5504876	And then the other one is Hired Gun.
5505216	5509859	Kill someone who has the legend achievement, because you know those types of players are going to be really good.
5509899	5511740	So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements.
5511760	5512261	That's kind of neat.
5512761	5512901	Yeah.
5513117	5514798	That's better than those viral ones.
5514998	5517259	What was that one?
5517279	5520000	I want to say it was a game I just recently played.
5522601	5524942	Not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.
5525342	5530645	Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the virus achievement.
5530685	5532325	It's even called a viral achievement or something.
5532505	5536487	It's not worth any points, but that's the only way you can get it is by playing with somebody who has the achievement.
5536587	5537127	It's kind of weird.
5538848	5539629	I think that's kind of neat.
5540689	5542690	Good job to whoever thought up those achievements on Halo 2.
5543897	5545659	Anything for you, Jamie?
5547580	5547940	For me?
5547960	5552584	I don't play the... My last minute news in general.
5553185	5555507	Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.
5555647	5557388	No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.
5557708	5557869	No.
5559150	5559690	I don't have anything.
5560351	5566376	We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.
5566416	5567176	I think that would be fun.
5567196	5569318	Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck, I suck.
5569598	5572841	So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship.
5573473	5576755	I'm actually decent with a lot of games.
5577415	5580557	In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle.
5580677	5582818	The sniper rifles in Grand Theft Auto suck balls.
5583018	5585239	I don't know.
5585819	5586500	It'd be pretty fun.
5587840	5588941	I suck at Halo 2.
5589021	5590302	In fact, I think I've only played it once.
5592443	5593283	No, I haven't played Halo 2.
5593443	5595384	I've only played Halo 1 once.
5596725	5597805	That'd be fun.
5597885	5599866	DDRDollarBill says, I suck at Halo.
5599886	5600947	I can't even get one kill.
5601508	5603649	Actdeft says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.
5604169	5604530	We'll see.
5607151	5609652	I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest.
5609672	5610153	That would be fun.
5611173	5612234	We should make a clan.
5613094	5613915	Suck at Halo clan.
5614035	5616416	There is an OL Army Halo clan, supposedly.
5616436	5622379	I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually play Halo.
5622619	5623280	So, there you go.
5624700	5627322	Alright, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program.
5627861	5630182	So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5630482	5631843	Mandarin, thank you so much for being here.
5631883	5639547	I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing match game with us and bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.
5639687	5640248	Oh, you're welcome.
5640288	5643389	I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.
5643629	5644350	So you will come back?
5644670	5645210	Oh, yeah.
5645230	5645591	Absolutely.
5645671	5646091	Sounds like fun.
5646111	5655956	After he moves up here and gets settled in, we'll have to take a day off and he'll have to come up and... Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.
5656296	5657177	If he can get out of work.
5657437	5657557	Hmm.
5658735	5659175	Take a day off.
5659195	5659596	We're worth it.
5659776	5660216	No, I'm kidding.
5660717	5660937	All right.
5661777	5662418	Oh, your final thought.
5665220	5665781	It was fun.
5666081	5669484	I know I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but it was still a lot of fun.
5669584	5669924	That's all right.
5669944	5670905	We get a lot of guests that do that.
5670945	5674027	Christopher was kind of... Mika's been on the show like 40 times.
5674067	5675388	He never says a damn thing when he's here.
5675869	5676149	All right.
5676549	5679091	It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing.
5679111	5680492	Yeah, but you like it.
5680572	5681213	You like the kink.
5681613	5681953	You know it.
5682254	5682794	Eh.
5683074	5683335	All right.
5683955	5685296	You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?
5685777	5685957	No.
5685977	5686117	Okay.
5686197	5686317	Okay.
5686676	5688716	Loki, your final thought.
5690517	5694197	I want to play Earth... Why is it... Explain this to me.
5694377	5706139	Why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation 2 looks more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?
5707220	5708040	That's what I want to know.
5708340	5714921	Because it looks like they have a lot more complex enemies in there, some stuff that could have been from War of the Worlds or something.
5715661	5715801	Why...
5717183	5718264	What's up with that?
5718644	5720265	Exactly, what's up with that shit?
5720685	5726088	I need to get my PS2 back from my sister because I think they've played Driver 3 long enough.
5727709	5730031	Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?
5731211	5731652	Deadpool.
5732672	5734693	Alright, and my final thought tonight?
5742678	5744859	That was my final thought for tonight.
5744899	5746240	Did you enjoy that final thought, DarkSakura?
5747322	5749144	and even Orgy now.
5769093	5769794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
