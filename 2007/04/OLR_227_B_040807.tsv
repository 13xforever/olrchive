15480	19920	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19920	21840	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21840	26920	This is episode number 227 for April the 8th of 2007.
26920	29820	We tape live every Sunday night over on orangeloungeradio.com.
29820	32120	We have a chat room full of people listening to us right now.
32120	33440	Hi chat room!
33440	36160	And we'll invite some phone calls later on during the show.
36160	37160	1-877-GAME-OLR.
37160	40480	We'll open the Skype line a little later.
40480	43800	Also in part A, we tease that we're going to be playing match game tonight and we want
43800	48800	to congratulate GS68 for being one of our two contestants for match game.
48800	52240	He will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later
52240	53240	on in the program.
53240	54620	We'll tell you when to call.
54620	57720	But in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.
57720	64640	Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday.
64640	66880	And everyone is all excited about it.
66880	71140	It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.
71140	80000	And this is the brand new EA harmonics kind of co-game there.
80000	85360	Basically this thing is going to be kind of you get drums as well as bass and lead guitars
85360	87080	and you're also going to have singing.
87080	95080	So think Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero mixed with Drummania mixed with Karaoke Revolution.
95080	97960	And that's basically the game.
97960	104080	And apparently they're going to be using this not only to have some fun games and stuff,
104080	108860	but they're also going to make it almost like the next MTV, whereas they're going to launch
108860	111040	music this way.
111040	116440	And I don't know, it just seems like it's a big bunch of nothing to be honest.
116440	120000	I think that this is going to, it's just going to be the next fad.
120000	121000	It's just like...
121000	122000	Wow, Debbie Downer, what's your problem with this game?
122000	123480	Well, I think it's going to be the next big fad.
123480	125960	I mean, it's just like Guitar Hero is big right now.
125960	129280	I mean, Dance Dance Revolution was big a few years ago.
129280	132840	And once this comes out, everyone's going to be all, oh, it's awesome.
132840	133840	But you know what?
133840	135860	Is there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies
135860	136860	of it?
136860	139760	Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals
139760	142140	involved with it, according to some rumors.
142140	147900	But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen
147900	151680	is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.
151680	153800	And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.
153800	155920	This is so innovative.
155920	157800	So innovative.
157800	159920	It's not innovative at all.
159920	165760	Well, to an extent though, if they do make it playable over the internet, and you know,
165760	170120	you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar
170120	175720	Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked
175720	176720	ass.
176720	177720	The keyboard was pretty good.
177720	178720	I have to say that.
178720	181120	If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.
181120	183160	But the drum controller for home?
183160	184160	Not that hot.
184160	185600	Guitar controller for home?
185600	186600	Not that hot.
186600	188680	The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.
188680	190720	But you can never really have that experience at home.
190720	196120	From what I understand, you can session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, but again, the song
196120	199440	list is not that great for those games.
199440	202440	It's no Sweet Child of Mine by Guns N' Roses.
202440	205840	So you know, adding this whole karaoke thing into it seems like a natural progression,
205840	207480	especially for harmonics.
207480	209080	I think to some extent it could be.
209080	213160	I mean, I do agree it's just going to be a fad, but I think it kind of takes it one step
213160	219320	up from the Sing Stars and the Guitar Heroes of the world because now, for those people
219320	223160	that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing.
223160	224160	I don't want to sing.
224160	225360	It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.
225360	230320	I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing is fucking Konami
230320	231320	wake up.
231320	232320	Where the fuck have you been?
232320	236360	You've missed a train and the next train and the next train as far as music games go.
236360	240920	You're letting these people, I mean, you have the whole market cornered for this stuff and
240920	243680	now you're just kind of letting it slip away.
243680	245080	I don't know what they're thinking.
245080	246080	What's the big deal?
246080	249680	I mean, they really should have, when Guitar Freaks or Guitar Heroes-
249680	253000	Is that where your bitterness comes from, that you're just more mad that Konami didn't take
253000	254200	the opportunity with this?
254200	256640	I'm mad that they're going to call this original.
256640	262200	That's what I'm mad about because, and I blame a lot of bad press about it because there's
262200	266760	stupid press outlets that will not know of the Japanese games and they're just going
266760	268080	to pretend this is the first-
268080	273720	Maybe it's because the Japanese games didn't resonate here like these games do and it's
273720	274720	all about the song list.
274720	278960	I mean, as much as you and I and her and her might like the Japanese songs-
278960	280320	It doesn't matter if it's a song list though.
280320	284880	I mean, you can take a game that has a crappy ass song list, like one of the DDRs or something
284880	289760	like that, and still when In the Groove comes out, you can't say that that's original.
289760	291120	So it doesn't matter.
291120	294460	If it's been done before, it's not original.
294460	295460	I don't care.
295460	297040	If they want to improve on it, great.
297040	299360	That's awesome if they want to improve on it.
299360	301440	But it's not fucking original.
301440	307440	If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going
307440	310440	to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.
310440	314920	GS68 says Konami wailed on In the Groove and pump it up but is pretending Guitar Hero doesn't
314920	315920	exist.
315920	320880	That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In the Groove should have done to DDR
320880	325760	and that is completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone
325760	327640	of Guitar Freaks.
327640	331600	The only similarities between the games is they both have guitar controllers in their
331600	333000	rhythm games.
333000	335680	Otherwise they gave it the more amplitude look.
335680	340360	They gave it characters and charisma and songs that we all knew.
340360	343840	Guitar Hero, for me, hella improved on Guitar Freaks.
343840	347640	I still have a soft spot in my heart for Guitar Freaks once in a while.
347640	351320	How many fucking versions of Guitar Freaks are out there?
351320	352320	Over twelve now.
352320	353320	Eleventy billion.
353320	354480	Fourteen I think is what they're up to now.
354480	356920	It's the same fucking game.
356920	358360	The tracks aren't that great.
358360	361280	Which is what Guitar Hero is going to turn into.
361280	362760	Yes, it is going to turn into this.
362760	364620	I like the harmonics now.
364620	368560	This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, never soft.
368560	369560	You can have Guitar Hero.
369560	370560	Bye.
370560	371560	We're going to go work on something bigger and better.
371560	372560	That's smart harmonics to me.
372560	373560	I think so.
373560	378180	I'm curious to see what it's going to become, but here's my thing.
378180	381120	People bitch about having to buy $600 systems and stuff.
381120	387160	Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got
387160	392400	leaked out there from GameStop, they were saying that they were starting to do preorders
392400	397480	on stuff because they'll preorder games that don't exist yet.
397480	401520	Let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something
401520	402520	like that.
402520	405960	You're spending $200 on a fucking game.
405960	408320	That's a little much for me, I would think.
408320	410680	People are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.
410680	411680	Why not?
411680	414880	Yeah, but still though, they drop another just for one game.
414880	418560	You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.
418560	422240	I guess she's going to get them all anyway.
422240	427120	You're a peripheral whore, but I want to ask you, this is very interesting, and I think
427120	431360	this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue, because you guys have to realize, six
431360	438400	years ago, Flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is
438400	444040	on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks, literally the three of us were playing this
444040	445040	band thing.
445040	447880	Insert random other person on the guitar.
447880	449680	We were kind of doing this a long time ago.
449680	453280	We had a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.
453280	459480	Now, nobody looked at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us
459480	460480	on the machine.
460480	462040	So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?
462040	464560	He doesn't seem to care for it, because it's not original.
464560	468960	I'm a little disappointed though, that he just didn't fully rip it off and do a keyboard
468960	471720	as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.
471720	476680	And I generally kind of like the idea, because, you know, well, Guitar Freaks, what do you
476680	478680	think, Dark Soccer?
478680	483320	Um, I honestly, I think it's going to be fun, because it's the closest we're going to get
483320	488000	in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind
488000	489800	of, you know, bullshit.
489800	495600	But it's the closest we're going to get over here, it'll make it, you know, I think it'll
495600	496600	really catch on.
496600	497760	I think that it's going to be a big thing.
497760	501000	You know, I am a little disappointed though, in Konami, just a little bit, because they
501000	505440	used to be so edgy with like, you know, DDR, and then karaoke revolution, no one had even
505440	509040	thought about doing something like that, or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out
509040	513240	there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.
513240	517360	And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh games.
517360	522240	I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom, just like
522240	525920	totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside, you know, come out with the next
525920	527560	big thing, you know.
527560	532040	I think the other killer about this though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that
532040	535560	money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the
535560	540960	original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DDR, well, some
540960	542280	DDR, some karaoke revolution.
542280	548080	I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty
548080	549080	good.
549080	550080	They're solid.
550080	555360	I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and despite the fact that I may
555360	559040	not like most of their sports games, but, you know, I'm not a sports game fan.
559040	564080	But still though, you've got, you know, they have the money to make this game good, and
564080	569040	you know, you've got Harmonix, they know how to make music games, and then back that with
569040	575480	MTV, now that, since they own Harmonix, it's going to be, it's going to be huge.
575480	577320	That's, you know, no doubt about it.
577320	578720	I just hope it's diverse.
578720	579720	Yeah.
579720	583520	You know, I don't want to play all these emo bands, you know, one emo song once in a while
583520	588380	is kind of fun, you know, I wouldn't mind doing, hey, me today, and I wouldn't mind a little
588380	591320	bit of that emo, but, you know, I don't want a whole game full of that.
591320	597520	I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some, you know, new
597520	602600	classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today, you know, I kind of hope they find a balance, and we'll
602600	603600	see them.
603600	605600	And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it, because that was...
605600	606600	There should be a keyboard, though.
606600	611480	I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but, you know, I understand why it's not there,
611480	614280	but it doesn't make me any less sad.
614280	615280	Well...
615280	621400	You know what I want to know, this is real, you know, kind of stupid, but, you're going
621400	625600	to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going
625600	633320	to be USB on, like, the 360, they're lacking one USB port for that, that's gonna be a problem.
633320	634320	They need a...
634320	635320	Wireless mic?
635320	636320	I don't know.
636320	637320	Nothing...
637320	641200	All right, I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.
641200	642200	Ah, whatever.
642200	645640	Well, I think this is kind of cool.
645640	654320	During the conference for Rock Band, the harmonic CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance
654320	659660	that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.
659660	663080	It was actually specified, he said it without hesitation.
663080	668780	He's quoted saying, we will, at some time, bring Rock Band to every important platform,
668780	675640	and harmonics would be tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms,
675640	677320	and he likes the Wiimote.
677320	683000	Hmm, well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that
683000	686440	platform, except playing online is going to suck, because Nintendo will make you put in
686440	687440	Franco's little crap.
687440	693880	And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks
693880	696640	or something like that, it will never work.
696640	698280	Just make new peripherals.
698280	700720	They could do a Taiko no Tatujin on Wii.
700720	704800	Or it would be better, is if they made the peripherals universal, where they'll work
704800	707840	for the PlayStation 3 and the 360.
707840	708840	That would be pretty cool.
708840	711240	You know they're not.
711240	712240	They could.
712240	715240	If it's USB, that would be no problem.
715240	716240	I don't know.
716240	719880	All right, well, moving on, going back to Konami for a little bit, maybe this is where
719880	724680	their music game franchise is headed, is BeatMania 2DX, trying to relaunch that, I guess, well,
724680	728320	I don't know, so much relaunch, but trying to get that off the ground in arcades in the
728320	729320	US.
729320	732560	You might remember there was a home version of BeatMania that came out a couple years
732560	733560	ago.
733560	737680	And of course, everybody compared it to Guitar Hero, which is so wrong, because BeatMania
737680	740840	was out many years before, and that's why Loki's so mad.
740840	744960	But what should be interesting to note is that, remember there were location tests recently
744960	747280	for 2DX Gold in America?
747280	752960	Well, according to this user on bamanistyle.com, Brazzoliange, I probably mispronounced that
752960	758720	horribly, sorry, this guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there,
758720	764840	and she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it, and
764840	768960	that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations, but they're
768960	772940	having problems finding a distributor right now in the US and has not seen an easy way
772940	774880	to import them.
774880	778280	They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.
778280	783520	Autonomy or Betson is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September,
783520	786080	and this lady, I guess, is looking into that.
786080	791160	So Dave & Buster's, they want to buy 2DX Gold, they're glad to see there is a client base,
791160	793440	and they're looking into purchasing machines.
793440	797840	If you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support, all the information
797840	799280	is over there at bamanistyle.com.
799280	800280	But pretty interesting.
800280	803460	It'll be interesting if that game finally took off here, but I don't know, it's a bit
803460	804520	of a novelty.
804520	810800	I love B-Mania 2DX, but I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has
810800	816480	unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.
816480	823900	Put in anything Timbaland produced in there, or mix it with some new techno, like Faster
823900	830360	Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff, and trance
830360	832940	and dance, and it'll be huge!
832940	836720	They don't know, that would never work, and what they need to do is they need to reinvent
836720	839480	the whole damn franchise for the US, if they're going to do that.
839480	844400	They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing, instead of just having
844400	845400	keys and stuff.
845400	850320	Actually, you just have turntables, a mixer, and stuff like that, more like Kraken DJ,
850320	853120	or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.
853120	856680	Easy to DJ though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot
856680	862480	of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with Beatmania 2DX or something
862480	863480	like that.
863480	866320	They just need to make it, because right now people, when they see that, they're all,
866320	870680	well that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer
870680	873080	to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.
873080	874080	Kraken DJ!
874080	875840	Kraken DJ is a good example.
875840	879640	But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast, maybe it was just because the songs in there were
879640	883440	not recognizable at all, but I don't know, something about 2DX kept me on.
883440	887640	They had a great, even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,
887640	891540	at least the Konami produced originals have been very good, although I do think the quality
891540	894520	has been slipping ever since like 10th.
894520	896480	But I don't know, that's just me.
896480	900880	I'm a jaded old man, Bimani player, what do I know?
900880	901880	Got the old part right.
901880	902880	I mean, hi Rob.
902880	906200	Excuse me, what year were you born and what year was I born?
906200	908120	What thing am I holding up?
908120	909120	Rob.
909120	912280	Alright, that's more years than that that separate us, but...
912280	913280	Rob, Rob, Rob.
913280	914280	My birthday is in two weeks.
914280	915280	Really?
915280	917280	And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.
917280	918280	Yes we are.
918280	919280	Yay!
919280	920280	Rockin' Space Mountain.
920280	921280	Hell yeah!
921280	924720	We're back in time for the show, hopefully, otherwise we're doing it live from I-5.
924720	929040	Uh, hi, this is me and I'm driving.
929040	930680	God damn it!
930680	931680	Fucking SUV!
931680	933080	God damn it!
933080	935360	Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.
935360	937360	God damn it, motherfuckers!
937360	940760	That will be me, won't it?
940760	947120	So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the
947120	955200	PlayStation 3 20GB system, that's skewed at least, well Sony style is no longer carrying
955200	960560	the 20GB system and that's kind of interesting and that kind of further backs up what everybody
960560	965040	else either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done
965040	970520	with it or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling, the 20GB at least
970520	976300	is not selling and I know for a lot of retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore
976300	983120	so I don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20GB system,
983120	986360	probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there
986360	992760	but I think they're done with the 20GB system, it's my opinion.
992760	999520	And actually, I think, while I was trying to read here, Joystiq, I believe, contacted
999520	1005560	Sony style and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month and they said
1005560	1009160	they're not getting any more, you could go out and find one though.
1009160	1011800	Has anyone checked the Metreon store?
1011800	1018880	I don't know, but I know my 20GB is awesome so you don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit,
1018880	1022360	that's just, just plug it in, plug the damn thing in.
1022360	1028080	Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play and then I'll talk hardware.
1028080	1029960	Exactly.
1029960	1041600	Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they
1041600	1046880	actually are both not coming out in May as we have been told.
1046880	1056560	They still have a 2007 release but Sony isn't really saying much about it so we'll just,
1056560	1060680	I guess, keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.
1060680	1061680	Probably summer.
1061680	1068040	I don't think they have anything else coming out, I mean Lair, Heavenly Sword, I don't
1068040	1072520	think they have anything really, well I guess Warhawk, oooh, Warhawk, that's gonna be awesome.
1072520	1075520	Ohjoyandrapture.com.
1075520	1079780	Let's see, let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking
1079780	1082680	waited until 2008 to launch the system.
1082680	1085680	Write that up there on the board, alright, there we go.
1085680	1093520	Now we have, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.
1093520	1098000	But one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam, you know, sometimes
1098000	1102240	a lot of people give this system a lot of crap, but the PSP is still chugging along
1102240	1105360	and now it's chugging along at a lower price, that's been people's number one bitch about
1105360	1111860	the system, well now the core system is only $169.99, that is a drop from the $199.00.
1111860	1116980	Keep in mind though that the core only comes with, I believe, what, the unit, the charger,
1116980	1117980	and that's it.
1117980	1121160	It doesn't come with any games, it doesn't come with shit.
1121160	1124760	Yeah, but if you're gonna buy the Entertainment Pack or something like that, those have also
1124760	1126900	dropped down 30 bucks as well, so.
1126900	1130160	Keep in mind though, the cool thing about the PSP versus the DS is that, you know, you
1130160	1134720	can get online with it right out of the box, you can visit OLRPSP.com with it right out
1134720	1139720	of the box and download your favoritest podcast in the world, oh, you need a memory stick
1139720	1140720	though.
1140720	1146080	I'm just kidding.
1146080	1148000	Touche.
1148000	1153160	Anyways, other things coming to the PSP, at least if you're in Japan, they're getting
1153160	1163880	a voice over IP service being made by Jaja, and apparently it's not exactly easy to use,
1163880	1172440	you actually have to log into Jaja's mobile link using your PSP web browser and via its
1172440	1180200	Wi-Fi connection, and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking
1180200	1185680	with phones and stuff like that, not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.
1185680	1188800	Unfortunately there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.
1188800	1192760	So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?
1192760	1195240	I don't know, probably a while.
1195240	1201640	But yeah, there's a YouTube video out there, so if you want to see it in action, you can
1201640	1209160	do that, but of course if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.
1209160	1212920	All right.
1212920	1213920	You know what?
1213920	1214920	What?
1214920	1215920	I think we should all just move anyway.
1215920	1216920	Just move?
1216920	1217920	Yeah, why not?
1217920	1218920	Make our own country.
1218920	1220180	What brought that on?
1220180	1223400	And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any
1223400	1224400	games.
1224400	1225400	Yay!
1225400	1226400	Games more expensive!
1226400	1227400	Awesome!
1227400	1233280	Anyway, there's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final
1233280	1238240	Fantasy 13 available on the PlayStation 3 network.
1238240	1243280	Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this
1243280	1249880	spring thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year the honor
1249880	1252200	will go to the PlayStation Network.
1252200	1256200	As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.
1256200	1257200	That'd be funny.
1257200	1260280	Well, it's still floating about the rumor mill, so.
1260280	1262720	Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing though.
1262720	1266800	Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?
1266800	1267800	Right.
1267800	1268800	That would be something else.
1268800	1272920	It might hit Japan Store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.
1272920	1274680	Not necessarily.
1274680	1278640	Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the US,
1278640	1279640	right?
1279640	1280640	Yeah.
1280640	1281640	There's that and there's ways.
1281640	1284760	Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.
1284760	1286720	Yeah, but then all the text is in Japanese.
1286720	1287720	Who cares?
1287720	1289720	It doesn't matter.
1289720	1294460	Alright, well another who cares for me, you know, we've been talking a lot this episode
1294460	1300600	about Guitar Hero and Hands On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar
1300600	1304980	Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.
1304980	1308880	You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar
1308880	1310760	Hero on a cell phone because you know it's gonna suck.
1310760	1317460	I mean, I'm sorry, but you know, rhythm game, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks, so why
1317460	1321300	would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?
1321300	1323000	People should stop gaming on cell phones.
1323000	1325000	Hey, I play Lumines.
1325000	1327200	Yeah, Lumines is okay.
1327200	1332560	Tell that to fucking Nvidia, or not Nvidia, Nokia.
1332560	1333560	Nokia.
1333560	1334560	Yeah, Nokia.
1334560	1337720	The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.
1337720	1338760	That's it.
1338760	1339760	We don't need anything else.
1339760	1341720	You know what cell phone game is pretty awesome?
1341720	1348760	It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive instead of trying to play your stupid
1348760	1351760	mobile games at red lights.
1351760	1357280	Anyways, Apply Makeup The Game.
1357280	1358280	That's horrible.
1358280	1359480	Actually, I think they do have a game like that too.
1359480	1360480	Do they really?
1360480	1361480	Like Barbie?
1361480	1362480	Barbie cell phone game?
1362480	1364880	I've actually seen women driving down the road, they're like putting makeup on, like
1364880	1369960	I've totally seen this in traffic, like lipstick on the rear view mirror, it's like DRIVE!
1369960	1375840	Yeah, anyways, you have a little bit of makeup, it's not going to transform you from, you
1375840	1380840	know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen, so.
1380840	1386560	Anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little
1386560	1388160	bit.
1388160	1396320	There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, Jon
1396320	1399880	Tam, who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.
1399880	1403880	I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy
1403880	1407080	that you got, I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of
1407080	1410320	the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Lawns YouTube, if you look up our
1410320	1414400	account, you can see this guy that got the smack down here.
1414400	1422680	Anyways, settlement has been reached, they are no longer able to, there was some interesting
1422680	1426960	stuff around this, because it didn't make any sense to me a little bit, because they
1426960	1433920	said that they were doing a demo of a game that was based off of Step Mania and Guitar
1433920	1434920	Hero.
1434920	1438120	It says a demo incorporating elements of Guitar Hero and Step Mania.
1438120	1441000	I thought Step Mania is not a game, wouldn't that be in the groove that they're talking
1441000	1442000	about?
1442000	1445720	I don't know, whatever, the groove is basically Step Mania anyway.
1445720	1451600	Another part of the introduction, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer
1451600	1456960	based games for the next year, nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero
1456960	1463360	2 until six months after the game's release, and some other stuff like that.
1463360	1469120	So, that kind of sucks, oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos
1469120	1472040	for a while.
1472040	1476880	This is what you get when you break those NDAs.
1476880	1481400	Alright, well then you won't be breaking any NDAs, right Loki?
1481400	1482400	Nope.
1482400	1483400	Alright.
1483400	1484400	I don't break NDAs.
1484400	1485400	That's right.
1485400	1487700	Alright, well, one thing we like to break open every week here on Orange Launch Radio
1487700	1491920	is the mailbag, and Dark Soccer likes to jump into the mailbag and pull out some of our
1491920	1495080	favorite emails to read for you right here on the program.
1495080	1498600	If you want to email us, it's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1498600	1499600	Dark Soccer!
1499600	1500600	What?
1500600	1503360	Who sent us Anthrax this week?
1503360	1505360	My mother.
1505360	1508480	Look how evil of her, okay.
1508480	1511880	First email, hi, it's Zaid from London again.
1511880	1516360	I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii edition.
1516360	1522520	I was reading about it on the net, and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.
1522520	1526840	Also I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any
1526840	1529640	idea if us Brits will get that too?
1529640	1532640	Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?
1532640	1536320	Always have a good one, Zaid Mohammed.
1536320	1540000	And last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.
1540000	1542000	I hope this one is better.
1542000	1543640	Yeah, I'm a bitch.
1543640	1545480	Don't even bother.
1545480	1548700	Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where Dark Soccer is admitting
1548700	1549700	she's a bitch?
1549700	1550700	No, I'm proud.
1550700	1551700	Heart.
1551700	1552700	Hey, Rob.
1552700	1553700	What?
1553700	1554700	Broken heart.
1554700	1555700	No.
1555700	1556700	No.
1556700	1557700	No.
1557700	1558700	Resident Evil 4 on the Wii.
1558700	1559700	Yes, it's happening.
1559700	1562040	We don't know much, but we talked about it in part A, right?
1562040	1567960	So go download part A. As far as DVD playback on the Wii, well, I think that's been announced
1567960	1569020	previously.
1569020	1571600	How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?
1571600	1572840	Hooray.
1572840	1575760	That could be the 10th DVD player in my house.
1575760	1581320	But for the little kid with a Wii in his bedroom, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.
1581320	1584440	Yes, Loki.
1584440	1585700	Gateway to porn.
1585700	1586700	That's what it is.
1586700	1587700	Gateway to porn.
1587700	1589800	Now that can play all the porn DVDs.
1589800	1591920	So let's gateway the porn.
1591920	1592920	Hooray.
1592920	1594980	All right.
1594980	1597040	Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?
1597040	1598600	Eventually, I'm sure.
1598600	1601160	Yes, but six months later than us.
1601160	1603640	Because Nintendo hates you.
1603640	1607120	Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.
1607120	1610120	Anyway, next email please, Rob.
1610120	1613800	I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.
1613800	1616600	I feel sorry for you guys.
1616600	1617600	Something to do with the revolutionary war.
1617600	1619800	We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.
1619800	1621680	We'll figure something out.
1621680	1626640	We got an email from Ron says don't call him cute.
1626640	1627640	We call Ron?
1627640	1628640	I don't remember him calling.
1628640	1629640	He was the young one.
1629640	1632960	Aw, the cute little kid that emailed us.
1632960	1635000	Next email from AZHP.
1635000	1640080	Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast
1640080	1646560	waiting for my vector calculus class to start and Rob started playing blow my whistle, I
1646560	1650080	inadvertently began bobbing my head and before I knew it, I was break dancing outside the
1650080	1652280	classroom and then the music stopped.
1652280	1653280	I was sad.
1653280	1654280	Sad face.
1654280	1661200	But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2 and for that, I wanted
1661200	1664800	to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.
1664800	1667400	We lived to confuse.
1667400	1673560	That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little
1673560	1676680	bit of it, it makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.
1676680	1679360	You know, Rob, camstorm.
1679360	1684640	You have to have the, you know.
1684640	1688200	Aw, but I do, I do, I do.
1688200	1689840	That song was horrible.
1689840	1690840	Next email.
1690840	1691840	Alright, yes.
1691840	1696360	Dear LLR crew, first of all, congratulations to Dark Sakura for graduating and getting
1696360	1697360	certified EROC.
1697360	1698360	I know.
1698360	1699360	Thank you.
1699360	1700360	Finally, someone else says it.
1700360	1704320	Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program
1704320	1706040	is produced.
1706040	1709560	Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.
1709560	1713480	I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.
1713480	1716440	Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?
1716440	1717440	Yeah.
1717440	1719880	Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner,
1719880	1723160	but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland so we could go.
1723160	1724160	Yeah, it was.
1724160	1725160	More.
1725160	1726160	What the, why?
1726160	1727160	Email.
1727160	1728160	Why hasn't he come on the show?
1728160	1729160	Email.
1729160	1730160	Alright.
1730160	1731160	Maybe he'll answer that question.
1731160	1732160	Alright, fine.
1732160	1733640	It seems that I've recently begun to crave pinball mildly.
1733640	1735800	Oh, you are so in luck.
1735800	1739440	And while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate
1739440	1743560	a proper table with flippers and steel balls and lanes and bumpers and popular culture
1743560	1748120	tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands
1748120	1752180	that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.
1752180	1755760	It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate and so
1755760	1756840	I put the question to you.
1756840	1759860	Where might I find good local pinball?
1759860	1760860	Not at RBGL.
1760860	1761860	Shit.
1761860	1763640	Oh, there's a PS on here.
1763640	1766240	My profound thanks, Warrior Bob.
1766240	1770160	PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's
1770160	1774560	house, but I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking
1774560	1775560	creepy.
1775560	1781640	PPS, Byron promised me pinball once that they were liars, because Byron is a piece of crap.
1781640	1783080	Scandia had a bunch of machines.
1783080	1785520	I haven't been there in a long time, though.
1785520	1786520	Madison and I-80.
1786520	1788240	Have you seen the weird thing that they've gotten up and down?
1788240	1792280	Their new little, like, we're going to throw you up in the air thing, that ride they have,
1792280	1793480	that thing is scary looking.
1793480	1796480	As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.
1796480	1798560	What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.
1798560	1802800	Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my God, Scandia
1802800	1805520	has got this new ride called the motherfucking eyesore.
1805520	1806520	The piece of shit.
1806520	1809480	Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.
1809480	1810480	It's called the pooflinger.
1810480	1811480	I thought, like, for example- Hey, email, right?
1811480	1812480	No.
1812480	1815400	Yes, but I want to say real quick, the last time I went to Scandia, which
1815400	1818840	granted was a couple years ago, they had, like, seven pinball machines there.
1818840	1820160	RVGL's machines are shit.
1820160	1821160	They don't have anything now.
1821160	1823160	They have, like, two machines.
1823160	1828460	Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.
1828460	1829460	And I'm not even joking.
1829460	1831000	I sadly wouldn't doubt that.
1831000	1835240	Honestly, it really- she has, like, at least six or seven operational machines, and they're
1835240	1836240	free.
1836240	1841760	At present, I have- and not all of them are mine, because, unfortunately, Dan's friend
1841760	1843120	Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.
1843120	1845040	So we have a bride of pinbot.
1845040	1847920	We've got, um- what else do I have here?
1847920	1855360	We have bride of pinbot, judge dread, whodunnit, rocky and bullwinkle, guns and roses, um...
1855360	1856360	Star Trek The Next Generation.
1856360	1857360	What the fuck?
1857360	1858360	What is that?
1858360	1859360	Sorry.
1859360	1861880	Extrofer and Nellie are in here because they're waiting for match game, and since we haven't
1861880	1864280	acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.
1864280	1869080	They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher, and apparently
1869080	1872840	Extrofer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.
1872840	1873840	That was Nellie.
1873840	1874840	Oh, that was Nellie.
1874840	1875840	That's what Extrofer drew with this little-
1875840	1876840	It was like a bone.
1876840	1880500	But then it drew, I heart bunny, and there's this picture of a bunny there-
1880500	1881800	I think it's supposed to be a cat.
1881800	1886240	With a teeny tiny penis, with a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.
1886240	1893120	So, I heart teeny tiny bunny penis.
1893120	1894960	Only Extrofer can bring this show to a screeching halt.
1894960	1895960	Anyway- Next email!
1895960	1897960	Hey, I was still answering his question.
1897960	1898960	Oh, sorry.
1898960	1904120	Um, yeah, and I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch, Johnny Mnemonic, and Creature
1904120	1905120	from the Black Lagoon.
1905120	1908020	So, honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.
1908020	1911680	If you want to play, you've got my number.
1911680	1913480	It won't be creepy if you call.
1913480	1916040	I have friends at my house.
1916040	1918540	It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.
1918540	1921880	Dark Soccer owns a gun anyway, so she'll- I own several.
1921880	1922880	And knives.
1922880	1923880	Several good knives.
1923880	1926040	And I know how to use them.
1926040	1927040	And guns to turn into knives.
1927040	1928040	And if you think I'm joking, no.
1928040	1929040	Gun knives.
1929040	1933440	Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?
1933440	1934440	slave-wielding snakes.
1934440	1936160	No, I asked for a Beretta.
1936160	1939200	They should have a gun spork.
1939200	1940200	Any more emails?
1940200	1941200	Yes!
1941200	1942200	There's three more.
1942200	1943200	Um.
1943200	1944200	Okay.
1944200	1945200	Hey, OLR.
1945200	1946200	Hey.
1946200	1953640	First, I want to say that I love the podcast, hope you guys continue it for a long time.
1953640	1958480	Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.
1958480	1963120	I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there
1963120	1964120	yet.
1964120	1968200	A. Appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower but not something that would
1968200	1972520	bore them like RollerCoaster Tycoon B. Do not have a frustrating learning curve
1972520	1977840	C. Are $25 American or less B. And D. Do not have a monthly fee such as
1977840	1979000	World of Warcrack.
1979000	1980000	That about covers it.
1980000	1982000	Thanks, GamerDad.
1982000	1987320	I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.
1987320	1995160	It is over $25, however, you will not have a registration fee, and aren't there parental
1995160	1997040	controls available for Guild Wars?
1997040	1999560	You can censor the dirty language.
1999560	2001240	You can censor it out.
2001240	2006680	Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment, considering
2006680	2009920	that I paid $14 a month for World of Warcraft.
2009920	2013600	After four months, you've paid for the game, pretty much.
2013600	2019880	Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.
2019880	2021880	I would assume that you don't have a Mac.
2021880	2027960	So I would recommend that you play, oh, actually Star Wars Battlefront II, maybe.
2027960	2030960	It's a bit old, and it might be cheap now, where you can play that.
2030960	2031960	It might be pretty fun.
2031960	2032960	There's also worms.
2032960	2037960	Well, worms, yeah, it doesn't really benefit from, you know.
2037960	2041080	There's a bunch of free stuff out there, like all the stuff you can get, like Source, like
2041080	2045440	Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.
2045440	2052320	That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.
2052320	2056280	If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, that's a fun one.
2056280	2057280	Tetranet!
2057280	2058280	Tetranet!
2058280	2060400	Isn't that kind of a violent game?
2060400	2061400	Garry's Mod?
2061400	2063400	Oh, no, never mind, never mind.
2063400	2064400	Sorry.
2064400	2065400	Let me think.
2065400	2069520	Seriously, I know you said no monthly fee, but seriously, look in the game tab, because
2069520	2073380	it's got so many games, and you can set the parental controls in there, and give the kids
2073380	2077400	their own account, and there's even educational games in there, not that they'd actually play
2077400	2078640	them, but at least that's available.
2078640	2080520	There are a lot of other games in there.
2080520	2081920	Sims 2 is $25 now.
2081920	2087040	Sims 2, Civilization, I mean, I know you said the rollercoaster tycoon would bore them,
2087040	2091680	but Civilization's a heck of a lot of fun, but I don't know, I played it when I was 12,
2091680	2092680	the original one.
2092680	2095380	Command Conquer 3, but it's a bit more expensive, that just came out.
2095380	2102240	It also depends, I would say, not knowing your sons, I'm not sure what type of genres
2102240	2108960	they're interested in, I would say look at the games that they play off of the PC, or
2108960	2113160	look at the types of, like if they're interested in books, or what types of movies they like,
2113160	2120240	and then go to GameStop, or go look online, and find something in the same genre, and
2120240	2121240	use that as your criteria.
2121240	2123200	Mandarin, do you have any suggestions?
2123200	2124200	I saw one.
2124200	2129960	Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though the first episode is $32, each of the following
2129960	2138080	are only $9, and they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts,
2138080	2141000	which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kid's time on the computer to
2141000	2145920	like an hour or so, it'll give them a little bit more playtime throughout the whole thing,
2145920	2152440	versus other games where it takes several days to finish.
2152440	2158240	Kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, for kids, boy or girl,
2158240	2159240	and they do really well.
2159240	2161240	Grab the pitchforks and porches!
2161240	2162240	Shut up.
2162240	2165400	I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad, that
2165400	2169040	you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie, but apparently
2169040	2171520	Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad, not bad.
2171520	2175080	Oh, never mind, I was incorrect, season one, the whole season is $32.
2175080	2176080	Sorry.
2176080	2178840	I was incorrect about the price and now I'm getting corrected here, the season is $32
2178840	2183760	and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying a season, but again
2183760	2186920	I said it's still a really good game and it's kid-friendly.
2186920	2192480	Or you get game tab.
2192480	2201480	Keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.
2201480	2209320	I would say really, take those interests and look for things that associate with those
2209320	2212200	interests that are within your price range and have the criteria.
2212200	2218000	Now one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere, okay Rob, if you wrote
2218000	2227800	I heart pussy Hitler, there's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this
2227800	2228800	page.
2228800	2230400	I'm going to pretend I never saw that.
2230400	2234960	I'd like to confiscate this note, frame it, hang it on your fridge, oh Amanda needs to
2234960	2235960	see pussy Hitler.
2235960	2240880	I'll let Amanda guard it for me.
2240880	2244160	I'm sorry gamer dad, I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of
2244160	2245160	thought.
2245160	2246160	Sorry gamer dad.
2246160	2247160	Blame Rob.
2247160	2249880	You and your 13 year old kids sound pretty cool, but we got pussy Hitler in studio.
2249880	2254080	Hey, he said both of his sons were 13, I wonder if they're twins.
2254080	2255080	Maybe.
2255080	2257960	So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together
2257960	2258960	too.
2258960	2268240	So from the Rob D, I just listened to your April Fool Day joke and I got to say I'm cracking
2268240	2269240	up like crazy.
2269240	2274080	I really shouldn't be laughing at this, at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta
2274080	2276880	and Matilda sent me over the edge.
2276880	2279120	Good idea and it was pretty funny.
2279120	2282600	That said, Ms. Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming besides
2282600	2284660	Ms. Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.
2284660	2288840	She just had an, she's just an independent woman with an open relationship.
2288840	2291560	Me and Pac-Man have a kid, don't you remember the old cartoons?
2291560	2293440	Well yeah, they did suck.
2293440	2295320	What's your favorite April Fool Day joke this year?
2295320	2302020	I enjoyed the snakes in MySpace joke on VGCats and the 8-bit tie on ThinkGeek.
2302020	2304760	Of course, nothing beats Shang Long in the old EGM issue.
2304760	2306920	You must defeat Shang Long to stand a chance.
2306920	2310240	How many April Fool's jokes have actually influenced the franchise enough to inspire
2310240	2312680	a new legendary character like Akuma?
2312680	2315800	I think Gohki was a better name.
2315800	2319640	Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show, O.L.R. has become a weekly fixture on
2319640	2323160	my iPod and its space on there is well-deserved.
2323160	2326400	Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do and I'll keep on listening,
2326400	2330600	smile face, the Rob D. Roberta's really glad to hear that you're
2330600	2331600	a big fan.
2331600	2333400	You sound like Kirstie Alley.
2333400	2335360	And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.
2335360	2338880	I think that, I think, I think, I think, look, you said it best, you sounded like Kirstie
2338880	2339880	Alley.
2339880	2341880	Um, let's see, what, uh.
2341880	2343560	I didn't have to do a damn thing.
2343560	2349000	I'm going to, not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most
2349000	2351800	of the internet's April Fool's jokes this year, so I think we seriously have one of
2351800	2352800	the better ones.
2352800	2353800	I'm sorry.
2353800	2354800	I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.
2354800	2355800	We had a great joke.
2355800	2357160	I think that mine were great.
2357160	2359400	We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.
2359400	2361640	So visit dig.com and dig our episode.
2361640	2363800	By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.
2363800	2367880	I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.
2367880	2373320	While you're digging in there, um, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's
2373320	2378280	because they poked fun at Myspace, which was kind of amusing.
2378280	2382960	Who wants to touch it?
2382960	2383960	This is not a joke.
2383960	2384960	Who wants to touch it?
2384960	2389480	Ah, it's the, the Christmas check finally making its way.
2389480	2393760	We, it got, it got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally,
2393760	2394760	so it'll be fun.
2394760	2397920	Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account set up.
2397920	2398920	Fun, fun, fun.
2398920	2406480	So I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to, uh, Kristen for being like freaking
2406480	2407480	rad.
2407480	2409480	Okay, now I'm done.
2409480	2412040	I'm being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.
2412040	2413880	Um, all right, what?
2413880	2414880	All right.
2414880	2415880	Yeah.
2415880	2417160	The 8-bit tie was awesome.
2417160	2418160	I know.
2418160	2419160	I heard, I heard they're going to make it for real.
2419160	2420160	That's awesome.
2420160	2421160	I want one.
2421160	2422160	Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?
2422160	2423160	All right.
2423160	2426560	Uh, chat that orangeonsrated.com if you want to join our chat room, I gave you the link
2426560	2430880	there to a dig, uh, where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.
2430880	2433920	Uh, Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.
2433920	2434920	They didn't have one this year.
2434920	2435920	Yeah.
2435920	2436920	Whatever happened to that?
2436920	2437920	Um, they did have one.
2437920	2438920	What was it?
2438920	2439920	It wasn't public.
2439920	2444960	It was actually just someone, what I said on the show, it was actually was a thought
2444960	2448160	that we, that would come up with on the moderator's thread.
2448160	2451720	Um, and I just decided just to throw it out there since no one seemed to, you know, wanted
2451720	2453760	to get off their ass and actually do it.
2453760	2458040	So, um, the joke was that we were going to tell everybody that there was a big joke hidden
2458040	2462200	on DDR Freak and if anyone found it, then you win a prize.
2462200	2464080	Um, Rob found the joke.
2464080	2469000	So Rob wins a no prize for anyone who was, uh, an old, um, okay.
2469000	2472560	I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.
2472560	2473560	Stop.
2473560	2474560	Okay.
2474560	2475560	Extra for Drew.
2475560	2477200	We have extra for Nellie in the room.
2477200	2480600	Now they can talk and not pass some giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.
2480600	2483160	It's no, but it says I heart man-gina.
2483160	2485440	It looks like goat say that he drew on there.
2485440	2489120	Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and
2489120	2490120	you fools can leave.
2490120	2491120	All right.
2491120	2492120	Heart.
2492120	2493120	All right.
2493120	2495560	Quick, more video game stories.
2495560	2496560	This one's about violence.
2496560	2498560	Everybody likes violence.
2498560	2501200	Well, um, let's see.
2501200	2507200	There was a study recently that was done, um, that looked at 120 children, uh, before
2507200	2509640	and after a 20 minute quake two session.
2509640	2514480	The study was done by a university Swinburne university technology in Melbourne, Australia.
2514480	2520080	Um, and it said that, uh, while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending
2520080	2524440	on their emotional state before playing, the majority of kids were not affected by the
2524440	2530000	game violence at all quote professor Devley said much of the research linking aggressive
2530000	2533200	behavior to violent video games has been unconvincing.
2533200	2536280	It's the only message parents have ever received and it's just not accurate.
2536280	2540800	He said the study showed aggression link linked to game playing depended on a player's mood
2540800	2543000	and predisposition to aggression.
2543000	2547960	He said, so in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they
2547960	2551040	won't act out, act out on it after they play a video game.
2551040	2553440	Who would have thought?
2553440	2555600	Who would have thunk it anyways?
2555600	2559240	Well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.
2559240	2560720	Well, I like volume games.
2560720	2566040	I don't know who wouldn't, but um, apparently the proper, the rapper creator, um, he wants
2566040	2569920	less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.
2569920	2575080	I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but anyways, apparently, um, Messiah
2575080	2581840	Matsuura, uh, creator of the proper, the rapper says that the industry should stop focusing
2581840	2584280	on X rated violent affairs.
2584280	2587000	No they shouldn't more X rated games would be better.
2587000	2590240	Actually some X rated games would be better cause they don't have any.
2590240	2601360	Um, let's see, he was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers
2601360	2607640	and uh, also basically said at the recent, um, Australian GO3 conference, um, making
2607640	2616000	good games that everybody can play is a very high priority and um, I don't know.
2616000	2617000	It's interesting.
2617000	2621240	I mean also that he wants faster TVs cause I guess he's talking about the delay between,
2621240	2625720	you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.
2625720	2626720	More rhythm games.
2626720	2629800	Who would have thought it?
2629800	2631440	How about we just get another Parappa sequel?
2631440	2632640	Oh, I hit myself in the chin.
2632640	2634400	I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.
2634400	2635400	More Parappa!
2635400	2638560	Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.
2638560	2640560	Well guess what?
2640560	2642160	What?
2642160	2643160	Chicken butt.
2643160	2650120	Anyway, um, they have signed up though, and honestly I don't really give two shits about
2650120	2654760	the game cause I really don't give two shits about the movie either, but um, Peter Cullen
2654760	2660200	and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers
2660200	2661200	game.
2661200	2664640	Now, now, now, the new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have
2664640	2667360	for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.
2667360	2668360	Really?
2668360	2674360	Why all the hate for Transformers?
2674360	2678840	The seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my, you
2678840	2683120	know, Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.
2683120	2685120	Maybe, you know, I'm gonna see it.
2685120	2687040	I haven't said I'm not gonna see it.
2687040	2693120	I will, and I'll reserve my judgment, my final judgment for when I see it, but right now,
2693120	2697040	it doesn't seem right, so I don't know.
2697040	2703180	But if Starscream is fucking awesome, as usual, cause I, I, I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream
2703180	2708680	when I was little, so it better, if it's cool, then I'll go see it.
2708680	2711760	It's awesome, and they have it, uh, I think it's on the internet.
2711760	2715160	Too bad his voice actor's dead.
2715160	2717160	He was Cobra Commander.
2717160	2718160	COBRA!
2718160	2719160	Sorry.
2719160	2724000	They have that on- Wow, that was a random outburst.
2724000	2727960	I love the 80s, or, like, one of the, I love the 80s things that they did, they had, like,
2727960	2732440	Cobra Commander, like, a day in the life of Cobra Commander or something like that, and
2732440	2739160	they'd have him do different things, and they'd always go, COBRA!
2739160	2742440	I just wanna have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.
2742440	2744960	I think that would be awesome.
2744960	2746960	Sorry.
2746960	2747960	That's not video game news.
2747960	2751520	Drink, drink like some Drano, and then you'll sound like him.
2751520	2754040	All right, kids, do you know what time it is?
2754040	2755600	Ice cream!
2755600	2762120	No, but almost, almost as good.
2762120	2764320	It's time to play the match game!
2764320	2768800	Video game match game here on Orange Laundry AO.
2768800	2771120	We gotta get ourselves a caller, though, to play.
2771120	2776680	Uh, GS68 is one of our contestants tonight, I hope he's there.
2776680	2779000	He changed his nickname, which makes me think he might have left.
2779000	2781920	If so, he's gonna have to surrender his spot to someone else.
2781920	2783560	How dare you leave during the show?
2783560	2784560	All right.
2784560	2788480	Well, meanwhile, though, we're going to get another, okay, good, he's still there.

2989480	2990480	No.
2990480	2991480	No.
2991480	2992480	Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?
2992480	2994160	Because we don't like Christy Alley.
2994160	2995160	All right.
2995160	2996160	Well, I'm playing...

3014200	3015200	and everybody here in studio.
3015200	3019000	Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer
3019000	3020000	on the computer?
3020000	3021400	I will try to remember.
3021400	3022400	All right.
3022400	3025480	If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.
3025480	3026640	You ready for your first clue?
3026640	3027640	Mm-hmm.
3027640	3028640	All right.
3028640	3029640	Here we go.
3029640	3030640	Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.
3030640	3033360	You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.
3033360	3034360	All right.
3034360	3035360	Here is question number one.
3035360	3037720	There's four questions tonight.
3037720	3043600	Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.
3043600	3047720	Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.
3047720	3053080	Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.
3053080	3055280	I'll make this game more exciting.
3055280	3063800	I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
3063800	3066760	Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.
3066760	3069920	Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.
3069920	3073440	Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.
3073440	3074720	I'll make this game more exciting.
3074720	3078440	I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
3078440	3084080	Celebrities are thinking.
3084080	3100120	I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
3100120	3124480	I'll make this game more exciting.
3124480	3130400	I'll install five fret buttons on a dildo, says Zappi.
3130400	3132560	I just hope the chat room doesn't fail me.
3132560	3133560	Good answer.
3133560	3134560	All right.
3134560	3135560	There we go.
3135560	3136960	And GS68 said, we mote.
3136960	3139240	So we have dildo and we mote.
3139240	3141240	Let's go around and see who's a match.
3141240	3143200	Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?
3143200	3144760	It was a very close.
3144760	3147880	I said a gigantic horse dildo.
3147880	3148880	Gigantic horse dildo.
3148880	3149880	Judges.
3149880	3150880	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3150880	3151880	All right.
3151880	3152880	Good job.
3152880	3153880	Zappi, off to a great start.
3153880	3154880	Nice one.
3154880	3155880	All right.
3155880	3162280	Extifer, five fret buttons on A. I said strand of asshole hair.
3162280	3163880	Strand of asshole hair.
3163880	3164880	Wow.
3164880	3165880	Okay.
3165880	3166880	Dirty asshole.
3166880	3167880	Dirty asshole hair.
3167880	3168880	I don't know how I got that one.
3168880	3169880	Do I get that one, judges?
3169880	3170880	No.
3170880	3174400	Unfortunately, no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.
3174400	3175400	All right.
3175400	3182480	Nellie, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian
3182480	3183480	baby.
3183480	3189160	The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.
3189160	3192160	Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.
3192160	3193160	All right.
3193160	3195480	Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A.
3195480	3203400	You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot
3203400	3206720	of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.
3206720	3207720	Dildo.
3207720	3208720	Another match for Zappi.
3208720	3209720	Good job, Zappi.
3209720	3210720	Two to nothing.
3210720	3211720	Sorry, GS68.
3211720	3215600	That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.
3215600	3216600	Dark Sakura.
3216600	3220920	I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.
3220920	3221920	There you go.
3221920	3222920	Dildo.
3222920	3223920	Three to nothing.
3223920	3224920	Ding, ding, ding.
3224920	3225920	All right.
3225920	3226920	Wow, Zappi.
3226920	3227920	You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.
3227920	3228920	All right.
3228920	3231560	My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say dildo because this is my thing.
3231560	3235960	I said a Pringles can because I like food.
3235960	3237640	Five fret buttons on a Pringles can.
3237640	3238640	So I guess.
3238640	3239640	Pringles can.
3239640	3242400	I'd like to expand it for this.
3242400	3243400	All right.
3243400	3244800	Did expanding give you that answer?
3244800	3245800	Yeah.
3245800	3246800	All right.
3246800	3252480	Well, Pringles can suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth something.
3252480	3255320	Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.
3255320	3259200	You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.
3259200	3260200	You ready?
3260200	3261200	All right.
3261200	3262200	Here we go.
3262200	3263200	Question number two.
3263200	3269800	Loki thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this
3269800	3272280	year's E3 event.
3272280	3276960	When Loki walked through the door though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when
3276960	3288640	he exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.
3288640	3292400	Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3, but when he walked
3292400	3296560	through the door, he realized that Namco had had the last laugh, he exclaimed, wait a minute,
3296560	3310000	this isn't E3, this is a blank.
3310000	3313080	This isn't E3, this is a blank.
3313080	3318040	The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question, I'll just have to like do charades
3318040	3320040	or something.
3320040	3327560	This isn't E3, this is a blank.
3327560	3328560	Dark Sakura needs clarification.
3328560	3332080	Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?
3332080	3333080	Yes.
3333080	3334080	All right.
3334080	3335440	Do you understand the question, Zappi?
3335440	3336440	Am I crazy?
3336440	3337440	No, I completely understand.
3337440	3338440	All right.
3338440	3339440	Thank you.
3339440	3340440	I'm not crazy.
3340440	3341440	All right.
3341440	3342440	Ding.
3342440	3343440	Ding.
3343440	3344440	Nellie gets ding.
3344440	3345440	Extrovert, ding.
3345440	3346440	Mandarin, ding.
3346440	3347440	Dark Sakura, ding.
3347440	3348440	Loki, ding.
3348440	3349440	All right.
3349440	3350440	Dark Sakura, ding.
3350440	3354160	Loki exclaimed, this isn't E3, this is a?
3354160	3355160	Porno convention.
3355160	3363160	A porno convention, all right, and GS68 said a gay bar, all right, so we have porno convention
3363160	3364160	and gay bar.
3364160	3368200	Mandarin, what did you say, this isn't E3, this is a?
3368200	3373400	I think they both might actually get expensive combination, a gay orgy.
3373400	3379360	A gay orgy, not going to work, I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.
3379360	3383000	Extrovert, this isn't E3, this is?
3383000	3385000	A Frankie Muniz convention.
3385000	3386760	A Frankie Muniz convention.
3386760	3392060	Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.
3392060	3396000	It's almost like a gay bar, but no, that doesn't work, all right.
3396000	3400000	Nellie, this isn't E3, this is a?
3400000	3404240	The funny thing is is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all
3404240	3411080	naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife, darn.
3411080	3416240	An all naked girl convention, but he brought his wife, darn, good answer, not a match.
3416240	3423560	Could be porn, no, Zappi's ahead, if he was behind, I'd give it to him, but no, Loki.
3423560	3428080	I don't buy that, she would never come to an E3 thing, even if she thought it wasn't
3428080	3429080	E3.
3429080	3435720	Anyways, I said a Pringles can, because it's useless.
3435720	3436720	You're a dick.
3436720	3439360	All right, a Pringles can, not an answer.
3439360	3440360	Dark Sakura.
3440360	3441760	Orgy of suck.
3441760	3447920	An orgy of suck, that's almost like a gay bar, but no, all right.
3447920	3452920	And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something,
3452920	3458520	it's like damn, why is there all these women here, this sucks, where are the games?
3458520	3459520	All right.
3459520	3460520	Although maybe I would say that.
3460520	3466480	My answer, this is an E3, this is a gay bath house, I don't know, is that a match with
3466480	3467480	gay bar?
3467480	3468480	Uh-huh.
3468480	3470920	I'm going to say yes, who wants, GS68's behind.
3470920	3475920	I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.
3475920	3478640	All right, what, you guys aren't going to get me.
3478640	3480000	And why would they have a Frankie Muniz?
3480000	3488280	So Nellie says yes, I say yes, uh-huh, Dark Sakura says no, Loki says no, all right, sorry
3488280	3489280	NGS68.
3489280	3490280	All right.
3490280	3491280	No, Loki said yes.
3491280	3492280	Oh, Loki said yes?
3492280	3493280	Yeah.
3493280	3495280	Gay bath house and gay bar, are they the same thing, Dark Sakura?
3495280	3496280	No.
3496280	3497280	All right.
3497280	3498880	How was the bath house like a bar?
3498880	3500480	Because it's all gay.
3500480	3501480	Now we're three and three.
3501480	3502480	Okay, okay.
3502480	3503480	I have a question on the rules.
3503480	3504480	What?
3504480	3505480	Yes.
3505480	3506480	What?
3506480	3507480	Yes.
3507480	3508480	Okay.
3508480	3509480	Yes.
3509480	3510480	Dark Sakura says yes.
3510480	3511480	Because you can suck in the bathroom.
3511480	3512480	That's true, have you ever been to faces?
3512480	3513480	All right.
3513480	3514480	Wait, wait, wait, I have a question on the rules.
3514480	3515480	That's true, they do have a pool now.
3515480	3516480	What?
3516480	3522080	The person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people
3522080	3523380	choosing for him again.
3523380	3526880	Only in certain years they did that and then they didn't do that in future years.
3526880	3527880	That's cheating then.
3527880	3528880	No, it's not.
3528880	3529880	You're cheating.
3529880	3530880	Shut up, Nellie.
3530880	3531880	All right.
3531880	3535880	Hey, look, if I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her till she did it.
3535880	3536880	Rob.
3536880	3537880	What?
3537880	3538880	Get in your place.
3538880	3540280	Answer the thing.
3540280	3541280	Sorry, Miss Jamie.
3541280	3542280	All right.
3542280	3543280	That's right.
3543280	3545840	You're watching her all break out the paddle again.
3545840	3546840	Question number three.
3546840	3547840	Robby Goodstick.
3547840	3550560	Oh, this is a question about Jamie.
3550560	3552560	This should be good.
3552560	3553560	You ready, Zappy?
3553560	3554560	Yep.
3554560	3555560	Three to one.
3555560	3556560	You feeling the heat a little bit?
3556560	3557560	I'm not ready.
3557560	3558560	All right.
3558560	3559560	Here we go.
3559560	3565400	While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pin bot machine for sale.
3565400	3571800	The machine costs $1,000 though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.
3571800	3577680	Being the ever clever game collector and negotiator though, Jamie told the salesman, I really
3577680	3579520	want that pin bot machine.
3579520	3583720	I would trade you my blank for it.
3583720	3591240	Where's my music?
3591240	3594040	I really want that pin bot machine.
3594040	3596760	I would trade you my blank for it.
3596760	3598320	All right.
3598320	3602000	Ding, this one's easy for me.
3602000	3603000	Uh-oh.
3603000	3607000	Did I copy paste that to GS68?
3607000	3608000	Oh, never mind.
3608000	3609000	You got it anyway.
3609000	3611000	I would trade you my blank for it.
3611000	3612000	Ding.
3612000	3614000	Expert said ding.
3614000	3615000	Ding.
3615000	3616000	Dark Sakura?
3616000	3617000	All right.
3617000	3619000	That was quick.
3619000	3623480	When the question is about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.
3623480	3624480	All right.
3624480	3625880	I would trade you my blank for it.
3625880	3631000	Zappi, I would trade you my massage table.
3631000	3632000	Massage table.
3632000	3635240	Okay, massage table.
3635240	3637320	That is something very precious to her decision.
3637320	3638320	All right.
3638320	3639320	GS68 said-
3639320	3641080	I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.
3641080	3645960	GS68 said I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.
3645960	3649840	Which is great because I don't got any, ha ha.
3649840	3653560	It could be, well, what about your behind virginity?
3653560	3656200	Ew, we're not going there, Rob.
3656200	3657200	I thought your be-hymen.
3657200	3658200	All right.
3658200	3662200	Rob, you just ruined my answer.
3662200	3663200	Yes.
3663200	3665640	All right, shut up.
3665640	3669560	Mandarin, we have virginity and massage table.
3669560	3670680	I want that pinball machine.
3670680	3672160	I would trade you my-
3672160	3675880	Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.
3675880	3678000	Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.
3678000	3679480	Is that a match for massage table?
3679480	3681360	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3681360	3683640	That's because of the massage services, so-
3683640	3684640	Yeah, I say no.
3684640	3685640	That's a half a point.
3685640	3686640	Half a point.
3686640	3687640	I say no.
3687640	3688640	All right, we'll do-
3688640	3690640	The table is what you do-
3690640	3691640	Fine.
3691640	3692640	Half a point for Zappi.
3692640	3693640	I'm outvoted.
3693640	3694640	Half a point.
3694640	3696640	See, now I have to write half.
3696640	3698520	All right, there we go.
3698520	3699520	Extra fur.
3699520	3700520	I want that pinball machine.
3700520	3701520	Shut the fuck up.
3701520	3702520	I went for the most obvious.
3702520	3711040	I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.
3711040	3712040	It's amazing.
3712040	3717160	The Dark Sakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.
3717160	3720160	Frankie Muniz's ass- She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.
3720160	3724800	A strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.
3724800	3727560	That's actually one of my prized treasures.
3727560	3730560	All right, Nellie, I would trade you a-
3730560	3734440	I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.
3734440	3735440	B. Eimond.
3735440	3736440	All right.
3736440	3737440	Loki.
3737440	3738440	Well, see, I would have matched.
3738440	3739440	I'm going to get a point.
3739440	3740440	Loki, I would trade you my-
3740440	3746320	Well, where would one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Baby?
3746320	3751040	Iraqi Suicide Baby, which Dark Sakura also happens to own one.
3751040	3753240	Dark Sakura, I would trade you my-
3753240	3754240	Husband.
3754240	3757640	Husband for it.
3757640	3760160	My answer was, I really want that pinball machine.
3760160	3762320	I would trade you my husband for it.
3762320	3765200	I also said husband, so there it is.
3765200	3767640	Husband was the answer to go with in that round.
3767640	3768640	All right.
3768640	3769640	One more question.
3769640	3770640	You ready, Zappy?
3770640	3771640	Yup.
3771640	3772640	All right.
3772640	3776040	Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.
3776040	3777040	All right?
3777040	3778440	So, you got to keep the lead here.
3778440	3780240	All right, GS68, you can do it.
3780240	3782240	All right, here we go.
3782240	3783240	Here's the question.
3783240	3789960	Xtafur, this is a true story, by the way, Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online
3789960	3795420	MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.
3795420	3801680	He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't
3801680	3811720	play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
3811720	3830760	Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
3830760	3832520	All right, GS68 has an answer.
3832520	3833520	I'm ding.
3833520	3834520	How about the other celebrities?
3834520	3835520	Ding.
3835520	3836520	Some are ding.
3836520	3840360	All right, let me read the question again and see if it inspires some folks.
3840360	3844360	Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively
3844360	3845360	of the game.
3845360	3849800	He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't
3849800	3854880	play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
3854880	3865080	Isn't this the best song ever?
3865080	3866480	Nelly finally dinged.
3866480	3867480	Xtafur?
3867480	3868480	Sure, ding.
3868480	3869480	Mandarin and ding.
3869480	3872520	We have some very apathetic celebrities.
3872520	3873520	Last question though.
3873520	3877240	Here we go before this segment gets drawn on way too long as if it hasn't already.
3877240	3882720	Zappi, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me
3882720	3883720	a slut.
3883720	3884720	A slut.
3884720	3885720	Okay, a slut.
3885720	3887720	There you go.
3887720	3893900	GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.
3893900	3896200	Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.
3896200	3899360	All right, let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.
3899360	3903680	Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game, I would not play that game again unless the creator
3903680	3904680	sent me...
3904680	3905680	Pussy.
3905680	3906680	Pussy!
3906680	3907680	Is that a match for slut?
3907680	3909680	I don't know where you're coming from.
3909680	3912480	No, no, because a slut could be male or female.
3912480	3916360	All right, Xtafur, I wouldn't, true story though, you did play the game, right?
3916360	3917360	Yeah.
3917360	3918360	And it sucked?
3918360	3919360	It sucked balls.
3919360	3920800	What was so bad about it?
3920800	3926120	Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.
3926120	3927120	All right.
3927120	3928920	I don't know, I don't like purple balls.
3928920	3930800	Like, you're going to suck my balls.
3930800	3931800	Be gentle.
3931800	3937520	All right, I wouldn't, I wouldn't play, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator
3937520	3938720	sent me...
3938720	3945760	My butt virginity back, because I'm, I'm pretty loose down there.
3945760	3949640	I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.
3949640	3956520	Oh, this show sucks.
3956520	3958000	Shit just falls right out of me.
3958000	3959000	It's just, it's horrible.
3959000	3965600	It's like, I have to, I should, I should get a colostomy bag and it's like...
3965600	3973980	Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators, the chat room is just exploding
3973980	3977920	with, oh my God, oh, oh God, oh.
3977920	3981640	That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.
3981640	3982640	Nelly, I...
3982640	3986440	Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.
3986440	3996160	Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators sent me...
3996160	3999640	His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.
3999640	4005040	His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover, a very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly,
4005040	4006640	but unfortunately not a match.
4006640	4009400	Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creators sent me...
4009400	4012680	I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie
4012680	4016960	Mina's butt hair in a Pringles can.
4016960	4020640	In a Pringles can, all right.
4020640	4021640	Dark Sakura.
4021640	4023080	A naked sweaty man slut.
4023080	4026280	A naked sweaty man slut, I think that's a match with slut.
4026280	4027680	Ding, ding, ding, ding.
4027680	4030600	So Zappy, you got another point.
4030600	4033560	I think Mandarin should get a pussy slut.
4033560	4034760	Well, but...
4034760	4035920	That doesn't count.
4035920	4038440	Dark Sakura actually used the word slut, it doesn't matter, Zappy is still going to win
4038440	4044100	anyway because GS68 was somehow to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't
4044100	4045200	see happening.
4045200	4051320	But my answer, just so you know, was Frankie Mina's as B. Hyman, which was not a match,
4051320	4054080	but probably almost matched Loki's answer.
4054080	4059640	So Zappy, by a score of four and a half to one, you win.
4059640	4062080	Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.
4062080	4063080	Yeah, you did pretty good.
4063080	4064960	That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.
4064960	4065960	Congratulations.
4065960	4066960	It's all thanks to the chat room.
4066960	4067960	Yes.
4067960	4075080	Zappy, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.
4075080	4076080	You were a part of it.
4076080	4077080	I feel so special.
4077080	4078080	Yeah, all right.
4078080	4079080	Well, congratulations.
4079080	4081200	Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?
4081200	4082200	All right.
4082200	4084840	In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?
4084840	4085840	Yep.
4085840	4086840	Any other comments you want to give?
4086840	4087840	Not really.
4087840	4088840	All right.
4088840	4089840	Well, have a good week, Zappy.
4089840	4090840	All right, thanks.
4090840	4093400	And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.
4093400	4097480	A nice effort from GS68.
4097480	4100040	And Extafur and Nelly have left.
4100040	4102480	Thank God.
4102480	4106760	Normality can come back and resume with the program.
4106760	4109680	Wow.
4109680	4115680	Let's get back to some game news.
4115680	4121240	If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their
4121240	4124400	Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.
4124400	4131020	They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.
4131020	4132020	So let's see.
4132020	4134320	I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.
4134320	4139920	They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original
4139920	4144320	console back from Microsoft, faster service, you get it back within five business days,
4144320	4149480	and other enhanced customer care operations, a new pledge from Xbox to you for your three
4149480	4151480	rings of death.
4151480	4155000	That's all I have.
4155000	4158960	Anyways, some other fun stuff.
4158960	4166920	Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't
4166920	4169200	downloaded it in another territory like I did.
4169200	4174120	But you get to play three single player missions, and check that out.
4174120	4178880	It's an okay average game, but hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that
4178880	4179880	anyways.
4179880	4181800	Kind of worth checking out.
4181800	4186440	It's definitely a lot better than ChromeHounds, that is for sure.
4186440	4189720	So if you're looking for a mech combat game, there you go.
4189720	4190720	Why?
4190720	4191720	Why is it better than ChromeHounds?
4191720	4192720	It's a lot faster.
4192720	4196800	I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for god sakes.
4196800	4199680	Plus, you know, overall it looks good.
4199680	4201440	Just ChromeHounds is very slow.
4201440	4202440	Just slow in everything.
4202440	4207180	Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words
4207180	4208960	for snow in Inuit?
4208960	4215360	No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which maybe makes you
4215360	4219600	go really fast, and then like a quick boost.
4219600	4220600	Quick boost?
4220600	4223180	Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.
4223180	4227040	The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets, and then the
4227040	4233560	super boost is just, you know, your typical anime robot flying over the ocean type thing.
4233560	4237520	Can you put two explicit tags on a show?
4237520	4239400	I was just wondering.
4239400	4240400	What?
4240400	4242480	Rated C for Christopher and for Nellie.
4242480	4243480	Yeah, NC17.
4243480	4245480	Somebody in chat already made that joke.
4245480	4246480	Nellie, Christopher17.
4246480	4247480	There you go.
4247480	4248480	All right.
4248480	4250560	Well, Skyline will be open very soon, kids.
4250560	4256400	Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack that has the
4256400	4264400	Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn-up mountain and a trial
4264400	4271840	point which is a modern-day office complex with a background of a busy day, you know,
4271840	4275560	behind it, a busy city behind it.
4275560	4278680	You can download it on LiveMarketplace.
4278680	4279680	Actually it's already up.
4279680	4285720	It was up there on the 6th, and it's 400 Microsoft points, and so I'd say give it a try.
4285720	4288720	Lost Planet's pretty cool.
4288720	4291800	Zatty's oil.
4291800	4292800	You know what?
4292800	4293800	Hey, Rob.
4293800	4297160	We're having a lot of meetings right now, and we really did lose five listeners during
4297160	4299160	the match game segment live.
4299160	4300160	Did we?
4300160	4301160	Yeah.
4301160	4302160	That was great.
4302160	4303160	All right.
4303160	4320000	The Skyline is open 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the Skyline as well.
4320000	4321600	The user name is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4321600	4325600	I want to play something for you guys real, real quick though because DMN left us a message
4325600	4329400	because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play
4329400	4331840	for you guys because you can leave us voicemails during the week.
4331840	4334840	Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.
4334840	4335840	This is DMN.
4335840	4339840	I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.
4339840	4345360	I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't because I got forced to
4345360	4351200	run a Soul Calibur III tournament, so I killed the guy who didn't do it.
4351200	4358560	Yeah, we're all good, but I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here, hopefully
4358560	4361440	one more from closing ceremonies, which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.
4361440	4366080	I want you guys to know how much people love OrangeLoungeRadio, even if I force them to
4366080	4370960	be crazy about it, but yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.
4370960	4371960	Bye.
4371960	4375880	So, live from SakuraCon, there's DMN.
4375880	4378120	Apparently there's fans of OrangeLoungeRadio at SakuraCon.
4378120	4380680	Sorry we couldn't come.
4380680	4383400	I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to SakuraCon.
4383400	4384400	Something happened.
4384400	4388680	We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out, so maybe next year.
4388680	4390680	Let's go to Skypline in the meanwhile.
4390680	4391680	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4391680	4392680	Who's this?
4392680	4393680	It's Legend of Zaku.
4393680	4394680	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
4394680	4395680	How you doing?
4395680	4396680	Pretty good.
4396680	4401480	Can you put two explicit tags on the podcast, do you think?
4401480	4403460	I'm not sure if that would...
4403460	4406080	I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.
4406080	4407080	Anyways...
4407080	4408920	Right, what's on your mind?
4408920	4415040	I heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonics is basically trying to give
4415040	4421880	Konami a run for its money, also for the fact that Konami is lazy.
4421880	4426360	They haven't even shown any real initiative that's trying to release guitar freaks and
4426360	4429040	drum manias to this country sooner.
4429040	4433280	In other words, Harmonics just stole the thunder.
4433280	4434840	Do you think maybe they've just given up?
4434840	4435840	That they've been beat at their own game?
4435840	4437560	Well, it's not really that.
4437560	4442040	From what I hear, they're supposed to be testing guitar freaks and drum manias this summer
4442040	4449120	in this country, but the backlash is that people will easily call it a Rock Band rip-off.
4449120	4454080	They'll just call Konami a bunch of biters, just for the fact that they are announcing
4454080	4456520	that game after Rock Band.
4456520	4461720	So it's like they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries
4461720	4466200	to release, just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.
4466200	4469440	To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?
4469440	4471440	I don't think it is.
4471440	4473720	Konami still has the Japanese market if nothing else.
4473720	4475720	Right, of course.
4475720	4480760	They have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that the way Harmonics managed to
4480760	4484120	get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.
4484120	4486920	They have commercials for it.
4486920	4490920	That and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in
4490920	4491920	right now.
4491920	4496280	Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.
4496280	4498200	It was a huge, huge risk.
4498200	4501240	When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it
4501240	4502240	was.
4502240	4506880	I know it was, but as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
4506880	4513880	So it was a damn good risk at best, but it's like they need a lot more marketing if they
4513880	4519360	want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania just to catch
4519360	4524860	up to Harmonics as the reach that they already have.
4524860	4528900	So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides karaoke revolution, which
4528900	4531200	they may not be known for much longer, or DDR?
4531200	4536100	If they want to push something like Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania, they have to get a lot
4536100	4542060	of marketing and a lot of American, mostly Americanization on it, just more American
4542060	4546320	licenses which would translate into more sales for the American public.
4546320	4552160	They'll give the average Guitar Hero user another choice, an alternative, instead of
4552160	4554760	just rejecting a truly Japanese version.
4554760	4556960	I hate to be honest, but that's the way it has to be.
4556960	4561320	I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.
4561320	4565120	How could Konami make BeatMania a success in this country?
4565120	4574800	Well, they really have to focus on basically licenses, pick up really good licenses, stuff
4574800	4583440	like really good trance, techno and stuff like that, and maybe some decent hip-hop or
4583440	4584440	something.
4584440	4588800	But yes, they have to definitely push, they have to do some more marketing and they have
4588800	4593960	to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost, just like they did with
4593960	4594960	DDR.
4594960	4599280	It just started in the arcades and then it snowballed into the home versions, although
4599280	4602600	the home version came first here already in this country.
4602600	4607880	They have to definitely push gold a lot further than it already is right now.
4607880	4609440	They have to really get it out there.
4609440	4610440	All right.
4610440	4613000	Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.
4613000	4614000	We appreciate it.
4614000	4615000	All right.
4615000	4616000	Later, buddy.
4616000	4617000	Bye.
4617000	4618000	Bye.
4618000	4619000	Black Boy makes an interesting statement in chat.
4619000	4623120	He says, I love that because this is a Bimani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because
4623120	4625880	another company improved on something that Bimani pioneered.
4625880	4628360	I wouldn't say I'm mad.
4628360	4631280	I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.
4631280	4636000	It made a great formula even better.
4636000	4640200	I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing
4640200	4642280	to take and it paid off.
4642280	4647600	I can't be mad at that, but what Loki's saying there is that when Guitar Hero gets all these
4647600	4652600	lavish, it's so original, it's the most original game ever, awards bestowed on it, you can't
4652600	4657640	help but feel like, well, I did kind of play a game like it once.
4657640	4662160	Well, anyway, let's go back to the Skype line and see if there's more calls.
4662160	4665960	Black Boy says, by the way, that's the whole point because people here have had such affection
4665960	4668800	for Bimani, and I'm an exception, apparently.
4668800	4669800	Let's see.
4669800	4670800	Hi, you're on Orangetown's radio.
4670800	4671800	Who's this?
4671800	4672800	Hey, it's Ron.
4672800	4673800	What's up, everyone?
4673800	4674800	Hi, Rama.
4674800	4675800	How you doing?
4675800	4676800	What's up?
4676800	4677800	Pretty good.
4677800	4680080	Look, Konami has other franchises that they're working on that's making them a whole lot
4680080	4681080	of money.
4681080	4685920	Seriously, I don't think Konami really gives two shits about Guitar Freaks or 2DX or anything
4685920	4686920	like that.
4686920	4693720	I mean, if you put Pop'n Music, 2DX, DDR, an arcade machine right in front of people,
4693720	4697520	people demonstrating it seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks
4697520	4703040	more easy and more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to
4703040	4705840	me one of the reasons why they brought it over.
4705840	4712040	Yes, there are other franchises' risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is like, you
4712040	4713040	know what?
4713040	4714040	Hey, we did our thing.
4714040	4715040	Let's just call it a night.
4715040	4716040	Let's work on other stuff.
4716040	4720480	I mean, they're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off, trying to Americanize
4720480	4722880	Guitar Freaks and Drummy, I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just
4722880	4729240	using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods,
4729240	4734680	the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming
4734680	4735680	out with.
4735680	4736680	Yeah, exactly.
4736680	4740640	I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.
4740640	4744520	I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?
4744520	4751760	I mean, they probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX of touring or maybe
4751760	4756200	like Guitar Freaks or something like that, you know?
4756200	4760800	By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple
4760800	4767440	sources and contexts I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as
4767440	4769240	far as the home version went.
4769240	4772860	So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem
4772860	4776080	to be like that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Rama, that even though
4776080	4778760	they could go for it, they're not choosing to.
4778760	4779760	I don't know.
4779760	4780760	Exactly.
4780760	4785560	I mean, with the much money they've made off the Bimani games, for them to bring over Beatmania
4785560	4788440	wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?
4788440	4790800	FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.
4790800	4795360	Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis is a problem, is to think that arcades
4795360	4797640	are relevant enough to give a fuck.
4797640	4799000	Arcades are dead in the US.
4799000	4800720	That's why they don't give a fuck.
4800720	4806200	Same point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar
4806200	4811840	Hero and this rock band game would be made for a console on the outset.
4811840	4812840	Kind of interesting.
4812840	4813840	Yeah, exactly.
4813840	4818760	Because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine
4818760	4824680	in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men, it was a Konami game.
4824680	4829440	And now nowadays, the only place you can find a half decent arcade if you're in a big town
4829440	4834840	where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little Podunk Corner place, you know?
4834840	4835840	It's sad.
4835840	4837280	I really hope arcades have a resurgence.
4837280	4838280	I really do.
4838280	4839280	I miss them.
4839280	4840280	Exactly.
4840280	4846160	I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.
4846160	4849120	Any other thoughts, Rama?
4849120	4852120	That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.
4852120	4853640	Sure, why not?
4853640	4855680	Okay, this is really dirty.
4855680	4859260	Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.
4859260	4860260	How much worse can we get?
4860260	4861260	Go for it.
4861260	4862260	Okay.
4862260	4866360	What does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?
4866360	4867360	What?
4867360	4872280	A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.
4872280	4878800	Bye Rama, thanks for the call.
4878800	4881480	Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?
4881480	4882480	I don't know.
4882480	4884160	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4884160	4885160	Who's this?
4885160	4886160	Hey guys, how you doing?
4886160	4887160	This is Bandit.
4887160	4889160	Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?
4889160	4890160	Okay.
4890160	4894040	What you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever
4894040	4896840	be popular in this country.
4896840	4897840	Why is that?
4897840	4903040	I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, if you look at that game, what the other
4903040	4908480	couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years
4908480	4912960	ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now, I mean, that game
4912960	4918600	takes too much time to learn and things like that, way too much dedication.
4918600	4924720	The casual gamer's not going to just walk into a place, throw in 50 cents and just be
4924720	4928360	great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?
4928360	4930400	But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard too?
4930400	4934880	I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of
4934880	4940440	dumbed down modes, which BeatMania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place because
4940440	4944380	when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing
4944380	4945920	BeatMania down.
4945920	4949760	But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?
4949760	4953200	Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.
4953200	4958640	I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.
4958640	4964800	I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then
4964800	4968960	look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.
4968960	4972520	Damn, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?
4972520	4974480	Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.
4974480	4976040	That sounds hard.
4976040	4978720	Trying to think if Buckethead does that one.
4978720	4981280	All right, well, anything else?
4981280	4984520	No, that's it for now.
4984520	4988760	And anything non-music, because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.
4988760	4991760	Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?
4991760	4996320	Right now, I mean, I picked up a, I haven't gone, I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.
4996320	5000240	I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but you know, I just haven't made that leap.
5000240	5004440	So I picked up God of War about a month ago, picked up God of War 2 when it came out.
5004440	5005640	I played through both of them.
5005640	5006640	They're really good.
5006640	5011000	I'd definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet, I mean, it's been maybe
5011000	5014240	a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.
5014240	5017120	I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.
5017120	5020360	Well, there's that in Devil May Cry collection.
5020360	5022280	It's like all three games for like 29 bucks.
5022280	5023280	Nice.
5023280	5024280	Definitely get that too.
5024280	5025280	Just might.
5025280	5026280	All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.
5026280	5027280	All right, there you go.
5027280	5028280	All right, take care.
5028280	5029280	One more call.
5029280	5030280	What do you say?
5030280	5031280	One more.
5031280	5032280	You guys okay?
5032280	5033280	You guys doing all right?
5033280	5034280	Yes.
5034280	5039120	All right, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth
5039120	5043400	Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually
5043400	5047200	looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.
5047200	5050120	All right, let's do one more call.
5050120	5051560	Hi, you're on Ornishon's radio.
5051560	5052560	Who's this?
5052560	5054600	Hey guys, this is DDR Dollar Bill here.
5054600	5057480	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?
5057480	5061000	This whole damn argument is like pissing me off now.
5061000	5062000	Why?
5062000	5067400	All right, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different
5067400	5071040	things at the same time, they're the same thing.
5071040	5080480	First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level, and I've proven
5080480	5083120	this by actually trying to game the other day.
5083120	5089260	Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four, while Guitar Hero actually
5089260	5094000	passed me by missing half the damn song, that's the first thing I've seen the difference.
5094000	5098920	Hold on though, because doesn't the Arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?
5098920	5099920	Stop breathing into the mic, please.
5099920	5103520	Yeah, careful, you're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.
5103520	5104520	Sorry.
5104520	5109860	That's all right, but yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the Arcade difficulty
5109860	5110860	setting?
5110860	5116520	Yes, but most Arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.
5116520	5119860	I don't really know too many Arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right
5119860	5122280	there, you know?
5122280	5128360	That's my first thought, and then the second thought is also the song list, and people
5128360	5134140	keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freaks' song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and
5134140	5137280	very few American stuff that people recognize.
5137280	5141320	While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada,
5141320	5143120	yada, yada, I can play this.
5143120	5145320	True, very true.
5145320	5149720	And I've said this kind of distinguishes the games and make Guitar Hero more successful
5149720	5151720	here, yeah?
5151720	5158120	Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that
5158120	5160020	both the difficulty level and the song list.
5160020	5164920	You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games, I mean you have DDR in your nickname,
5164920	5166400	what do you think of Rock Band?
5166400	5168320	Is it something you're going to check out?
5168320	5172440	I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't
5172440	5175720	have much of an idea what it's about.
5175720	5179440	Real quickly, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania,
5179440	5181560	and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?
5181560	5188000	Well imagine doing that online, take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.
5188000	5194080	So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
5194080	5195640	But on the internet.
5195640	5196640	Hmm.
5196640	5203160	And you sound interested, and Guitar Hero type songs.
5203160	5208720	That wouldn't be so bad actually, because one thing people can forget is that no game
5208720	5211960	has actually included like a karaoke type thing.
5211960	5216680	So that would actually make it different at the same time.
5216680	5217680	That's true.
5217680	5221680	You know, because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time, okay.
5221680	5226400	Now we have drums, guitars, and singers.
5226400	5227400	Yeah.
5227400	5228400	It could be interesting.
5228400	5229400	We'll see.
5229400	5232080	Well I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.
5232080	5233760	Alright.
5233760	5235760	Take care buddy, thanks for the perspective.
5235760	5236760	Hey, thanks man.
5236760	5237760	No problem.
5237760	5238760	Later.
5238760	5239760	Later.
5239760	5240760	Alright.
5240760	5242440	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, thanks to those that called in.
5242440	5245120	If you didn't get through though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in
5245120	5248760	still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.
5248760	5251520	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
5251520	5255480	And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every
5255480	5258040	week because we take the calls to come in.
5258040	5261460	If you're not calling us, you shouldn't be complaining about that.
5261460	5264360	So tune in live on a Sunday night sometime or leave us a voicemail.
5264360	5268320	I'm going to open it up to any last minute stories that anyone might have here in studio.
5268320	5269320	Last minute stories.
5269320	5271320	I got a few.
5271320	5272320	Yes.
5272320	5280440	There's another rumor, also coming from Gamespot, about a keyboard controller attachment that
5280440	5282180	they're going to be coming out.
5282180	5286320	It looks very legit coming from them, and I do remember seeing a patent or some sort
5286320	5292360	of picture a while back, and I believe Gamers reports were also saying that they ran a story
5292360	5296440	months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.
5296440	5302080	So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely, and that would kind of tie into
5302080	5308480	that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.
5308480	5309480	Let's see.
5309480	5314520	Other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit that's drawn
5314520	5315520	to life.
5315520	5321700	It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet, and it looks
5321700	5330340	a little bit like Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that, but you actually
5330340	5338080	doodle stuff onto your DS, and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.
5338080	5339080	So that's kind of neat.
5339080	5343800	I'm looking forward to that, and they're also making a Worms 2, apparently.
5343800	5352160	Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP, and apparently it's
5352160	5357240	triple triads, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.
5357240	5361080	I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy
5361080	5364840	IX, but interesting nonetheless, I guess.
5364840	5369080	And there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison
5369080	5372400	trying to auction off a PS3 at a rock concert.
5372400	5376000	Apparently he failed, and it was funny.
5376000	5378500	One dollar!
5378500	5381200	Area 51's being made into a Hollywood movie?
5381200	5383200	Don't care.
5383200	5389380	The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with
5389380	5395040	the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be an on-rails shooter game,
5395040	5397800	or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.
5397800	5402320	So that's kind of neat, hopefully that'll come out soon.
5402320	5407680	Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video
5407680	5412000	service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.
5412000	5415080	Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there on the market, though,
5415080	5417680	so it should be interesting.
5417680	5421600	And that's it.
5421600	5425320	I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat.
5425320	5428360	Is this supposed to be like Leetspeak for Havoc 1792?
5428360	5431600	I think that's what it is, H4V0C, I think it's Havoc.
5431600	5437840	Havoc 1792 in Leetspeak sent me this article on Achieve360points.com that shows the Halo
5437840	5444400	2 achievements, because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite,
5444400	5446300	so it has achievements there.
5446300	5450680	And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well, if you were
5450680	5453020	playing the backwards compatibility, eventually.
5453020	5458200	Well, it looks like the basics are you get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of
5458200	5462880	the single-player game you go through, then you get some other achievement points if you
5462880	5468280	actually beat the game, and then of course there's your various multiplayer points.
5468280	5474080	Steel and occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running
5474080	5475080	riot, all that stuff.
5475080	5478640	But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement
5478640	5484760	called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.
5484760	5488640	There's a Ninja achievement, and then there's also a Legend achievement, and that's what
5488640	5491640	you get when you complete the game on Legendary difficulty.
5491640	5494680	But here's the thing that I think is cool, not those achievements, but the fact that
5494680	5498520	then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.
5498520	5503600	One is called Flaming Ninja, kill somebody that has the Ninja achievement, and then the
5503600	5505400	other one is Hired Gun.
5505400	5509040	Kill someone who has the Legend achievement, because you know those types of players are
5509040	5510040	going to be really good.
5510040	5513240	So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements, that's kind of neat.
5513240	5516640	That's better than those Viral ones.
5516640	5517640	What was that one?
5517640	5525440	I want to say it was a game I just recently played, not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.
5525440	5530760	Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the Virus achievement.
5530760	5532560	It's even called a Viral achievement or something.
5532560	5535760	It's not worth any points, but it's the only way you can get it, is by playing with somebody
5535760	5536760	who has the achievement.
5536760	5538760	It's kind of weird.
5538760	5540760	I think that's kind of neat.
5540760	5544200	Good job to whoever thought of those achievements on Halo 2.
5544200	5547640	Anything for you, Jamie?
5547640	5549380	For me?
5549380	5550380	I don't play the...
5550380	5552720	I don't play any last minute news in general.
5552720	5555680	Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.
5555680	5557800	No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.
5557800	5558800	No.
5558800	5560400	I don't have anything.
5560400	5566360	We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.
5566360	5567360	I think that would be fun.
5567360	5569640	Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck.
5569640	5573920	So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship, and that would be fun.
5573920	5577480	I'm actually decent, I mean, with a lot of games.
5577480	5581720	In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle, and the sniper rifles in Grand Theft
5581720	5587780	Auto suck balls, but I don't know, it'd be pretty fun.
5587780	5588780	I suck at Halo 2.
5588780	5590960	In fact, I think I've only played it once, so...
5590960	5595160	No, wait, no, I haven't played Halo 2, I've only played Halo 1 once.
5595160	5597160	That would be fun.
5597160	5598160	A long time ago.
5598160	5601600	DDR Dollar Bill says, I suck at Halo, I can't even get one kill.
5601600	5604240	Act Def says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.
5604240	5607080	We'll see.
5607080	5611200	I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest, that would be fun.
5611200	5614160	We should make a clan suck at Halo.
5614160	5618120	There is a Noelle Army Halo clan, supposedly, I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously
5618120	5621680	not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually
5621680	5622680	play Halo.
5622680	5624680	So, there you go.
5624680	5628200	All right, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program, so now we're going
5628200	5630080	to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5630080	5633100	Mandarin, thank you so much for being here, I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity
5633100	5637800	to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing Match Game with us and
5637800	5639600	bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.
5639600	5643680	Oh, you're welcome, I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.
5643680	5644680	So you will come back?
5644680	5645680	Oh yeah.
5645680	5646680	Absolutely.
5646680	5652360	We'll come up here and get settled in, and we'll have to take a day off and he'll have
5652360	5654480	to come up and...
5654480	5656320	Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.
5656320	5658840	If he can get out of work.
5658840	5659840	Take a day off, we're worth it.
5659840	5660840	No, I'm kidding.
5660840	5661840	Yeah.
5661840	5662840	All right.
5662840	5663840	Oh, your final thought?
5663840	5668720	It was fun, even though I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but
5668720	5669720	it was still a lot of fun.
5669720	5670720	That's all right, we get a lot of guests that do that.
5670720	5672280	It's okay, Christopher was kind of...
5672280	5675800	Miklakkah's been on the show like 40 times, he never says a damn thing when he's here.
5675800	5676800	All right.
5676800	5679720	It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing, and...
5679720	5680720	Yeah, but you like it.
5680720	5681720	You like the kink.
5681720	5682720	You know it.
5682720	5683720	Eh.
5683720	5684720	Eh.
5684720	5685720	All right.
5685720	5686720	Eh.
5686720	5687720	You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?
5687720	5688720	No.
5688720	5689720	Okay.
5689720	5690720	Loki, your final thought?
5690720	5692400	I want to play Earth...
5692400	5699840	Why is it, explain this to me, why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation
5699840	5707360	2 looks like more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?
5707360	5708640	That's what I want to know.
5708640	5712280	Because it looks like they have a lot more complex, you know, enemies in there, you know,
5712280	5715720	some stuff that could have been like from War of the Worlds or something.
5715720	5716720	Why...
5716720	5717720	I don't know.
5717720	5718720	What's up with that?
5718720	5719720	Exactly.
5719720	5720720	What's up with that shit?
5720720	5725880	I need to get my PS2 back from my sister, because I think they've played Driver 3 long
5725880	5726880	enough.
5726880	5730680	All right, Dark Soccer, your final thought?
5730680	5732080	Um, Deadpool.
5732080	5734720	All right, and my final thought tonight...
5734720	5744080	That was my final thought for tonight.
5744080	5746880	Did you enjoy that final thought, Dark Soccer?
5746880	5747880	Awesome.
5747880	5748880	All right.
5748880	5749880	I need an orgy now.
5749880	5751920	All right, that's it, guys.
5751920	5755040	Thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.
5755040	5759320	You guys are awesome, especially through these episodes that are very X-rated.
5759320	5761520	Thank you guys so much for sticking through it.
5761520	5764200	We promise we'll be family-friendly next week on the program.
5764200	5769480	Hey, if you like the show, tell two friends, tell two enemies, who cares, about Orange
5769480	5773720	on its Radio, because if everybody tells two people about it, then, you know, then we slowly
5773720	5774720	conquer the world.
5774720	5777540	You can also leave us a nice review, a five-star review on iTunes.
5777540	5779040	We always really appreciate that.
5779040	5782720	The digs, the other stuff you guys do for us out there on the internet, posting about
5782720	5784280	us on a forum.
5784280	5785280	There's even...
5785280	5786280	Oh, this is really cool.
5786280	5789200	If you go to the Orange on its Radio forums, some folks have actually made little artwork.
5789200	5793560	Now you can get little Orange on its Radio icons with my face or Dark Soccer's face or
5793560	5798300	somebody's face on it, and one of those little bars, like those little tiny bars that say,
5798300	5802720	I'm a Coke drinker, or I'm a watcher of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
5802720	5805200	Now there's one that says, O.L. Army, a little bar.
5805200	5808420	So you can check out that all on the forums.
5808420	5810120	So my name is Rob Roberts.
5810120	5811120	That's Dark Soccer.
5811120	5812120	That's Loki.
5812120	5831520	And I'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
