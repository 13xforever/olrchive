Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.840
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.920
This is episode number 227 for April the 8th of 2007.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.820
We tape live every Sunday night over on orangeloungeradio.com.

00:29.820 --> 00:32.120
We have a chat room full of people listening to us right now.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.440
Hi chat room!

00:33.440 --> 00:36.160
And we'll invite some phone calls later on during the show.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
1-877-GAME-OLR.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.480
We'll open the Skype line a little later.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.800
Also in part A, we tease that we're going to be playing match game tonight and we want

00:43.800 --> 00:48.800
to congratulate GS68 for being one of our two contestants for match game.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.240
He will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
on in the program.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.620
We'll tell you when to call.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.720
But in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.640
Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.880
And everyone is all excited about it.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.140
It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.

01:11.140 --> 01:20.000
And this is the brand new EA harmonics kind of co-game there.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.360
Basically this thing is going to be kind of you get drums as well as bass and lead guitars

01:25.360 --> 01:27.080
and you're also going to have singing.

01:27.080 --> 01:35.080
So think Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero mixed with Drummania mixed with Karaoke Revolution.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.960
And that's basically the game.

01:37.960 --> 01:44.080
And apparently they're going to be using this not only to have some fun games and stuff,

01:44.080 --> 01:48.860
but they're also going to make it almost like the next MTV, whereas they're going to launch

01:48.860 --> 01:51.040
music this way.

01:51.040 --> 01:56.440
And I don't know, it just seems like it's a big bunch of nothing to be honest.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.000
I think that this is going to, it's just going to be the next fad.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
It's just like...

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Wow, Debbie Downer, what's your problem with this game?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.480
Well, I think it's going to be the next big fad.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.960
I mean, it's just like Guitar Hero is big right now.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.280
I mean, Dance Dance Revolution was big a few years ago.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.840
And once this comes out, everyone's going to be all, oh, it's awesome.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
But you know what?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.860
Is there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies

02:15.860 --> 02:16.860
of it?

02:16.860 --> 02:19.760
Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals

02:19.760 --> 02:22.140
involved with it, according to some rumors.

02:22.140 --> 02:27.900
But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen

02:27.900 --> 02:31.680
is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.800
And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.920
This is so innovative.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.800
So innovative.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.920
It's not innovative at all.

02:39.920 --> 02:45.760
Well, to an extent though, if they do make it playable over the internet, and you know,

02:45.760 --> 02:50.120
you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar

02:50.120 --> 02:55.720
Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
ass.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.720
The keyboard was pretty good.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
I have to say that.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.120
If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.160
But the drum controller for home?

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
Not that hot.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.600
Guitar controller for home?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.600
Not that hot.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.680
The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.720
But you can never really have that experience at home.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.120
From what I understand, you can session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, but again, the song

03:16.120 --> 03:19.440
list is not that great for those games.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.440
It's no Sweet Child of Mine by Guns N' Roses.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.840
So you know, adding this whole karaoke thing into it seems like a natural progression,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.480
especially for harmonics.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.080
I think to some extent it could be.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.160
I mean, I do agree it's just going to be a fad, but I think it kind of takes it one step

03:33.160 --> 03:39.320
up from the Sing Stars and the Guitar Heroes of the world because now, for those people

03:39.320 --> 03:43.160
that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
I don't want to sing.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.360
It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.320
I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing is fucking Konami

03:50.320 --> 03:51.320
wake up.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
Where the fuck have you been?

03:52.320 --> 03:56.360
You've missed a train and the next train and the next train as far as music games go.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.920
You're letting these people, I mean, you have the whole market cornered for this stuff and

04:00.920 --> 04:03.680
now you're just kind of letting it slip away.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.080
I don't know what they're thinking.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
What's the big deal?

04:06.080 --> 04:09.680
I mean, they really should have, when Guitar Freaks or Guitar Heroes-

04:09.680 --> 04:13.000
Is that where your bitterness comes from, that you're just more mad that Konami didn't take

04:13.000 --> 04:14.200
the opportunity with this?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.640
I'm mad that they're going to call this original.

04:16.640 --> 04:22.200
That's what I'm mad about because, and I blame a lot of bad press about it because there's

04:22.200 --> 04:26.760
stupid press outlets that will not know of the Japanese games and they're just going

04:26.760 --> 04:28.080
to pretend this is the first-

04:28.080 --> 04:33.720
Maybe it's because the Japanese games didn't resonate here like these games do and it's

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
all about the song list.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.960
I mean, as much as you and I and her and her might like the Japanese songs-

04:38.960 --> 04:40.320
It doesn't matter if it's a song list though.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.880
I mean, you can take a game that has a crappy ass song list, like one of the DDRs or something

04:44.880 --> 04:49.760
like that, and still when In the Groove comes out, you can't say that that's original.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.120
So it doesn't matter.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.460
If it's been done before, it's not original.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.460
I don't care.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.040
If they want to improve on it, great.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.360
That's awesome if they want to improve on it.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.440
But it's not fucking original.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.440
If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going

05:07.440 --> 05:10.440
to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.920
GS68 says Konami wailed on In the Groove and pump it up but is pretending Guitar Hero doesn't

05:14.920 --> 05:15.920
exist.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.880
That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In the Groove should have done to DDR

05:20.880 --> 05:25.760
and that is completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone

05:25.760 --> 05:27.640
of Guitar Freaks.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.600
The only similarities between the games is they both have guitar controllers in their

05:31.600 --> 05:33.000
rhythm games.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.680
Otherwise they gave it the more amplitude look.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.360
They gave it characters and charisma and songs that we all knew.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.840
Guitar Hero, for me, hella improved on Guitar Freaks.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.640
I still have a soft spot in my heart for Guitar Freaks once in a while.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.320
How many fucking versions of Guitar Freaks are out there?

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
Over twelve now.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.320
Eleventy billion.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.480
Fourteen I think is what they're up to now.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.920
It's the same fucking game.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.360
The tracks aren't that great.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.280
Which is what Guitar Hero is going to turn into.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.760
Yes, it is going to turn into this.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.620
I like the harmonics now.

06:04.620 --> 06:08.560
This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, never soft.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.560
You can have Guitar Hero.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.560
Bye.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.560
We're going to go work on something bigger and better.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.560
That's smart harmonics to me.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.560
I think so.

06:13.560 --> 06:18.180
I'm curious to see what it's going to become, but here's my thing.

06:18.180 --> 06:21.120
People bitch about having to buy $600 systems and stuff.

06:21.120 --> 06:27.160
Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got

06:27.160 --> 06:32.400
leaked out there from GameStop, they were saying that they were starting to do preorders

06:32.400 --> 06:37.480
on stuff because they'll preorder games that don't exist yet.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.520
Let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something

06:41.520 --> 06:42.520
like that.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.960
You're spending $200 on a fucking game.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.320
That's a little much for me, I would think.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.680
People are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.680
Why not?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.880
Yeah, but still though, they drop another just for one game.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.560
You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.240
I guess she's going to get them all anyway.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.120
You're a peripheral whore, but I want to ask you, this is very interesting, and I think

07:07.120 --> 07:11.360
this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue, because you guys have to realize, six

07:11.360 --> 07:18.400
years ago, Flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is

07:18.400 --> 07:24.040
on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks, literally the three of us were playing this

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
band thing.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.880
Insert random other person on the guitar.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.680
We were kind of doing this a long time ago.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.280
We had a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.

07:33.280 --> 07:39.480
Now, nobody looked at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us

07:39.480 --> 07:40.480
on the machine.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.040
So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.560
He doesn't seem to care for it, because it's not original.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.960
I'm a little disappointed though, that he just didn't fully rip it off and do a keyboard

07:48.960 --> 07:51.720
as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.

07:51.720 --> 07:56.680
And I generally kind of like the idea, because, you know, well, Guitar Freaks, what do you

07:56.680 --> 07:58.680
think, Dark Soccer?

07:58.680 --> 08:03.320
Um, I honestly, I think it's going to be fun, because it's the closest we're going to get

08:03.320 --> 08:08.000
in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind

08:08.000 --> 08:09.800
of, you know, bullshit.

08:09.800 --> 08:15.600
But it's the closest we're going to get over here, it'll make it, you know, I think it'll

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
really catch on.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.760
I think that it's going to be a big thing.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.000
You know, I am a little disappointed though, in Konami, just a little bit, because they

08:21.000 --> 08:25.440
used to be so edgy with like, you know, DDR, and then karaoke revolution, no one had even

08:25.440 --> 08:29.040
thought about doing something like that, or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out

08:29.040 --> 08:33.240
there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.360
And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh games.

08:37.360 --> 08:42.240
I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom, just like

08:42.240 --> 08:45.920
totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside, you know, come out with the next

08:45.920 --> 08:47.560
big thing, you know.

08:47.560 --> 08:52.040
I think the other killer about this though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that

08:52.040 --> 08:55.560
money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the

08:55.560 --> 09:00.960
original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DDR, well, some

09:00.960 --> 09:02.280
DDR, some karaoke revolution.

09:02.280 --> 09:08.080
I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty

09:08.080 --> 09:09.080
good.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
They're solid.

09:10.080 --> 09:15.360
I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and despite the fact that I may

09:15.360 --> 09:19.040
not like most of their sports games, but, you know, I'm not a sports game fan.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.080
But still though, you've got, you know, they have the money to make this game good, and

09:24.080 --> 09:29.040
you know, you've got Harmonix, they know how to make music games, and then back that with

09:29.040 --> 09:35.480
MTV, now that, since they own Harmonix, it's going to be, it's going to be huge.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.320
That's, you know, no doubt about it.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.720
I just hope it's diverse.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.720
Yeah.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.520
You know, I don't want to play all these emo bands, you know, one emo song once in a while

09:43.520 --> 09:48.380
is kind of fun, you know, I wouldn't mind doing, hey, me today, and I wouldn't mind a little

09:48.380 --> 09:51.320
bit of that emo, but, you know, I don't want a whole game full of that.

09:51.320 --> 09:57.520
I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some, you know, new

09:57.520 --> 10:02.600
classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today, you know, I kind of hope they find a balance, and we'll

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
see them.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it, because that was...

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
There should be a keyboard, though.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.480
I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but, you know, I understand why it's not there,

10:11.480 --> 10:14.280
but it doesn't make me any less sad.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
Well...

10:15.280 --> 10:21.400
You know what I want to know, this is real, you know, kind of stupid, but, you're going

10:21.400 --> 10:25.600
to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going

10:25.600 --> 10:33.320
to be USB on, like, the 360, they're lacking one USB port for that, that's gonna be a problem.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.320
They need a...

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
Wireless mic?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
I don't know.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
Nothing...

10:37.320 --> 10:41.200
All right, I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
Ah, whatever.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.640
Well, I think this is kind of cool.

10:45.640 --> 10:54.320
During the conference for Rock Band, the harmonic CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance

10:54.320 --> 10:59.660
that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.080
It was actually specified, he said it without hesitation.

11:03.080 --> 11:08.780
He's quoted saying, we will, at some time, bring Rock Band to every important platform,

11:08.780 --> 11:15.640
and harmonics would be tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms,

11:15.640 --> 11:17.320
and he likes the Wiimote.

11:17.320 --> 11:23.000
Hmm, well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that

11:23.000 --> 11:26.440
platform, except playing online is going to suck, because Nintendo will make you put in

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
Franco's little crap.

11:27.440 --> 11:33.880
And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks

11:33.880 --> 11:36.640
or something like that, it will never work.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.280
Just make new peripherals.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.720
They could do a Taiko no Tatujin on Wii.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.800
Or it would be better, is if they made the peripherals universal, where they'll work

11:44.800 --> 11:47.840
for the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
That would be pretty cool.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.240
You know they're not.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.240
They could.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.240
If it's USB, that would be no problem.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.240
I don't know.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.880
All right, well, moving on, going back to Konami for a little bit, maybe this is where

11:59.880 --> 12:04.680
their music game franchise is headed, is BeatMania 2DX, trying to relaunch that, I guess, well,

12:04.680 --> 12:08.320
I don't know, so much relaunch, but trying to get that off the ground in arcades in the

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
US.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.560
You might remember there was a home version of BeatMania that came out a couple years

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
ago.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.680
And of course, everybody compared it to Guitar Hero, which is so wrong, because BeatMania

12:17.680 --> 12:20.840
was out many years before, and that's why Loki's so mad.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.960
But what should be interesting to note is that, remember there were location tests recently

12:24.960 --> 12:27.280
for 2DX Gold in America?

12:27.280 --> 12:32.960
Well, according to this user on bamanistyle.com, Brazzoliange, I probably mispronounced that

12:32.960 --> 12:38.720
horribly, sorry, this guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there,

12:38.720 --> 12:44.840
and she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it, and

12:44.840 --> 12:48.960
that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations, but they're

12:48.960 --> 12:52.940
having problems finding a distributor right now in the US and has not seen an easy way

12:52.940 --> 12:54.880
to import them.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.280
They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.

12:58.280 --> 13:03.520
Autonomy or Betson is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September,

13:03.520 --> 13:06.080
and this lady, I guess, is looking into that.

13:06.080 --> 13:11.160
So Dave & Buster's, they want to buy 2DX Gold, they're glad to see there is a client base,

13:11.160 --> 13:13.440
and they're looking into purchasing machines.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.840
If you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support, all the information

13:17.840 --> 13:19.280
is over there at bamanistyle.com.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.280
But pretty interesting.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.460
It'll be interesting if that game finally took off here, but I don't know, it's a bit

13:23.460 --> 13:24.520
of a novelty.

13:24.520 --> 13:30.800
I love B-Mania 2DX, but I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has

13:30.800 --> 13:36.480
unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.

13:36.480 --> 13:43.900
Put in anything Timbaland produced in there, or mix it with some new techno, like Faster

13:43.900 --> 13:50.360
Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff, and trance

13:50.360 --> 13:52.940
and dance, and it'll be huge!

13:52.940 --> 13:56.720
They don't know, that would never work, and what they need to do is they need to reinvent

13:56.720 --> 13:59.480
the whole damn franchise for the US, if they're going to do that.

13:59.480 --> 14:04.400
They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing, instead of just having

14:04.400 --> 14:05.400
keys and stuff.

14:05.400 --> 14:10.320
Actually, you just have turntables, a mixer, and stuff like that, more like Kraken DJ,

14:10.320 --> 14:13.120
or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.680
Easy to DJ though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot

14:16.680 --> 14:22.480
of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with Beatmania 2DX or something

14:22.480 --> 14:23.480
like that.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.320
They just need to make it, because right now people, when they see that, they're all,

14:26.320 --> 14:30.680
well that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer

14:30.680 --> 14:33.080
to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.080
Kraken DJ!

14:34.080 --> 14:35.840
Kraken DJ is a good example.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.640
But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast, maybe it was just because the songs in there were

14:39.640 --> 14:43.440
not recognizable at all, but I don't know, something about 2DX kept me on.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.640
They had a great, even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,

14:47.640 --> 14:51.540
at least the Konami produced originals have been very good, although I do think the quality

14:51.540 --> 14:54.520
has been slipping ever since like 10th.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.480
But I don't know, that's just me.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.880
I'm a jaded old man, Bimani player, what do I know?

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
Got the old part right.

15:01.880 --> 15:02.880
I mean, hi Rob.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.200
Excuse me, what year were you born and what year was I born?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.120
What thing am I holding up?

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
Rob.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.280
Alright, that's more years than that that separate us, but...

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
Rob, Rob, Rob.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
My birthday is in two weeks.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
Really?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.280
And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
Yes we are.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.280
Yay!

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
Rockin' Space Mountain.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
Hell yeah!

15:21.280 --> 15:24.720
We're back in time for the show, hopefully, otherwise we're doing it live from I-5.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.040
Uh, hi, this is me and I'm driving.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.680
God damn it!

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
Fucking SUV!

15:31.680 --> 15:33.080
God damn it!

15:33.080 --> 15:35.360
Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.360
God damn it, motherfuckers!

15:37.360 --> 15:40.760
That will be me, won't it?

15:40.760 --> 15:47.120
So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the

15:47.120 --> 15:55.200
PlayStation 3 20GB system, that's skewed at least, well Sony style is no longer carrying

15:55.200 --> 16:00.560
the 20GB system and that's kind of interesting and that kind of further backs up what everybody

16:00.560 --> 16:05.040
else either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done

16:05.040 --> 16:10.520
with it or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling, the 20GB at least

16:10.520 --> 16:16.300
is not selling and I know for a lot of retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore

16:16.300 --> 16:23.120
so I don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20GB system,

16:23.120 --> 16:26.360
probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there

16:26.360 --> 16:32.760
but I think they're done with the 20GB system, it's my opinion.

16:32.760 --> 16:39.520
And actually, I think, while I was trying to read here, Joystiq, I believe, contacted

16:39.520 --> 16:45.560
Sony style and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month and they said

16:45.560 --> 16:49.160
they're not getting any more, you could go out and find one though.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.800
Has anyone checked the Metreon store?

16:51.800 --> 16:58.880
I don't know, but I know my 20GB is awesome so you don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit,

16:58.880 --> 17:02.360
that's just, just plug it in, plug the damn thing in.

17:02.360 --> 17:08.080
Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play and then I'll talk hardware.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.960
Exactly.

17:09.960 --> 17:21.600
Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they

17:21.600 --> 17:26.880
actually are both not coming out in May as we have been told.

17:26.880 --> 17:36.560
They still have a 2007 release but Sony isn't really saying much about it so we'll just,

17:36.560 --> 17:40.680
I guess, keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
Probably summer.

17:41.680 --> 17:48.040
I don't think they have anything else coming out, I mean Lair, Heavenly Sword, I don't

17:48.040 --> 17:52.520
think they have anything really, well I guess Warhawk, oooh, Warhawk, that's gonna be awesome.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.520
Ohjoyandrapture.com.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.780
Let's see, let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking

17:59.780 --> 18:02.680
waited until 2008 to launch the system.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.680
Write that up there on the board, alright, there we go.

18:05.680 --> 18:13.520
Now we have, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.000
But one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam, you know, sometimes

18:18.000 --> 18:22.240
a lot of people give this system a lot of crap, but the PSP is still chugging along

18:22.240 --> 18:25.360
and now it's chugging along at a lower price, that's been people's number one bitch about

18:25.360 --> 18:31.860
the system, well now the core system is only $169.99, that is a drop from the $199.00.

18:31.860 --> 18:36.980
Keep in mind though that the core only comes with, I believe, what, the unit, the charger,

18:36.980 --> 18:37.980
and that's it.

18:37.980 --> 18:41.160
It doesn't come with any games, it doesn't come with shit.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.760
Yeah, but if you're gonna buy the Entertainment Pack or something like that, those have also

18:44.760 --> 18:46.900
dropped down 30 bucks as well, so.

18:46.900 --> 18:50.160
Keep in mind though, the cool thing about the PSP versus the DS is that, you know, you

18:50.160 --> 18:54.720
can get online with it right out of the box, you can visit OLRPSP.com with it right out

18:54.720 --> 18:59.720
of the box and download your favoritest podcast in the world, oh, you need a memory stick

18:59.720 --> 19:00.720
though.

19:00.720 --> 19:06.080
I'm just kidding.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.000
Touche.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.160
Anyways, other things coming to the PSP, at least if you're in Japan, they're getting

19:13.160 --> 19:23.880
a voice over IP service being made by Jaja, and apparently it's not exactly easy to use,

19:23.880 --> 19:32.440
you actually have to log into Jaja's mobile link using your PSP web browser and via its

19:32.440 --> 19:40.200
Wi-Fi connection, and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking

19:40.200 --> 19:45.680
with phones and stuff like that, not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.800
Unfortunately there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.760
So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?

19:52.760 --> 19:55.240
I don't know, probably a while.

19:55.240 --> 20:01.640
But yeah, there's a YouTube video out there, so if you want to see it in action, you can

20:01.640 --> 20:09.160
do that, but of course if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.920
All right.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.920
You know what?

20:13.920 --> 20:14.920
What?

20:14.920 --> 20:15.920
I think we should all just move anyway.

20:15.920 --> 20:16.920
Just move?

20:16.920 --> 20:17.920
Yeah, why not?

20:17.920 --> 20:18.920
Make our own country.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.180
What brought that on?

20:20.180 --> 20:23.400
And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
games.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
Yay!

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
Games more expensive!

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
Awesome!

20:27.400 --> 20:33.280
Anyway, there's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final

20:33.280 --> 20:38.240
Fantasy 13 available on the PlayStation 3 network.

20:38.240 --> 20:43.280
Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this

20:43.280 --> 20:49.880
spring thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year the honor

20:49.880 --> 20:52.200
will go to the PlayStation Network.

20:52.200 --> 20:56.200
As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
That'd be funny.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.280
Well, it's still floating about the rumor mill, so.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.720
Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing though.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.800
Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
Right.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.800
That would be something else.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.920
It might hit Japan Store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.680
Not necessarily.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.640
Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the US,

21:18.640 --> 21:19.640
right?

21:19.640 --> 21:20.640
Yeah.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.640
There's that and there's ways.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.760
Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.720
Yeah, but then all the text is in Japanese.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.720
Who cares?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.720
It doesn't matter.

21:29.720 --> 21:34.460
Alright, well another who cares for me, you know, we've been talking a lot this episode

21:34.460 --> 21:40.600
about Guitar Hero and Hands On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar

21:40.600 --> 21:44.980
Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.

21:44.980 --> 21:48.880
You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar

21:48.880 --> 21:50.760
Hero on a cell phone because you know it's gonna suck.

21:50.760 --> 21:57.460
I mean, I'm sorry, but you know, rhythm game, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks, so why

21:57.460 --> 22:01.300
would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?

22:01.300 --> 22:03.000
People should stop gaming on cell phones.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Hey, I play Lumines.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.200
Yeah, Lumines is okay.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.560
Tell that to fucking Nvidia, or not Nvidia, Nokia.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.560
Nokia.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
Yeah, Nokia.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.720
The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.760
That's it.

22:18.760 --> 22:19.760
We don't need anything else.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.720
You know what cell phone game is pretty awesome?

22:21.720 --> 22:28.760
It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive instead of trying to play your stupid

22:28.760 --> 22:31.760
mobile games at red lights.

22:31.760 --> 22:37.280
Anyways, Apply Makeup The Game.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
That's horrible.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.480
Actually, I think they do have a game like that too.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.480
Do they really?

22:40.480 --> 22:41.480
Like Barbie?

22:41.480 --> 22:42.480
Barbie cell phone game?

22:42.480 --> 22:44.880
I've actually seen women driving down the road, they're like putting makeup on, like

22:44.880 --> 22:49.960
I've totally seen this in traffic, like lipstick on the rear view mirror, it's like DRIVE!

22:49.960 --> 22:55.840
Yeah, anyways, you have a little bit of makeup, it's not going to transform you from, you

22:55.840 --> 23:00.840
know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen, so.

23:00.840 --> 23:06.560
Anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little

23:06.560 --> 23:08.160
bit.

23:08.160 --> 23:16.320
There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, Jon

23:16.320 --> 23:19.880
Tam, who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.880
I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy

23:23.880 --> 23:27.080
that you got, I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of

23:27.080 --> 23:30.320
the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Lawns YouTube, if you look up our

23:30.320 --> 23:34.400
account, you can see this guy that got the smack down here.

23:34.400 --> 23:42.680
Anyways, settlement has been reached, they are no longer able to, there was some interesting

23:42.680 --> 23:46.960
stuff around this, because it didn't make any sense to me a little bit, because they

23:46.960 --> 23:53.920
said that they were doing a demo of a game that was based off of Step Mania and Guitar

23:53.920 --> 23:54.920
Hero.

23:54.920 --> 23:58.120
It says a demo incorporating elements of Guitar Hero and Step Mania.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.000
I thought Step Mania is not a game, wouldn't that be in the groove that they're talking

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
about?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.720
I don't know, whatever, the groove is basically Step Mania anyway.

24:05.720 --> 24:11.600
Another part of the introduction, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer

24:11.600 --> 24:16.960
based games for the next year, nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero

24:16.960 --> 24:23.360
2 until six months after the game's release, and some other stuff like that.

24:23.360 --> 24:29.120
So, that kind of sucks, oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos

24:29.120 --> 24:32.040
for a while.

24:32.040 --> 24:36.880
This is what you get when you break those NDAs.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.400
Alright, well then you won't be breaking any NDAs, right Loki?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Nope.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
Alright.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
I don't break NDAs.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.400
That's right.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.700
Alright, well, one thing we like to break open every week here on Orange Launch Radio

24:47.700 --> 24:51.920
is the mailbag, and Dark Soccer likes to jump into the mailbag and pull out some of our

24:51.920 --> 24:55.080
favorite emails to read for you right here on the program.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.600
If you want to email us, it's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
Dark Soccer!

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
What?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.360
Who sent us Anthrax this week?

25:03.360 --> 25:05.360
My mother.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.480
Look how evil of her, okay.

25:08.480 --> 25:11.880
First email, hi, it's Zaid from London again.

25:11.880 --> 25:16.360
I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii edition.

25:16.360 --> 25:22.520
I was reading about it on the net, and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.840
Also I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any

25:26.840 --> 25:29.640
idea if us Brits will get that too?

25:29.640 --> 25:32.640
Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?

25:32.640 --> 25:36.320
Always have a good one, Zaid Mohammed.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.000
And last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I hope this one is better.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.640
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.480
Don't even bother.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.700
Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where Dark Soccer is admitting

25:48.700 --> 25:49.700
she's a bitch?

25:49.700 --> 25:50.700
No, I'm proud.

25:50.700 --> 25:51.700
Heart.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.700
Hey, Rob.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.700
What?

25:53.700 --> 25:54.700
Broken heart.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.700
No.

25:55.700 --> 25:56.700
No.

25:56.700 --> 25:57.700
No.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
Resident Evil 4 on the Wii.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.700
Yes, it's happening.

25:59.700 --> 26:02.040
We don't know much, but we talked about it in part A, right?

26:02.040 --> 26:07.960
So go download part A. As far as DVD playback on the Wii, well, I think that's been announced

26:07.960 --> 26:09.020
previously.

26:09.020 --> 26:11.600
How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?

26:11.600 --> 26:12.840
Hooray.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.760
That could be the 10th DVD player in my house.

26:15.760 --> 26:21.320
But for the little kid with a Wii in his bedroom, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.440
Yes, Loki.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.700
Gateway to porn.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.700
That's what it is.

26:26.700 --> 26:27.700
Gateway to porn.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.800
Now that can play all the porn DVDs.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.920
So let's gateway the porn.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.920
Hooray.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.980
All right.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.040
Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?

26:37.040 --> 26:38.600
Eventually, I'm sure.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.160
Yes, but six months later than us.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.640
Because Nintendo hates you.

26:43.640 --> 26:47.120
Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.120
Anyway, next email please, Rob.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.800
I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.600
I feel sorry for you guys.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
Something to do with the revolutionary war.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.800
We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.680
We'll figure something out.

27:01.680 --> 27:06.640
We got an email from Ron says don't call him cute.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.640
We call Ron?

27:07.640 --> 27:08.640
I don't remember him calling.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.640
He was the young one.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.960
Aw, the cute little kid that emailed us.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.000
Next email from AZHP.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.080
Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast

27:20.080 --> 27:26.560
waiting for my vector calculus class to start and Rob started playing blow my whistle, I

27:26.560 --> 27:30.080
inadvertently began bobbing my head and before I knew it, I was break dancing outside the

27:30.080 --> 27:32.280
classroom and then the music stopped.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
I was sad.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.280
Sad face.

27:34.280 --> 27:41.200
But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2 and for that, I wanted

27:41.200 --> 27:44.800
to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.400
We lived to confuse.

27:47.400 --> 27:53.560
That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little

27:53.560 --> 27:56.680
bit of it, it makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.360
You know, Rob, camstorm.

27:59.360 --> 28:04.640
You have to have the, you know.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.200
Aw, but I do, I do, I do.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.840
That song was horrible.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.840
Next email.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
Alright, yes.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.360
Dear LLR crew, first of all, congratulations to Dark Sakura for graduating and getting

28:16.360 --> 28:17.360
certified EROC.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
I know.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
Thank you.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
Finally, someone else says it.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.320
Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program

28:24.320 --> 28:26.040
is produced.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.560
Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.480
I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.440
Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?

28:36.440 --> 28:37.440
Yeah.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.880
Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner,

28:39.880 --> 28:43.160
but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland so we could go.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.160
Yeah, it was.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.160
More.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.160
What the, why?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
Email.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.160
Why hasn't he come on the show?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.160
Email.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.160
Alright.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.160
Maybe he'll answer that question.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.160
Alright, fine.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.640
It seems that I've recently begun to crave pinball mildly.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.800
Oh, you are so in luck.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.440
And while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate

28:59.440 --> 29:03.560
a proper table with flippers and steel balls and lanes and bumpers and popular culture

29:03.560 --> 29:08.120
tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands

29:08.120 --> 29:12.180
that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.

29:12.180 --> 29:15.760
It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate and so

29:15.760 --> 29:16.840
I put the question to you.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.860
Where might I find good local pinball?

29:19.860 --> 29:20.860
Not at RBGL.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.860
Shit.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.640
Oh, there's a PS on here.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.240
My profound thanks, Warrior Bob.

29:26.240 --> 29:30.160
PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's

29:30.160 --> 29:34.560
house, but I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking

29:34.560 --> 29:35.560
creepy.

29:35.560 --> 29:41.640
PPS, Byron promised me pinball once that they were liars, because Byron is a piece of crap.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.080
Scandia had a bunch of machines.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.520
I haven't been there in a long time, though.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.520
Madison and I-80.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.240
Have you seen the weird thing that they've gotten up and down?

29:48.240 --> 29:52.280
Their new little, like, we're going to throw you up in the air thing, that ride they have,

29:52.280 --> 29:53.480
that thing is scary looking.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.480
As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.560
What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.800
Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my God, Scandia

30:02.800 --> 30:05.520
has got this new ride called the motherfucking eyesore.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.520
The piece of shit.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.480
Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.480
It's called the pooflinger.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.480
I thought, like, for example- Hey, email, right?

30:11.480 --> 30:12.480
No.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.400
Yes, but I want to say real quick, the last time I went to Scandia, which

30:15.400 --> 30:18.840
granted was a couple years ago, they had, like, seven pinball machines there.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.160
RVGL's machines are shit.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.160
They don't have anything now.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.160
They have, like, two machines.

30:23.160 --> 30:28.460
Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.460
And I'm not even joking.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.000
I sadly wouldn't doubt that.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.240
Honestly, it really- she has, like, at least six or seven operational machines, and they're

30:35.240 --> 30:36.240
free.

30:36.240 --> 30:41.760
At present, I have- and not all of them are mine, because, unfortunately, Dan's friend

30:41.760 --> 30:43.120
Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.040
So we have a bride of pinbot.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.920
We've got, um- what else do I have here?

30:47.920 --> 30:55.360
We have bride of pinbot, judge dread, whodunnit, rocky and bullwinkle, guns and roses, um...

30:55.360 --> 30:56.360
Star Trek The Next Generation.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
What the fuck?

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
What is that?

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
Sorry.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.880
Extrofer and Nellie are in here because they're waiting for match game, and since we haven't

31:01.880 --> 31:04.280
acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.

31:04.280 --> 31:09.080
They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher, and apparently

31:09.080 --> 31:12.840
Extrofer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
That was Nellie.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
Oh, that was Nellie.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
That's what Extrofer drew with this little-

31:15.840 --> 31:16.840
It was like a bone.

31:16.840 --> 31:20.500
But then it drew, I heart bunny, and there's this picture of a bunny there-

31:20.500 --> 31:21.800
I think it's supposed to be a cat.

31:21.800 --> 31:26.240
With a teeny tiny penis, with a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.

31:26.240 --> 31:33.120
So, I heart teeny tiny bunny penis.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.960
Only Extrofer can bring this show to a screeching halt.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.960
Anyway- Next email!

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
Hey, I was still answering his question.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.960
Oh, sorry.

31:38.960 --> 31:44.120
Um, yeah, and I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch, Johnny Mnemonic, and Creature

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
from the Black Lagoon.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.020
So, honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.

31:48.020 --> 31:51.680
If you want to play, you've got my number.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.480
It won't be creepy if you call.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.040
I have friends at my house.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.540
It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.

31:58.540 --> 32:01.880
Dark Soccer owns a gun anyway, so she'll- I own several.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
And knives.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
Several good knives.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.040
And I know how to use them.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
And guns to turn into knives.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
And if you think I'm joking, no.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.040
Gun knives.

32:09.040 --> 32:13.440
Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?

32:13.440 --> 32:14.440
slave-wielding snakes.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.160
No, I asked for a Beretta.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.200
They should have a gun spork.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.200
Any more emails?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.200
Yes!

32:21.200 --> 32:22.200
There's three more.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.200
Um.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.200
Okay.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.200
Hey, OLR.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.200
Hey.

32:26.200 --> 32:33.640
First, I want to say that I love the podcast, hope you guys continue it for a long time.

32:33.640 --> 32:38.480
Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.

32:38.480 --> 32:43.120
I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
yet.

32:44.120 --> 32:48.200
A. Appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower but not something that would

32:48.200 --> 32:52.520
bore them like RollerCoaster Tycoon B. Do not have a frustrating learning curve

32:52.520 --> 32:57.840
C. Are $25 American or less B. And D. Do not have a monthly fee such as

32:57.840 --> 32:59.000
World of Warcrack.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
That about covers it.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Thanks, GamerDad.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.320
I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.

33:07.320 --> 33:15.160
It is over $25, however, you will not have a registration fee, and aren't there parental

33:15.160 --> 33:17.040
controls available for Guild Wars?

33:17.040 --> 33:19.560
You can censor the dirty language.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.240
You can censor it out.

33:21.240 --> 33:26.680
Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment, considering

33:26.680 --> 33:29.920
that I paid $14 a month for World of Warcraft.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.600
After four months, you've paid for the game, pretty much.

33:33.600 --> 33:39.880
Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.880
I would assume that you don't have a Mac.

33:41.880 --> 33:47.960
So I would recommend that you play, oh, actually Star Wars Battlefront II, maybe.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.960
It's a bit old, and it might be cheap now, where you can play that.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.960
It might be pretty fun.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.960
There's also worms.

33:52.960 --> 33:57.960
Well, worms, yeah, it doesn't really benefit from, you know.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.080
There's a bunch of free stuff out there, like all the stuff you can get, like Source, like

34:01.080 --> 34:05.440
Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.

34:05.440 --> 34:12.320
That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.

34:12.320 --> 34:16.280
If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, that's a fun one.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.280
Tetranet!

34:17.280 --> 34:18.280
Tetranet!

34:18.280 --> 34:20.400
Isn't that kind of a violent game?

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
Garry's Mod?

34:21.400 --> 34:23.400
Oh, no, never mind, never mind.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
Sorry.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.400
Let me think.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.520
Seriously, I know you said no monthly fee, but seriously, look in the game tab, because

34:29.520 --> 34:33.380
it's got so many games, and you can set the parental controls in there, and give the kids

34:33.380 --> 34:37.400
their own account, and there's even educational games in there, not that they'd actually play

34:37.400 --> 34:38.640
them, but at least that's available.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.520
There are a lot of other games in there.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.920
Sims 2 is $25 now.

34:41.920 --> 34:47.040
Sims 2, Civilization, I mean, I know you said the rollercoaster tycoon would bore them,

34:47.040 --> 34:51.680
but Civilization's a heck of a lot of fun, but I don't know, I played it when I was 12,

34:51.680 --> 34:52.680
the original one.

34:52.680 --> 34:55.380
Command Conquer 3, but it's a bit more expensive, that just came out.

34:55.380 --> 35:02.240
It also depends, I would say, not knowing your sons, I'm not sure what type of genres

35:02.240 --> 35:08.960
they're interested in, I would say look at the games that they play off of the PC, or

35:08.960 --> 35:13.160
look at the types of, like if they're interested in books, or what types of movies they like,

35:13.160 --> 35:20.240
and then go to GameStop, or go look online, and find something in the same genre, and

35:20.240 --> 35:21.240
use that as your criteria.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.200
Mandarin, do you have any suggestions?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.200
I saw one.

35:24.200 --> 35:29.960
Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though the first episode is $32, each of the following

35:29.960 --> 35:38.080
are only $9, and they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts,

35:38.080 --> 35:41.000
which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kid's time on the computer to

35:41.000 --> 35:45.920
like an hour or so, it'll give them a little bit more playtime throughout the whole thing,

35:45.920 --> 35:52.440
versus other games where it takes several days to finish.

35:52.440 --> 35:58.240
Kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, for kids, boy or girl,

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
and they do really well.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
Grab the pitchforks and porches!

36:01.240 --> 36:02.240
Shut up.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.400
I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad, that

36:05.400 --> 36:09.040
you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie, but apparently

36:09.040 --> 36:11.520
Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad, not bad.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.080
Oh, never mind, I was incorrect, season one, the whole season is $32.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.080
Sorry.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.840
I was incorrect about the price and now I'm getting corrected here, the season is $32

36:18.840 --> 36:23.760
and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying a season, but again

36:23.760 --> 36:26.920
I said it's still a really good game and it's kid-friendly.

36:26.920 --> 36:32.480
Or you get game tab.

36:32.480 --> 36:41.480
Keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.

36:41.480 --> 36:49.320
I would say really, take those interests and look for things that associate with those

36:49.320 --> 36:52.200
interests that are within your price range and have the criteria.

36:52.200 --> 36:58.000
Now one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere, okay Rob, if you wrote

36:58.000 --> 37:07.800
I heart pussy Hitler, there's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this

37:07.800 --> 37:08.800
page.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.400
I'm going to pretend I never saw that.

37:10.400 --> 37:14.960
I'd like to confiscate this note, frame it, hang it on your fridge, oh Amanda needs to

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
see pussy Hitler.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.880
I'll let Amanda guard it for me.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.160
I'm sorry gamer dad, I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
thought.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.160
Sorry gamer dad.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.160
Blame Rob.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.880
You and your 13 year old kids sound pretty cool, but we got pussy Hitler in studio.

37:29.880 --> 37:34.080
Hey, he said both of his sons were 13, I wonder if they're twins.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.080
Maybe.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.960
So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
too.

37:38.960 --> 37:48.240
So from the Rob D, I just listened to your April Fool Day joke and I got to say I'm cracking

37:48.240 --> 37:49.240
up like crazy.

37:49.240 --> 37:54.080
I really shouldn't be laughing at this, at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta

37:54.080 --> 37:56.880
and Matilda sent me over the edge.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.120
Good idea and it was pretty funny.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.600
That said, Ms. Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming besides

38:02.600 --> 38:04.660
Ms. Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.

38:04.660 --> 38:08.840
She just had an, she's just an independent woman with an open relationship.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.560
Me and Pac-Man have a kid, don't you remember the old cartoons?

38:11.560 --> 38:13.440
Well yeah, they did suck.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.320
What's your favorite April Fool Day joke this year?

38:15.320 --> 38:22.020
I enjoyed the snakes in MySpace joke on VGCats and the 8-bit tie on ThinkGeek.

38:22.020 --> 38:24.760
Of course, nothing beats Shang Long in the old EGM issue.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.920
You must defeat Shang Long to stand a chance.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.240
How many April Fool's jokes have actually influenced the franchise enough to inspire

38:30.240 --> 38:32.680
a new legendary character like Akuma?

38:32.680 --> 38:35.800
I think Gohki was a better name.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.640
Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show, O.L.R. has become a weekly fixture on

38:39.640 --> 38:43.160
my iPod and its space on there is well-deserved.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.400
Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do and I'll keep on listening,

38:46.400 --> 38:50.600
smile face, the Rob D. Roberta's really glad to hear that you're

38:50.600 --> 38:51.600
a big fan.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.400
You sound like Kirstie Alley.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.360
And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.880
I think that, I think, I think, I think, look, you said it best, you sounded like Kirstie

38:58.880 --> 38:59.880
Alley.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.880
Um, let's see, what, uh.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.560
I didn't have to do a damn thing.

39:03.560 --> 39:09.000
I'm going to, not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most

39:09.000 --> 39:11.800
of the internet's April Fool's jokes this year, so I think we seriously have one of

39:11.800 --> 39:12.800
the better ones.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.800
I'm sorry.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
We had a great joke.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.160
I think that mine were great.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.400
We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.640
So visit dig.com and dig our episode.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.800
By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.880
I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.

39:27.880 --> 39:33.320
While you're digging in there, um, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's

39:33.320 --> 39:38.280
because they poked fun at Myspace, which was kind of amusing.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.960
Who wants to touch it?

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
This is not a joke.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.960
Who wants to touch it?

39:44.960 --> 39:49.480
Ah, it's the, the Christmas check finally making its way.

39:49.480 --> 39:53.760
We, it got, it got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally,

39:53.760 --> 39:54.760
so it'll be fun.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.920
Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account set up.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
Fun, fun, fun.

39:58.920 --> 40:06.480
So I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to, uh, Kristen for being like freaking

40:06.480 --> 40:07.480
rad.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.480
Okay, now I'm done.

40:09.480 --> 40:12.040
I'm being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.880
Um, all right, what?

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
All right.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
Yeah.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.160
The 8-bit tie was awesome.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.160
I know.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.160
I heard, I heard they're going to make it for real.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.160
That's awesome.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.160
I want one.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.160
Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?

40:22.160 --> 40:23.160
All right.

40:23.160 --> 40:26.560
Uh, chat that orangeonsrated.com if you want to join our chat room, I gave you the link

40:26.560 --> 40:30.880
there to a dig, uh, where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.920
Uh, Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
They didn't have one this year.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
Yeah.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
Whatever happened to that?

40:36.920 --> 40:37.920
Um, they did have one.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
What was it?

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
It wasn't public.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.960
It was actually just someone, what I said on the show, it was actually was a thought

40:44.960 --> 40:48.160
that we, that would come up with on the moderator's thread.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.720
Um, and I just decided just to throw it out there since no one seemed to, you know, wanted

40:51.720 --> 40:53.760
to get off their ass and actually do it.

40:53.760 --> 40:58.040
So, um, the joke was that we were going to tell everybody that there was a big joke hidden

40:58.040 --> 41:02.200
on DDR Freak and if anyone found it, then you win a prize.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.080
Um, Rob found the joke.

41:04.080 --> 41:09.000
So Rob wins a no prize for anyone who was, uh, an old, um, okay.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.560
I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.560
Stop.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
Okay.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
Extra for Drew.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.200
We have extra for Nellie in the room.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.600
Now they can talk and not pass some giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.160
It's no, but it says I heart man-gina.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.440
It looks like goat say that he drew on there.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.120
Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
you fools can leave.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.120
All right.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
Heart.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
All right.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.560
Quick, more video game stories.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.560
This one's about violence.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.560
Everybody likes violence.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.200
Well, um, let's see.

41:41.200 --> 41:47.200
There was a study recently that was done, um, that looked at 120 children, uh, before

41:47.200 --> 41:49.640
and after a 20 minute quake two session.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.480
The study was done by a university Swinburne university technology in Melbourne, Australia.

41:54.480 --> 42:00.080
Um, and it said that, uh, while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending

42:00.080 --> 42:04.440
on their emotional state before playing, the majority of kids were not affected by the

42:04.440 --> 42:10.000
game violence at all quote professor Devley said much of the research linking aggressive

42:10.000 --> 42:13.200
behavior to violent video games has been unconvincing.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.280
It's the only message parents have ever received and it's just not accurate.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.800
He said the study showed aggression link linked to game playing depended on a player's mood

42:20.800 --> 42:23.000
and predisposition to aggression.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.960
He said, so in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they

42:27.960 --> 42:31.040
won't act out, act out on it after they play a video game.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.440
Who would have thought?

42:33.440 --> 42:35.600
Who would have thunk it anyways?

42:35.600 --> 42:39.240
Well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.720
Well, I like volume games.

42:40.720 --> 42:46.040
I don't know who wouldn't, but um, apparently the proper, the rapper creator, um, he wants

42:46.040 --> 42:49.920
less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.

42:49.920 --> 42:55.080
I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but anyways, apparently, um, Messiah

42:55.080 --> 43:01.840
Matsuura, uh, creator of the proper, the rapper says that the industry should stop focusing

43:01.840 --> 43:04.280
on X rated violent affairs.

43:04.280 --> 43:07.000
No they shouldn't more X rated games would be better.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.240
Actually some X rated games would be better cause they don't have any.

43:10.240 --> 43:21.360
Um, let's see, he was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers

43:21.360 --> 43:27.640
and uh, also basically said at the recent, um, Australian GO3 conference, um, making

43:27.640 --> 43:36.000
good games that everybody can play is a very high priority and um, I don't know.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
It's interesting.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.240
I mean also that he wants faster TVs cause I guess he's talking about the delay between,

43:41.240 --> 43:45.720
you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
More rhythm games.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.800
Who would have thought it?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.440
How about we just get another Parappa sequel?

43:51.440 --> 43:52.640
Oh, I hit myself in the chin.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.400
I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.400
More Parappa!

43:55.400 --> 43:58.560
Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.560
Well guess what?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.160
What?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.160
Chicken butt.

44:03.160 --> 44:10.120
Anyway, um, they have signed up though, and honestly I don't really give two shits about

44:10.120 --> 44:14.760
the game cause I really don't give two shits about the movie either, but um, Peter Cullen

44:14.760 --> 44:20.200
and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
game.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.640
Now, now, now, the new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have

44:24.640 --> 44:27.360
for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
Really?

44:28.360 --> 44:34.360
Why all the hate for Transformers?

44:34.360 --> 44:38.840
The seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my, you

44:38.840 --> 44:43.120
know, Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
Maybe, you know, I'm gonna see it.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.040
I haven't said I'm not gonna see it.

44:47.040 --> 44:53.120
I will, and I'll reserve my judgment, my final judgment for when I see it, but right now,

44:53.120 --> 44:57.040
it doesn't seem right, so I don't know.

44:57.040 --> 45:03.180
But if Starscream is fucking awesome, as usual, cause I, I, I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream

45:03.180 --> 45:08.680
when I was little, so it better, if it's cool, then I'll go see it.

45:08.680 --> 45:11.760
It's awesome, and they have it, uh, I think it's on the internet.

45:11.760 --> 45:15.160
Too bad his voice actor's dead.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.160
He was Cobra Commander.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.160
COBRA!

45:18.160 --> 45:19.160
Sorry.

45:19.160 --> 45:24.000
They have that on- Wow, that was a random outburst.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.960
I love the 80s, or, like, one of the, I love the 80s things that they did, they had, like,

45:27.960 --> 45:32.440
Cobra Commander, like, a day in the life of Cobra Commander or something like that, and

45:32.440 --> 45:39.160
they'd have him do different things, and they'd always go, COBRA!

45:39.160 --> 45:42.440
I just wanna have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.960
I think that would be awesome.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.960
Sorry.

45:46.960 --> 45:47.960
That's not video game news.

45:47.960 --> 45:51.520
Drink, drink like some Drano, and then you'll sound like him.

45:51.520 --> 45:54.040
All right, kids, do you know what time it is?

45:54.040 --> 45:55.600
Ice cream!

45:55.600 --> 46:02.120
No, but almost, almost as good.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.320
It's time to play the match game!

46:04.320 --> 46:08.800
Video game match game here on Orange Laundry AO.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.120
We gotta get ourselves a caller, though, to play.

46:11.120 --> 46:16.680
Uh, GS68 is one of our contestants tonight, I hope he's there.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.000
He changed his nickname, which makes me think he might have left.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.920
If so, he's gonna have to surrender his spot to someone else.

46:21.920 --> 46:23.560
How dare you leave during the show?

46:23.560 --> 46:24.560
All right.

46:24.560 --> 46:28.480
Well, meanwhile, though, we're going to get another, okay, good, he's still there.

46:28.480 --> 46:33.360
Let's get another contestant on the Skype line right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can

46:33.360 --> 46:37.640
call us, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, and we'll just take the first person on the

46:37.640 --> 46:41.040
line tonight to play match game.

46:41.040 --> 46:44.600
Remember the way match, wouldn't that be funny if no one called?

46:44.600 --> 46:46.240
Remember the way, oh good, we already got a call.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

46:48.480 --> 46:49.480
Zappi.

46:49.480 --> 46:50.480
Zappi!

46:50.480 --> 46:51.960
What's on your mind, buddy?

46:51.960 --> 46:54.400
I'm just hoping I don't lose at the match game.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.560
All right, well you got in first, congratulations, you're gonna play match game with us tonight.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.240
I know I'm not gonna get any matches at all.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.720
That's all right, people usually don't here on the match game, but that's all right.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.240
All right, so stop calling, Zappi got through, he's our contestant.

47:06.240 --> 47:10.400
Zappi versus GS68 tonight, Zappi, do you have a MySpace account?

47:10.400 --> 47:11.400
No, I don't.

47:11.400 --> 47:15.720
Oh, you should get one, because if you win tonight, you will be put in our MySpace Top

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
20.

47:16.720 --> 47:20.360
So, that's a very nice prize, but you're gonna have to battle, I know, isn't that as stupid

47:20.360 --> 47:21.360
as prize ever?

47:21.360 --> 47:22.360
We have to give him cover.

47:22.360 --> 47:27.480
All right, GS68 is one of our other contestants, he will also be battling you for that spot.

47:27.480 --> 47:31.920
All right, so let's meet our celebrities.

47:31.920 --> 47:36.680
All right, celebrity number one is somebody you haven't really seen on this show a whole

47:36.680 --> 47:39.960
lot, but she's back tonight, here to match some questions with you.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.960
Say hello to Mandarin.

47:41.960 --> 47:42.960
Hi.

47:42.960 --> 47:47.920
All right, that was a very somewhat non-sexy hi.

47:47.920 --> 47:51.360
How are you guys doing?

47:51.360 --> 47:57.200
Do you have any clubs or organizations you'd like to plug while you're here, the charity

47:57.200 --> 47:58.200
you're playing for?

47:58.200 --> 48:03.040
The charity, get Rob Laidmore?

48:03.040 --> 48:12.600
Yeah, anyway, also joining us tonight is celebrity number two, you know him for such films as

48:12.600 --> 48:14.760
... What did Orko and Chat say?

48:14.760 --> 48:16.440
That was like the best thing ever.

48:16.440 --> 48:20.400
By the way, that's one of my favorite nicknames ever.

48:20.400 --> 48:25.520
He's been in such films as Pussy Hitler and Penis Stalin versus Mangina.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.240
Say hello to Extover.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.920
Hello, everybody.

48:29.920 --> 48:33.600
And the microphone has been placed in guest number three's boobies.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.600
Say... What?

48:34.600 --> 48:35.600
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:35.600 --> 48:36.600
The charity.

48:36.600 --> 48:37.600
Oh, what charity are you playing for, Extover?

48:37.600 --> 48:39.320
The Boobies of America.

48:39.320 --> 48:41.840
We can't hear, you gotta get... The Boobies of America.

48:41.840 --> 48:46.200
All right, The Boobies of America.

48:46.200 --> 48:51.400
Guest number three tonight is known for her massive cleavage that stores microphones in

48:51.400 --> 48:54.880
them and also known on this program as The Wife.

48:54.880 --> 48:56.200
Say hello to Nellie.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.200
Hello.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.640
And what charity are you playing for tonight, Nellie?

48:59.640 --> 49:01.360
Battered Wives of America.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.680
All right.

49:02.680 --> 49:06.280
Celebrity number four is the often outspoken guest of Orange Lounge Radio.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.280
Say hello to Loki.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.280
Beer batter.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.280
Beer batter.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.280
What the hell?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.280
Ahem, a show, Loki.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.280
Yeah.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Oh.

49:14.280 --> 49:18.560
What charity are you playing for tonight?

49:18.560 --> 49:21.480
I guess the beer batter wives of America.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.480
All right.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.440
And deep fry them, seven style.

49:25.440 --> 49:30.320
Celebrity number five is here tonight and celebrity number five is known for...

49:30.320 --> 49:32.880
Satan.

49:32.880 --> 49:33.880
Worshipping Satan.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.880
Say hello to Dark Sakura.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.880
Souls.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.400
And what charity are you playing for tonight?

49:39.400 --> 49:40.400
Health.

49:40.400 --> 49:44.400
And celebrity number six needs no introduction.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.480
It's me.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.480
And I'm playing for the...

49:46.480 --> 49:47.480
Roberta.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.480
Oh, do you want me to do it as Roberta?

49:49.480 --> 49:50.480
No.

49:50.480 --> 49:51.480
No.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.480
Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?

49:52.480 --> 49:54.160
Because we don't like Christy Alley.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160
All right.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
Well, I'm playing...

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
Christy Alley.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.760
Well, my charity is the Save Fat Actress TV Show Foundation.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
That's my charity.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
All right.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.160
So, oh, we had a guy on the phone.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.640
Zappy, you still there or did you hang up?

50:05.640 --> 50:06.640
Nope.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
I'm still here.

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
Hi, Zappy.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.640
Yeah.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.640
All right.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.200
We're going to be asking you some questions and you got to tell us what goes in the blank

50:14.200 --> 50:15.200
and everybody here in studio.

50:15.200 --> 50:19.000
Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
on the computer?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.400
I will try to remember.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.400
All right.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.480
If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.640
You ready for your first clue?

50:26.640 --> 50:27.640
Mm-hmm.

50:27.640 --> 50:28.640
All right.

50:28.640 --> 50:29.640
Here we go.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.640
Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.

50:30.640 --> 50:33.360
You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.360
All right.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.360
Here is question number one.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.720
There's four questions tonight.

50:37.720 --> 50:43.600
Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.

50:43.600 --> 50:47.720
Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

50:47.720 --> 50:53.080
Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.280
I'll make this game more exciting.

50:55.280 --> 51:03.800
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.760
Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.920
Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

51:09.920 --> 51:13.440
Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.720
I'll make this game more exciting.

51:14.720 --> 51:18.440
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

51:18.440 --> 51:24.080
Celebrities are thinking.

51:24.080 --> 51:40.120
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

51:40.120 --> 52:04.480
I'll make this game more exciting.

52:04.480 --> 52:10.400
I'll install five fret buttons on a dildo, says Zappi.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.560
I just hope the chat room doesn't fail me.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.560
Good answer.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
All right.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.560
There we go.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.960
And GS68 said, we mote.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.240
So we have dildo and we mote.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.240
Let's go around and see who's a match.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.200
Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?

52:23.200 --> 52:24.760
It was a very close.

52:24.760 --> 52:27.880
I said a gigantic horse dildo.

52:27.880 --> 52:28.880
Gigantic horse dildo.

52:28.880 --> 52:29.880
Judges.

52:29.880 --> 52:30.880
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

52:30.880 --> 52:31.880
All right.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.880
Good job.

52:32.880 --> 52:33.880
Zappi, off to a great start.

52:33.880 --> 52:34.880
Nice one.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.880
All right.

52:35.880 --> 52:42.280
Extifer, five fret buttons on A. I said strand of asshole hair.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.880
Strand of asshole hair.

52:43.880 --> 52:44.880
Wow.

52:44.880 --> 52:45.880
Okay.

52:45.880 --> 52:46.880
Dirty asshole.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
Dirty asshole hair.

52:47.880 --> 52:48.880
I don't know how I got that one.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.880
Do I get that one, judges?

52:49.880 --> 52:50.880
No.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.400
Unfortunately, no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.400
All right.

52:55.400 --> 53:02.480
Nellie, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian

53:02.480 --> 53:03.480
baby.

53:03.480 --> 53:09.160
The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.

53:09.160 --> 53:12.160
Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.160
All right.

53:13.160 --> 53:15.480
Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A.

53:15.480 --> 53:23.400
You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot

53:23.400 --> 53:26.720
of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.720
Dildo.

53:27.720 --> 53:28.720
Another match for Zappi.

53:28.720 --> 53:29.720
Good job, Zappi.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
Two to nothing.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.720
Sorry, GS68.

53:31.720 --> 53:35.600
That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.600
Dark Sakura.

53:36.600 --> 53:40.920
I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
There you go.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
Dildo.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
Three to nothing.

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
Ding, ding, ding.

53:44.920 --> 53:45.920
All right.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
Wow, Zappi.

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
All right.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.560
My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say dildo because this is my thing.

53:51.560 --> 53:55.960
I said a Pringles can because I like food.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.640
Five fret buttons on a Pringles can.

53:57.640 --> 53:58.640
So I guess.

53:58.640 --> 53:59.640
Pringles can.

53:59.640 --> 54:02.400
I'd like to expand it for this.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.400
All right.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.800
Did expanding give you that answer?

54:04.800 --> 54:05.800
Yeah.

54:05.800 --> 54:06.800
All right.

54:06.800 --> 54:12.480
Well, Pringles can suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth something.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.320
Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.

54:15.320 --> 54:19.200
You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.200
You ready?

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
All right.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.200
Here we go.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.200
Question number two.

54:23.200 --> 54:29.800
Loki thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this

54:29.800 --> 54:32.280
year's E3 event.

54:32.280 --> 54:36.960
When Loki walked through the door though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when

54:36.960 --> 54:48.640
he exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.400
Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3, but when he walked

54:52.400 --> 54:56.560
through the door, he realized that Namco had had the last laugh, he exclaimed, wait a minute,

54:56.560 --> 55:10.000
this isn't E3, this is a blank.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.080
This isn't E3, this is a blank.

55:13.080 --> 55:18.040
The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question, I'll just have to like do charades

55:18.040 --> 55:20.040
or something.

55:20.040 --> 55:27.560
This isn't E3, this is a blank.

55:27.560 --> 55:28.560
Dark Sakura needs clarification.

55:28.560 --> 55:32.080
Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?

55:32.080 --> 55:33.080
Yes.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.080
All right.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.440
Do you understand the question, Zappi?

55:35.440 --> 55:36.440
Am I crazy?

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
No, I completely understand.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
All right.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.440
Thank you.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
I'm not crazy.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
All right.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
Ding.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
Ding.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.440
Nellie gets ding.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
Extrovert, ding.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.440
Mandarin, ding.

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
Dark Sakura, ding.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.440
Loki, ding.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
All right.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
Dark Sakura, ding.

55:50.440 --> 55:54.160
Loki exclaimed, this isn't E3, this is a?

55:54.160 --> 55:55.160
Porno convention.

55:55.160 --> 56:03.160
A porno convention, all right, and GS68 said a gay bar, all right, so we have porno convention

56:03.160 --> 56:04.160
and gay bar.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.200
Mandarin, what did you say, this isn't E3, this is a?

56:08.200 --> 56:13.400
I think they both might actually get expensive combination, a gay orgy.

56:13.400 --> 56:19.360
A gay orgy, not going to work, I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.

56:19.360 --> 56:23.000
Extrovert, this isn't E3, this is?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
A Frankie Muniz convention.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.760
A Frankie Muniz convention.

56:26.760 --> 56:32.060
Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.

56:32.060 --> 56:36.000
It's almost like a gay bar, but no, that doesn't work, all right.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
Nellie, this isn't E3, this is a?

56:40.000 --> 56:44.240
The funny thing is is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all

56:44.240 --> 56:51.080
naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife, darn.

56:51.080 --> 56:56.240
An all naked girl convention, but he brought his wife, darn, good answer, not a match.

56:56.240 --> 57:03.560
Could be porn, no, Zappi's ahead, if he was behind, I'd give it to him, but no, Loki.

57:03.560 --> 57:08.080
I don't buy that, she would never come to an E3 thing, even if she thought it wasn't

57:08.080 --> 57:09.080
E3.

57:09.080 --> 57:15.720
Anyways, I said a Pringles can, because it's useless.

57:15.720 --> 57:16.720
You're a dick.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.360
All right, a Pringles can, not an answer.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.360
Dark Sakura.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.760
Orgy of suck.

57:21.760 --> 57:27.920
An orgy of suck, that's almost like a gay bar, but no, all right.

57:27.920 --> 57:32.920
And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something,

57:32.920 --> 57:38.520
it's like damn, why is there all these women here, this sucks, where are the games?

57:38.520 --> 57:39.520
All right.

57:39.520 --> 57:40.520
Although maybe I would say that.

57:40.520 --> 57:46.480
My answer, this is an E3, this is a gay bath house, I don't know, is that a match with

57:46.480 --> 57:47.480
gay bar?

57:47.480 --> 57:48.480
Uh-huh.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.920
I'm going to say yes, who wants, GS68's behind.

57:50.920 --> 57:55.920
I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.

57:55.920 --> 57:58.640
All right, what, you guys aren't going to get me.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.000
And why would they have a Frankie Muniz?

58:00.000 --> 58:08.280
So Nellie says yes, I say yes, uh-huh, Dark Sakura says no, Loki says no, all right, sorry

58:08.280 --> 58:09.280
NGS68.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.280
All right.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.280
No, Loki said yes.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.280
Oh, Loki said yes?

58:12.280 --> 58:13.280
Yeah.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
Gay bath house and gay bar, are they the same thing, Dark Sakura?

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
No.

58:16.280 --> 58:17.280
All right.

58:17.280 --> 58:18.880
How was the bath house like a bar?

58:18.880 --> 58:20.480
Because it's all gay.

58:20.480 --> 58:21.480
Now we're three and three.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.480
Okay, okay.

58:22.480 --> 58:23.480
I have a question on the rules.

58:23.480 --> 58:24.480
What?

58:24.480 --> 58:25.480
Yes.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
What?

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
Yes.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.480
Okay.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.480
Yes.

58:29.480 --> 58:30.480
Dark Sakura says yes.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.480
Because you can suck in the bathroom.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.480
That's true, have you ever been to faces?

58:32.480 --> 58:33.480
All right.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.480
Wait, wait, wait, I have a question on the rules.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.480
That's true, they do have a pool now.

58:35.480 --> 58:36.480
What?

58:36.480 --> 58:42.080
The person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people

58:42.080 --> 58:43.380
choosing for him again.

58:43.380 --> 58:46.880
Only in certain years they did that and then they didn't do that in future years.

58:46.880 --> 58:47.880
That's cheating then.

58:47.880 --> 58:48.880
No, it's not.

58:48.880 --> 58:49.880
You're cheating.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.880
Shut up, Nellie.

58:50.880 --> 58:51.880
All right.

58:51.880 --> 58:55.880
Hey, look, if I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her till she did it.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.880
Rob.

58:56.880 --> 58:57.880
What?

58:57.880 --> 58:58.880
Get in your place.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.280
Answer the thing.

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
Sorry, Miss Jamie.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.280
All right.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.280
That's right.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.840
You're watching her all break out the paddle again.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
Question number three.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.840
Robby Goodstick.

59:07.840 --> 59:10.560
Oh, this is a question about Jamie.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.560
This should be good.

59:12.560 --> 59:13.560
You ready, Zappy?

59:13.560 --> 59:14.560
Yep.

59:14.560 --> 59:15.560
Three to one.

59:15.560 --> 59:16.560
You feeling the heat a little bit?

59:16.560 --> 59:17.560
I'm not ready.

59:17.560 --> 59:18.560
All right.

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
Here we go.

59:19.560 --> 59:25.400
While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pin bot machine for sale.

59:25.400 --> 59:31.800
The machine costs $1,000 though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.

59:31.800 --> 59:37.680
Being the ever clever game collector and negotiator though, Jamie told the salesman, I really

59:37.680 --> 59:39.520
want that pin bot machine.

59:39.520 --> 59:43.720
I would trade you my blank for it.

59:43.720 --> 59:51.240
Where's my music?

59:51.240 --> 59:54.040
I really want that pin bot machine.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.760
I would trade you my blank for it.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.320
All right.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.000
Ding, this one's easy for me.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Uh-oh.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Did I copy paste that to GS68?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, never mind.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You got it anyway.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I would trade you my blank for it.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Ding.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Expert said ding.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Ding.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Dark Sakura?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
All right.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
That was quick.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.480
When the question is about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480
All right.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.880
I would trade you my blank for it.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:31.000
Zappi, I would trade you my massage table.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Massage table.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.240
Okay, massage table.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.320
That is something very precious to her decision.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320
All right.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
GS68 said-

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.080
I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.960
GS68 said I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.840
Which is great because I don't got any, ha ha.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.560
It could be, well, what about your behind virginity?

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.200
Ew, we're not going there, Rob.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200
I thought your be-hymen.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.200
All right.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.200
Rob, you just ruined my answer.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.200
Yes.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.640
All right, shut up.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.560
Mandarin, we have virginity and massage table.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.680
I want that pinball machine.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.160
I would trade you my-

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.880
Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.000
Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.480
Is that a match for massage table?

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.360
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.640
That's because of the massage services, so-

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640
Yeah, I say no.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
That's a half a point.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640
Half a point.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.640
I say no.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640
All right, we'll do-

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.640
The table is what you do-

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640
Fine.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.640
Half a point for Zappi.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640
I'm outvoted.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640
Half a point.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.640
See, now I have to write half.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.520
All right, there we go.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520
Extra fur.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520
I want that pinball machine.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520
I went for the most obvious.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:51.040
I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040
It's amazing.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.160
The Dark Sakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.160
Frankie Muniz's ass- She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.800
A strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.560
That's actually one of my prized treasures.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.560
All right, Nellie, I would trade you a-

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.440
I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440
B. Eimond.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.440
All right.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.440
Loki.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440
Well, see, I would have matched.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.440
I'm going to get a point.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.440
Loki, I would trade you my-

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:26.320
Well, where would one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Baby?

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.040
Iraqi Suicide Baby, which Dark Sakura also happens to own one.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.240
Dark Sakura, I would trade you my-

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240
Husband.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.640
Husband for it.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.160
My answer was, I really want that pinball machine.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.320
I would trade you my husband for it.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.200
I also said husband, so there it is.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.640
Husband was the answer to go with in that round.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640
All right.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640
One more question.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640
You ready, Zappy?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640
Yup.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640
All right.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.040
Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040
All right?

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.440
So, you got to keep the lead here.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.240
All right, GS68, you can do it.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240
All right, here we go.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240
Here's the question.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:09.960
Xtafur, this is a true story, by the way, Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:15.420
MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:21.680
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:31.720
play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:50.760
Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.520
All right, GS68 has an answer.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520
I'm ding.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520
How about the other celebrities?

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520
Ding.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520
Some are ding.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.360
All right, let me read the question again and see if it inspires some folks.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.360
Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
of the game.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.800
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.880
play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:25.080
Isn't this the best song ever?

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.480
Nelly finally dinged.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Xtafur?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480
Sure, ding.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480
Mandarin and ding.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.520
We have some very apathetic celebrities.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520
Last question though.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.240
Here we go before this segment gets drawn on way too long as if it hasn't already.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.720
Zappi, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720
a slut.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720
A slut.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720
Okay, a slut.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.720
There you go.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:53.900
GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.200
Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.360
All right, let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.680
Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game, I would not play that game again unless the creator

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680
sent me...

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680
Pussy.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680
Pussy!

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680
Is that a match for slut?

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.680
I don't know where you're coming from.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.480
No, no, because a slut could be male or female.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.360
All right, Xtafur, I wouldn't, true story though, you did play the game, right?

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360
Yeah.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.360
And it sucked?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360
It sucked balls.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.800
What was so bad about it?

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.120
Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.120
All right.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.920
I don't know, I don't like purple balls.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.800
Like, you're going to suck my balls.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800
Be gentle.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:37.520
All right, I wouldn't, I wouldn't play, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.720
sent me...

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.760
My butt virginity back, because I'm, I'm pretty loose down there.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.640
I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:56.520
Oh, this show sucks.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.000
Shit just falls right out of me.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It's just, it's horrible.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.600
It's like, I have to, I should, I should get a colostomy bag and it's like...

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:13.980
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators, the chat room is just exploding

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.920
with, oh my God, oh, oh God, oh.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.640
That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.640
Nelly, I...

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.440
Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:36.160
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators sent me...

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.640
His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:45.040
His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover, a very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly,

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.640
but unfortunately not a match.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.400
Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creators sent me...

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.680
I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.960
Mina's butt hair in a Pringles can.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.640
In a Pringles can, all right.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.640
Dark Sakura.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.080
A naked sweaty man slut.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.280
A naked sweaty man slut, I think that's a match with slut.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.680
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.600
So Zappy, you got another point.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.560
I think Mandarin should get a pussy slut.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.760
Well, but...

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.920
That doesn't count.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.440
Dark Sakura actually used the word slut, it doesn't matter, Zappy is still going to win

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.100
anyway because GS68 was somehow to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.200
see happening.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.320
But my answer, just so you know, was Frankie Mina's as B. Hyman, which was not a match,

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.080
but probably almost matched Loki's answer.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.640
So Zappy, by a score of four and a half to one, you win.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.080
Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080
Yeah, you did pretty good.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.960
That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.960
Congratulations.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960
It's all thanks to the chat room.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960
Yes.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:55.080
Zappy, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080
You were a part of it.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080
I feel so special.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.080
Yeah, all right.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.080
Well, congratulations.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.200
Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200
All right.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.840
In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840
Yep.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840
Any other comments you want to give?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.840
Not really.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840
All right.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840
Well, have a good week, Zappy.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.840
All right, thanks.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.400
And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.480
A nice effort from GS68.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.040
And Extafur and Nelly have left.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.480
Thank God.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.760
Normality can come back and resume with the program.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.680
Wow.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Let's get back to some game news.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:41.240
If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.400
Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:51.020
They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.020
So let's see.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.320
I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.920
They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.320
console back from Microsoft, faster service, you get it back within five business days,

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.480
and other enhanced customer care operations, a new pledge from Xbox to you for your three

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.480
rings of death.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.000
That's all I have.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.960
Anyways, some other fun stuff.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:26.920
Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.200
downloaded it in another territory like I did.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.120
But you get to play three single player missions, and check that out.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.880
It's an okay average game, but hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880
anyways.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.800
Kind of worth checking out.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.440
It's definitely a lot better than ChromeHounds, that is for sure.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.720
So if you're looking for a mech combat game, there you go.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720
Why?

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720
Why is it better than ChromeHounds?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.720
It's a lot faster.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:56.800
I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for god sakes.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.680
Plus, you know, overall it looks good.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.440
Just ChromeHounds is very slow.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440
Just slow in everything.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.180
Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.960
for snow in Inuit?

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:15.360
No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which maybe makes you

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.600
go really fast, and then like a quick boost.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600
Quick boost?

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.180
Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:27.040
The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets, and then the

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:33.560
super boost is just, you know, your typical anime robot flying over the ocean type thing.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.520
Can you put two explicit tags on a show?

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.400
I was just wondering.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400
What?

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.480
Rated C for Christopher and for Nellie.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.480
Yeah, NC17.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.480
Somebody in chat already made that joke.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.480
Nellie, Christopher17.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480
There you go.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480
All right.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.560
Well, Skyline will be open very soon, kids.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:56.400
Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack that has the

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:04.400
Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn-up mountain and a trial

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.840
point which is a modern-day office complex with a background of a busy day, you know,

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.560
behind it, a busy city behind it.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.680
You can download it on LiveMarketplace.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680
Actually it's already up.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.720
It was up there on the 6th, and it's 400 Microsoft points, and so I'd say give it a try.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.720
Lost Planet's pretty cool.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.800
Zatty's oil.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.800
You know what?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.800
Hey, Rob.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.160
We're having a lot of meetings right now, and we really did lose five listeners during

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.160
the match game segment live.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160
Did we?

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160
Yeah.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160
That was great.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160
All right.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:12:00.000
The Skyline is open 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the Skyline as well.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.600
The user name is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.600
I want to play something for you guys real, real quick though because DMN left us a message

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.400
because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.840
for you guys because you can leave us voicemails during the week.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.840
Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840
This is DMN.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.840
I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:25.360
I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't because I got forced to

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.200
run a Soul Calibur III tournament, so I killed the guy who didn't do it.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:38.560
Yeah, we're all good, but I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here, hopefully

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.440
one more from closing ceremonies, which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.080
I want you guys to know how much people love OrangeLoungeRadio, even if I force them to

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.960
be crazy about it, but yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.960
Bye.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.880
So, live from SakuraCon, there's DMN.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.120
Apparently there's fans of OrangeLoungeRadio at SakuraCon.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.680
Sorry we couldn't come.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.400
I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to SakuraCon.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400
Something happened.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.680
We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out, so maybe next year.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.680
Let's go to Skypline in the meanwhile.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680
Who's this?

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680
It's Legend of Zaku.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.680
How you doing?

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.680
Pretty good.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.480
Can you put two explicit tags on the podcast, do you think?

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.460
I'm not sure if that would...

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.080
I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080
Anyways...

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.920
Right, what's on your mind?

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:35.040
I heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonics is basically trying to give

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.880
Konami a run for its money, also for the fact that Konami is lazy.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.360
They haven't even shown any real initiative that's trying to release guitar freaks and

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.040
drum manias to this country sooner.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.280
In other words, Harmonics just stole the thunder.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.840
Do you think maybe they've just given up?

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840
That they've been beat at their own game?

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.560
Well, it's not really that.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.040
From what I hear, they're supposed to be testing guitar freaks and drum manias this summer

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:09.120
in this country, but the backlash is that people will easily call it a Rock Band rip-off.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.080
They'll just call Konami a bunch of biters, just for the fact that they are announcing

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.520
that game after Rock Band.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.720
So it's like they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.200
to release, just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.440
To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.440
I don't think it is.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.720
Konami still has the Japanese market if nothing else.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.720
Right, of course.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.760
They have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that the way Harmonics managed to

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.120
get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.920
They have commercials for it.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.920
That and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920
right now.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.280
Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.200
It was a huge, huge risk.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.240
When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.240
was.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.880
I know it was, but as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:13.880
So it was a damn good risk at best, but it's like they need a lot more marketing if they

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:19.360
want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania just to catch

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.860
up to Harmonics as the reach that they already have.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.900
So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides karaoke revolution, which

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.200
they may not be known for much longer, or DDR?

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.100
If they want to push something like Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania, they have to get a lot

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:42.060
of marketing and a lot of American, mostly Americanization on it, just more American

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.320
licenses which would translate into more sales for the American public.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:52.160
They'll give the average Guitar Hero user another choice, an alternative, instead of

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.760
just rejecting a truly Japanese version.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.960
I hate to be honest, but that's the way it has to be.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.320
I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.120
How could Konami make BeatMania a success in this country?

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:14.800
Well, they really have to focus on basically licenses, pick up really good licenses, stuff

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:23.440
like really good trance, techno and stuff like that, and maybe some decent hip-hop or

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440
something.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.800
But yes, they have to definitely push, they have to do some more marketing and they have

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.960
to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost, just like they did with

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960
DDR.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.280
It just started in the arcades and then it snowballed into the home versions, although

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.600
the home version came first here already in this country.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.880
They have to definitely push gold a lot further than it already is right now.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.440
They have to really get it out there.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.440
All right.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.000
Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
We appreciate it.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
All right.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Later, buddy.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Bye.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Bye.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Black Boy makes an interesting statement in chat.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.120
He says, I love that because this is a Bimani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.880
another company improved on something that Bimani pioneered.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.360
I wouldn't say I'm mad.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.280
I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.000
It made a great formula even better.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.200
I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.280
to take and it paid off.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.600
I can't be mad at that, but what Loki's saying there is that when Guitar Hero gets all these

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.600
lavish, it's so original, it's the most original game ever, awards bestowed on it, you can't

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.640
help but feel like, well, I did kind of play a game like it once.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.160
Well, anyway, let's go back to the Skype line and see if there's more calls.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.960
Black Boy says, by the way, that's the whole point because people here have had such affection

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.800
for Bimani, and I'm an exception, apparently.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.800
Let's see.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.800
Hi, you're on Orangetown's radio.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800
Who's this?

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800
Hey, it's Ron.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.800
What's up, everyone?

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.800
Hi, Rama.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800
How you doing?

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800
What's up?

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800
Pretty good.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.080
Look, Konami has other franchises that they're working on that's making them a whole lot

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080
of money.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.920
Seriously, I don't think Konami really gives two shits about Guitar Freaks or 2DX or anything

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.920
like that.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:13.720
I mean, if you put Pop'n Music, 2DX, DDR, an arcade machine right in front of people,

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.520
people demonstrating it seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.040
more easy and more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.840
me one of the reasons why they brought it over.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:32.040
Yes, there are other franchises' risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is like, you

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040
know what?

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.040
Hey, we did our thing.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040
Let's just call it a night.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.040
Let's work on other stuff.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.480
I mean, they're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off, trying to Americanize

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.880
Guitar Freaks and Drummy, I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.240
using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods,

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.680
the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680
out with.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.640
I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.520
I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:11.760
I mean, they probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX of touring or maybe

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.200
like Guitar Freaks or something like that, you know?

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.800
By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:27.440
sources and contexts I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.240
far as the home version went.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.860
So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:36.080
to be like that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Rama, that even though

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.760
they could go for it, they're not choosing to.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
I don't know.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.760
Exactly.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.560
I mean, with the much money they've made off the Bimani games, for them to bring over Beatmania

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.440
wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.800
FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:55.360
Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis is a problem, is to think that arcades

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.640
are relevant enough to give a fuck.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.000
Arcades are dead in the US.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.720
That's why they don't give a fuck.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:06.200
Same point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:11.840
Hero and this rock band game would be made for a console on the outset.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Kind of interesting.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.760
Because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.680
in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men, it was a Konami game.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.440
And now nowadays, the only place you can find a half decent arcade if you're in a big town

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.840
where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little Podunk Corner place, you know?

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840
It's sad.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.280
I really hope arcades have a resurgence.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.280
I really do.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280
I miss them.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280
Exactly.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:46.160
I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.120
Any other thoughts, Rama?

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.120
That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.640
Sure, why not?

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.680
Okay, this is really dirty.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.260
Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.260
How much worse can we get?

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.260
Go for it.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260
Okay.

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:06.360
What does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
What?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.280
A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:18.800
Bye Rama, thanks for the call.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.480
Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.480
I don't know.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.160
Who's this?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160
Hey guys, how you doing?

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160
This is Bandit.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.160
Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160
Okay.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.040
What you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.840
be popular in this country.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:37.840
Why is that?

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.040
I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, if you look at that game, what the other

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.480
couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.960
ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now, I mean, that game

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.600
takes too much time to learn and things like that, way too much dedication.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:04.720
The casual gamer's not going to just walk into a place, throw in 50 cents and just be

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.360
great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.400
But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard too?

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.880
I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.440
dumbed down modes, which BeatMania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place because

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.380
when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.920
BeatMania down.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.760
But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.200
Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.640
I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:44.800
I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.960
look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.520
Damn, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.480
Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.040
That sounds hard.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.720
Trying to think if Buckethead does that one.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.280
All right, well, anything else?

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.520
No, that's it for now.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.760
And anything non-music, because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.760
Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.320
Right now, I mean, I picked up a, I haven't gone, I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.240
I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but you know, I just haven't made that leap.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.440
So I picked up God of War about a month ago, picked up God of War 2 when it came out.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.640
I played through both of them.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.640
They're really good.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.000
I'd definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet, I mean, it's been maybe

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.240
a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.120
I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.360
Well, there's that in Devil May Cry collection.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.280
It's like all three games for like 29 bucks.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.280
Nice.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.280
Definitely get that too.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.280
Just might.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280
All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.280
All right, there you go.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.280
All right, take care.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.280
One more call.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.280
What do you say?

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.280
One more.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280
You guys okay?

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280
You guys doing all right?

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280
Yes.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.120
All right, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.400
Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.200
looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.120
All right, let's do one more call.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.560
Hi, you're on Ornishon's radio.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560
Who's this?

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.600
Hey guys, this is DDR Dollar Bill here.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.480
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.000
This whole damn argument is like pissing me off now.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Why?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.400
All right, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.040
things at the same time, they're the same thing.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:40.480
First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level, and I've proven

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.120
this by actually trying to game the other day.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:49.260
Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four, while Guitar Hero actually

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:54.000
passed me by missing half the damn song, that's the first thing I've seen the difference.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.920
Hold on though, because doesn't the Arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?

01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.920
Stop breathing into the mic, please.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.520
Yeah, careful, you're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.520
Sorry.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.860
That's all right, but yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the Arcade difficulty

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.860
setting?

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:16.520
Yes, but most Arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.860
I don't really know too many Arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.280
there, you know?

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:28.360
That's my first thought, and then the second thought is also the song list, and people

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:34.140
keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freaks' song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.280
very few American stuff that people recognize.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.320
While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada,

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.120
yada, yada, I can play this.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.320
True, very true.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.720
And I've said this kind of distinguishes the games and make Guitar Hero more successful

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.720
here, yeah?

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:58.120
Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.020
both the difficulty level and the song list.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:04.920
You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games, I mean you have DDR in your nickname,

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.400
what do you think of Rock Band?

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.320
Is it something you're going to check out?

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.440
I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.720
have much of an idea what it's about.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.440
Real quickly, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania,

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.560
and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:28.000
Well imagine doing that online, take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.080
So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.640
But on the internet.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.640
Hmm.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:43.160
And you sound interested, and Guitar Hero type songs.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.720
That wouldn't be so bad actually, because one thing people can forget is that no game

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.960
has actually included like a karaoke type thing.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.680
So that would actually make it different at the same time.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680
That's true.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.680
You know, because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time, okay.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.400
Now we have drums, guitars, and singers.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.400
Yeah.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.400
It could be interesting.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.400
We'll see.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.080
Well I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.760
Alright.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.760
Take care buddy, thanks for the perspective.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760
Hey, thanks man.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760
No problem.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760
Later.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760
Later.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760
Alright.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.440
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, thanks to those that called in.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.120
If you didn't get through though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.760
still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.520
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.480
And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.040
week because we take the calls to come in.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.460
If you're not calling us, you shouldn't be complaining about that.

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:44.360
So tune in live on a Sunday night sometime or leave us a voicemail.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:48.320
I'm going to open it up to any last minute stories that anyone might have here in studio.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320
Last minute stories.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320
I got a few.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
Yes.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:00.440
There's another rumor, also coming from Gamespot, about a keyboard controller attachment that

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.180
they're going to be coming out.

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:06.320
It looks very legit coming from them, and I do remember seeing a patent or some sort

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.360
of picture a while back, and I believe Gamers reports were also saying that they ran a story

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.440
months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.080
So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely, and that would kind of tie into

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:28.480
that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.480
Let's see.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.520
Other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit that's drawn

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520
to life.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.700
It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet, and it looks

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:50.340
a little bit like Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that, but you actually

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:58.080
doodle stuff onto your DS, and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.080
So that's kind of neat.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.800
I'm looking forward to that, and they're also making a Worms 2, apparently.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:12.160
Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP, and apparently it's

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:17.240
triple triads, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.080
I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.840
IX, but interesting nonetheless, I guess.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.080
And there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.400
trying to auction off a PS3 at a rock concert.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.000
Apparently he failed, and it was funny.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.500
One dollar!

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.200
Area 51's being made into a Hollywood movie?

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.200
Don't care.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:49.380
The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:55.040
the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be an on-rails shooter game,

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.800
or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:02.320
So that's kind of neat, hopefully that'll come out soon.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.680
Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.000
service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.080
Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there on the market, though,

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.680
so it should be interesting.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:21.600
And that's it.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.320
I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.360
Is this supposed to be like Leetspeak for Havoc 1792?

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.600
I think that's what it is, H4V0C, I think it's Havoc.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.840
Havoc 1792 in Leetspeak sent me this article on Achieve360points.com that shows the Halo

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:44.400
2 achievements, because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite,

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.300
so it has achievements there.

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.680
And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well, if you were

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.020
playing the backwards compatibility, eventually.

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:58.200
Well, it looks like the basics are you get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.880
the single-player game you go through, then you get some other achievement points if you

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:08.280
actually beat the game, and then of course there's your various multiplayer points.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:14.080
Steel and occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.080
riot, all that stuff.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.640
But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.760
called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.640
There's a Ninja achievement, and then there's also a Legend achievement, and that's what

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:31.640
you get when you complete the game on Legendary difficulty.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.680
But here's the thing that I think is cool, not those achievements, but the fact that

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.520
then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:43.600
One is called Flaming Ninja, kill somebody that has the Ninja achievement, and then the

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.400
other one is Hired Gun.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.040
Kill someone who has the Legend achievement, because you know those types of players are

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.040
going to be really good.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.240
So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements, that's kind of neat.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.640
That's better than those Viral ones.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.640
What was that one?

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:05.440
I want to say it was a game I just recently played, not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.760
Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the Virus achievement.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.560
It's even called a Viral achievement or something.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.760
It's not worth any points, but it's the only way you can get it, is by playing with somebody

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:16.760
who has the achievement.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.760
It's kind of weird.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.760
I think that's kind of neat.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.200
Good job to whoever thought of those achievements on Halo 2.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.640
Anything for you, Jamie?

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.380
For me?

01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.380
I don't play the...

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.720
I don't play any last minute news in general.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.680
Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.800
No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800
No.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.400
I don't have anything.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.360
We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360
I think that would be fun.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.640
Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.920
So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship, and that would be fun.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:57.480
I'm actually decent, I mean, with a lot of games.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.720
In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle, and the sniper rifles in Grand Theft

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:07.780
Auto suck balls, but I don't know, it'd be pretty fun.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.780
I suck at Halo 2.

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.960
In fact, I think I've only played it once, so...

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:15.160
No, wait, no, I haven't played Halo 2, I've only played Halo 1 once.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160
That would be fun.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.160
A long time ago.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.600
DDR Dollar Bill says, I suck at Halo, I can't even get one kill.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.240
Act Def says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.080
We'll see.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:31.200
I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest, that would be fun.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.160
We should make a clan suck at Halo.

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:38.120
There is a Noelle Army Halo clan, supposedly, I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.680
not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680
play Halo.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.680
So, there you go.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.200
All right, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program, so now we're going

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.080
to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.100
Mandarin, thank you so much for being here, I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:57.800
to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing Match Game with us and

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.600
bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.680
Oh, you're welcome, I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.680
So you will come back?

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.680
Oh yeah.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680
Absolutely.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:12.360
We'll come up here and get settled in, and we'll have to take a day off and he'll have

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.480
to come up and...

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.320
Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.840
If he can get out of work.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.840
Take a day off, we're worth it.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840
No, I'm kidding.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840
Yeah.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840
All right.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.840
Oh, your final thought?

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.720
It was fun, even though I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720
it was still a lot of fun.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720
That's all right, we get a lot of guests that do that.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.280
It's okay, Christopher was kind of...

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.800
Miklakkah's been on the show like 40 times, he never says a damn thing when he's here.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800
All right.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.720
It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing, and...

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.720
Yeah, but you like it.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.720
You like the kink.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.720
You know it.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.720
Eh.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.720
Eh.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720
All right.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720
Eh.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.720
You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.720
No.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:49.720
Okay.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.720
Loki, your final thought?

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.400
I want to play Earth...

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:59.840
Why is it, explain this to me, why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:07.360
2 looks like more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.640
That's what I want to know.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.280
Because it looks like they have a lot more complex, you know, enemies in there, you know,

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.720
some stuff that could have been like from War of the Worlds or something.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:16.720
Why...

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.720
I don't know.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:18.720
What's up with that?

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.720
Exactly.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:20.720
What's up with that shit?

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.880
I need to get my PS2 back from my sister, because I think they've played Driver 3 long

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.880
enough.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.680
All right, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.080
Um, Deadpool.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.720
All right, and my final thought tonight...

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:44.080
That was my final thought for tonight.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.880
Did you enjoy that final thought, Dark Soccer?

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880
Awesome.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880
All right.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880
I need an orgy now.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.920
All right, that's it, guys.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:55.040
Thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:59.320
You guys are awesome, especially through these episodes that are very X-rated.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.520
Thank you guys so much for sticking through it.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.200
We promise we'll be family-friendly next week on the program.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.480
Hey, if you like the show, tell two friends, tell two enemies, who cares, about Orange

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.720
on its Radio, because if everybody tells two people about it, then, you know, then we slowly

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.720
conquer the world.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.540
You can also leave us a nice review, a five-star review on iTunes.

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.040
We always really appreciate that.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.720
The digs, the other stuff you guys do for us out there on the internet, posting about

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.280
us on a forum.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280
There's even...

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280
Oh, this is really cool.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.200
If you go to the Orange on its Radio forums, some folks have actually made little artwork.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.560
Now you can get little Orange on its Radio icons with my face or Dark Soccer's face or

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:38.300
somebody's face on it, and one of those little bars, like those little tiny bars that say,

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:42.720
I'm a Coke drinker, or I'm a watcher of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.200
Now there's one that says, O.L. Army, a little bar.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.420
So you can check out that all on the forums.

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.120
So my name is Rob Roberts.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.120
That's Dark Soccer.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.120
That's Loki.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:37:11.520
And I'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
