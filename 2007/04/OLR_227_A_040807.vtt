Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and what you, the gamer, really want to know

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I like Frappuccinos

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And I like the new Cinnamon Dulce one

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Dulce

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I actually ordered one and the chick said back to me, Dulce, so I thought that's how you pronounced it

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I thought that was wrong, I thought it was Dulce

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
That's like, um, Versace

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I guess so, that's probably true

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Nice reference to my favorite movie ever, love it

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I thought you would appreciate that

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Joining us as well, the official showgirl of Orange Lounge Radio, Loki!

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm just kidding, I don't know, I had to work in a showgirl's segue somehow

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I don't know if I should respond to that since I'm not a showgirl, but

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Well then showboy

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Okay

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
Alright, well say hello to a special guest tonight who might very well be a showgirl, I'm not sure, are you gonna get topless for us tonight?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Maybe

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright, say hello to Amanda

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Hi

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
How are you?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm good, how are you?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Good, now you haven't been on the, I think you've been on the show before, but not in a long long time, right?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Very little brief snippets

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Don't forget you gotta almost practically give head to that microphone to be picked up on it

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Alright, very good, very good

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
So you probably haven't been here since we've been podcasting all that stuff, like on iPods and stuff, right? Have you?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I've been out there

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, but you've always been out here, you've never been in studio

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Like, briefly

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Okay, well why don't you introduce yourself to the listeners, what type of video games do you like?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I like the Wii

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
You like the Wii?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Wii!

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
I like puzzle games, that's pretty much my thing, and then, you know, cutesy stuff

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
What have you been playing on your Wii lately?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Uh, WarioWare

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
WarioWare?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That's a fun game

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
And then, like, a bunch of virtual console stuff, like playing Sonic and stuff

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
What would you say is your favorite video game of all time?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't know

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
Um, like, the Bubble Bobble, or the thing where you shoot the little marbles up at the-

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Bubble Bobble, you're barely getting picked up, sweetie, you can see yourself in-

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Sorry

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
That's right, Bubble Bobble

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Bubble Bobble, yes

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That's right

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Sounds good

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
That's Puzzle Bobble

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Bobble, whatever name they decide-

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Bust a Move

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Bust a Move, whatever name they decide to do it

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Alright

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I also like bar games, like the little, like, where you put a quarter in and you get a game and you have to, like-

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Oh, like the touch screen games at the bars?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yes

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
There's an arcade game that's very popular that people don't talk about very often

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Those little, what do they call that, the Quartermaster, what are those things called?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Touch Something?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I don't know

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Touch Master, I think

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Touch Master, I don't know what the hell they're called

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Like the one where you have to, like, where you have to get, like, all the groups of, like, two or three or more color blocks and reduce them

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I like that, like the blockus, or no, I don't know if it's blockus, something

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Alright, sounds like fun

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, welcome to the show

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Thank you

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
You're in our-

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Mega Touch

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You're in our chat room under your-

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Omega Touch, thank you, whoever, who said that in chat?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
That was, um-

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Dark Tetsuya

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Good man, Dark Tetsuya

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm sorry, I thought it said D Teaser

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm like, what do you, what's the D that you're teasing?

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright, um, if you do want to join our chat, if you're listening live on the Sunday night, chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
And, uh, Amanda's in chat as Mandarin tonight, she'll be reading there and commenting on stories as she seems appropriate

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
As she deems appropriate

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Alright, um, let's go around and talk about our gaming weeks, how was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Pretty non-existent given that I was, um, doing my, uh, last few, uh, massages this week

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
Um, I actually did finish my final on Tuesday, and, um, however, I am getting back into, uh, Marvel Ultimate Alliance because, um, Deadpool is awesome

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Um, I, uh, for anyone who has access to my live journal, I put a, uh, link up there of, like, the funniest thing ever

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Um, and I've been, um, screaming at our Twilight Zone pinball machine, like, loudly, because, um, I don't know, the machine's a bastard

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
I would get to the zone and then lose my ball, like, as soon as I got in the zone

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Rob's got tea

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Sorry, I stepped out for a minute, we can do that in radio, what, I heard you lost your balls over the week?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
No, no, I keep them in a little brown bag

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I see

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
No, um, I was getting mad at Twilight Zone because I got a really good score up on there, got into the zone, you know

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, those balls

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You know, don't touch the door thing

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I'd get in the zone and then drain

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
So, your gaming week was basically having to get your balls into the zone

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And Deadpool

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Alright

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I've actually been reading a whole lot of comics, too

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Um, I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2070

05:16.000 --> 05:26.000
God, this is gonna become the new, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, or Liberty City Story, the fucking game you talk about every single week on this program during your gaming week

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Because it's fun and stupid

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
I mean, let's put it this way, there's a lot of physics that don't apply in the game, I mean, you can fly up, it's like, 70 stories in the air, jump out of a helicopter and land on the ground, fine

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Just, you know, like nothing happened, helicopter will land down there and do it again

05:44.000 --> 05:54.000
Um, so I've been just basically playing that on lunch and stuff, and actually this week I've been playing more of it, and almost finished with, like, easy on it

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Does it have multiplayer so you guys can slack off at work?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
You can do two player co-op

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, there you go

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
And it's a lot of fun, really the fun of the game comes down to unlocking all the different weapons in it, because there's a lot of them

06:05.000 --> 06:18.000
And, um, I mean, right now I've played through almost the whole thing on the easy, and a few of the harder difficulty levels, um, and really only have, I don't even have half the weapons yet

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
So, you can actually get one weapon, it's called the genocide gun, that does a million damage, like, to an area of like 72 meters or whatever

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
It's just, you really have to watch out launching that thing because you can kill yourself very easy, but I can't wait to get that

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Unfortunately you have to beat the game on Inferno, which is fucking impossible

06:39.000 --> 06:55.000
Um, other than that, I was playing, I tried a little bit of, what was it, um, uh, Honeycomb Beats, yeah, and that was okay, I'm not very interested in it though, not my thing

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Was that why you gave me your copy?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yes

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Sweet! I got free games from Loki today

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yay!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And then, um

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Now I just have to find my DS, I seriously cannot find my DS

07:04.000 --> 07:18.000
I played, um, played Crackdown a bit, that was kind of fun, um, I played another game, which I can't talk about though right now, due to an NDA, but it wasn't as fun as it would seem

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Wait a minute, when did Loki start listening to NDAs on this program? This is something, what happened?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't think this stuff wasn't associated with an NDA right now

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, it's a game for the Xbox Live, um, or not the Xbox Live, the games for Windows Live Beta, they're doing that cross-

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Lawsuit

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Cross play thing, and there's a game you play to test it, and it's stupid, but

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I don't want you to get sued

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
Either way though, it's neat, I guess, I was, and the leaderboards for it though, I was almost in the top 100 out of like 3,000 people

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Should, um, come over to our house and play Crackdown with Dan and Will, cause they start doing the commentary

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
I like jumping, my name is Bob, and I like to jump

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
That's the whole theme of Crackdown by the way, is to jump everywhere you go

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Wow

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Jump a lot

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I had fun tossing cars onto bridges, like at the top of bridges and stuff

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
That part was fun

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
And then, um, I don't know, just pure killing people

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I like the jumping

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
And Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, I've also been playing that and that's a lot of fun

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Looking at some comments from Chatroom, DJ Morpheus says, Earth Defense Force is the greatest piece of cheese ever made

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Uh, JeremyTau1 says, hopefully Loki won't start having Earth Defense death matches with his co-workers

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
They do have like a versus mode in that, I don't know how well that would be

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Ion671 says, it is no longer Earth Defense, it is Loki Defense

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And JeremyTau1 wonders, Loki, how many giant ants do you think you've killed total?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Too many

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Alright, there you go

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Um, my gaming week, I played a game called, uh, what was it?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Tidepool Explorer

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Because I went to the Monterey Aquarium

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Because William took me to Monterey this weekend and it surprised me with a nice little weekend thing

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
So we went to Monterey and um, and you know, it got me thinking like

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
They got these cool little educational things for kids

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And it kind of got me thinking about the educational games that we had

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Uh, like you know, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Remember that, Rocky's Boots, and what were the other MECC games?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Oregon Trail, I guess

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Number Munchers

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Number Munchers, hell yeah

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Like, oh, I'm gonna write this whole Nostalgia article for the community all-game site

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Turtle

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Turtle?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh, or what was that, what was the language? Logo?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Was that the language they made us all learn in like third grade?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
We had the turtle?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Like, drop pen, 30 north or something

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Like, I remember it was this lame programming language you had to learn

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Um, so yeah, this Tidepool Explorer was the little game where you walk

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But it was like, it was like you had two screens

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Like, they had four people playing it at once

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And you had this big screen in the middle

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And then you had a little screen right in front of you

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Like an old, uh, picture one of those, um, what do they call them?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Tabletop, like Ms. Pac-Man?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
What do they call those games back in the day when they had the, is it just tabletop?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Cocktail?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Cocktail, it was like a cocktail machine

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
And uh, yeah, and then the big screen had you walking around the tidepools

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And on your own screen you could touch the buttons that say

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Um, pick up, you know, uh, so you could like pick up the shell

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Or you could, you know, throw away, like if you found a trash can you could throw it away

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Or you could take a picture of an animal you're not supposed to like

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
You know, it's supposed to teach kids about what's okay to move away from tidepools and what you can't

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So it's just kind of neat

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
This old stingray will stab you through the heart

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Crikey! Um, but yeah, William commented, I know he was like

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh, that looks like a DS game, and it kind of was

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
So, I'm just like, wow, these kids have really cool little educational things

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Usually when I see educational games I try to figure out how to break them, but you know

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
And then we saw, we saw, um, um, penguins

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And that made me very happy, not a video game, like actual live penguins

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
That made me very happy, that's why we went to the aquarium in the first place

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
We need to get you like your own copy of Portable Pango

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, I love Pango, that's one of my favorite games, it's a good game

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Alright, it's on that Konami game thing

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Is it really? Sweet!

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh wait, not Puyen, Puyen's different

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Oh, maybe it's Puyen

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, Puyen's way different, Puyen's like the free little pig

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Puyen's like the dumb little bubble game

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah, I had that when I was 64

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Wait, I don't know, it says on the back

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Pango was a Sega game, wasn't it? I took it in my room

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Wasn't Pango a Sega game?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Maybe it was

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I think it was

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Um, now I've got to find out

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Nah

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Alright, anywho, uh, let's see, what else?

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh, but so actual games I really did play, uh, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, hello

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Pango is by Sega

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Thank you, um, was that from Wikipedia? Or from chat?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
No, it was from Google

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Alright, sweet

11:38.000 --> 11:48.000
Um, Guitar Hero 2, I passed on Guitar Hero 2 on the Playstation 2 because I knew, like, they made the dumb announcement of saying it was going to come out on 360 later on

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
So I knew to wait and not buy it on Playstation 2, so it's been a long time since I've played Guitar Hero

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Because the first one kind of wore off for me

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And I'm really liking Guitar Hero 2, it's fun

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Song list for me is not wowing me as much as the first one did

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't know, I'm more into, like, the contemporary songs, and there's some really, like, obscure classics in this game

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
But, you know, it's cool

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I mean, because they, like, they freaking have Sweet Child in mind

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I mean, come on, like, how awesome is that to have in Guitar Hero 2?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Does it have the commercial, like, animation thing in the beginning of the game?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
It does have a animation thing in the beginning, I don't know if it's the same as commercial

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Where they're, like, uh, fighting off a meteor or something like that?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm not sure, but there's unlockable videos, I haven't unlocked them yet though

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
That was awesome, that actually kind of would make me want to buy the game, because it's kind of badass

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I don't know

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, Guitar Hero 2 is fun

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Graphics, obviously a step up from the Playstation 2 because it supports widescreen

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
It's not going to wow you, but then again, Guitar Hero was not ever about amazing graphics

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
The controller itself works pretty good

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
My whammy bar seems screwy, but now I'm hearing there's a recall

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So I bet you anything I got one of those guitars

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I did

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Did you really?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I haven't played it yet, so

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Shit

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
We'll check mine live on air a little later

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
If you have one, I probably have one too, because ours came from the same place

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, they basically said it was, like, two different versions of it or something

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
It's, like, I think it's something probably easy to fix, but, you know

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I knew my whammy bar seemed screwy for some reason, but anyway

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
But, uh, yeah, I mean, there's lots of stuff to unlock

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I like the leaderboards

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I hear a lot of people saying they can't do online co-op though

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They can't do online co-op because, heaven forbid, lag gets in the game

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
But then I'm thinking, well, DDR kind of has online co-op, and that works, even with the lag

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
I mean, granted, guitar is about hearing the music as you're playing it

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
So you wouldn't be able to really, I mean, that would be the lagged part

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Whereas DDR, you know, the way DDR gets away with it

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Is it kind of shows you the steps with, or that shows you the ratings with a little bit of lag

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
But it doesn't matter because you're not really focusing on that

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
You're playing your own game

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
So I think they could do it

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
They just would have to get creative with how the music track plays

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
You know what I mean?

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
They obviously have the way it's supposed to sound and the little fuck-up notes

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
When you screw up, it goes, you know, those little things

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Well then they have, like, amplitude online

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I have to displace those

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And where you could do co-op with amplitude and stuff like that

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm almost positive they did

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, they had amplitude

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So I'm pretty sure it can be done

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I don't know

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
DevilKai in chat says

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Hey Sky, I hear Guitar Hero 2 for 360 has some pretty awkward compared to the PS2 version

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Lag, stiffer pick on the guitar, etc.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
This is coming from a brother who just got it, by the way

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
It does seem like the pick is a little bit different

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
If you're getting lag, I would urge you to go into the video options

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Hit start and go into the video options

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And you can actually calibrate your screen

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Because some HDTVs have the lag

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Because of the upscaling or whatever it does

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I don't know

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You really shouldn't have that on an Xbox 360 though

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Because it has a native HD signal

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
But I know either way

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
If you're getting screwy lag

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
You can go in and calibrate it

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
But it's a little hard to find

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You wouldn't know that unless you read the manual

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
So check that out

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Anyway, Guitar Hero 2, I do recommend it

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Especially if you don't already own the PS2 version

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It's good times

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
It's kind of expensive though

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
If you already own the PS2 version

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
You might want to question how important is it to you to have it on next gen

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Because I don't know

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Granted, there's a couple new songs

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Some slightly prettier graphics and the whole online leaderboards

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
You have to ask yourself if achievement points mean that much to you

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh, speaking of achievement points real quick

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
There's some really screwy ones in there

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
You fail a song on easy and get 10 points

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
You play a left-handed song and get 10 points

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You beat tutorial and get 10 points

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
It seems like some of the scores are mis-weighted

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I think if you fail a song on easy

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It should be one of those ghost achievements

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Kind of like the manhole achievement in Ninja Turtles

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Where it's just on your record

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
But it's zero gamer score

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Or Dead or Alive has one too

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think if you lose 10 battles in a row

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
That goes on your gamer card

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But you don't get any gamer points for it

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And that game score should have been allocated to some of the other

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Beat a song, perfect

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Because you only get 10 points for getting a perfect 100% on a song

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I think

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Might have been 10 or 30

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
But it just seems some of the scores are mis-weighted

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
That's what you get for having 50 achievements in a damn game

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
But that's kind of cool

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Because I'd rather have that than 10 achievements

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
That are really hard or really easy

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You know what I mean?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It feels a little spread out having the 50

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
To me

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
But anyway

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Alright, Mandarin

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Because they already talked about games

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Are there any games specifically this week you've been into?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
We wound up playing doctor and nurse

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh, you mean video games?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Video games, sweetie, video games

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Tom beat Zelda finally

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I watched him beat it, sort of

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I was in and out of the room

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Is that Zelda Twilight Princess?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yes

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Sweet

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Other than that we're probably going to pick up Paper Mario tomorrow at some point

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Heck yeah, I want that too

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That's pretty much about it right now

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Since we've just been busy with other things

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Like fucking?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Like fixing my bike

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
My motorcycle

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Fixing your bike

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yes

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Do you ride a bike to work?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
No, not yet

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Are you going to ride a bike to work?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Once I get my license

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Have you ever seen that bike video game they have?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
It's something we saw at E3 a couple of years ago

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It's a little exercise bike but it's a game

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Where it's on the street

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
But the graphics were kind of horrible if I remember right

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It looked like

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
God, what was that Sega Master System game?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I think it came with every Sega system

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
That was like a motorcycle game

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I can't remember

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Hang on?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Yes, it was Hang On

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
It looked like Hang On to me

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Alright

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
DarkShyInChat says Dr. Mario and Peach Live

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Is that what your house is like, Amanda?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Dr. Mario and Peach Live?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
No

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Alright

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, thank you for sharing your gaming weeks with us

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm looking at chat

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Some of them are sharing their gaming weeks as well

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Also talking about the achievements

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Blaze says

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I think games shouldn't be allowed to have more than like 30 achievements

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Microsoft does regulate it to some extent

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Can't you not have more than 50 achievements or something like that?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I think 50 is the max and they raised it up to 50

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Did they?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Interesting

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Let's see

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
JeremyTod1 says

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I think they should have negative achievements

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Where it takes away achievement points for sucking too much

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
That would be interesting

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
But I do think having the ghost achievement points is kind of cool

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Like the ones that are worth nothing

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That are just stuck on your gamer card

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
You have fallen down a hole, champagne

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Alright

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Let's see, anyway

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Let's go to some housekeeping for tonight

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't really have a lot

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
So I will just say

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Please listen to our spinoff programming

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
DarkSakura was unable to pump up the volume this week

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Because Comcast went down, right?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Yes, it did

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Actually, I thought I had to replace my modem

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
But it turned out that it was just a temporary

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Alright, so Tuesday nights

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You can listen to DarkSakura take your request

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
7pm or 7.30?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I can never remember

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
7.30

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
7.30pm Pacific, right here on orangelauncherady.com

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Wednesday nights, guys on the show

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
7 o'clock Pacific time

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Thursday nights, STFU

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Also at 7 o'clock Pacific time

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Is there still a club, OLR?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
There is

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
There is, I put new episodes up there

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Or reruns

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Club OLR has been getting low ratings

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
So we're thinking of moving it

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And putting something else on Friday nights

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
But if you want to save Club OLR

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Friday nights at 7 o'clock

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Might be one of the first Orange Launch Radio shows to get canned due to low ratings

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
We'll see

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
No, that's right, your other shows have all been canned due to low ratings

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
No, what about your shows?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Oh, that's true, one of my shows did

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
No, we don't usually cancel shows due to low ratings

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
That's just the excuse

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
The first case of the Mondays

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I mean, it's internet radio, people

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
We have low ratings anyway

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
We don't care

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But we always use that as an excuse

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
The thing is, it takes a long time

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
To create that damn show

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And wife doesn't like that

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And it's awesome, because you mix all this music together

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
It's awesome, and unfortunately you can't broadcast it

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, I was working on stuff

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I was actually doing a happy hardcore one

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
But I stopped

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
For some reason

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I ran out of material

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Let's see what happens

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Let's see, Saturday at 7 o'clock Pacific

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Is Travis Donovan Live

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Our old buddy from Understation Live does his own show

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
No, he cancelled it

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I heard about that

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I heard there was a really nasty April Fools joke

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
He had people calling in, like, crying in the whole works

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It was awesome

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And then he said, screw you, April Fools

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
What a little bastard

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Listen to that little bastard, Travis Donovan

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
On Saturday nights at 7 Pacific

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Welcome to tonight's gaming news

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I'll start it off

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Talking about the Xbox 360

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Some information has leaked

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
About the spring dashboard update

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
And this leak comes to you

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Courtesy of GameSpot

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Good job, guys

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah, I'm sure it was really leaked

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It wasn't a planned release or something

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I'm totally sure that was

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Well, probably the article went up a couple days before it was supposed to

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I imagine

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Maybe Major Nelson was going to talk about it on his show tonight

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And that was going to be it

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh wait, no, I think actually he's off because of Easter

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I've been following him on Twitter

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I have a Twitter account now

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
So I could be like Major Nelson and Gamer Andy

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Because I want to be cool like them

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I heard that's supposed to be the next YouTube or something

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It's kind of a stalker site

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Which kind of worries me

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So I don't post about things as I'm doing them

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I post about things after the fact

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
You know what I mean?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It's really the cheesy thing

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It asks, what are you doing right now?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You're supposed to type in what you're doing right now

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
For instance, I think the last thing I put

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Is I'm listening to the new Bjork song

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
While I'm trying to produce the show role for tonight

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
You're supposed to use 140 characters or less

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But the trick is, you can also use your cell phone to update

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Or IM to update

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So it's kind of interesting

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's like a live journal, but they restrict you to only 150 characters

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
So it forces you to be quick

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I don't know, it's weird

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
But Major Nelson's been a huge backer of it

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And I've been following him on there

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And then Gamer Andy sent me an invite

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
What are you doing right now?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm updating my Twitter account

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
What are you doing right now?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm updating my Twitter account

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Alright

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's twitter.com.sky

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
How did we get on that?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
The spring dashboard update

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Do you think GameSpot will get a cease and desist over this?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
No

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Because I bet you anything this is totally planned

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Fucking corporate

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
They pay good money to leak the stories

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I mean, I say this

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
The corporate website does not leak stories, okay?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It's not a leak

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It's a fucking planned PR thing

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
That's disguised as a leak

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Because there's...no

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm sorry

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't know

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I want to say you corporate fuckers

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Even though GameSpot's okay and all

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It just irritates me

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It's still news

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So the update is supposed to come May 7th

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
And Windows Live Messenger is going to be incorporated

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Some of you know this is MSM Messenger

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So it's going to be incorporated into the Xbox 360

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
So if you have people who aren't on

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Xbox Live

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
You can still communicate to them through MSM Messenger

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Because they know most people use AIM

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
So they're trying to really take a step up

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I think with MSM Messenger

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And what was interesting about that

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Is I saw in the video that they had posted

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That you can actually push the button

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And use Messenger during a game

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Like you could be playing a game

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And you know how like right now you can bring up the sidebar

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And send messages on Xbox Live and all that

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Well you can bring up like a little chat window

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And chat with people right in the middle of the game

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So that's kind of interesting

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Sorry I could be winning my game

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
But instead I got a pop-up coming

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm talking to you

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
But that could be, I don't know

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That could be kind of fun for some of those

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't know, little arcade games and stuff

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
That you play, that you take turns

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't know

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You know how they call it blades

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
When you're going across the 360 menu

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Marketplace will now have its own blade

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Users are now getting inline achievement updates

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Supposedly you're going to be able to see

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
How many points the achievement was

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
What the achievement is

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's like you know how right now it says achievement unlock

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Little sound comes up right

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You can actually now know what it is you're getting

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Because a lot of times we go, what the hell achievement did I just get

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Especially when we did something stupid

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I fell in a manhole five times

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Why did that unlock an achievement

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Low power download mode

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And auto shutdown

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
For those long movie downloads

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
You can also watch partially downloaded movies

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Now you don't have to wait for the whole thing to download

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And again that messenger

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Will work with up to six friends

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
At once and other little tweaks

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
On the user interface

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So that is the big spring dashboard update

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Information leaked to the internet

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Sounds kind of fun

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I wish I knew people that actually used MSN

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Messenger

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
But as it is everybody owns AIM

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You use it?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Every once in a while

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I have a few contacts that are primarily

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
On there and I just kind of keep it open

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
With a trillion

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
But don't use too many people on there

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Would you want to talk to me on

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Xbox while I'm playing Halo

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Would you like to send me messages like you suck at Halo

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Rob

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You suck at Halo Rob

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
No one needs to actually tell you that don't you already know

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Sadly yes

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I do know

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
It's not a fucking joke people

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I really suck at Halo

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Supposedly

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
In MSN Messenger

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You're going to be able to see that I'm playing Halo

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It's going to tell you what game I'm playing

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
So you can stalk me more

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Don't you want to stalk me Mandarin?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
She's giving me a funny look

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Anyway there you go spring dashboard update

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Awesome

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Now if you're thinking about possibly buying

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
One of those Xbox 360 elite systems

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
There's a few things you might want to know

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
About the HDMI

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
First off that it will ship with

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
HDMI version 1.2

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
As opposed to latest version 1.3

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Now what does that mean

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
For you

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Well not too much as far as

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Video is concerned however

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Audio though if you want some

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Really cool audio you're not going to be able to use

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Dolby TrueHD

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And DTS HD

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Master audio streams

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
It's not really a problem I think for most people

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Most people who I use the HDMI for

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You know the video

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And then you know digital out

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
For audio I mean really it's not that big

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
A difference but

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean if you really want to get down to it

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
That's a problem for some people I guess

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But anyways

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Other differences include

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
They actually have this

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
New audio lip sync technology

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't really know

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Where that would come to play with games

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Better transfer speeds

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And of course if you were

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Outputting above 1080p

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Which you're not going to be doing right now

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
At least not anytime soon

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Audio lip sync technology would that be like

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
You know how like in Kingdom Hearts

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Because they didn't bother to resync the lips

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
From the Japanese version

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
The lips are all off sync with the English words

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Like is that maybe what they're talking about

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Like maybe you can sync that better

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Maybe

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Just audio is really the issue right now

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't know

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I don't really think that's a big deal

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I mean

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Like I

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Optical is awesome I mean unless you really

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Are spending the big money for you know

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Your system or something

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't really think that would be a huge deal

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But then again you watch it next week

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
There will be a press release from Sony

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Saying well we support true HD audio

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
We're the fucking next generation

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
You guys are not

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I mean I can't wait to see

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
The press release because I know what's going to happen

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Sony is more HD than your mom

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
There's the press release right there

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Um

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So guess what there's some sad news

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Sniff

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Apparently

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Our friends

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
At Rooster Teeth

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Which as far as

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I understand was supposed to originally be called

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Cockbite

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Rooster Teeth

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That's what we should have called the podcast, Cockbite

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Um

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
They are um

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Stopping at uh

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Episode 100 for Red vs Blue

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
They posted it on their

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
On their forum

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
But you want to know what

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I call bullshit because it was posted on April 1st

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Ah

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But that news has been making rounds around the internet this week

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
It has and I don't see

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Um

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I've been looking through the whole thing and I don't see

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Any type of uh

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Disclaimer

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Hmm

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
But I still call bullshit

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They're just going to move on to Halo 3 and do a new

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Either relaunch Red vs Blue

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Or do something else

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It's like you're ending one series and another's beginning

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's like you know

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
The end of Star Trek

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And the beginning of Star Trek The Next Generation

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
There you go that's a good analogy

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Very very nerdy of you

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You get kudos

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But think about this guys

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
In iTunes seriously like if you look up Video Game Podcast

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Which would you download first

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
The podcast called Orange Lounge Radio

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Or the podcast called Cockbite

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Cockbite Radio

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't know

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It's tempting

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
For five years we might have to change our name

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We should just call our show

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The Naked Lesbian Boobs

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Rock Music

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And Drug Show

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's called Games Games Games

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I think there already is a show called

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Games Games Games

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
There's so many

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I remember when we started podcasting

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
There were maybe like five video game shows

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
We should call it Look Boobies

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
There were like five video game

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Mandarin did you just show your boobs at studio?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
There were like maybe five video game

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Podcasts and all and now there's like five hundred

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
All right

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
She flashed her abdomen at you

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
All right anyway

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Sigh

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Anyway

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Going on to the marketplace

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Why isn't there more

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Red vs Blue downloadable in the marketplace

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I thought they were going to do all these viral videos

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And things like they have this whole section

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Of marketplace for viral videos

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But I can't get Lonely Girl

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I can't get Alanis's My Humps

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I can't get any of that YouTube

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Stuff on

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Microsoft Marketplace

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In charge of the backwards compatibility updates

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Aha touche

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Good job

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Well what they will have on marketplace pretty soon

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Is the Forza 2 demo

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
There were rumors this week

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That a downloadable demo will be coming

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
The timing though

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Is still unknown

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So supposedly though the game

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Is coming out in May

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
If the information is supposed to be confirmed

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Soon

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
The demo should be like end of April

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Right ish early May

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Maybe

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I've been hearing that their official

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Release has been the 15th

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Mid April

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Well probably I'd say late April

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Cause I was just thinking

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I can't think of any racing

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Games on the Xbox 360

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So I'm really excited to hear

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That's a joke

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Cause there's like 50

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
If you want a demo of

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
The second Forza

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Just play Project Gotham Racing 3

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
More or less

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Alright

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
MotoGP

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Anyways

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So as we mentioned earlier

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Red Octane

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And actually they have admitted to it now

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
But apparently there's been some issues

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
With the whammy bars on some of the

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Guitar Hero 2 controllers

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Now I personally haven't experienced this yet

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Since my game is still in the shrink wrap

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But you know I have picked up

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
The guitar and the

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Whammy bar feels a little cheap

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Anyhoo so

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Apparently the

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
One's affected by

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
There's two skews actually

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
That are defective

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
The first one is

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Let's see here

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I believe it's like a 95055

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And then the other one is 95065

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And apparently

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
You can see

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I'm sitting back in the room and I have my explorer controller

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What'd you say now? What am I looking for?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
95055 or 95065

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Fuck!

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I have a 95065

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Ha ha! God damn you Loki

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Ha ha! You stole me

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
This broke as fuck

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Xbox 360 explorer

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm gonna smash this like a real guitar

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm just gonna take mine apart

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Take it back

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Cause you know what I wanna do?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I wanna get mad props on the internet

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And get a distortion pedal

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Since it can't be that hard to figure out how to

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Fuck you know

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
That distortion pedal works

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
This is just a damn

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
What is it? Ethernet cord there?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Anyways

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So yeah that's what's up

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Apparently they want you to return

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Your guitar

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And get a new one

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
That's not one of those two models

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
They didn't really say what's defective

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But if it's giving you crap

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
If you got it from Red Octane

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You can contact them to get them RMA

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Or if you purchase it

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Elsewhere you may need to go bitch them out

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But either way

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It's stupid

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Don't they test this stuff?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Shouldn't they test these batches?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
If there's four different types of guitars

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Made obviously there were some issues

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Why revise the product?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
It's the whammy bar

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I read somewhere else it's the whammy bar

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And when I'm playing the game it feels like the whammy bar

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Has noticed it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It doesn't work the same as the PlayStation 2 one

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I could tell

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
It works! It's not completely broken

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But it doesn't do the wah wah wah

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Very easily

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It's either on or it's off

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
That's what seems to be wrong with the whammy bar

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
So yeah

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Thank you for selling me a bum

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Xbox 360

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Hey it's not my fault

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It's all the launch ones I think are like that

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
This is what I'm saying though

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Why revise the designs on some product?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I mean why revise the design four times?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I mean seriously

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What's the big deal?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Unless these are coming from four different production factories

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Or something like that

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
One in China, one in Malaysia

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
One in Hong Kong

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And two of those are fucked up or something

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I don't believe

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
That two would be broken in an exact same way

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
But

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I don't know

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah, Sycoon is wondering in our chat room

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Why are there four different guitars anyway?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Kyle Snyder says

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Why can't these companies actually tell the whole truth to the public for once?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
How about

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Test your product and if it's effective

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Don't send out hundreds of thousands of them

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
SSJ100Matt says

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Smash it

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Video tape it and throw it on the OLR YouTube

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Maybe

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I'll tell you this

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
If I can unlock all 1000 achievement points

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Or as many as I'm going to get on Guitar Hero

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Then I'll smash my controller

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
There's going to be tons of download content though

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
We'll see

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
When is some new DDR content coming up?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Because there's just one song pack

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Don't hold your breath

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Alright

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Anyhow

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
At least I can say this

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'll say something nice about Red Octane

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Because I do like Guitar Hero

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
At least they acted on this quickly

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
They realized they screwed up

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And within a week of the game's release they're acting on it

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
So yay for them

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
It makes me very angsty that I have one of those crappy guitars

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
GS68 says

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Convert your guitar to a machine gun

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I'm going to have it implanted on my leg

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Like Rose McGowan

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Dude that's hot

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What's also hot is hell

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
In our Effies of the Week

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
My Effie of the Week

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Goes to

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
The line at Marie Callender's this morning

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
When I was standing in it

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You stood between me and my ex Benedict bitches

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Lowkey

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Your Effie of the Week

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Effie of the Week goes to

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
The movie Premonition

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Because I knew it sucked

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
But yet I went to see it because the wife wanted to see it

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Now

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That movie is so horrible

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I hate Sandra Bullock so much

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
But I got to admit

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I laughed my ass off at the very end of the movie

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
The way the character dies

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
At the end is so like stupid

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Oh man

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I just couldn't stop laughing

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I was going to go into the theater and do that shit

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Thanks for the spoilers by the way

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Don't see it, it's a horrible movie

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
My Effie of the Week

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Goes to the movie Babble

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Bab-el? Bab-el?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Although I actually really like the movie

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
That was way too many pussy shots

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
For one movie

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And it was the same pussy every time

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Like I know that girl's vagina

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Inside and out

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
In glorious HD

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
High definition DVD

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Thanks to my player in Netflix

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Wow!

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Alright

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Mantrin, do you have any FUs of the Week?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Yes, I'd like to say FU

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
To the speakers who stole our most

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Motorcycle, not that we started

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Fixing it

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Because we have to go out

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And essentially get new bearings

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Because you rip the pegs

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Off of that actual

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Half of the bike properly

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
So, screw you

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Don't steal shit people

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Try the same fuckers who broke into my car

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Like 50 times

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Alright

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Well

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Back to some gaming news

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Maybe

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
If I feel like it

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
FU to Dark Sakura for being a bitch

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Hey, you know what?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
People love my bitchiness

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Anyway

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance has 8

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Downloadable characters on Xbox 360

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I don't know about anything else

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Which is kind of stupid because I'm playing the PS3 one

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
But I don't care

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
The downloadable characters

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Effective April 10th

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Are Hulk, Hawkeye which makes me happy

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Cyclops, Nightcrawler

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Another one of my favorites

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Dr. Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth and Venom

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Venom is cool

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Playable for Marvel Ultimate Alliance on Xbox 360

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Has all their abilities

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Costumes, dialogue

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Conversations, achievement points

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But everyone really wants to just play Deadpool

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
If you haven't bought the game yet

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And you're thinking about buying it for the Xbox 360

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I'd wait until next month

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Because they're going to do

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Just like the Call of Duty 3

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Characters packed in

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Save yourself like 10 bucks

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Or just play it on PS3

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Or buy it used

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Or don't buy it at all

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
That'd be my preference

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Or come over to my house and bring controllers

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Because we need more people to play with me

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Alright

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
But no Wonder Woman

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That's DC Comics, dummy

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I learned that last week the hard way

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I just felt like fucking with you

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Alright

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I learned that last week the hard way

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I just felt like fucking with you

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
When we told you over and over again

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That Knights is coming out to the Wii

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And I don't know, somehow that got confirmed again

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Like blogs were rerunning the story

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Knights is confirmed yet again

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Journey into Dreams

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Or no, Journey of Dreams

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And I was like, okay, didn't we already hear this?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But one thing we didn't hear that was new this week

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Is that it's going to use

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Wii Connect 24 functionality

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Are you listening, Loki?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
However

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
It's going to use the forecast channel

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
To bring you the real world seasons

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
So it's going to actually use the forecast channel

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm assuming

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
If it's snowing outside

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Then it'll be snowing in game

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
If it was snowing at midnight

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
You mean

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Then it'll be snowing in game

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Because that forecast channel doesn't update ever

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It's going to suck if you live in Jamaica

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And it's sunny all the time

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Well then maybe you can set it

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I mean, you can probably turn forecast channel

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
On or off, I imagine, in the game

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And if it's off, it's just randomized

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
That's what I'm going to do when they have Animal Crossing come out

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm just going to set mine to Antarctica

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Or something like that

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Why is it snowing in summer?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Because it's cold

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
That's what the forecast channel says

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Anyways

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
As if this is a big surprise

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I know

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
New colors of the Wiimote and Nunchucks

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Are supposedly coming out soon

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah, big shocker there

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
It's going to be funny though

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Apparently

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It comes from a retailer list

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
According to GoNintendo.com

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
And some of the colors available

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Silver, blue, and pearl pink

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Both

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Pink

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
And I bet you anything

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
The console colors are coming as well

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
But my question is though

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Is this

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
The controllers aren't out there anyways now

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
What's it matter if they're in different colors as well

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
You still can't get them

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
People are going to be

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Silver is such a weird color too

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
For a controller

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Mandarin, you did a little

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Jerk off motion when you heard this story

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
What are your thoughts on the Nunchucks and remotes

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And different colors

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I have a remote skin

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Like the most rubbery things

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Once I heard about all the remotes

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Flying off because of sweaty hands

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I went out and got one and it cuts down

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So I have a pink remote

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Just like Nelly does

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
But it does look like your wiimote is wearing a condom

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I mean I just put that out there

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah what can I say I like to play safe

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And to kind of

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And your wiimote has not gotten AIDS

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
So good job

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
To clarify this also this is coming from a European

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Retail list apparently

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
According to that

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It will be shipping on

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
June 29th in the UK

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So not of course

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
An official confirmation but come on

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Of course Nintendo is going to do different colored

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Remotes and stuff

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I don't know the

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Silver, blue, and pink that's kind of a weird

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Combo of colors there

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Isn't that all the colors of the DS?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
There's no silver in this

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah there is the original one was silver

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Silver-y

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Silver-ish

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Those are all DS colors

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Oh sorry gray

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Silver

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Well we can all call it what we want to

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But that doesn't necessarily make it true

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Well

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Something that I think is really stupid

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You know we weren't really supposed to talk about this

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
You know situation again

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
But um

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
The uh we all remember the

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Woman that drank all the water

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And you know

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Pretty much killed herself

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
How could we forget we freaking live here

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It was all over the news for like months

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Well um

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Basically they um

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Are not filing any

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Criminal charges against

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
The radio station

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Um

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The district attorney

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Basically is quoted saying

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Jennifer Strange was an adult

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Who voluntarily participated

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
In the radio contest

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
She knew what the contest

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Involved when she entered it

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And had the option to stop or discontinue her participation

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
In the radio contest at any time

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
However the civil suit is still

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
In a process

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And um

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
That morning show though still cancelled

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
The staffers were fired

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And they still haven't replaced it by the way

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I think they're still doing that cheesy

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Make your own playlist

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And come in and DJ for the morning

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Like they're trying to get people off the street

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
To fill in cause they like seriously no one will touch

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
That radio station with a ten foot pole right now

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I would if I could play my own music but unfortunately

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I actually was going to send in an entry

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
For it but you have to join their little

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Online club but maybe I should do that

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I mean wouldn't that be kind of funny

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
We should all send in a playlist

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
And just put Beyonce

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
My chemical romance I don't know just put all the top

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
40 crap on there and get in there

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
And do it wouldn't that be fun

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
No not really cause I don't listen to that station

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
But you know

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I don't entirely agree with that statement

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I think that you know she

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Wasn't fully they didn't fully disclose

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
The risks involved with it

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I mean yes she is an adult if she was

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Feeling sick or whatever she could bow out

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
But you know I don't think

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
They fully explain the risks to them

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
As far as you know what

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
What's involved and what could possibly happen

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
And that's all going to come out in this civil lawsuit

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
To be honest it's no surprise

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
To me that a criminal charge

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Wasn't filed because you'd essentially be saying

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
They were set out to kill someone

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Like they were

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Going into this contest thinking hey

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You know what we should do for ratings let's kill someone

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Well

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I don't think that would work

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
We thought about it but you know

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I don't know

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
But still I still think they can

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Get them on negligence just you know

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
For not disclosing this stuff I mean hell

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
If they can get Pete like McDonald's on that

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Disclosing that coffee's hot

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I mean they should be able to get that's a civil lawsuit

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
The owner of McDonald's did not go

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
To jail for a year because the coffee was hot

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
They should cause their fries suck sometimes

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
And they keep hiring

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
These people that don't speak any English

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And they always fuck up my orders

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That station will get sued for

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Eleveny billion dollars it's coming

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
And they will get sold and change their name

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's counting down till the day

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Till that radio station has to change their name

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And then we will see the headline

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
On the news is at the end of

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
The end

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Wah wah

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
They're saving that like headline

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Saving it

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Ahh love it

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Alright

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Well um

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
While we wait for more information

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
On the Jennifer Strange

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Lawsuit stuff cause I know you just

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
You love and thrive on all that

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Information

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah I know

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I was being facetious

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I have release dates

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
See what I was doing was I was buying time

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
While I was pulling up the Japanese release dates

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Cause I was lazy bastard and didn't pull them up in advance

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So let me tell you about all these great games coming out

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
To the Japanese market

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And you can also horribly

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Listen to me horribly horribly

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Butcher and mispronounce names of your favorite titles

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Of which it actually does not seem like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
There's a whole lot coming out over in Japan

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
This week um for Playstation 2

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
There's a game called

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Grim Grimoire

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Which is coming out and also

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double agent

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
On the Playstation 2 finally gets its way

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
In Japan

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's coming out

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
There's a couple titles on the DS

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Including some Disney franchises

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Chicken Little and The Little Mermaid

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Make its way to Japan

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Which by the way

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
You have to hear at some point in your life

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
The Little Mermaid stage from Kingdom Hearts

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
In Japanese

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Makes me cry

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Makes me cry from laughing so hard

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Watashi no Relaxuma

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Is a game coming out to the Nintendo DS

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Relaxuma sounds cool

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Relaxuma

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And Jamie maybe you'd like this

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Doesn't it look like little bears massaging each other

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Or something

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It does

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
It looks like the old bear is reading

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And the little bear is walking on his back

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Some folks used to do that

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
To massage

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
That bear is going to murder the other bear

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
With that little pointy red flag

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
He's going to play with his

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I call this land in the name of France

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
And stab them through the temple

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
So really not an exciting week in Japan

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Sorry

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Well if you're looking for excitement

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
In the United States

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Well

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
You better wait until next week

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Although there is one good game coming out this week

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Super Paper Mario

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
On the Wii

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
That's about it

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
There's a couple PSP games coming out

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
None worth mentioning

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
That is your week

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Super Paper Mario if you don't have a Wii

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Ha

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Ha

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
But I was really looking forward to Hot Dog King on the PC

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That game looks awesome

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Wasn't that supposed to come out last week

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't know I'm looking at a website that has it listed for this week

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Yeah it's

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
It's just a really

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Really sad week

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Well it's really not looking much better

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
For the UK

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
We have

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Well Fears coming out that's a good game

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
And the Godfather the Dawns edition

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
On PS3

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Gurumin A Monstrous Adventure

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
On the PSP Harvest Moon DS

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Hotel Dusk Room 215

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Pokemon Ranger and Wing Island

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
On Wii

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Maybe Hotel Dusk

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Room 215 will do better like in Europe

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
You know how like sometimes with music

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
There's like bands that do way better

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
In Europe that like flop here even though

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
They might be really good

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I don't know things like Robbie Williams

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
He's big everywhere but people here

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Don't bat an eyelash at him right

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Maybe Hotel Dusk 215 will like

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Catch like wildfire

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Or maybe you're just saying

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Yeah cause you're a bitch

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Hey Rob

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Guess what

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You know it's kind of random

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
This is completely random here but you know a game

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I saw a video for that kind of made it look

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Fun to play

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Cabela's African Safari

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
They have it like where you can go into bullet time

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
As you freaking

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
You're diving towards

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You know I guess a lion

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Or something like that and you can snipe

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Lions in the head

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Africa

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Although they already said in Africa

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
You're not gonna be hunting animals

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Which is like the one reason I would

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Buy the game

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
It'd be awesome if like it's resistance in Africa

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
And you're just blowing crap up

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Africa

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Alright well

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Speaking of games

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We won't be seeing anytime soon

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Cause I don't know about you I haven't heard a damn thing on Africa

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Since E3

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Here's another game we won't be seeing anytime soon

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Mother 3

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And just to pour salt in the wounds

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Guess what Nintendo did this week

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Nintendo posted the soundtrack

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
On iTunes

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And no, not the Japanese store

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
You can actually get

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
The Mother 3 soundtrack in the US

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Store

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And download some of the songs from Mother 3

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Wait, what's this

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Mandarin? You have a game release?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Sam & Max episode 5

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Is gonna be released Thursday

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Wasn't that already out?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I thought episode 5 came out

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I thought it did too

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Oh it already released on Thursday

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Cause GameTap

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Does roll out their new games on Thursday

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And I had a friend

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Who was playing it but I think

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
This friend gets to play some games before the rest of us do

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
On GameTap

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Cause he's special

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
You getting told?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Alright well anyway

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
If you are waiting for Sam & Max

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Or just don't have GameTap

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And you want to download some music from Mother 3

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
You can download such gems as

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
We Miss You

51:04.000 --> 51:24.000
Music

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Slow jams of Earthbound

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Lame

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I don't know why anyone would be interested in that stupid game

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Because there are rabid

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Fucking Mother fans out there

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
On the internet that will

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Download anything that remotely has to do

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
With Mother

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
We used to have a little cluster from some

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
There was some website dedicated to Mother

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
And the Earthbound series

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
But there was a period of time

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
When there was a bunch of those folks listening to our show

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Don't you remember that?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Nope

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Well god, you don't care about our listeners do you?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Well then fine, new story

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Anyways

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Starman.net, that was it

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Miyamoto

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Of course inspired by

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
PlayStation Home

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Wants to expand the world

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Of the Miis

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
In other words

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Wants to do more things with them

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Including

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Have some sort of virtual sim-like experience with them

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
How about you start

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
By

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Giving third party companies

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Access to put Miis in their game

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Would be a good way to expand the experience

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Or

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I don't know, how about

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Do something a little bit more

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Than just have them wandering around their little

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
White existence in there

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
But yeah

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
He plans on seeing

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
A vast virtual world

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
With the Miis

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Not starting too well with the

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Vote for your favorite

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Mii channel that's supposed to be coming out

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Eventually

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
A Mare Mii can idol

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
We're Sanjaya Mii

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Okay

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Well

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Anyway

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Anyway

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This makes me kind of sad

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Because

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Our dear

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Hero

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Nomura Tetsuya

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Is not affiliated

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
With the

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
New Kingdom Hearts

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Coming out

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Wait, but we saw that trailer last week right?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
For some type of

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Or at least it was tacked on at the end of

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix or whatever

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
So they're going on without them or what?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
What he's basically telling

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Dengeki Playstation is

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And this is a quote

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
First it's not Kingdom Hearts 3

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Of course because we're calling it a new series

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It won't be Kingdom Hearts 3

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Also it's a series so it won't

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Be just one title

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Um

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
He's saying that basically he's working

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
On a different story

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I don't know

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Not the next Kingdom Hearts

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It's a spinoff of the Kingdom Hearts series

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Online, MMO

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Dude that would be hot

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I would totally quit World of Warcraft

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
For that

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I think it's the Kingdom Hearts series

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Without Disney

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
But why?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
That's why most of us started playing Kingdom Hearts

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
In the first place

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Now we have to play it for the

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Roxas

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
And Axl

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Fuck that

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Well we'll see what happens

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Dustcap2 makes it funny in chat

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Kingdom Hearts X1

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Like Mega Man

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Get it

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Laugh

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Well this is also leaving

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
A lot of people with a huh kind of look

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Is that Resident Evil 4

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Has been confirmed for the Wii

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Um now yes that's Resident Evil

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
4 the game that you could already

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Play with your GameCube

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Backwards compatibility

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Will now be coming out on the Wii

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
This must be what they were talking about when they said the old GameCube

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Games they could easily redo them for the Wii

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
With the new functionality

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Well here it is in motion right here

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Uh you're gonna now be able to

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Um you know obviously you use the Wii

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Controls as part of the game

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
It'll have widescreen support although I believe the old one had

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Widescreen support as well but I guess now you can get

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Progressive Scan and all that good stuff

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Um well couldn't the old one do

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Progressive Scan as well? Could it?

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I don't remember. I thought so. Interesting

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So they really aren't changing a lot of it then

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Well the Wii Mode is gonna be used for close range

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Attacks uh the speaker will be used

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
For the reload sound effect the one that's in the

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Little Wii Mode there um if an enemy

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Approaches you give the Wii Mode a little shake

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And you can do a close range attack

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
With the knife um otherwise

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
The game has also been modified to take

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Um the Wii into the account um

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Some interactive event scenes use the Wii

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Buttons you have to shake the Wii Mode and part

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Of it um the producer of the Wii

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Version uh was talking to Famitsu

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Magazine and said that uh

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
They want to allow families who play the

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Wii together to experience Resident Evil

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
So in other words

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
No more chainsaw your face off

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I guess I guess they're gonna have to do something about that

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
But there are gonna be easy and amateur

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Difficulty settings to make the game a little

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Bit easier

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Also the bonus elements from the Playstation 2

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Will be in the Wii release so you can do

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
The add a um sequence

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
The another order sequence

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
So that's I guess something

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
That you didn't have on your backwards compatibility

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I can't

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
They're gonna have to do something about uh

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Chainsaw man taking off your head though

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
For the family play they're gonna really

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Need to do something like that about that

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Oh man that's funny

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Anyway instead he gives you

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
He gives you flowers

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Resident Evil Family Edition

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Anyways

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
So yeah I think it's funny that

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
They were saying that you know you can

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Redo some of the old GameCube games cause I think

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Most of the games that have come out recently

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Especially by Ubisoft um are just

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Old GameCube games that have been ported

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Over to the Wii

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Super Paper Mario to some extent is that I mean

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Granted they went back and reworked it

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Twilight Princess is a perfect example

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Prince of Persia 2 no

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Hot damn when do you think we're gonna get

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
A Wii game that was actually made for the Wii

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
What do you want to bet Excite Truck was just a GameCube

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Game they were thinking about too

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I don't know

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
That I think they were probably actually doing you know

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
For the Wii but like

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Prince of Persia Rival Swords

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Like you have a lot of the

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
You know stuff that's been out

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Binacle Heroes that's coming out that was a GameCube title

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Open Season a lot of the movie tie in stuff

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I don't know it's just bad

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Anyways

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Some of our chat room by the way is coming up with new slogans

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And commercials for Resident Evil 4

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Like you know that

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
We would like to play

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Bandit has come up with some new taglines

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Including

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
We die together

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And we would like to kill you

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
So there you go

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Free marketing

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Anyways

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
There's a rumor

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
That mass shortage

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Or mass storage

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Is coming to the Wii

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Although

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Unfortunately I think this rumor has been squashed

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Because

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
It had to do with a press release by a company called

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
ESOL Middleware

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
They have basically

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
A fat driver

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
For the file system

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
And there's another driver for USB host stuff

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Which apparently

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Is already being implemented into the Wii

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
So

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
This is probably not the case

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
For right now

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It is for the

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I believe the little

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Flash card you can put in there

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Sorry no mass storage for you

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I'm sure they have to at some point

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
You know do that

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Poor babies

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Alright well

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
DarkSakura might use that mass storage device

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
To save her favorite websites

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
When she's surfing the internet

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Because she likes to surf the internet a lot

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
And she finds her favorite websites

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And brings them to you in a special statement

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
We call DarkSakura's website of the week

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Today's website of the week

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Is one that Rob

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Frequences often

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Because I got the idea from him

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Pornotube.com

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Home of pterodactyl porn

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It needs nothing

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
It's pornotube.com

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Pterodactyl porn

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
You know

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
You want pterodactyl porn

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Adult only

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It does not count mental state of adult

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
What's been up with your website of the week lately

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
They've all been like x-rated

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I have no idea

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Because it's like

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Someone's been thinking about

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Sex

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
No

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Someone's been um

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Busy

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Psycoon says why don't we just make this Rob's website

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Of the week

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Oh okay I will think of an original website of the week next week

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Alright

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I promise

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Well DarkSakura frequents the pornotube

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
She's not afraid to get down with the pornotube

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Alright

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Well speaking of

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
We talked about GameTap earlier in the show

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I guess Mandarin clarified

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
That it was on the private server

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The new Sam & Max

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Like this Thursday

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So that's cool

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Something else that's there hidden away

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Apparently some Sega Saturn games

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Are in there

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
There's a game called Bug

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Which was lame by the way

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Well nevertheless it was on the Sega Saturn

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And it's there in GameTap

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And apparently there's some Easter Egg

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Games

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It's part of a promotion GameTap is doing

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I haven't logged into GameTap in a while

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I haven't used it in a while

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Apparently there's some other games hidden away too

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But those haven't come to light yet

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Something that some sharp eyed

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Folks have noticed is that if you

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Look at the controls in the game

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
The controls actually mention the shift key

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So is it possible this is

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Just a PC version of Bug that's

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Tucked away

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Don't know yet if this means that there are actually

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Saturn games coming

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
But nevertheless it wouldn't be too surprising seeing as Sega

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Has been a big supporter of

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
GameTap because you know you have a lot of Genesis

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Games and Master System games and hell you

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Have Dreamcast games in there

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So why not Saturn

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Makes sense

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
SSJ100mad in chat says

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'll get GameTap when they do Sega CD

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Sega in chat says

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
GameTap has included the

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Sega Saturn emulator so you'll get more

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Saturn games later

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
GameTap has officially announced that it is an emulator

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh there you go

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Cool

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Well speaking of

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Emulating stuff

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
A game called Piano Hero

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
On the PC

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Some guys making it

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And it's basically a freeware open source

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Project that lets people with

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
MIDI capable keyboards

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Play any MIDI file as if it were

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Like a Guitar Hero

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Style track

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Or think back to I don't know keyboard mania

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
However

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Activision has now

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Sent a cease and desist order

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
To the guy

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Behind it

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Nicholas looks like he had a

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Peach done

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Well basically the only thing he has

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
To do which is not too bad

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Is he has to change the name

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Because they want to make sure that people

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Aren't getting confused

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That it's an actual

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Official Activision product

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Or something like that

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So he can keep on making the game as long as he names it

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
As something else

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I don't know that's not bad

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
You know seeing as they're not going after the actual game though

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I don't know

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Does he really have to change the name?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yeah

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Basically they've sent a cease and desist

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Well no no no I'm not saying based on cease and desist

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
But do they really have the legal right to make him change the name?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I don't know

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Maybe unless they have something

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You know

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Coming out

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
It says among the various

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Products Activision publishes

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Are

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Video games

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Activision is the owner of certain

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Intellectual property rights including

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Guitar Hero franchise

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Including but not limited to

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The trademark Guitar Hero

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And says

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Let's see here

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I'm trying to see exactly what it is

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It says it comes to attention that you've been using

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The name Piano Hero in connection with your game

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
That you designed

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
For Halite Studios

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Where enclosed they print out of your

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Website showing such

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
In our opinion your use of

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
The name Piano Hero constitutes

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
At least

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Trademark infringement

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Delusion and unfair competition

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
With the respect to the trademark

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Guitar Hero

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I don't know

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It seems like I'm trying to think of things where things get

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Named similarly all the time

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Especially

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
When it comes to a lot of puzzle games

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't know

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
There's a perfect example

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
There's a movie studio out there that does

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Knock off movies like Snakes on a Train

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Or for the new

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Transformers movie

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Transmorphers

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
There you go

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Landmine Fairy

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Suggests Keyboard Villain

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
As a possible name to replace

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Can they already license Guitar Villain?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Not officially

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's been licensed but there's no game out on the market yet

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Which by the way that's one of my favorite chat room names ever

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Is Landmine Fairy

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Also Bandit makes a good suggestion

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Go to Guitar Hero.com

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
It's a site for action figures not associated

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
With Activision

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
They should sue Activision ASAP

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I agree

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Turn about the fair play right?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Or how about

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I don't know

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
The fact that I would say it's infringing more on

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Keyboard Mania

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Than you know

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The game itself

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Alpha

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Canongram suggests a name that will

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Probably sell more copies of the game

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Piano Porno Star

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Piano Porno Star

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Piano Porno Star is a pretty awesome name

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Piano Cockbite

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And on that note

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
We're going to bring part A to a close here

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Oh real quick

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Mandarin you wanted to give a special shout out right?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Seggman anyway

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I just want to give a special shout out to

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Segg in the chat room

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
He's a friend of mine currently in Boston

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
He was working at Emerson

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Emerson College

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
He just got a job at Telltale Games

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Out in San Rafael

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
He's going to be

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Being the new build engineer

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
For all the Sam & Max episodes

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
From this point

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Once he starts there from this point forward

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And I believe he starts next week or

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Didn't we see

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Something a while back about

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sam & Max they were trying to hire people

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
To port it to Xbox Live or something

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
There was a job posting on the internet

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Did your friend get that job?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Kinda?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Something like it?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Interesting

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
He will have to come on the show later if he can

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
There might be NDA's at the wazoo

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Get your friend to come

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
To our show because Sam & Max is pretty cool

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Also

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Part B tonight we're bringing back an old favorite

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
We're going to play some match game

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
In Part B tonight

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So that means we need to get some contestants during the break

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So we'll take one on the skype line later

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Don't call yet, we'll take one on the skype line

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
We have to do the game, but we need a chat room contestant

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
So to find a chat room contestant we always

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Ask a trivia question live here on the program

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Here is tonight's trivia question

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
We're going to be talking about

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
A new game in Part B

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Tonight called Rock Band

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Of course a lot of you guys have heard about this

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But Rock Band was not the first game

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That would allow you to put together a full band

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
There was actually an arcade series

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And I know a lot of you folks that have listened to this program

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
For a long time now

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know these games very well

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
There used to be three games

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
That would all session together

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
To form your own band

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So you could play games at the arcade

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Name them

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
First folks to send that will draw a random name out of the hat

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Send a message to Sky in the chat room

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
With the name of the three games

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
To form your own band with in the arcade previously

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It can all be made

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Alright so we're going to take a break

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And we'll see you guys in Part B
