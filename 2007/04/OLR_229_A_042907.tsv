14434	23751	Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive, the PlayStation is set to get an eye, is Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?
31923	36104	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36144	41166	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41246	42546	My name is Rob Roberts.
42626	46928	Joining me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47188	47828	I have pitas.
48428	48848	Pitas.
49268	49548	Yum.
50529	52209	You're eating a salad thingy from Quiznos?
52229	53129	From Quiznos.
53369	53670	I like it.
53690	58471	This show is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi.
59691	60572	Quiznos is pretty good stuff.
60592	61252	I like their salads.
62202	62963	I love the Food Network.
63323	69590	I would say Diet Wild Cherry.
69991	72693	I mean, it's not very wild if it's diet.
73294	75677	Yeah, but if you read the ingredients, it is pretty wild.
77399	79381	Sucralose and whatever else is in the...
80274	82336	What is that, aspartame or sucralose that sweetens that?
82356	84017	This would be aspartame.
84037	85137	You know what, no one really gives a shit.
85858	94724	Let's see, also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before, and that's something else, because usually it's the same old freaking people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station.
95168	95228	O.L.R.
95248	95408	Listener
125455	131279	Probably two or more years ago, it was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts.
131720	131920	Right.
132060	136823	I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio, let's look for all the good radio shows.
137044	137564	Right, cool.
137724	140666	And then I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one.
140686	141247	Awesome.
141267	141727	Because I liked it.
141967	142307	Sucker.
142668	142848	Yeah.
143048	143308	Alright.
143528	144029	So that's a good time.
144169	145830	But now you're here, where were you living before?
146090	151134	So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college, but I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here.
151502	153864	Soundless Obispo is not that far from here.
153884	155725	It's about a four or five hour drive.
156045	157166	Five or six, depending on how you drive.
158607	159388	I'm a conservative.
159808	160709	Okay, cool.
160929	163411	But now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool.
163591	163951	Well, very cool.
163971	164492	Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
164532	165152	Thank you for having me.
165312	165953	No problem.
166153	167214	We like having new people.
167734	169115	Especially guests that bring their own mics.
169396	169616	Yeah.
169816	170657	So that's kind of neat.
170677	171677	Let's see how this one would work.
171797	173218	This mic, this guy brought us more...
174139	178262	Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet.
204126	211310	Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system.
212210	213211	I like it because it's black.
215192	217513	And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace.
217993	219734	Once you go black, you never go back.
220374	220775	Mm-hmm.
222275	222596	Anyway.
222816	224957	Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white.
226698	231140	My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive.
231638	234580	Which is going to be loaded up with... Not porn.
236301	237022	Did you see that?
237062	238543	She totally was saying porn.
238603	240064	Not porn.
240764	242625	You can't see it if you're not in studio.
242645	244226	That wasn't even an intentional mistake.
246768	252752	At any rate... Yaoi is still porn, you do realize, right?
253512	254913	I'm not going to put Yaoi on it.
255454	257615	Yuri is still porn, you do realize, right?
257635	258716	I'm not going to put Yuri on it.
258736	258916	Okay.
261072	264275	I'm gonna put lots of, you know, doujinshi, though.
264315	266938	Quick side track, because we're talking about replacement hard drives now.
266978	269360	Loki, you're like a cracking type person.
269700	272963	Could she take, like, a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?
273084	273484	Uh, no.
275085	276427	Do I want to?
277288	277708	Do I care?
277848	278289	Why not?
278409	278849	Extreme porn.
278889	280711	Because each drive has, like, a special...
282671	284553	Model Number, Serial Number, something.
284613	291299	They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120, and it only works with one type of hard drive.
291459	291739	I see.
291879	294301	But you can save like $100 doing it that way.
294922	295242	Interesting.
296206	310389	Yeah, I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over at Microsoft, the key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace, even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console.
310409	310769	But forget it.
311089	313209	If you want to be even better, 11 times better.
313409	314270	How about my gaming week?
314430	315890	Porn downloads.
317090	317590	Porn downloads.
317610	318851	What, your gaming week was porn downloads?
319071	320211	No, Rob, I wasn't finished.
320311	321191	Oh, all right, go ahead.
321861	327062	Um, I, um, found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents, which she got me, is a paid account for Guild Wars.
327622	328883	So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars.
330423	335724	I think she tricked you, because you know that Guild Wars, all you have to do is buy the game, and there's no... I know, but I only had a trial.
336044	336464	Ah, okay.
337124	342266	Like, I, because I never, you know, bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it.
342606	343166	Well, that's cool.
343766	343906	Yep.
345246	348467	So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?
350852	351693	in 10 years, yeah.
351853	352193	Oh, okay.
352213	356014	Then again, I did spend, you know, at least the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online.
356955	357155	So.
357755	358015	All right.
358275	358435	Yeah.
358695	359016	Is that it?
359836	360476	Yes, Rob.
360536	360836	You sure?
362117	362717	You sure you're sure?
362737	364638	I thought I peed at you in a second.
365078	366138	Loki, how was your gaming week?
367399	371401	All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017.
371621	373061	That was it.
374682	375062	That's it?
375362	377323	But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017.
377363	377783	I've finished...
380114	381376	Normal and easy.
382037	382878	Working through hard.
383339	385502	Playing some of the Inferno levels to get more weapons.
386062	387424	Although that hasn't been going too well.
387725	389827	And then... I don't know.
390028	392030	Pretty soon we're going to start playing some more Crackdown.
393693	395335	Because we're going to land two systems at work.
396011	424697	and get another copy of that and then that'll be fun so for some co-op and hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out and since Saints Row just dropped in price we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through like podcasts like you I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2
425635	427217	Stored neatly on the hard drive.
428739	431082	But that game actually looks better than this one.
431743	433545	Because I think this is just a remake of the first one.
434206	435708	Is that game really good?
435828	437631	I want to buy it, but I don't know.
438271	441315	It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun.
441335	442357	Okay.
442377	442557	Okay.
443024	445585	Well, our chat room seems to think that it's a good game.
445605	449166	We have SSJ100Matt says, Earth Defense Force equals next-gen body harvest.
449766	452927	Deekman says, Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome.
453627	456388	DarkTetsuya says, is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?
457428	458008	D3?
458208	458428	No.
459568	460929	No, I'm not on their payroll.
461109	466930	If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple Series in the U.S., hell yeah, I'll take them.
467171	468851	They can thank you by translating more of them.
469403	477089	I mean, seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword.
478471	480733	I mean... I want that game.
480753	481693	What was that sound?
481733	482834	Did somebody get a boner?
482874	483675	What was that noise?
483695	485396	No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner.
485416	486017	You got a boner?
487258	488139	Yes, Rob.
488219	490100	She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap.
492843	495405	It was just a badly timed clink noise.
495805	496686	Shut up, I'm eating my chicken.
499195	500276	Better Than Eating Your Fish.
500916	510943	I hope they do put out a sequel, though, because if they remake the second one, or even just do a new one that's, you know, got some better enemies in it and stuff, hell, you could just do the same damn storyline.
510963	513065	It doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline.
513605	514966	It's just blowing shit up.
515066	515526	That's it.
515807	521050	You can level the entire city and just come back to the next level, or if you play the level over again.
521210	523472	Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?
524393	526514	They have a gun in there called the Genocide Gun.
526534	527695	Isn't that that Hulk game?
529033	529313	What?
529573	529893	No.
530133	531674	No, that was Ultimate Destruction.
531834	534995	They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game.
535715	538096	Press A button, blow shit up.
538296	540817	I mean, it would sell trillions of copies.
541217	542358	WarioWare Genocide.
542638	544919	Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force.
544959	546119	I mean, because that's all you're doing.
546159	549100	Your mission is like, okay, we need to destroy the ants.
549300	551201	Okay, now we need to destroy the robots.
551321	553422	Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants.
553762	554662	That's every level.
554702	556783	It's no rescuing, no nothing.
556863	557163	It's just...
557890	558891	We're in a different location.
558951	559832	Let's blow shit up.
559892	560732	We're in a different location.
560772	561573	Let's blow shit up.
561713	563014	Oh, there's a giant thing.
563234	563795	Blow it up.
564215	565757	You know, oh, we can't blow it up.
565917	566217	Run.
566497	567978	I mean, that's it.
568159	570380	You can, like I said, you can level everything.
571361	573643	Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob.
573663	573943	I don't know.
574304	577286	Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made, though.
577306	578807	It's so boring.
578887	586754	I know, like, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series because of the fact, you know, like, hee-hee, you can play monsters and eat people and stuff, but
587102	591383	Seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous freaking gameplay I've ever played.
591824	595605	And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested.
596745	597545	It's like SNK.
601027	602287	I love Metal Slug, shut up!
603527	605068	Alright, I like Samurai Shodown.
605348	607289	Anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?
608909	614091	Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer.
614451	614911	Gotta love it.
615336	619739	They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories.
620080	623222	Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy.
623502	626164	I was playing the other day, and my car wasn't visible.
626284	630408	It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air.
631568	632689	That's pretty awesome, actually.
632749	633950	But like, it's ridiculous.
633970	641336	There's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome, where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle.
641932	646154	or like Fat Air where your kernel just stops like it hits something but there's nothing there.
647154	647735	Weird stuff.
648035	649575	We could write a book about this crap.
650636	653497	Alright, well I'm looking at that chat room at chat.orangelandreda.com.
653537	657159	Remember we do tape live on Sunday nights and solicit your feedback here in chat.
657619	658940	DDRDollarBill agrees with me.
658980	662801	Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels and after that ZZZZZ.
662841	663842	There's no ending.
664582	664802	True.
665943	668064	I played a game on Nintendo that was like that.
668624	669984	It was only interesting for two levels.
670505	671065	Mag Max.
672931	673672	Mad Max?
673752	674513	Mag Max.
674533	675293	Oh, Mag Max.
675313	677776	I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia.
678116	678296	Okay.
678316	678917	Mag Max.
679017	679577	Mag Max.
679617	680578	I've never even heard of that.
681098	688865	It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it, and I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks.
689586	692469	There were some pretty god-awful NES games.
692489	695151	Actually, Mad Max was one, too.
695932	699595	Oh, man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories.
701162	702483	You guys are hardcore.
702983	705824	We were trying to beat the level with the sheep, and we couldn't do it.
707204	711386	There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day.
711486	712326	Don't laugh, okay?
712726	714107	It was a Color Dreams game.
714147	715227	Let's start with that, okay?
715666	719727	and the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who.
720188	724749	And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life.
724989	729611	I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?
730071	731171	I remember one time when...
733578	736459	I don't remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games.
736479	738320	I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue.
740041	741081	Not because it's good.
741402	744023	Not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge.
744323	745143	That might be cool.
745563	745944	I don't know.
746404	755328	Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like, unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh Tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge?
755348	757889	No, I just, all that happened was it sucked really bad.
758209	759410	I don't even remember what game it was.
759450	762451	Some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap.
763843	764484	All right, anyway, sorry.
764544	765284	Back to the present.
765344	773592	But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and stuff like that, and how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out.
774032	779117	And all you would do is put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there, and it'd glitch out different ways.
779157	782079	It's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out.
782139	783521	Like you were talking to the glitch.
783901	784882	Like, for example, like...
785576	790598	One of our characters, when we were playing two-player co-op, would be running under everything.
791118	798781	It wouldn't actually be running on the layer above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot, but he was running under the world, almost.
799662	807825	You know what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night and pick game genie codes, and then edit them until I came out with interesting results.
808525	812427	Like, I ran around with, I called him Frog Mario, because he would screen.
812447	814988	Isn't that Luigi?
815515	816836	No, he was green in the face.
817016	817156	Okay.
817216	820178	Either that or he was like morning stars.
820299	822120	He was green in the face.
822520	823541	Hold your breath, Mario.
823761	824341	Keep holding it.
825122	825722	No, don't let up.
826603	832828	And like the pillar effect where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen.
833988	834609	It was really weird.
835510	836350	All right.
836390	837711	Anything else for your Gaming Week, Loki?
837731	838392	Back to the present?
839713	839833	No.
840093	840313	All right.
840812	855082	I'll go, speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past like 10 years, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS, because my friend Miklatov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like,
855464	856905	Rob, you want to get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?
856945	857926	Don't you want to get Pokemon Pearl?
857966	858466	Come on!
859067	859948	Come on!
860008	860808	It's got voice chat!
860848	861749	Come on!
861809	863070	We can play over the internet!
863090	863691	Come on!
864151	866413	So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl.
867153	869675	And you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kind of cool.
869715	870716	It actually works pretty well.
871797	880264	But here's the thing is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it, like, what, 12 years ago, whenever the first ones came out?
880544	882265	Those games have not changed at all.
882665	892889	Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom and you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever.
892949	896150	But essentially the battle system is the same freaking thing.
896370	906094	And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like, Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes, it's like the sounds they all make.
906593	907294	Right?
907314	909816	They all make these horrendous little blips and blops.
909836	914540	Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there.
914580	914980	I guess so.
915000	916201	There's no room for them.
917623	922887	You'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system.
922987	924548	That's what some of the Pokemon make.
924568	927871	They make these god-awful noises.
927891	929713	They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls.
929733	933136	They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water.
933796	934417	Now fight for me.
935512	936252	Come on, you little bitch.
936393	936993	What's wrong with you?
938234	940455	He said there, Shut up and fight.
940495	942336	You don't fight, you go back in the ball.
942376	944718	No ball, no ball.
945918	950681	Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die.
950962	953503	Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint.
954204	954504	Okay.
955504	956565	Follow me with this, okay?
956585	958386	This is going to go on a weird tangent.
958406	958686	Okay.
959247	964550	But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know...
966064	967185	Evolve it into Pokemon.
967205	973829	Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball.
974029	975190	That attack you in the wild.
975230	976331	Yeah, that attack you in the wild.
976351	977552	Stick them in a cardboard box.
978072	984977	All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all, and get them to fight each other.
985337	988459	And then Nintendo can put it out and everybody be, you know, accepting of it.
990240	993202	Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw it up.
993581	1003750	Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years, I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS, and it's, it's, it's fun.
1004010	1004850	I'm having a good time with it.
1004931	1008934	Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff?
1008954	1013438	Like, for example, let's add voiceover IP chat to Pokemon.
1013758	1015359	Uh, why?
1015439	1017201	I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, uh...
1018311	1020873	I don't know, I'm going to add GPS to Metroid.
1020933	1023556	I mean, it's just, why do we need that?
1023696	1024777	That would actually be really cool.
1025638	1037623	Well, it's actually kind of cool because now I kind of use it as a phone, but it's kind of a pain to set it up because you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on instant messenger.
1037923	1043126	Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now, and then I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well.
1043426	1044826	And that's how you set it up.
1044927	1048728	I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's going to be on.
1049088	1052830	I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected to,
1053451	1055533	Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy.
1055634	1056735	Where's the fun in that?
1067907	1074111	These crap Pokemon for really good Pokemon, because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care.
1074652	1079955	And I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names, like it's cool to have English names, I guess.
1080435	1087420	So if you want my Pokemon, because I named my Pokemon really dumb stuff, like I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokemon?
1087460	1088601	I think I named him Muffins.
1090462	1091803	And I named them all cute things.
1093444	1095966	Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles.
1096806	1098827	and FancyPants is one that my friend has.
1098847	1103810	So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokemon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess.
1104431	1106232	So, that's something I've been playing.
1106272	1109774	I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download.
1110074	1113436	I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live.
1113536	1114437	It's epic Pinball.
1114987	1137039	No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables, that was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables, but the physics and everything else of the game, I mean, is really good, and, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views, and it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer, and they definitely built it to be expandable, like, they're gonna have new tables for download later on, let's just see how much they're gonna charge us for them, hopefully it's not too bad, but...
1137563	1138244	We shall see.
1139004	1140785	I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks.
1140825	1142747	Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot.
1143047	1147570	Because since I was gone pretty much all last week, I had Rest Bar for like a level and a half.
1147970	1153554	And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin.
1153974	1155315	Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.
1155735	1157476	Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?
1157637	1159098	My gaming week was pitiful.
1159498	1162680	I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could.
1163100	1164201	Tried to play Frequency, but
1164687	1169392	That's on a blue PS2 CD, and my drive is dying and can't play those.
1169852	1172174	So I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphid.
1172194	1174677	I'd like to play Sylphid, oh, that's on a blue disc too.
1174817	1176339	So I said, okay, screw this.
1176959	1183185	So I went over to my new Commodore, and I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission I was given to work.
1183446	1184166	That doesn't work either.
1185127	1186949	So I said, screw it, and went back to Guitar Hero.
1188351	1188791	So boring.
1190646	1193428	Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on Commodore 64?
1193488	1195290	Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago.
1195310	1199313	That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing.
1199553	1200854	But you haven't gotten anything to work on it.
1200874	1203957	Well, I've gotten, oh, what game did I get to work on that?
1204237	1209662	I got The Hobbit to work on it, which is, well, it's a text adventure and I didn't really have the time to put in for one.
1209702	1212023	I wanted an action game, although I did go on GameTap.
1212124	1212524	I take it back.
1212564	1217408	I went on GameTap, which I downloaded on a whim recently and played that Commodore breakdancing game.
1218241	1219122	Break-in or whatever it's called.
1219142	1220104	Have you played that thing?
1220404	1221365	I did for a little bit.
1221405	1222847	Like Simon says, play DDR.
1222907	1227473	Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64 meets like Bust a Crap.
1228414	1229555	That's what that game was.
1229575	1230837	That game was so terrible.
1230897	1231558	Bust a Crap.
1231618	1232098	So bad.
1232118	1233340	But yeah, that was my gaming week.
1233760	1236864	Mostly Guitar Hero and yeah, Guitar Hero.
1236884	1237645	Alright, very cool.
1238467	1242788	All right, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news.
1243729	1246089	Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week.
1246509	1251831	You know, Jamie and I were on vacation, and even before we went on vacation, I was out of town for most of the week.
1251871	1255392	So we were so behind on gaming news that it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show.
1255732	1260254	And we really actually didn't even get home from the trip until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night.
1260514	1262194	I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back.
1262614	1267416	But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter.
1268152	1276575	at Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there because Peter's been listening to the show and knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks.
1276955	1277355	Yeah.
1277415	1281276	Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there and give us the hookup and all that stuff.
1281316	1282596	So thanks, dude.
1283797	1285197	And I hope to see you again.
1285477	1293620	And we'll hopefully maybe in future weeks give the OLR listeners a little more warning when we're going to Disneyland next time and maybe do a little meetup there or something because that would be fun.
1293640	1294840	We could all ride pirates together.
1295683	1296163	Yo-ho, yo-ho
1320840	1324824	They have Jack Sparrow in it, which of course gives everybody this big fangasm.
1325245	1327187	I think it changed for the better.
1327207	1330390	There were two series of changes before this, I think.
1330490	1332072	They tried to make the write-all PC.
1332132	1333173	Oh, the politically correct version.
1333213	1337178	And then people bitched, so they tried to ease it through.
1338590	1349519	Like, I don't know, okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate was sitting down by the barrel, and this girl would come out of it and say, you know, he wanted the girl too, and she was hiding in the barrel behind him.
1349920	1355405	And then they changed it to something else, like she had something, and then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel.
1356105	1357867	But I like at the end when he's there singing.
1358767	1361690	Oh yeah, I like that too, where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever.
1362110	1364332	I don't call him Jack Sparrow, I call him Johnny Depp, just because.
1364372	1365013	Yeah.
1365767	1368348	And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion.
1368428	1371768	Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years.
1371848	1374769	You didn't get to see it with the old bride's attic.
1375489	1378209	No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight.
1378229	1379490	Rob had to be escorted off the ride.
1379510	1385691	Yes, when I was eight years old, I had to be escorted off the ride because I screamed my head off because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride.
1386511	1389452	There are no windows and no doors.
1389692	1390112	And I'm like...
1394394	1396175	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1424161	1425062	Hmm.
1425102	1427503	Like seven days for the price of four at a discount.
1427563	1428244	Seven days.
1447640	1472827	Run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor Which is a Disney version of the Haunted Mansion Which is actually cooler than ours And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad And you can actually kind of run those I actually played the Phantom Manor one And that was kind of fun It looks very similar to like I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride By the way, all the rides go faster at night
1473291	1476134	Yeah, I was going to say, in this simulator, do the rides go faster at night?
1476174	1476854	That's what I want to know.
1476994	1477495	I don't think so.
1478356	1481599	That actually is our in-joke, but it's really true on a lot of the rides.
1483020	1484121	It's totally true.
1484141	1485222	The rides do go faster at night.
1485622	1486983	The teacups go really fast at night.
1487043	1490667	All right, look, we've got to save this for another podcast, so we need to get into some gaming news.
1490727	1496612	Since we did miss last week, Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week since we didn't have a show.
1496692	1497153	Sorry, kids.
1497653	1497913	Okay.
1498794	1499755	Anyways, real quick.
1500140	1503522	There's a few things that were getting updated, a few systems.
1503862	1512668	For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update, including some wonderful games being added to it, like Mercenaries.
1513128	1517912	Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there.
1519533	1521574	Return to Castle Wolfenstein, I guess, is pretty cool.
1522474	1525697	And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, Soul Calibur II.
1527507	1529168	and... let's see here.
1529568	1530488	Oh, this is kind of neat.
1530548	1531729	Guilty Gear Isuka.
1532929	1534270	So, lots of fun stuff there.
1535590	1537291	And, oh, Jet Set Radio Future.
1537331	1538031	How could I forget that?
1538311	1543013	So, Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list, but the combo disc is not on the list.
1543934	1544514	Riddle me that one.
1546595	1547255	It might work, though.
1547755	1548215	No, it doesn't.
1548255	1548755	People tried it.
1549136	1549556	Oh, okay.
1549576	1550376	Well, then, that sucks.
1550736	1550916	Yeah.
1551576	1552837	Way to do your research, Loki.
1553437	1554238	It was on our own forums.
1554958	1555458	Just kidding.
1555478	1555538	Man.
1556314	1582815	Anyways, um, another thing, or another system that's getting an update, actually, the PlayStation 3, and they went to firmware 1.7, and that allows you now to be able to play PlayStation 1 games on the PlayStation 3, because there was all those PlayStation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP, but you had to have a, you know, PS3 to download them, which is retarded in itself, but now you can actually use that to play those games, so, hooray.
1582835	1582875	Um,
1584935	1594940	Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the virtual console.
1595220	1604924	Originally, they thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters, but right now it hasn't been determined yet what will be available and when.
1605325	1607105	But they are coming, so that's good.
1608166	1611628	And then, of course, this was also interesting, Konami...
1613052	1620153	has decided to close its Redwood City office and move everything to the LA offices.
1620714	1624714	So no more Northern California Gamers Day, unfortunately.
1625414	1634416	Which is kind of interesting because DarkSakura and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit last week on our way to Disneyland, which is the first time I'd actually been there.
1634796	1636517	It's in a really nice area, though.
1636957	1639497	That business complex area, it's with the river going through and everything.
1640758	1642838	They're probably having to move because rent's really big over there.
1643277	1643978	I wouldn't doubt it.
1644678	1645399	It's the Bay Area.
1645599	1648421	And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick.
1648841	1652264	Just real quick mentions, Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced.
1652324	1652724	Yes!
1653024	1656207	Using the House of the Dead 3 engine, so that's kind of exciting.
1656807	1669437	And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man, they're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships, in which you'll be able to be crowned, I guess, the Pac-Man World Champion.
1669884	1671505	and receive a custom... Yippee!
1671966	1672726	Wait, here's the prizes.
1672746	1689300	You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360, 100,000 Microsoft points, which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple Guitar Hero 2 songs, and 26 years of one free Quiznos subs a week.
1691302	1698287	Okay, and then apparently... Wait, 26 years of a free Quiznos sub a week?
1698548	1698768	Yes.
1701024	1702685	Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?
1702705	1703465	Just like my dinner.
1721240	1723281	Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest, DarkSakura?
1723301	1724861	Probably not.
1724941	1725842	I suck at Pac-Man.
1725902	1732084	If you're interested in joining, go to XboxLiveTournament.com to register.
1733904	1734184	That's it.
1734665	1736565	Alright, well thank you for the wrap-up on last week's news.
1736825	1740727	It is very much appreciated, since we were too lazy to do a show last week.
1741087	1741567	So, thank you.
1742267	1746169	Alright, now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week.
1746749	1747409	Making things current.
1748192	1751296	and this week's news, I was awesome, as usual.
1751416	1751777	No, really.
1753539	1754500	April fools!
1754860	1756082	Hey, Rob, shut up.
1756262	1756883	It's almost May.
1757303	1757944	Seriously.
1759186	1762329	Well, in response to the demand for...
1763303	1771125	The Wii, Nintendo has promised to increase production so that they can meet the demand that's out there for it.
1771725	1782128	They said that they were producing 1 million units per month and are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity so they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year.
1783208	1783788	So yeah.
1783888	1784348	Wii!
1785088	1787189	So now you might actually be able to find one, correct?
1788143	1793147	Well, so far to date, 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far.
1793907	1794248	Dang.
1795508	1799972	Which, actually, didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?
1801133	1801733	I don't remember.
1801813	1806657	Too many numbers with these sales things, and then they always change, especially over at the Sony camp.
1806697	1808798	It was like, we're going to have a million out by the end of the year.
1808818	1809679	We're going to eat crayons.
1810039	1810359	Shipped.
1810720	1811000	Shipped.
1811480	1812081	Yeah, shipped.
1812941	1813722	No, no, we meant shipped.
1813742	1813882	Shipped.
1815588	1817190	Do we say by the end of the year?
1817230	1818031	We meant by the end of April.
1818051	1820474	We meant ten boxes put together in the shape of a ship.
1820734	1822276	We said year, we meant fiscal year.
1822976	1824558	We said year, we meant fiscal year.
1824618	1826220	The new year doesn't start until we say it does.
1826380	1827522	We use the lunar calendar.
1828351	1831772	So I can't follow all this stupid, you know, goals and sales stuff.
1831832	1846378	I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need to ramp up production, seeing as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now, and it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff, and now there's Wiis available?
1846838	1849520	Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything?
1849840	1850640	Hmm, yeah.
1851140	1853061	I'm sure they're ramping up production.
1853421	1855622	Yep, that's really what's going on.
1855882	1858444	Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1859084	1862827	Well, one thing that's also a conspiracy is where the hell are the games?
1863467	1873974	I mean, we had Super Paper Mario came out recently, and, um, well, Kororimpa, I guess?
1874715	1878437	No, there was WarioWare and Wii Play.
1879338	1882080	Like four months ago, but what's come out in like the past month?
1882340	1882840	Not a lot.
1882980	1885182	Wii Play, I'm sure, didn't take much to, you know,
1886280	1886800	E3 Tech Demos
1906013	1910435	45 of them are in development for the Wii, 79 in development for the DS.
1910495	1913056	And you might be going, well, you know, why is the DS getting all the love?
1913296	1916497	Well, because there's like, what, like 20 million DSs out there?
1916917	1921459	So obviously, you know, it's a very big platform to be developing for.
1921579	1925420	And of course, 45 games just being developed, not being released this year.
1927034	1930897	Well, who knows, because here's a short list of some of the games being developed.
1931217	1932158	Super Smash Bros.
1932238	1942405	Brawl, The Legend of Zelda on the DS, Phantom Hourglass, Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS, Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii, Metroid and all that fun stuff.
1942685	1945667	Project Hammer and all those other crappy games.
1945927	1947068	Or Six Sight Truck 2.
1948289	1950351	All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles.
1950571	1952272	I mean, how many other A-list titles are there?
1953762	1954263	I don't know.
1954463	1959787	That's what I was going to say because Nintendo is known for only putting out one, two really big name games a year.
1959867	1962789	So yeah, they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years.
1963649	1967092	But also that's them that they have in development too.
1967112	1969634	All those games are what Nintendo has in-house developing.
1969934	1972015	Mario Party 8 and so on and so on.
1972396	1980161	But outside, that's not counting what Konami's got in development, what Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff.
1980201	1982223	So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too.
1983620	2009257	Cooking Mama 2 Revenge of the Horrible Translation Stop porting DS games to the Wii It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom chat.orangeonsradio.com reminds us of another story that came up this week I don't think it was on our show roll but Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros.
2009297	2010878	Brawl and apparently it's nearly done
2011454	2016998	According to, I think, some podcast where there was an interview with Kojima, he's actually played it, and it's just about done.
2017378	2023083	I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario because, like, you know, Mario's such a legend.
2024223	2025364	I've lost all respect for him.
2026085	2026765	I know, seriously.
2026845	2027926	It's a fucking game.
2028887	2034111	He makes freaking Metal Gear games, you know, shoot people in the face, and then it's like, oh, but I can't punch Mario.
2035332	2036492	I can't punch a fat plumber.
2036512	2036953	Yeah.
2038274	2042957	I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute and he says, oh, no, I just can't punch Mario.
2042997	2044979	Five seconds later, die, you little plummy.
2045179	2047140	I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit.
2047160	2053324	He's like, yeah, you know, oh, I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him because, you know, I loved Mario growing up.
2053784	2057026	But then after I got past that, it was fucking on.
2057146	2059208	I owned the crap out of Iwata.
2059428	2062270	Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels.
2062510	2065912	TheRobD says, Cooking Mama 2, Mama teaches you poison.
2067120	2070962	and Sakuramax says, Cooking Mama 2, Cooking Drugs.
2073243	2076925	Mama's crack house.
2077025	2079086	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
2079126	2080186	Mama will give you your fix.
2082968	2086349	Win.
2086449	2092152	Or even better, it's like Mama's son or whatever accidentally kills one of his friends or something.
2092352	2093893	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
2094113	2096614	We're going to chop the body up and put it in the food.
2098035	2098917	We'll hide that.
2099778	2100640	No one will notice.
2102142	2102483	Anywho.
2103344	2104066	Turkey surprise.
2105319	2114705	So apparently Square Enix has said that there will not be any of their games coming to at least a Japanese virtual console.
2114825	2116325	At least that's what's kind of hinted.
2116646	2117126	Lies!
2117466	2118287	I think so too.
2118567	2122289	They're saying that we feel the Japanese market still requires physical media.
2122769	2127452	Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest are played by a wide range of users from children to adults.
2127832	2132755	So limitations when you consider a problem that we would have with billing systems.
2133374	2133714	Actraiser?
2133734	2134035	Actraiser.
2154465	2156367	Square Enix made Actraiser.
2156727	2157268	They're Square now.
2157668	2159089	Yeah, that's Square Enix.
2159109	2160510	That would be the Enix in Square Enix.
2160850	2163312	So what do you mean Square Enix games aren't coming to Virtual Console?
2164193	2165294	Actraiser's already there.
2165834	2166394	Let me put it this way.
2166435	2167796	What do you mean it's not in the U.S.?
2167836	2169357	I bought a cartridge of that not long ago.
2169857	2170878	Let me put it this way, okay?
2171618	2178224	To be honest, this is coming originally from an IGN interview with a Square Enix representative.
2179665	2182587	It's actually from, I guess, a magazine, Nintendo Dream or something like that.
2183425	2193540	I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation here because I think what they're talking about is digital downloads in Japan that they aren't going to go to a strictly digital download system or whatever.
2195040	2217914	and it might make sense that they might not put Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever on the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them again I was going to say, that's what it is they're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console they're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2 and 3 and so on on Virtual Console because you stupid Americans will continue to pay $29.99 for the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so awesome, they're so cool
2218720	2220542	But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console because of that.
2220962	2222103	I think that's the reason, yeah.
2222624	2228769	But I would say there is still hope for Illusion of Gaia and Soul Blazers and all those other old school Enix games at least.
2229249	2234454	I don't know about Chrono Trigger because they'll probably do an advanced version of that at some point.
2234474	2242101	I will bet you money that there will be a PSP version of Chrono Trigger sometime in the near future because they love...
2243084	2245246	Releasing, re-releases and stuff.
2245266	2246627	Is this something in your database?
2246847	2259376	No, this is purely speculation because they're, I mean, what, they're doing Star Ocean, you know, they're supposed to be a new Star Ocean game, which I do believe we did see a little movie for it a couple years ago at E3.
2259436	2268123	I could have sworn there was, it was just like that, remember that other, there was like another game series that they were teasing too that I haven't seen anything on, like the
2269547	2274350	Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into the Square Enix movie room and you saw all the movies?
2275010	2279792	Literally every single freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy game, and then like, oh, and Star Ocean.
2280152	2281833	Yeah, yeah, it was something like that.
2283054	2295259	I know that there's been a trailer, because like I said, there was some other game series that they're doing that's supposed to be mobile, PlayStation 2, and I think maybe PSP or something that they haven't released yet that's going to be coming out.
2295280	2296320	I don't know.
2297197	2302080	Uh, DDR Dollar Bill says if they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger, it better be that fucking good.
2302481	2305222	I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it and damage it.
2306383	2308605	Oh, he's letting his, uh, fucking thoughts be known there.
2308745	2309105	Fuck.
2309145	2310946	Such overuse of the F word there.
2311126	2311747	What, the fuck word?
2311767	2312147	Rawr!
2313108	2314308	See, it's because, you know why?
2314348	2316630	It's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy.
2316830	2324155	Like, they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger, and like, if you ever try to get in that whole, like, Final Fantasy VI is better than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like, no, it's not!
2326226	2327587	Well, you have to wonder, he said fix.
2327707	2328928	What exactly does fix mean?
2328948	2331349	Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy VII.
2331369	2331970	That's what it was.
2332030	2335792	It was Code Age was the game that they were teasing and stuff.
2335812	2338073	Remember, there's supposed to be three different games in that series.
2338834	2341255	One of them, Code Age Commanders, was supposed to be on PlayStation 2.
2342276	2344077	And I believe, like, the cell phones had another one.
2344097	2345798	It was like Code Age something.
2347579	2349861	God, I don't remember what the other system it was on.
2350201	2350961	Oh, Code Age.
2351482	2352922	Oh, where'd it go?
2352963	2353343	I just saw it.
2353383	2355304	Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one.
2357148	2358189	Thanks for watching!
2377922	2383966	But as far as the Final Fantasy's and Chrono Triggers of the World, I want my goddamn Super Mario RPG!
2384206	2386548	What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?
2386568	2389470	You have to mod your Xbox, which I know you've done, and play it on an emulator.
2389490	2393312	And then you paint your Xbox white, and you call it a Wii.
2395033	2395413	Wii.
2396454	2397655	So anyway, um...
2399722	2402663	Just a little bit of news regarding Tokyo Game Show.
2402944	2405365	Nintendo actually will be a big participant there.
2406365	2413028	This is actually the first time since 1996 that Nintendo's having a booth there, so it's a pretty big deal.
2414689	2419471	But it's supposed to be this massive, massive booth, so I think that's going to be pretty cool.
2421172	2423773	That actually is in relation to Dragon Quest IX.
2425441	2435968	Ah, I see, so Nintendo is always like, oh, we're not gonna go to the Tokyo Game Show, we're not gonna go, but now they have Dragon Quest, they're like, well, we better fucking go, cause, you know, Dragon Quest is, is, you know.
2436128	2439230	Cause Square Enix calls the shots, fuckers.
2439270	2441852	Give me a goddamn Super Mario RPG!
2443913	2444634	Get over it!
2445114	2447776	Dragon Quest IX on the DS is probably the reason for that.
2449137	2453499	So, Loki, since we suck and we're not going to E3, you think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show?
2453519	2453760	Nope.
2453780	2454300	How much is fun?
2454912	2455232	Oh, come on.
2455252	2456093	You don't want to go to Tokyo?
2456113	2456813	Wouldn't that be fun?
2459055	2459575	Right.
2460916	2462317	Because E3 wasn't bad enough.
2462337	2464659	I had to go someplace where I don't understand anything.
2465280	2466180	And he can cosplay.
2467521	2468001	Look at me.
2468062	2469763	I'm stupid American foreigner.
2470083	2470783	Oh, film him.
2470824	2471444	He crazy.
2471864	2472525	No, seriously.
2474006	2476568	I'm just like... No.
2478889	2479170	Wow.
2480030	2480931	I can play DDR.
2480951	2481771	They'd love that.
2481831	2483613	I could be on a variety show or something.
2484679	2489002	AmericanGuyPagey FatWhiteManPlayingDDR So funny!
2489502	2490623	He uncoordinated!
2502057	2506439	Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development for it, what about a keyboard?
2507079	2510641	The latest Game Informer magazine has a little spiel on a Wii keyboard.
2510661	2521265	It says, quote, Nintendo's development team says that it's considering adding a keyboard peripheral to the system in order to make online surfing easier, but it has not officially announced anything at this time.
2521745	2523766	Why would they want to make online surfing easier?
2523786	2526087	They're not making online friend codes easier.
2526227	2528028	Oh, wait, no, friend codes aren't easy, so...
2528931	2531912	Well, what if they put Super Mario RPG in, like, Flash or something?
2531932	2533252	Then you could use your browser to play on the Wii.
2533272	2534512	Eventually the friend code would get to it.
2534892	2536953	Yeah, you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard.
2536973	2541234	So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in your friend codes faster.
2541794	2543055	That's why we're not getting rid of them.
2543315	2548696	Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf the internet faster on the Wii.
2548856	2551457	Go to your PC and surf it there.
2552057	2553257	Put your PC on your Wii.
2553897	2555338	So you're technically surfing it on your Wii.
2555598	2555998	There you go.
2556018	2556758	Science.
2556818	2557118	Science.
2560436	2565178	Yeah, so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard, but I don't see the point unless there's, like, games that start supporting it.
2565198	2565859	Typing of the Dead!
2567099	2567460	Hey.
2568340	2568820	Yeah.
2568900	2569801	That's not going to happen.
2569821	2570541	Typing of the Dead!
2570561	2576644	That would be great if you had a motion-sensing keyboard, and you could actually aim the keyboard, like, and then press the enter key.
2577004	2578565	Try to hit people with a keyboard.
2578605	2579946	You know what they could do, I think, though?
2580706	2581887	That would be rad.
2582067	2583768	They could do the Gun Survivor series.
2585228	2586009	Oh, yeah, they could.
2586449	2586669	On Wii.
2587688	2592551	No, I want a Typing of the Dead 2 where I literally have to pick up my keyboard and smack zombies with it.
2592571	2593752	Now this isn't working!
2595333	2596474	House of the Dead's a light gun game.
2596494	2598315	You've got the pointers on the Wiimotes already.
2598355	2604299	Just plug your keyboard in, the keyboard guy fills up the guy with a pointer with typing energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with.
2604339	2607181	Because everything you have to plug into the Wiimotes anyways.
2607301	2607501	Yeah.
2607561	2612224	Like you have to plug in the classic controller has to be threaded through your Wiimote and all the enhancements.
2612506	2617130	So this keyboard's probably going to have to plug into the Wii Remote so you have this big thing dangling there off your keyboard.
2617150	2621994	There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wiimote to the keyboard, so you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing.
2622115	2622495	Beautiful.
2622515	2626559	You've got a keyboard in your lap, you're trying to shift your waist around to point at the different places on the screen.
2626579	2627199	You just put it on your head.
2628160	2628760	Move your head around.
2629421	2629841	That's a good idea.
2629861	2632344	What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?
2634145	2634846	Do you remember that, Rob?
2635667	2635947	I know.
2636414	2644600	They had this Atari controller back in the day that was trying to be like the ESP controller, but really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way.
2647582	2649283	Trying to distract you when you were playing E.T.
2649303	2650063	from how bad it was.
2651624	2651824	What?
2653145	2653966	I'll try to find it.
2655367	2661251	Little do the listeners know that DarkSakura's Folgers coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD.
2663792	2666214	It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway.
2667020	2669441	I thought that you, with your gaming knowledge, would know this, Rob.
2669461	2670141	You disappoint me.
2671201	2672962	You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?
2673922	2674523	Adventure.
2675123	2681345	And there was no eye-wiggling or nose-twitching, I-dream-of-genie motions going on in that game.
2681425	2685586	No, you were Yellow Block versus squiggly thing called a dragon.
2685606	2687047	Mind Link Controller, that was it.
2689332	2691093	Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out.
2691113	2692233	It's Bewitched Technology.
2692313	2694394	No, it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one.
2694434	2695014	I found it.
2695194	2695715	Oh, good job.
2696115	2697695	I'm missing the Wikipedia link now.
2697835	2699436	Go on with your bad Wikipedia self.
2699756	2702777	Mix that thing with that Amiga lapboard controllers you had to do that.
2703237	2703897	Do you know about that one?
2704518	2706518	That yoga or the what was it?
2707238	2708759	The Zen Guru Master Game?
2709619	2716542	It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch so if you tilted too far to the left or right you broke your concentration and the game failed you.
2717222	2717602	You were a
2718223	2719144	Disappointed Guru.
2721145	2724769	We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night.
2725509	2727271	Some of these games sound really awful.
2727651	2730073	We should have the most frustrating game challenge.
2730093	2734257	Dude, let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Breakdance game.
2735978	2737439	I have a Sega Activator.
2737459	2737920	Yeah, me too.
2737940	2738620	Let's do it.
2738740	2740402	Or play anything with the Power Glove.
2740622	2741022	Anything.
2743184	2744425	The Power Glove was a piece of shit.
2745026	2745286	Alright.
2745546	2746006	Anyways, um,
2747967	2755912	So yeah, apparently Time Magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people.
2757413	2770402	Because yeah, he's done a lot of things, including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong, Zelda, the Wii, all that fun stuff.
2770462	2773584	Yeah, I just think they have to do this because it's a new game console.
2773604	2777226	It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that.
2777708	2778889	You know, this is a gimme.
2780069	2791176	You know, I actually looked at the results the other day, and Miyamoto was, like, number two on this little user poll, because, like, they have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential, and I believe he was, like, number two.
2791797	2800342	And I think, like, Perez Hilton was number five, so he's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that.
2800362	2804204	They should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel thing.
2806880	2807961	Who's more influential?
2808621	2808962	Purple!
2811043	2812044	Or pink, or whatever.
2812084	2813025	No, that was Paris Hilton.
2814786	2816748	I need to check the voting channel.
2816768	2822512	I haven't used that channel in a long time, but last time I played it, I remember there was a question, who's going to win American Idol?
2822832	2824714	Melinda Sanjaya.
2825294	2829538	That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel.
2829958	2830879	It's fascinating.
2832520	2835082	They still haven't used any of my submissions, which makes me very sad.
2837991	2840692	I think I submitted a question that said, which is funnier, clowns or rape?
2841032	2842893	But no, I'm just kidding.
2842913	2844073	God, I'm going to get so much hate mail.
2844113	2844374	Please.
2844934	2845514	I was drunk, okay?
2845534	2846915	You're going to get hate mail from clowns.
2846935	2848035	Yeah, I'm going to get hate mail from clowns.
2848275	2848956	I hate clowns.
2849196	2850116	I was drunk, okay?
2850536	2855018	No, but I submitted a serious one that says, which dessert is better, cake or pie?
2855539	2858760	And you know that this is something that needs to be asked of the American public.
2859240	2861081	Because we need to settle this debate once and for all.
2861121	2862562	Because I swear to God, pie is better.
2864077	2867078	We should do one that says, are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?
2867758	2869699	Is the glass half empty or half full?
2870479	2871899	Anyway.
2872180	2873520	Happy, happy day!
2874980	2882343	Ken Kutaragi, he of the crayon eating, bicycle helmet wearing, you know, leash.
2883223	2884803	I want to make more photo shots of that.
2886564	2893486	He who sucks so bad has retired from his position with the PlayStation.
2894534	2896875	But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI.
2898356	2906401	So, everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief, except... Guess what happens when you cut off this head.
2907102	2911224	Another one has regrown in its place in the form of Kazuo Hirai.
2912905	2913926	Kutaragi's a Hydra?
2916027	2916307	Yes.
2916828	2917868	Giant enemy Hydra.
2920750	2922271	Anyways, what's a Nubian?
2922371	2923352	Shut the fuck up!
2924514	2926296	I don't know, I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason.
2926316	2928839	I love that whole scene.
2928999	2930221	What's a Nubian bitch?
2930261	2931442	You almost made me laugh.
2933493	2936694	Anyways, but fear not!
2937314	2945756	Because the craziness at Sony is still not over, you know, Ken may be gone, but their PR department's still there to make a complete ass of themselves.
2946236	2953057	Including such things as the PlayStation 2 launch party for God of War 2 in the UK.
2953578	2959739	They've decided to celebrate this in the non-offensive way at all by offering a decapitated goat...
2961420	2961700	Pita!
2961720	2962921	Didn't you eat pita today?
2962941	2965464	Didn't you eat pita earlier?
2965484	2966284	People eating tasty animals.
2988223	2989404	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3009122	3018026	Yeah, apparently the International Fund for Animal Welfare said it was outrageous that the animals' death had to be used to sell a few computer games.
3019727	3023889	Dude, I dare one of our listeners to email PETA a link to one of these stories.
3024910	3025830	What is their website?
3025870	3027331	PETA2.org or something?
3029092	3033554	I once went out with someone who worked for PETA, and man, they're nuts.
3034114	3037636	So I want to see what happens when they get a hold of this story, just because...
3039036	3039336	I don't know.
3039376	3040017	I'm sick.
3040397	3041378	I have a problem.
3041458	3046143	Like, there's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen when PETA gets a hold of what's going on here.
3046503	3052729	Honestly, I mean, other than the fact that it is kind of cool, though, that they do have, like, you know, topless chicks there.
3053250	3062058	But what PR guy thought it was a great idea to decapitate a goat at a party and have people eat from its entrails?
3062319	3062519	I mean...
3063797	3066419	Maybe they're just trying to stay authentic to Roman culture?
3067019	3070081	Like, I mean, seriously, was some guy like sitting there playing a game or something?
3070422	3072943	Yeah, I need you to prove this PR event info.
3073003	3074905	Yeah, that's good, okay.
3074985	3076085	Back to playing God of War 2.
3077727	3078887	I could play the sex minigame.
3080989	3082350	Maybe it was an animatronic goat.
3083410	3085092	Not judging by the picture on that article.
3085332	3090896	They blurred out the decapitated head that apparently was hanging on by a string still.
3090936	3091056	Ew!
3091296	3091396	Ew!
3093931	3097392	Is that like some type of, you know, ancient Roman custom?
3100374	3101174	They seem to think so.
3101854	3110938	I want to say I was reading some thread about this on the internet and someone came out and said, well, actually, you know, I live with a scholar on Greece and no, they didn't do this at all.
3112659	3113519	So they got it wrong.
3113539	3115420	I have no idea if this is true or not.
3115976	3122719	It says, apparently... Well, dude, I can hear the Sony meeting now when the Angrapedia letters start coming.
3122999	3128021	Whoa, whoa, we read about it on Wikipedia, so it must be true.
3128861	3131583	I mean, what do you mean it didn't decapitate goats in Greece?
3132203	3133143	It was on Wikipedia.
3133163	3136845	Yeah.
3136865	3137045	Yeah.
3137614	3143778	Speaking of things hanging on by a string, Kutaragi may have some hope left in where he can go next.
3143798	3146440	I mean, true, he's going to be on the board at Sony or whatever.
3146840	3152304	But, very interesting, Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment.
3152364	3154525	Of course, Iwata being the president of Nintendo.
3154566	3159289	Iwata stated, quote, they would love to see Kutaragi join up with Nintendo.
3160089	3160710	Yeah, that's going to happen.
3160810	3162591	Doesn't that prospect make you excited?
3163109	3163709	Thank you for watching!
3187226	3200710	I think the rest of the quote was, we'd love to see Kutaragi join up with Nintendo, and then the rest of the quote was, in the available warehouse position that we have, mailing out the Wii's to Best Buys all over the world.
3200830	3202510	Chief Operating Officer of Crayons.
3203310	3204411	Of the Janitorial Department.
3205331	3206651	You realize the acronym for which is kook.
3206731	3212093	Anyway, so moving forward, how about some news that doesn't involve Kutaragi, please?
3212113	3212813	Well, kind of.
3213613	3213853	All right.
3215065	3218167	The PlayStation Store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma.
3219067	3222289	The demo is available here in the U.S.
3223089	3226031	And also a demo for Virtua Tennis is there.
3227131	3227851	So that's pretty cool.
3228952	3235435	Also trailers for Gauntlet 2, The Wheelman, John Woo's Stranglehold, and The Godfather.
3235875	3239197	And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma is set for June.
3240743	3246905	So basically you could sum this whole story up by basically saying PlayStation Network actually gets content.
3248025	3248766	There was Tekken.
3249586	3250146	I guess that's true.
3250306	3250686	There was Tekken.
3250706	3251847	That was only back in February.
3253147	3253647	Tekken.
3253867	3259869	Whereas Xbox 360, hey, to their credit, has upped it to two arcade titles a week recently.
3259969	3262810	So, you know, more than some of us can handle.
3263431	3265511	So there you go.
3265551	3267292	Speaking of stuff coming out soon...
3267728	3273733	We're going to take a look around the world at some various release dates, what's coming up in the near future in some various countries around the world.
3274233	3280398	And during my portion of this segment, I usually talk about what's going on in Japan with the Japanese release dates.
3280498	3281239	And you know what, folks?
3281619	3282900	There's really not a lot.
3283581	3292468	There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii and for the DS, but honestly, game-wise, as far as Japanese release dates go, there's really only like one game coming out.
3293490	3301277	And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS called Osowari Tantai Osowarina, also known as Good Prince.
3301857	3307082	And it's an adventure game coming out from... I'm not sure who actually is putting this out.
3307122	3308423	Success is putting this out.
3309003	3310785	And it doesn't look to be based on an anime game.
3310805	3313027	I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here.
3314868	3319192	Looks to be... Well, very boring, actually, is what the game looks to be.
3319432	3321914	So if you are interested in boring games, check that one out.
3323442	3330787	that's it for Japanese release dates there's really nothing coming out this week over there we want more release dates more MORE
3332162	3335883	It's spelled with an A. I don't have one.
3335983	3341304	Okay, you can get really excited about Face Cover Portable coming out on the Sony PSP.
3341725	3342125	Awesome.
3342205	3344045	In black, blue, pink, and white.
3344125	3345886	That's my favorite game already.
3346006	3347366	Face Cover Portable?
3347526	3348486	Face Cover Portable.
3348526	3353068	You stick the PSP in front of your face and it puts different faces on your face.
3353088	3354168	For a low price of $8.
3354408	3358569	I think it's great that they have a face cover in black when the PSP is black.
3358959	3360040	Oh, it's a system cover, I get it.
3389116	3389676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3407064	3408085	Not too much else coming out.
3408445	3412487	There's the Cube on PSP, which is like a puzzle game.
3413248	3418591	The Ultimate Board Game Collection, which is coming out from... Or it's being distributed through Capcom.
3418611	3422993	It's kind of like a... The Ultimate in Board Games!
3423013	3424234	It's a board game collection.
3424694	3427095	We're gonna fuck you up with some sorry!
3428596	3431918	You can't handle all this clue we got up in here!
3432598	3435020	But here's... I think I'll leave it with the...
3437066	3438326	Some of the best stuff right here.
3438846	3442187	We've got... This Parcheesi's gonna fuck your shit up!
3443107	3447148	On the PC, Fairy Godmother Tycoon is coming out.
3447708	3450489	Once again proving that there are way too many tycoon games.
3451809	3452689	Board game tycoon.
3455690	3455930	Yeah.
3457010	3458210	I don't want to joke you at all.
3459591	3461271	Although I did find the coolest board game today.
3463071	3465112	And apparently it's one that's been out for a while and I just didn't know about it.
3465132	3465392	Anti-Monopoly.
3465432	3465892	Anti-Monopoly.
3466804	3468005	I've never heard of Anti-Monopoly.
3468105	3470466	That's where when you win the game you lose because the government breaks you up?
3471006	3471426	I think so.
3472806	3474647	Anyway, how about some UK release dates?
3475387	3475788	Shall we?
3475808	3476948	In Anti-Monopoly?
3477348	3480650	Like, is there a point to owning Baltic Avenue and Mediterranean?
3481410	3482330	I think it's good PR.
3482590	3482850	I see.
3484211	3484511	Anyway.
3485812	3487652	All these release dates are for the 4th.
3487732	3490734	We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops on PSP.
3491454	3493995	We have Mindy Storm on DS.
3494585	3501548	We have Tony Hawk's Project 8 on PSP, Untold Legends, Dark Kingdom on PlayStation 3, and Final Fantasy 3 for the DS.
3502689	3503169	Yay!
3504370	3505410	Final Fantasy 3 is a good one.
3505830	3506611	Two good games in that.
3506711	3509552	It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out.
3510473	3511813	Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good.
3511833	3513054	Yeah, good stuff.
3513574	3516635	Man, later on though, they're getting some other really good games, like Mario Strikers.
3518556	3519797	Ooh, SpongeBob!
3520137	3523939	Actually, I heard that Strikers really sucks, but you didn't hear that from me.
3525270	3526111	Hey, how about Picross?
3526432	3527313	There you go.
3539335	3546281	and what's interesting is that the ESRB is showing that this game is not just coming out on the Xbox 360, but it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3547322	3557430	Kind of interesting because you've heard about all these, you know, exclusive games going from the PlayStation 3 over to the Xbox 360, but this is one, you know, I think a lot of people were looking forward to that now seems to have gone the other way.
3557791	3567579	Of course, if I recall right, Eternal Sonata was never promised as an exclusive title either way, so it's not like this is like huge, like, OMG, Microsoft got pwned type news, it's just
3567938	3571219	No, it's just, you know, hey, it might be coming out for this other platform as well.
3571879	3576681	And, of course, this would be the one that's based all off, what, Chopin's music or something?
3577581	3577841	I don't know.
3578501	3579022	I think that's right.
3579662	3582643	It looks like an interesting title based on the screenshots.
3582723	3584343	It looks very, like, Final Fantasy-ish.
3585424	3589565	And I like how the characters' names are, like, Polka and Allegretto and all that stuff.
3589585	3590025	That's cute.
3590585	3595767	It's basically about a magical land that when you get terminally...
3597797	3601198	It's like that cloud dream.
3601238	3602999	Wait, so this is Make-A-Wish, the game?
3603259	3604139	Basically, yes.
3605820	3606120	Okay.
3607040	3620886	Anyways, the PlayStation Network is also getting some other interesting games coming out, including a game called Snakeball, which is supposedly the funkiest online sport ever created.
3621466	3622487	Quotes IGN.
3623267	3623347	Um...
3624329	3628950	So no idea what exactly that's going to be, but I don't know, it looks cute I guess.
3629430	3633371	It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there, so that's kind of neat.
3633591	3636532	That's cute, except the game is called Snake Ball.
3636612	3638772	That's just asking for trouble in PR.
3639592	3644013	But anyways, it says... And I believe Snake Ball could be a euphemism for penis.
3645834	3646714	Because there's a snake.
3647205	3647965	and Balls.
3648085	3658467	Snakeball, you I guess are donning your disco shoes and you glide across a dance floor on a hover snake while collecting colored balls to score points.
3659087	3667129	It says other players can rapidly reduce your point tally by flicking you with their tails or blasting you with their weapons.
3667669	3673930	And I guess it's going to support an option to import your face and map it on to stuff.
3674811	3675211	I don't know.
3675471	3676211	Looks okay.
3676271	3676871	It's kind of neat.
3678291	3693975	The other thing that they're going to be getting is a brand new game called Stardust HD, which I guess is a cross between Asteroids and, I guess, since everybody compares games to this, Geometry Wars.
3694555	3697836	So, yet another game where you blow up a lot of shit.
3698376	3700537	I think a game is like Geometry Wars if you shoot stuff.
3701517	3701897	Pretty much.
3702547	3706769	Hostile1 in our chatroom, chat.orangelongerator.com has a comment on the snake balls game.
3706789	3711610	He says, get these motherfucking snake balls off my motherfucking console.
3712931	3713191	Get it?
3713451	3714611	Like snakes on a plane.
3714911	3715131	Get it?
3715511	3716132	Movie sucked.
3716152	3727996	Dude, I love snakes on a plane, but I really liked it just for the situation I saw it in, where me and Megzy and Chris all had stuffed snakes that we picked up at the Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater.
3728476	3729996	I thought you were going to say it was an in-flight movie.
3731037	3731837	That would have been great.
3732062	3732923	Can I touch you?
3733463	3736525	Or will I bleed from your awesomeness?
3737845	3738165	I don't know.
3741687	3742748	I feel like death!
3743508	3744749	I got gay from Rob!
3745209	3746130	It's all over my foot.
3747971	3748451	Alright.
3749112	3750512	DarkSakura, the gay foot.
3751313	3752734	Your legacy will be remembered for years.
3752854	3754254	Oh my god, DarkTensia said touch DS.
3754294	3757656	That was funny.
3758377	3758697	Anyway.
3759818	3761379	So guess what we have.
3761399	3761920	Wait a minute.
3762240	3762720	Wait a minute.
3763401	3766063	Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?
3766183	3767264	It's fucking awesome.
3767324	3769866	I can't stop.
3769906	3777011	I was like touching DarkSakura's foot and I was like hee hee and now I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear I saw Loki like drinking the sauce from McDonald's.
3777031	3779253	I was because it's so tasty.
3779313	3781035	Oh my god, that's nasty.
3781075	3782095	That's like pure, pure fat.
3782115	3783156	It's sweet and sour sauce.
3783196	3784477	I ran out of nuggets.
3786511	3787131	Anyway!
3787251	3799176	Wait, I gotta know, are you one of those people that bitches at the drive-thru because they're like, okay, if you only get six nuggets, you only get one sweet and sour sauce pack, and if you want more, you gotta pay ten cents extra.
3799196	3805338	Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them, apparently?
3805378	3809160	No, two's enough for like a ten-piece nuggets or whatever, but, you know.
3809700	3814302	They gave me three, so what the fuck am I supposed to, I can't just save it for next time.
3815060	3815520	Think about it, Rob.
3815540	3816801	That's like a shot for 10 cents.
3818041	3820442	Dude, I mean, I take syrup shots.
3820482	3821282	I mean, come on.
3821602	3825443	Do you eat the jams at, like, waffle, country waffles and all that stuff, too?
3825463	3825743	Oh, God.
3825943	3826584	I don't like jams.
3826604	3828564	Remember the syrup shots, though, from Roscoe's?
3829044	3830225	Nasty, nasty, nasty.
3830245	3832165	You take syrup shots with everybody, Rob?
3832465	3833766	I'm going to finish drinking this now.
3833786	3834426	I was drunk!
3835266	3835986	At Roscoe's?
3837127	3837367	I don't know.
3837387	3838487	It's just my excuse for everything.
3838627	3839287	Oh, fine.
3839788	3842088	So guess what Sony's giving us, the bastards?
3843229	3843269	Um...
3844605	3845586	Crabs, AIDS.
3846506	3847687	Hot Shots Tennis.
3847887	3848867	Oh, I was going to say shots.
3849207	3852349	You can dress up the little girls in different costumes.
3853670	3854410	That's not very hot.
3855330	3856071	It's Hot Shots.
3856171	3857532	I guess it's supposed to be cute.
3858252	3858652	Yummy.
3860233	3862134	So yeah, Hot Shots Tennis.
3862454	3862834	Yay.
3863174	3863535	Next.
3866156	3868157	I love your reporting, DarkSakura.
3868897	3870798	You don't even bother to give us the details.
3870818	3871999	You're just like, yeah, I'm
3872662	3877749	Sony's making a Hot Shots tennis game, and you can dress chicks up, but this game sucks.
3877769	3881054	I can do that in Dead or Alive, and in this one I get bouncing boobies, so ha.
3883097	3883417	All right.
3884699	3887203	Well, of course, E3 is coming to town.
3887303	3888765	Of course, it's coming to Santa Monica.
3889136	3891617	Where exactly in town, they haven't really said.
3891677	3895239	From what I understand, they've kind of like told people like, okay, be on the street corner.
3895259	3897400	Oh yeah, my invitations at the house, I could have looked there.
3897760	3902763	Yeah, be on the, well, they're going to tell you like, be on the street corner and then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up.
3903183	3906625	And it's like going to a rave, apparently, is what E3 is tuned into.
3906665	3911427	Like, dude, there's going to be like this sweet party at this like vacated airport hangar.
3912017	3912497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3940842	3950411	Now, granted, Sony's on the list, Microsoft's on the list, and Nintendo's on the list, because all the companies that are debuting stuff is a lot of the big, big companies.
3951432	3958679	Basically, Kensha Hall was where 300 of those 400 companies were last year, but it's still kind of surprising there.
3959140	3961242	You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus.
3961482	3962143	I guess not, so...
3963877	3968559	The invitations are down by the way to between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year.
3968579	3968559	60,000!
3968839	3972821	Is one of the companies that's going to have a booth there G4?
3972861	3974542	Because you know they always have a booth.
3974622	3976223	No, G4 is not on the exhibitors list.
3976963	3981185	But they will probably still somehow have like 500 people at E3.
3982185	3983446	All in those ugly shirts.
3985404	3985984	DarkSakura.com
4006604	4010687	Loki and I are sitting here going, God damn, motherfucking E3, I'm not fucking sending this invite.
4010767	4013789	And you're like, oh yeah, I got an invite, just kind of sitting at home.
4014069	4015670	I don't know, I may not go.
4016751	4019593	I actually am putting my focus on my education, so maybe.
4019613	4022015	I don't know, if people want to give me money, I'll go.
4022195	4024216	Because it's kind of expensive to stay down there.
4024537	4026918	I hope you're listening, ESA fuckers.
4027299	4030261	This is who you're inviting, people that don't want to go.
4030781	4033363	I didn't say I don't want to go, I can't afford to go.
4035876	4038718	My name is DarkSakura, a.k.a.
4038738	4041479	Jamie Summers, and I think you should let me into E3.
4041920	4044221	I'm really angry about things!
4044501	4046462	Let me play your game, goddammit!
4046782	4051205	No, no, if they would give me a place to stay, then I would be happy.
4052245	4057068	I'd just wear glasses, do my hair in that little A-style that DarkSakura has hers, and I could sneak in as her.
4058009	4060410	Yeah, but you'd have to... I wanna play your game!
4060430	4061351	Does it have boobs?
4063252	4063612	Whatever.
4065060	4065520	and DarkSakura.
4096508	4099149	DarkSakura, would you care to start us off with the FUs of the week?
4100489	4103070	My FU of the week goes... It's very simple.
4103090	4105030	It goes to stupid drama.
4107791	4110872	And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland on my birthday!
4111352	4112772	Hey, dude, the lines were short.
4113872	4115113	And the teacups were not being opened.
4115373	4116073	That was sad.
4117033	4121774	And, and, and, and, and, and, and... The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain, fuckers!
4123515	4124795	And, and, and, and, and, and, and...
4125814	4126534	Yeah, done.
4127115	4127435	Loki!
4128855	4143702	Uh, fuck you to the dumbass that ran our games at QZAR last night, because you are a dumb fucking... The job, I mean, because I've done the job, it's not that fucking hard, and somehow you've failed at every aspect of it.
4144423	4149485	And, like, when I was playing in front of him, he was, like, mystified, like I was doing magic or something, you know?
4150065	4151446	So how are you doing that?
4152846	4153447	Horrible.
4153727	4154087	Horrible.
4154431	4156512	The QZAR has really gone downhill in Vacaville.
4156552	4157972	All the packs are all fucked up.
4158112	4160013	So, fuck them for screwing that up.
4162254	4169717	I would like to give an F you to Loki's wife, Nelly, for shooting me 58 times in one game at said QZAR because the...
4170390	4198302	Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on the defense shields So she could just shoot me over and over and over and over and over again Which is what she did She just basically held the gun up to my back and kept shooting Because I could not shoot the base Like something was wrong with the base But I had a fun time at laser tag F you to Loki for not opening up his own laser tag arena For being too like I'm gonna go broke Oh wait what's that Oh it's 20 You know 2 million dollars in my ass Wow If only I could do that
4200017	4201478	Get alone or something, I don't know.
4201698	4204039	Rescue us from horrible QZars around the world.
4204920	4206841	Anyway, what else do I have an FU to?
4207361	4207722	I don't know.
4207742	4210423	I guess that's it.
4210523	4211444	Just an FU to Nelly.
4212284	4214526	Warrior Bob, any FUs you have to get off your chest?
4214726	4216407	I'm actually a fairly happy guy.
4216427	4217508	I don't have a whole lot of FUs.
4217548	4222451	So if anything, it's to Sony for the drives not reading blue disks, because that makes me angry.
4223831	4227534	And to Jobs for not being open for me, because I'm unemployed.
4228794	4229635	Unemployment sucks.
4230422	4230942	I'm working on it.
4231162	4232523	I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now.
4232563	4233103	It kind of sucks.
4233664	4234964	Honestly, blue discs make me more angry.
4237425	4240787	You should say an F you to the Rob D for sounding like you.
4241067	4241307	I don't know.
4241327	4241887	It's kind of weird.
4242047	4243228	The Rob D sounds like me?
4243268	4243488	Yes.
4243688	4247490	I don't know if you've ever listened to the This Day in Gaming podcast, but you guys have a very similar voice.
4247550	4248290	It's kind of interesting.
4248390	4249530	I'm going to have to go listen to that now.
4249591	4249731	Yes.
4250471	4251011	It's interesting.
4251031	4251711	It's not a bad thing.
4252092	4254753	He's got a great radio voice, and so do you.
4254793	4255373	Well, thank you very much.
4255513	4257274	I sleep all night, and so I'm totally unconscious.
4257294	4258755	I have no idea what I'm running around doing.
4258775	4259575	Maybe we're the same guy.
4260729	4261129	Maybe.
4261250	4262470	Well, he's in chat right now, though.
4262791	4264152	I don't know if that's possible.
4265853	4270056	Unless you're like that chick on Heroes who can use the internet with her brain or whatever that is.
4270277	4271097	That would be so distracting.
4271157	4272879	No, I am not like the chick on Heroes.
4272979	4282606	Okay, and yeah, that stupid bitch on Heroes fucking A. I sign up for the damn little viral website and she spams me all this shit all the time.
4282926	4288811	Had I known her secret power was spamming people, I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site.
4289031	4289732	There's an F you.
4289892	4292193	F you to freaking Spambots getting into my forums.
4292633	4295635	F you to PHPBB for making it really hard for me to fix that.
4296616	4297677	And F you again to Spambots.
4297697	4298097	Spammer.
4298117	4301579	And the other thing, I hate fucking spam that has to do with the stock market.
4301739	4303180	I don't play the stock market.
4303561	4307503	Why the fuck would I care what companies want me to buy?
4307523	4310025	Amanda sent me the best title, though, from a spam email.
4310645	4311646	You exemplify Carrot.
4313137	4314517	Whatever happened to Spamusement?
4314577	4317238	That was like my favorite online... Have there been updates?
4317258	4321219	That was my favorite online comic anywhere was Spamusement.
4321419	4323920	And they just kind of stopped doing updates.
4325540	4329961	I mean, I realize maybe the guy, like, you know, real life comes first and maybe he had something else he wanted to do.
4330001	4331202	That doesn't make me any less sad.
4331222	4332402	You could just pass it off to somebody.
4332702	4334643	No, the last one was October 20th.
4335823	4336563	That makes me sad.
4336603	4339684	Seriously, if you've never seen Spamusement, go look in the archives.
4340236	4344581	The Older Cartoons at Spamusement.com It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life.
4345623	4346103	It's great.
4347545	4349307	Oh god, some of these are kind of gross.
4349487	4353652	So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out from Mitsubishi.
4353913	4355054	It's a new Docomo.
4356656	4357517	Sounds like Kokomo.
4358041	4369964	Anyways, D904i and apparently it's going to have a motion sensor built into it or I believe there's something about it using its camera to detect motion.
4370404	4382767	Anyways, it's a fucking like Wii phone type thing and you're going to be able to use it to play games and a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it, of course, Katamari Portable and UR Gundam.
4383547	4385468	So, I guess that's neat.
4385988	4386188	But,
4386994	4388374	I hope they don't release them in the U.S.
4388594	4394636	because people have enough trouble driving, let alone playing tilty games on their cell phone.
4395616	4396016	Yeah.
4396116	4397356	Driving while side-talking.
4398476	4400237	You know what, how about just shut up and drive?
4400597	4401117	That's what I vote for.
4401297	4408138	And further proof that Namco intends to just poop all over the Katamari franchise while the creator has gone off to greener pastures.
4408599	4410539	But then you can roll it up and do an even bigger pump.
4411810	4412630	and set it on fire.
4412750	4414971	Roll it up and light it.
4415852	4416612	There we go.
4418153	4420274	New Katamari game, Katamari Weed.
4421454	4422195	Katamari Weed.
4422495	4422715	Wow.
4423311	4445775	Well, anyway, that's going to bring Segment A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here, and we'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio, because as you know, we tape in two... Well, maybe you don't know, because we were gone last week, so maybe you need a little bit of a refresher, but Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves, live on Sunday night, and this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately, and then the second half will follow sometime midweek.
4446115	4449336	So we're going to take a break here, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4449977	4459731	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
