0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey
14000	19000	Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive
19000	21000	The PlayStation is set to get an eye
21000	24000	There's Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade
24000	27000	Orange Lounge Radio
54000	58000	Quizno is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi
85000	90000	Also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before
90000	94000	And that's something else, because usually it's the same old prick of people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station
94000	97000	So we have a brand new person visiting us tonight
97000	104000	And you may recognize his name from various OLR emails and I think maybe phone calls in the past
104000	108000	And now he's here live in studio, which just goes to prove that stalking works
108000	110000	Say hello to Warrior Bob
110000	113000	It does work. Hi everybody. Everybody laugh at the noob
113000	114000	How you doing, noob?
114000	116000	Oh, not too bad, actually
116000	121000	So wait a minute, okay, we gotta figure out, how did you get from OLR listener to now being here in the OLR studio
121000	123000	So when did you first listen to Orange Lounge?
123000	128000	Okay, so I started listening to Orange Lounge probably two or more years ago
128000	131000	It was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts
131000	132000	Right
132000	135000	I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio
135000	137000	Let's look for all the good radio shows
137000	138000	Right, cool
138000	141000	And I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one
141000	142000	Awesome. Sucker
142000	143000	Yeah
143000	144000	Alright
144000	145000	It's a good time
145000	146000	But now you're here, where were you living before?
146000	148000	So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college
148000	149000	Okay
149000	151000	But I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here
151000	155000	San Luis Obispo is like not that far from here, I'll think it's about a four or five hour drive, so
155000	157000	Five, six, depending on how you drive
157000	159000	More for me
159000	160000	More conservative
160000	163000	Okay, cool, okay, so but now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool
163000	164000	Well, very cool
164000	165000	Yeah, it's a lot of fun, thank you for having me
165000	169000	No problem, we like having new people, especially guests that bring their own mics
169000	170000	Yeah, I know
170000	171000	So that's kind of nice
171000	172000	Let's see how this one would work
172000	176000	This mic, this guy brought is like more expensive probably than the three mics we've been using
176000	177000	for the last four years, so
177000	181000	The secret is it was the cheapest mic I could find at the store I bought it from
181000	182000	Where'd you buy it at?
182000	183000	Oh, just a place in San Luis
183000	184000	Oh, well
184000	185000	Alright, well cool
185000	190000	Well, WorryBob will be lending his thoughts and stuff on all the gaming news tonight
190000	194000	But first, we're going to go around and see how everybody's gaming week was in the little bit we call
194000	197000	How was your gaming week, starting off with Dark Sakura?
197000	204000	Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet
204000	212000	Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system
212000	215000	I like it because it's black
215000	218000	And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace
218000	220000	Once you go black, you never go back
220000	222000	Mm-hmm
222000	223000	Anyway
223000	226000	Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white
226000	235000	My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive, which is going to be loaded up with not porn
235000	239000	Did you see that? She totally was saying porn
239000	240000	And you can't see that
240000	241000	Not porn
241000	246000	You can't see it if you're not in studio, but that wasn't even an intentional mistake
246000	250000	At any rate
250000	253000	Yowie is still porn, you do realize, right?
253000	255000	I'm not going to put Yowie on it
255000	257000	Alright
257000	260000	I'm going to put lots of doujinshi, though
260000	263000	Quick sidetrack, because we're talking about replacement hard drives and all that
263000	266000	Loki, you're like a cracking type person
266000	270000	Could she take a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?
270000	272000	Uh, no
272000	273000	Do I want to?
273000	274000	Do I care?
274000	275000	Why not?
275000	281000	You can't see it because the drive has a special model number or serial number or something
281000	285000	They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120
285000	288000	And it only works with one type of hard drive, I see
288000	291000	But you can save 100 bucks doing it that way
291000	292000	Interesting
292000	298000	I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over Microsoft
298000	303000	The key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace
303000	307000	Even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console
307000	308000	But forget it
308000	311000	If you want to be even better, 11 times better
311000	312000	How about my gaming week?
312000	314000	Porn downloads
314000	316000	Porn downloads, what, your gaming week was porn downloads?
316000	318000	No, Rob, I wasn't finished
318000	319000	Alright, go ahead
319000	322000	I found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents
322000	325000	What she got me is a paid account for Guild Wars
325000	327000	So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars
327000	331000	I think she tricked you, because you know that at Guild Wars all you have to do is buy the game
331000	333000	I know, but I only had a trial
333000	334000	Ah, okay
334000	339000	Like, I, because I never bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it
339000	340000	Well, that's cool
340000	341000	Yep
341000	346000	So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?
346000	348000	In ten years, yeah
348000	349000	Oh, okay
349000	353000	Then again, I did spend, you know, the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online
353000	354000	So
354000	355000	Alright
355000	356000	Yeah
356000	357000	Is that it?
357000	358000	Yes, Rob
358000	359000	You sure?
359000	360000	You sure you're sure?
360000	365000	I thought Peter, you had a second
365000	367000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
367000	372000	All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017
372000	374000	That was it
374000	375000	That's it?
375000	378000	But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017
378000	385000	I finished normal and easy, working through hard, playing some of the infernal levels to get more weapons
385000	392000	Although that hasn't been going too well, and then, I don't know, pretty soon I'm going to start playing some more Crackdown
392000	397000	Um, because we're going to land two systems at work and get another copy of that
397000	400000	And then that'll be fun, so for some co-op
400000	405000	And hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out
405000	411000	And since Scenes of the Road just dropped in price, we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe
411000	416000	I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through light podcasts like you
416000	420000	I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing
420000	427000	I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2 stored neatly on the hard drive
427000	431000	But that game actually looks better than this one
431000	434000	Because I think this is just a remake of the first one
434000	438000	Are those games, or is that game really good? I want to buy it, but I don't know
438000	442000	It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun
442000	445000	Okay, well our chat room seems to think that it's a good game
445000	449000	We have SSJ100Matt says Earth Defense Force equals Next Gen Body Harvest
449000	453000	Deakman says Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome
453000	457000	Dar Tetsuya says is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?
457000	461000	D3? No. No, I'm not on their payroll
461000	467000	If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple series in the US, hell yeah, I'll take them
467000	469000	They can thank you by translating more of them
469000	477000	I mean seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword
477000	479000	I mean
479000	481000	I want that game
481000	484000	What was that sound? Did somebody get a boner? What was that noise?
484000	486000	No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner
486000	487000	You got a boner?
487000	488000	Yes, Rob
488000	491000	She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap
491000	495000	It was just a badly timed clink noise
495000	497000	Shut up, I'm eating my chicken
497000	500000	Better than eating your fish
500000	509000	I hope they do put out a sequel though, because if they remake the second one or even just do a new one that's got some better enemies in it and stuff
509000	513000	Hell, you can just do the same damn storyline, doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline
513000	515000	It's just blowing shit up, that's it
515000	519000	You can level the entire city and just come back the next level
519000	521000	Or if you play the level over again
521000	523000	Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?
523000	526000	They have a gun in there called the genocide gun
526000	528000	Isn't that that Hult game?
528000	530000	What? No
530000	532000	No, that was Ultimate Destruction
532000	535000	They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game
535000	538000	Press A button, blow shit up
538000	541000	That would sell trillions of copies
541000	543000	WarioWare genocide
543000	545000	Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force
545000	547000	I mean, because that's all you're doing, your mission
547000	549000	Okay, we need to destroy the ants
549000	551000	Okay, now we need to destroy the robots
551000	553000	Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants
553000	557000	That's every level, it's no rescuing, no nothing
557000	560000	It's just, we're in a different location, let's blow shit up
560000	562000	We're in a different location, let's blow shit up
562000	564000	Oh, there's a giant thing, blow it up
564000	566000	Oh, we can't blow it up, run
566000	568000	I mean, that's it
568000	571000	Like I said, you can level everything
571000	574000	Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob
574000	577000	Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made though
577000	579000	It's so boring
579000	583000	You know, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series
583000	587000	Because of the fact that you can play monsters and eat people and stuff
587000	592000	But seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous game play I've ever played
592000	596000	And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested
596000	599000	It's like SNK
599000	603000	I love Metal Slug, shut up
603000	608000	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?
608000	614000	Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer
614000	616000	Gotta love it
616000	620000	They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories
620000	623000	Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy
623000	626000	I was playing the other day, and my card wasn't visible
626000	631000	It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air
631000	633000	That's pretty awesome, actually
633000	638000	It's ridiculous, there's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome
638000	641000	Where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle
641000	646000	Or like fat air, where your car will just stop like it hit something, but there's nothing there
646000	648000	Weird stuff
648000	650000	If I could write a book about this crap
650000	653000	Alright, well I'm looking in the chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com
653000	657000	Remember, we do tape live on Sunday nights, and solicit your feedback here in chat
657000	664000	DDRDollarBill agrees with me, Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels, and after that, ZZZZZ, there's no ending
664000	666000	True, true that
666000	670000	I played a game on Nintendo that was like that, it was only interesting for two levels
670000	672000	Mag Max
672000	674000	Mag Max?
674000	675000	Mag Max
675000	678000	Oh, Mag Max, I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia
678000	679000	Mag Max
679000	681000	Mag Max, I've never even heard of that
681000	685000	It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it
685000	689000	And I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks
689000	693000	There were some pretty god-awful NES games, actually Mad Max
693000	694000	Bible Stories
694000	695000	Was one too
695000	700000	Oh man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories
700000	702000	You guys are hardcore
702000	706000	We were trying to beat the level with this sheep, and we couldn't do it
706000	712000	There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day, don't laugh, okay?
712000	715000	It was a Color Dreams game, let's start with that, okay?
715000	720000	And the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who
720000	725000	And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life
725000	730000	I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?
730000	736000	I remember one time when, I remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games
736000	739000	And I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue
739000	744000	Not because it's good, not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge
744000	746000	That might be cool, I don't know
746000	750000	Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like
750000	755000	Unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge
755000	758000	No, all that happened was it sucked really bad
758000	763000	I don't even remember what game it was, some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap
763000	765000	Alright, anyway, sorry, back to the present
765000	770000	But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and, like, stuff like that
770000	774000	And how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out
774000	778000	And, like, all you would do is, like, put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there
778000	782000	And it'd glitch out different ways, it's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out
782000	784000	Like you were talking to the glitch
784000	788000	Like, for example, like, one of our characters when we were playing two-player co-op
788000	791000	Would be running under everything
791000	796000	It wouldn't actually be running on the lair above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot
796000	799000	But he was running under the world, almost
799000	803000	You know, what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night
803000	805000	And pick, um, game genie codes
805000	808000	And then edit them until I came out with interesting results
808000	811000	Like, I ran around with, um, I called him Frog Mario
811000	814000	Cause he would screen
814000	815000	Isn't that Luigi?
815000	817000	No, he was green in the face
817000	818000	Okay
818000	822000	Either that or he was, like, morning green in the face
822000	825000	Hold your breath, Mario, keep holding it
825000	826000	No, don't let up
826000	829000	And, like, the pillar effect
829000	833000	Where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen
833000	835000	That was really weird
835000	836000	Alright
836000	839000	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki, back to the present?
839000	840000	Uh, no
840000	841000	Alright, I'll go
841000	844000	Speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past, like, ten years
844000	848000	Uh, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS
848000	852000	Cause my friend, you know, Miklotov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is
852000	855000	Uh, he has, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like
855000	857000	Rob, you wanna get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?
857000	859000	Don't you wanna get Pokemon Pearl? Come on!
859000	862000	Come on! It's got voice chat, come on!
862000	864000	We can play over the internet, come on!
864000	867000	So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl
867000	871000	Uh, and you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kinda cool, it actually works pretty well
871000	878000	Um, but here's the thing, is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it
878000	880000	Like, what, twelve years ago, whenever the first ones came out?
880000	882000	Those games have not changed at all!
882000	887000	Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom
887000	893000	And you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever
893000	896000	But essentially, the battle system is the same freaking thing
896000	901000	And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like
901000	903000	Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes
903000	904000	EEE-EE-EE-EE
904000	907000	It's like the sounds they all make, right?
907000	910000	Like, they all make these, like, horrendous little blips and blops noise
910000	915000	Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there
915000	916000	I guess so
916000	917000	No room for them
917000	922000	So you'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system
922000	923000	EEE-EE-EE
923000	927000	That's like what some of the Pokemon make, they make these, like, god-awful noises
927000	930000	They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls
930000	933000	They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water
933000	935000	Now fight for me
935000	937000	Come on, you little bitch, what's wrong with you?
937000	939000	He's sitting there, EEE-EE-EE-EE
939000	940000	Shut up and fight
940000	942000	You don't fight, you go back in the ball
942000	945000	You want no ball, no ball
945000	951000	Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die
951000	954000	Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint
954000	959000	Okay, follow me with this, okay? This is gonna go on a weird tangent
959000	967000	But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know, evolving into Pokemon
967000	974000	Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball
974000	975000	That attack you in the wild
975000	976000	Yeah, attack you in the wild
976000	978000	Stick them in a cardboard box
978000	983000	All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all
983000	985000	And get them to fight each other
985000	989000	And then Nintendo could put it out and everybody would be, you know, accepting of it
990000	993000	Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw you up
993000	994000	Oh, yeah
994000	999000	Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years
999000	1004000	I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS and it's, it's, it's fun
1004000	1005000	I'm having a good time with it
1005000	1009000	Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff
1009000	1014000	Like, for example, let's add voice over IP chat to Pokemon
1015000	1021000	Why? I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, I don't know, I'm gonna add GPS to Metroid
1021000	1024000	I mean, it's just, why do we need that?
1024000	1025000	That would actually be really cool
1025000	1029000	Well, it's actually kind of cool because, like, now I kind of use it as a phone
1029000	1032000	But it's, excuse me, it's kind of a pain to set it up
1032000	1038000	Because, you know, you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on Instant Messenger
1038000	1043000	Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now and then I go, you know, I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well
1043000	1045000	And all that, and that's how you set it up
1045000	1049000	I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's gonna be on
1049000	1054000	I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected, you know what I mean?
1054000	1057000	Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy, where's the fun in that?
1057000	1059000	I guess not, so
1059000	1065000	But the other interesting thing that Wi-Fi is doing is that now that you have this global trading network
1065000	1070000	Is that, you know, you can trade these crap Pokémon for really good Pokémon
1070000	1074000	Because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care
1074000	1078000	And, I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names
1078000	1080000	Like, it's cool to have English names, I guess
1080000	1084000	So, if you want my Pokémon, because I named my Pokémon really dumb stuff
1084000	1087000	Like, I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokémon?
1087000	1089000	I think I named him Muffins
1090000	1092000	And I named them all cute things
1093000	1096000	Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles
1096000	1099000	And Fancy Pants is one that my friend has
1099000	1104000	So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokémon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess
1104000	1106000	So, that's something I've been playing
1106000	1110000	I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download
1110000	1113000	I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live
1113000	1115000	Is it Epic Pinball?
1115000	1118000	No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables
1118000	1120000	That was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables
1120000	1123000	But, the physics and everything else with the game, I mean, is really good
1123000	1126000	And, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views
1126000	1128000	And it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer
1128000	1131000	And they definitely build it to be expandable
1131000	1134000	Like, they're going to have new tables for download later on
1134000	1136000	Let's just see how much they're going to charge us for them
1136000	1139000	Hopefully it's not too bad, but we shall see
1139000	1141000	I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks
1141000	1143000	Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot
1143000	1145000	Because since I was gone pretty much all last week
1145000	1148000	I had rest bar for like a level and a half
1148000	1154000	And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so, you know, I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin
1154000	1156000	Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd
1156000	1158000	Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?
1158000	1160000	My gaming week was pitiful
1160000	1163000	I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could
1163000	1167000	Tried to play Frequency, but that's on a blue PS2 CD
1167000	1170000	And my drive is dying and can't play those
1170000	1173000	And I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphied, I'd like to play Sylphied
1173000	1174000	Oh, that's on a blue disc too
1174000	1175000	Sylphied
1175000	1177000	So I said, okay, screw this
1177000	1179000	So I went over to my new Commodore
1179000	1183000	And I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission that was given to work
1183000	1185000	That doesn't work either
1185000	1188000	So I said screw it and went back to Guitar Hero
1188000	1190000	So boring
1190000	1193000	Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on a Commodore 64?
1193000	1195000	Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago
1195000	1199000	That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing
1199000	1201000	But you haven't gotten anything to work on it
1201000	1203000	Well, I've gotten...
1203000	1204000	Oh, what game did I get to work on that?
1204000	1206000	I got The Hobbit to work on it
1206000	1208000	Which is, well, it's a text adventure
1208000	1210000	And I didn't really have the time to put in for one
1210000	1211000	I wanted an action game
1211000	1212000	Although I did go on GameTap
1212000	1213000	I took it back, I went on GameTap
1213000	1215000	Which I downloaded on a whim recently
1215000	1218000	And played that Commodore breakdancing game
1218000	1219000	Break-in or whatever it's called
1219000	1220000	Have you played that thing?
1220000	1221000	I did for a little bit
1221000	1223000	It's like Simon Says Play DDR
1223000	1226000	Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64
1226000	1229000	It meets Busta Crap
1229000	1231000	That game was so terrible
1231000	1232000	Busta Crap
1232000	1233000	So bad
1233000	1234000	But yeah, that was my gaming week
1234000	1235000	Mostly Guitar Hero
1235000	1237000	Yeah, Guitar Hero
1237000	1238000	Alright, very cool
1238000	1243000	Alright, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news
1243000	1246000	Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week
1246000	1248000	Jamie and I were on vacation
1248000	1250000	And even before we went on vacation
1250000	1252000	I was out of town for most of the week
1252000	1254000	So we were so behind on gaming news
1254000	1255000	That it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show
1255000	1256000	And we didn't even
1256000	1258000	We really actually didn't even get home from the trip
1258000	1260000	Until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night
1260000	1262000	I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back
1262000	1267000	But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter
1267000	1271000	At Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there
1271000	1273000	Because Peter's been listening to the show
1273000	1276000	And knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks
1276000	1277000	Yeah
1277000	1279000	Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there
1279000	1281000	And give us the hookup and all that stuff
1281000	1283000	So thanks, dude
1283000	1285000	And hope to see you again
1285000	1287000	And we'll hopefully, maybe in future weeks
1287000	1289000	Give the OLR listeners a little more warning
1289000	1291000	When we're going to Disneyland next time
1291000	1293000	And maybe do a little meet up there or something
1293000	1294000	Because that'll be fun
1294000	1295000	We could all ride pirates together
1295000	1297000	And sing along with it
1297000	1298000	Yeah, exactly
1298000	1300000	Because that won't annoy the other people in the boat to hell or anything
1300000	1303000	The drunken sorority girls were funny
1303000	1304000	Oh yeah, the drunken sorority
1304000	1305000	In the boat ahead of us
1305000	1307000	I kept expecting one to fall in
1307000	1309000	Didn't the one girl go like, I love you
1309000	1311000	At me or something
1311000	1312000	How were the changes
1312000	1314000	I was doing that to Barbossa
1314000	1315000	The changes on pirates?
1315000	1317000	Yeah, I still haven't seen it yet
1317000	1318000	It's, you know, they
1318000	1319000	YouTube
1319000	1322000	It's, they have Jack Sparrow in it
1322000	1325000	Which of course gives everybody this big fan-gasm
1325000	1327000	I think it changed for the better
1327000	1329000	There were two series of changes
1329000	1330000	Before this, I think
1330000	1332000	They tried to make the ride all PC
1332000	1333000	Oh, the politically correct version
1333000	1334000	And then people bitched
1334000	1338000	So they tried to ease it through
1338000	1339000	Like, I don't know
1339000	1342000	Okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate
1342000	1344000	Would sit down by the barrel
1344000	1346000	And this girl would come out of it and say
1346000	1347000	You know, he wanted the girl too
1347000	1349000	When she was hiding in the barrel behind him
1349000	1351000	And then they changed it to something else
1351000	1352000	Like she had something
1352000	1355000	And then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel
1355000	1358000	But I like at the end when he's there singing
1358000	1359000	Oh yeah, I like that too
1359000	1361000	Where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever
1361000	1362000	I don't call him Jack Sparrow
1362000	1363000	I call him Johnny Depp
1363000	1364000	Just because
1364000	1365000	Well
1365000	1366000	It was really cool
1366000	1368000	And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion
1368000	1371000	Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years
1371000	1373000	Oh, you didn't get to see it when they had the
1373000	1375000	With the old bride's attic
1375000	1378000	No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight
1378000	1379000	Rob had to be escorted off the ride
1379000	1380000	Yes, when I was eight years old
1380000	1381000	I had to be escorted off the ride
1381000	1382000	Because I screamed my head off
1382000	1386000	Because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride
1386000	1389000	There are no windows and no doors
1389000	1390000	And I'm like
1390000	1392000	Ah ha ha ha!
1392000	1394000	Ah ha ha ha!
1394000	1396000	Yes, I seriously thought I was going to die
1396000	1399000	You do everything and you look up and there's the skeleton hanging from the noose
1399000	1401000	It was horrible for a kid
1401000	1403000	You see all the pictures of the dead people
1403000	1405000	Anyway, sorry, this isn't the Disneyland podcast
1405000	1407000	I love the Disneyland podcast
1407000	1408000	We had a good time
1408000	1412000	But there are, you know, sometimes there's Disney games and stuff, right?
1412000	1416000	Like I remember on the NES there was that horrible Adventures in the Magic Kingdom game
1416000	1417000	Or Kingdom Hearts
1417000	1419000	Well, there's that Meteos game
1419000	1424000	I found out also though that I can get like an Uber discount through work for Disney World
1424000	1425000	Hmm
1425000	1427000	Like seven days for the price of four at a discount
1427000	1428000	Seven days
1428000	1432000	There are also some pretty cool Flash games you can play
1432000	1436000	In case you wanted to know what it's like to be a Disney employee
1436000	1441000	They have at the website sims.themagical.nl
1441000	1446000	And you can check out, they've got four different simulator rides on there
1446000	1450000	You can run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor
1450000	1452000	Which is your Disney version of the Haunted Mansion
1452000	1454000	Which is actually cooler than ours
1454000	1458000	And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad
1458000	1460000	And you can actually kind of run those
1460000	1462000	I actually played the Phantom Manor one
1462000	1463000	And that was kind of fun
1463000	1466000	It was, you know, looks very similar to like
1466000	1470000	You know, I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride
1470000	1473000	By the way, all the rides go faster at night
1473000	1476000	Yeah, I was going to say in this simulator do the rides go faster at night
1476000	1477000	That's what I want to know
1477000	1478000	I don't think so
1478000	1479000	That actually is our end joke
1479000	1480000	Loose
1480000	1482000	But it's really true on a lot of the rides
1482000	1483000	It's totally true
1483000	1484000	The rides do go faster at night
1484000	1485000	Anyway
1485000	1486000	The teacups go really fast at night
1486000	1488000	Alright, look, we've got to save this for another podcast
1488000	1490000	So we need to get into some gaming news
1490000	1491000	Since we did miss last week
1491000	1495000	Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week
1495000	1496000	Since we didn't have a show
1496000	1497000	Sorry kids
1497000	1498000	Okay
1498000	1499000	Anyways, real quick
1499000	1502000	There's a few things that were getting updated
1502000	1503000	A few systems
1503000	1507000	For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update
1507000	1510000	Including some wonderful games being added to it
1510000	1513000	Like Mercenaries
1513000	1519000	Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there
1519000	1522000	Turn to Castle Wolfenstein I guess is pretty cool
1522000	1524000	And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection
1524000	1526000	Soul Calibur 2
1526000	1529000	And let's see here
1529000	1530000	This is kind of neat
1530000	1532000	Guilty Gear Iseka
1532000	1535000	So lots of fun stuff there
1535000	1537000	And Jet Set Radio Future
1537000	1538000	How could I forget that?
1538000	1541000	So Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list
1541000	1543000	But the combo disc is not on the list
1543000	1546000	Riddle me that one
1546000	1547000	It might work though
1547000	1548000	No, it doesn't
1548000	1549000	People tried it
1549000	1550000	Oh, okay, well then that sucks
1550000	1551000	Yeah
1551000	1553000	Way to do your research, Loki
1553000	1554000	It was on our own forums
1554000	1556000	Just kidding
1556000	1557000	Anyways
1557000	1558000	Another thing
1558000	1560000	Or another system that was getting an update
1560000	1561000	Actually the Playstation 3
1561000	1563000	And they went to firmware 1.7
1563000	1568000	And that allows you now to be able to play Playstation 1 games on the Playstation 3
1568000	1573000	Because there was all those Playstation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP
1573000	1576000	But you had to have a PS3 to download them
1576000	1578000	Which is retarded in itself
1578000	1581000	But now you can actually use that to play those games
1581000	1583000	So, hooray
1583000	1587000	Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here
1587000	1592000	Is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console
1592000	1595000	And according
1595000	1599000	Originally they were thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters
1599000	1602000	But right now it hasn't been determined yet
1602000	1605000	What will be available and when
1605000	1606000	But they are coming
1606000	1607000	So that's good
1607000	1609000	And then of course
1609000	1611000	This was also interesting
1611000	1616000	Konami has decided to close its Redwood City office
1616000	1620000	And move everything to the LA offices
1620000	1625000	So no more Northern California Gamers Day unfortunately
1625000	1627000	Which is kind of interesting
1627000	1630000	Because Dark Soccer and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit
1630000	1632000	Last week on our way to Disneyland
1632000	1634000	Which is the first time I've actually been there
1634000	1636000	It's in a really nice area though
1636000	1638000	That business complex area
1638000	1640000	It's like the river going through and everything
1640000	1643000	They're probably having to move because rent is really big over there
1643000	1644000	I wouldn't doubt it
1644000	1645000	It's the Bay Area
1645000	1648000	And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick
1648000	1650000	Just real quick mentions
1650000	1652000	Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced
1652000	1653000	Yes
1653000	1655000	Using the House of the Dead 3 engine
1655000	1656000	So that's kind of exciting
1656000	1659000	And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man
1659000	1663000	They're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships
1663000	1666000	In which you'll be able to
1666000	1669000	Be crowned against the Pac-Man World Champion
1669000	1671000	And receive a custom
1671000	1672000	Yippee
1672000	1673000	Wait here's the prize
1673000	1675000	You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360
1675000	1678000	100,000 Microsoft points
1678000	1681000	Which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple
1681000	1683000	Guitar Hero 2 songs
1683000	1689000	And 26 years of one free Quizno subs a week
1689000	1692000	Okay
1692000	1694000	And then apparently
1694000	1695000	Wait wait
1695000	1698000	26 years of a free Quizno sub a week
1698000	1699000	Yes
1699000	1701000	Jesus
1701000	1703000	Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?
1703000	1704000	I guess
1704000	1706000	So the contest begins April 25th
1706000	1708000	Runs through May 9th
1708000	1710000	And the finalists will be chosen
1710000	1712000	And then they'll officially be on
1712000	1714000	I guess there's some
1714000	1717000	It's being sponsored by Quiznos obviously
1717000	1719000	But I'm going to be kind of interested
1719000	1721000	Just like my dinner
1721000	1723000	Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest to start soccer?
1723000	1725000	Probably not
1725000	1726000	I suck at Pac-Man
1726000	1728000	If you're interested in joining
1728000	1731000	Go to XboxLiveTournament.com
1731000	1733000	To register
1733000	1734000	That's it
1734000	1736000	Alright well thank you for the wrap up on last week's news
1736000	1738000	It is very much appreciated
1738000	1740000	Since we were too lazy to do a show last week
1740000	1742000	So thank you
1742000	1746000	Alright now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week
1746000	1748000	Making things current
1748000	1751000	In this week's news I was awesome as usual
1751000	1752000	No really
1752000	1754000	April fools
1754000	1756000	Hey Rob shut up
1756000	1757000	It's almost May
1757000	1758000	Seriously
1758000	1763000	Well in response to the demand for the Wii
1763000	1767000	Nintendo has promised to increase production
1767000	1771000	So that they can meet the demand that's out there for it
1771000	1775000	They said that they were producing 1 million units per month
1775000	1778000	And are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity
1778000	1782000	So they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year
1782000	1783000	So yeah
1783000	1784000	Wii
1784000	1787000	So now you might actually be able to find one correct?
1787000	1793000	Well so far to date 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far
1793000	1794000	Dang
1794000	1800000	Which actually didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?
1800000	1803000	I don't remember too many numbers with these sales things
1803000	1805000	And then they always change
1805000	1806000	Especially over at the Sony cap
1806000	1808000	It was like we're going to have a million out by the end of the year
1808000	1809000	We're going to eat crayons
1809000	1810000	Shipped
1810000	1811000	Shipped
1811000	1812000	Yeah shipped
1812000	1814000	No no we meant shipped
1814000	1818000	Do we mean did we say by the end of the year we meant by the end of April
1818000	1820000	We meant 10 boxes put together in the shape of a ship
1820000	1822000	When we said year we meant fiscal year
1822000	1824000	When we said year we meant fiscal year
1824000	1826000	The new year doesn't start until we say it does
1826000	1828000	We used the lunar calendar
1828000	1831000	So I can't follow all this stupid you know goals and sales stuff
1831000	1836000	I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need the ramp up production
1836000	1840000	Seen as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now
1840000	1845000	And it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff
1845000	1847000	And now there's Wiis available
1847000	1850000	Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything
1850000	1851000	Hmm yeah
1851000	1853000	I'm sure they're ramping up production
1853000	1856000	Yep that's really what's going on
1856000	1859000	Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio
1859000	1863000	Well one thing that's also conspiracy is where the hell are the games
1863000	1864000	I mean we had
1864000	1865000	I ate them
1865000	1868000	We had Super Paper Mario came out recently
1868000	1872000	And um well
1872000	1874000	Kororimpa I guess
1874000	1876000	No there was
1876000	1877000	No there's been
1877000	1879000	WarioWare and Wii Play
1879000	1882000	Like four months ago but what's come out in like the past month
1882000	1883000	Not a lot
1883000	1886000	Wii Play I'm sure didn't take much so you know
1886000	1889000	Work to get it finished since they were all the E3 tech demos
1889000	1890000	Well anyway
1890000	1893000	So obviously a lot of folks are asking where's the games
1893000	1896000	And Satoru Iwata said you want games?
1896000	1898000	I'll give you games
1898000	1903000	He said the company is developing 124 games for the Wii and the Nintendo DS
1903000	1905000	Now out of those 124
1905000	1908000	45 of them are in development for the Wii
1908000	1910000	79 in development for the DS
1910000	1913000	So you might be going well you know why is the DS getting all the love
1913000	1916000	Well because there's like what like 20 million DS's out there
1916000	1921000	So obviously you know it's a very big platform to be developing for
1921000	1925000	And of course 45 games just being developed not being released this year
1925000	1931000	Well who knows because here's a short list of some of the games being developed
1931000	1933000	Super Smash Brothers Brawl
1933000	1935000	The Legend of Zelda on the DS
1935000	1936000	Phantom Hourglass
1936000	1938000	Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS
1938000	1940000	Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii
1940000	1942000	You know Metroid and all that fun stuff
1942000	1945000	Project Hammer and all those other crappy games
1945000	1947000	Orzic Sight Truck 2
1947000	1950000	All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles
1950000	1952000	I mean how many other A-list titles are there?
1952000	1954000	I don't know
1954000	1957000	I was going to say because Nintendo's known for only putting out
1957000	1959000	One, two really big name games a year
1959000	1962000	So yeah they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years
1962000	1964000	So that's 10 a year
1964000	1967000	But also that's them that they have in development too
1967000	1969000	All those games are what Nintendo has in house developing
1969000	1972000	Mario Party 8 and so on and so on
1972000	1977000	But outside that's not counting what Konami's got in development
1977000	1980000	What Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff
1980000	1982000	So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too
1982000	1984000	Yeah
1984000	1985000	Cooking Mama 2
1985000	1987000	Revenge of the Horrible Translation
1987000	1989000	Boo
1989000	1992000	Stop porting DS games to the Wii
1992000	1995000	It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS
1995000	1998000	Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii
1998000	2001000	Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom
2001000	2004000	chat.orangelandrater.com reminds us of another story that came up this week
2004000	2006000	I don't think it was on our show roll
2006000	2009000	But Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros. Brawl
2009000	2013000	And apparently it's nearly done according to I think some podcast
2013000	2015000	Where there was an interview with Kojima
2015000	2017000	He's actually played it and it's just about done
2017000	2020000	I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario
2020000	2023000	Because Mario's such a legend
2023000	2025000	I've lost all respect for him
2025000	2027000	I know seriously
2027000	2029000	It's a fighting game
2029000	2031000	He makes freaking Metal Gear games
2031000	2033000	Shoot people in the face and then it's like
2033000	2035000	Oh but I can't punch Mario
2035000	2037000	I can't punch a fat plumber
2037000	2039000	I can't do that
2039000	2041000	I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute
2041000	2043000	And he says oh no I can't punch Mario
2043000	2045000	Five seconds later
2045000	2047000	I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit
2047000	2049000	He's like yeah
2049000	2051000	Oh I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him
2051000	2053000	Because I loved Mario growing up
2053000	2056000	But then after I got past that
2056000	2058000	It was fucking on
2058000	2060000	I owned the crap out of the water
2060000	2062000	Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels
2062000	2064000	TheRobD says Cooking Mama 2
2064000	2066000	Mama teaches You Poison
2066000	2068000	And um
2068000	2070000	Sakura Max says Cooking Mama 2
2070000	2072000	Cooking Drugs
2072000	2074000	Mama's crack house
2076000	2078000	Don't worry
2078000	2080000	Mama will fix it
2080000	2082000	Mama will give you your fix
2082000	2084000	Win
2086000	2088000	Or even better
2088000	2090000	Mama's son or whatever
2090000	2092000	Accidentally kills one of his friends
2092000	2094000	Don't worry Mama will fix it
2094000	2096000	We're going to chop the body up
2096000	2098000	And put it in the food
2098000	2100000	We'll hide that
2100000	2102000	No one will notice
2102000	2104000	Anywho
2104000	2106000	Turkey surprise
2106000	2108000	So apparently Square Enix has said that
2108000	2110000	There will not be any of their games
2110000	2112000	Coming to at least the Japanese
2112000	2114000	Virtual console
2114000	2116000	At least that's what's kind of hinted
2116000	2118000	Lies
2118000	2120000	I think so too
2120000	2122000	They're saying that we feel the Japanese market
2122000	2124000	Is a problem in the media
2124000	2126000	Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest
2126000	2128000	Are played by a wide range of users
2128000	2130000	From children to adults
2130000	2132000	So limitations when you consider a problem
2132000	2134000	That we would have with billing systems
2134000	2136000	Okay
2136000	2138000	That's retarded
2138000	2140000	What game have I been bitching and bitching about
2140000	2142000	That the Japanese have and Europe has
2142000	2144000	But we still don't have
2144000	2146000	What game have I been bitching on this show
2146000	2148000	Oonga Boonga
2148000	2150000	Pop Quiz
2150000	2152000	Actraiser
2152000	2154000	Who made Actraiser
2154000	2156000	Square
2156000	2158000	Enix made Actraiser
2158000	2160000	Square Enix
2160000	2162000	So what do you mean Square Enix
2162000	2164000	Games aren't coming to Virtual Console
2164000	2166000	Actraiser is already there
2166000	2168000	What do you mean it's not in the US
2168000	2170000	I bought a cartridge of that not long ago
2170000	2172000	Let me put it this way okay
2172000	2174000	To be honest this is coming from
2174000	2176000	Originally from an IGN interview
2176000	2178000	With a Square Enix representative
2178000	2180000	And it's actually from
2180000	2182000	I guess a magazine Nintendo Dream
2182000	2184000	Or something like that
2184000	2186000	I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation
2186000	2188000	Here because I think what they're talking about
2188000	2190000	Is digital downloads in Japan
2190000	2192000	That they aren't going to go to a strictly
2192000	2194000	Digital download system or whatever
2194000	2196000	And it might make sense
2196000	2198000	That they might not put like
2198000	2200000	Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever
2200000	2202000	On the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them
2202000	2204000	I was going to say that's what it is
2204000	2206000	They're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console
2206000	2208000	They're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2
2208000	2210000	And 3 and so on
2210000	2212000	On Virtual Console because you stupid Americans
2212000	2214000	Will continue to pay $29.99
2214000	2216000	For the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so
2216000	2218000	Awesome they're so cool
2218000	2220000	But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console
2220000	2222000	Because of that I think that's the reason yeah
2222000	2224000	But I would say there is still hope
2224000	2226000	For Illusion of Gaia and
2226000	2228000	Soul Blazers and all those other old school
2228000	2230000	Enix games at least I don't know about Chrono Trigger
2230000	2232000	Because they'll probably do
2232000	2234000	An advanced version of that at some point
2234000	2236000	I will bet you money
2236000	2238000	That there will be a PSP
2238000	2240000	Version of Chrono Trigger in some time
2240000	2242000	In the near future because they love
2242000	2244000	Releasing
2244000	2246000	Re-releases and stuff
2246000	2248000	Is this something in your database you're just afraid to say something about?
2248000	2250000	This is purely speculation because
2250000	2252000	They're doing Star Ocean
2252000	2254000	They're supposed to be a new Star Ocean
2254000	2256000	Game which I do believe we did see
2256000	2258000	A little movie for it a couple
2258000	2260000	Years ago at E3 I could have sworn
2260000	2262000	It was just like that
2262000	2264000	There was like another game series
2264000	2266000	That they were teasing too that I haven't seen
2266000	2268000	Anything on like
2268000	2270000	The code something or whatever
2270000	2272000	Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into
2272000	2274000	The Square Enix movie room and you saw all the
2274000	2276000	Movies literally every single
2276000	2278000	Freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy
2278000	2280000	Game and then like oh and Star Ocean
2280000	2282000	Yeah it was something like that
2282000	2284000	I know that there has been a trailer
2284000	2286000	Because like I said there was
2286000	2288000	Some other game series that they were doing
2288000	2290000	That were supposed to be mobile, Playstation 2
2290000	2292000	And I think maybe PSP or something
2292000	2294000	That they haven't released yet
2294000	2296000	That's going to be coming out
2296000	2298000	DDRDollarBill says
2298000	2300000	If they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger
2300000	2302000	It better be that fucking good
2302000	2304000	I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it
2304000	2306000	And damage it
2306000	2308000	He's letting his fucking thoughts be known there
2308000	2310000	Such overuse of the F word there
2310000	2312000	What the fuck word?
2312000	2314000	See it's because
2314000	2316000	You know why it's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy
2316000	2318000	Like they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger
2318000	2320000	And if you ever try to
2320000	2322000	Get in that whole Final Fantasy 6 is better
2322000	2324000	Than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like
2324000	2326000	No it's not
2326000	2328000	You have to wonder, he said fix
2328000	2330000	What exactly does fix mean?
2330000	2332000	Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy 7
2332000	2334000	That's what it was, Code Age
2334000	2336000	Was the game that they were teasing and stuff
2336000	2338000	Remember there was supposed to be three different games in that series
2338000	2340000	One of them, Code Age Commanders
2340000	2342000	Was supposed to be on Playstation 2
2342000	2344000	And I believe the cell phones had another one
2344000	2346000	Code Age something
2346000	2348000	I don't remember what the other
2348000	2350000	System it was on
2350000	2352000	Code Age
2352000	2354000	Where'd it go? I just saw it
2354000	2356000	Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one
2356000	2358000	Who cares
2358000	2360000	Alright well
2360000	2362000	Regardless
2362000	2364000	I think it's certainly possible we're going to see
2364000	2366000	At least some of the Enix games show up on Virtual Console
2366000	2368000	Especially because in the case of
2368000	2370000	Illusion of Gaia, Nintendo
2370000	2372000	I think published it
2372000	2374000	Even though Enix made it if I remember right
2374000	2376000	Because there was a strategy guide and everything
2376000	2378000	So I think some of those games are still possible
2378000	2380000	But as far as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Triggers of the world
2380000	2382000	I want my goddamn
2382000	2384000	Super Mario RPG
2384000	2386000	What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?
2386000	2388000	You have to mod your Xbox
2388000	2390000	Which I know you've done and play it on an emulator
2390000	2392000	And then you paint your Xbox white
2392000	2394000	And you call it a Wii
2394000	2396000	Wii
2396000	2398000	Wii
2398000	2400000	So anyway
2400000	2402000	Just a little bit of news
2402000	2404000	For the Tokyo Game Show
2404000	2406000	Nintendo actually will be a big participant there
2406000	2408000	This is actually the first time
2408000	2410000	Since 1996 that
2410000	2412000	Nintendo is having a booth there
2412000	2414000	So it's a pretty big deal
2414000	2416000	But it's supposed to be
2416000	2418000	This massive, massive booth
2418000	2420000	So I think that's going to be pretty cool
2420000	2422000	That actually is in relation to
2422000	2424000	Dragon Quest 9
2424000	2426000	Ah I see
2426000	2428000	So Nintendo is always like
2428000	2430000	Oh we're not going to go to the Tokyo Game Show
2430000	2432000	But now that they have Dragon Quest
2432000	2434000	They're like well we better fucking go
2434000	2436000	Because Dragon Quest is
2436000	2438000	Because Square Enix calls the shots
2438000	2440000	Fuckers
2440000	2442000	Get my goddamn Super Mario RPG
2442000	2444000	Get over it
2444000	2446000	Dragon Quest 9 on the DS
2446000	2448000	Is probably the reason for that
2448000	2450000	So Loki since we suck
2450000	2452000	And we're not going to E3
2452000	2454000	I think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show
2454000	2456000	That might be fun
2456000	2458000	Oh come on you don't want to go to Tokyo?
2458000	2460000	Right
2460000	2462000	Because E3 wasn't bad enough
2462000	2464000	I have to go someplace where I don't understand anything
2464000	2466000	And he can cosplay
2466000	2468000	Look at me
2468000	2470000	I'm stupid American foreigner
2470000	2472000	Oh film him he crazy
2472000	2474000	I mean seriously
2474000	2476000	I'm just like
2476000	2478000	No
2478000	2480000	Wow
2480000	2482000	I can play DDR they'd love that
2482000	2484000	I could be on a variety show or something
2484000	2486000	American guy play DDR
2486000	2488000	That white man playing DDR
2488000	2490000	So funny
2490000	2492000	He uncoordinated
2494000	2496000	You see what happens when we're gone for a week
2496000	2498000	It's just like
2498000	2500000	Man somebody put some drugs in the food
2500000	2502000	Anyhow
2502000	2504000	Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development
2504000	2506000	For it what about a keyboard
2506000	2508000	The latest Game Informer
2508000	2510000	Magazine has a little spiel on a Wii
2510000	2512000	Keyboard it says quote
2512000	2514000	Nintendo's development team says that it's considering
2514000	2516000	A keyboard peripheral to the system
2516000	2518000	In order to make online surfing easier
2518000	2520000	But it has not officially announced
2520000	2522000	Anything at this time
2522000	2524000	Why would they want to make online surfing easier
2524000	2526000	They're not making online friend codes easier
2526000	2528000	Oh wait no friend codes aren't easy so
2528000	2530000	Well what if they put
2530000	2532000	Super Mario RPG in like flash or something
2532000	2534000	Then you could use your browser to play it on the Wii
2534000	2536000	I bet you'd need a friend code to get to it
2536000	2538000	Yeah you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard
2538000	2540000	So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in
2540000	2542000	Your friend codes faster
2542000	2544000	Which is why we're not getting rid of them
2544000	2546000	Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf
2546000	2548000	The internet faster on the Wii
2548000	2550000	Go to your PC
2550000	2552000	And surf it there
2552000	2554000	Put your PC on your Wii
2554000	2556000	So you're technically surfing it on your Wii
2556000	2558000	There you go
2558000	2560000	Science
2560000	2562000	Yeah so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard
2562000	2564000	But I don't see the point unless there's like
2564000	2566000	Games that start supporting it
2566000	2568000	Typing of the Dead
2568000	2570000	Hey
2570000	2572000	Typing of the Dead
2572000	2574000	That would be great if you had a motion sensing keyboard
2574000	2576000	And you could actually aim the keyboard
2576000	2578000	And then press the enter key
2578000	2580000	You know they could do I think though
2580000	2582000	That would be rad
2582000	2584000	They could do the gun survivor series
2584000	2586000	Oh yeah they could
2586000	2588000	On Wii
2588000	2590000	No I want a typing of the dead 2
2590000	2592000	Where I literally have to pick up my keyboard
2592000	2594000	And smack zombies with it
2594000	2596000	That's better
2596000	2598000	House of the Dead is a light gun game
2598000	2600000	You just plug your keyboard in
2600000	2602000	The keyboard guy fills up the guy with the pointer with typing
2602000	2604000	Energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with
2604000	2606000	Because everything you have to plug into
2606000	2608000	The Wii remotes anyways
2608000	2610000	You have to plug in the classic controller
2610000	2612000	Has to be threaded through your Wii remote and all the enhancements
2612000	2614000	So this keyboard is probably going to have to
2614000	2616000	Plug into the Wii remote so you have this big thing
2616000	2618000	Dangling there off your keyboard
2618000	2620000	There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wii mote to the keyboard
2620000	2622000	So you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing
2622000	2624000	Beautiful
2624000	2626000	The keyboard in your lap you're trying to shift your waist around
2626000	2628000	You just put it on your head
2628000	2630000	Move your head around
2630000	2632000	What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?
2632000	2634000	Do you remember that Rob?
2634000	2636000	I know
2636000	2638000	They had this Atari controller back in the day
2638000	2640000	That you would
2640000	2642000	It was trying to be like the ESP controller
2642000	2644000	But really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way
2644000	2650000	Trying to distract you when you were playing ET from how bad it was
2650000	2652000	What?
2652000	2654000	I'll try to find it
2654000	2656000	Little do the listeners know
2656000	2662000	That Dark Sakura's Folgers Coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD
2662000	2666000	It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway
2666000	2668000	I thought that you with your gaming knowledge would know this Rob
2668000	2670000	You disappoint me
2670000	2672000	You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?
2672000	2674000	Adventure
2674000	2676000	And there was no eye wiggling
2676000	2678000	Or nose twitching
2678000	2680000	I dream of genie motions
2680000	2682000	Going on in that game
2682000	2684000	Yellow block vs squiggly thing called the Dragon
2684000	2686000	The Atari Mind Link controller
2686000	2688000	That was it
2688000	2690000	Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out
2690000	2692000	It's Bewitched technology
2692000	2694000	No it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one
2694000	2696000	I found it
2696000	2698000	Put it using the Wikipedia link now
2698000	2700000	Along with your bad Wikipedia self
2700000	2702000	Mix that thing with that Amiga lap board controllers
2702000	2704000	You had to do that
2704000	2706000	Do you know about that one?
2706000	2708000	The Zen Guru Master game
2708000	2712000	It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch
2712000	2714000	So if you tilted too far to the left or right
2714000	2716000	You broke your concentration and the game failed you
2716000	2718000	You were a disappointed guru
2718000	2724000	We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night
2724000	2726000	Some of these games sound really awful
2726000	2730000	We should have the most frustrating game challenge
2730000	2734000	Let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Break Dance game
2734000	2736000	I have a Sega Activator
2736000	2738000	Yeah me too
2738000	2740000	Or play anything with the Power Glove
2740000	2742000	Anything
2742000	2744000	The Power Glove was a piece of shit
2744000	2746000	Anyways
2746000	2756000	Apparently Time magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people
2756000	2766000	He's done a lot of things including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong
2766000	2768000	Zelda
2768000	2770000	The Wii
2770000	2772000	All that fun stuff
2772000	2774000	I think they have to do this because it's a new game console
2774000	2778000	It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that
2778000	2780000	It's just a gamey
2780000	2786000	I actually looked at the results the other day and Miyamoto was number 2 on this little user poll
2786000	2790000	They have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential
2790000	2792000	I believe he was number 2
2792000	2796000	I think Perez Hilton was number 5
2796000	2800000	He's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that
2800000	2804000	You should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel
2804000	2808000	Who's more influential?
2808000	2810000	Purple!
2810000	2812000	Or Pink or whatever
2812000	2814000	No that was Perez Hilton
2814000	2816000	I need to check the voting channel
2816000	2818000	I haven't used that channel in a long time
2818000	2820000	Last time I played it I remembered there was a question
2820000	2822000	Who's going to win American Idol?
2822000	2824000	Melinda Sanjaya
2824000	2830000	That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel
2830000	2832000	It's fascinating
2832000	2834000	They still haven't used any of my submissions
2834000	2836000	This makes me very sad
2836000	2838000	Clowns or rape?
2838000	2840000	I think I submitted a question that said which is funnier clowns or rape?
2840000	2842000	No I'm just kidding
2842000	2844000	I'm going to get so much hate mail
2844000	2846000	I was drunk
2846000	2848000	I'm going to get hate mail from clowns
2848000	2850000	I hate clowns
2850000	2854000	I submitted a serious one that says which dessert is better?
2854000	2856000	Cake or pie?
2856000	2858000	You know this is something that needs to be asked
2858000	2860000	Of the American public
2860000	2862000	We need to settle this debate once and for all
2862000	2864000	I swear to god pie is better
2864000	2868000	I should do one that says are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?
2868000	2870000	Is the glass half empty or half full?
2870000	2872000	Anyway
2872000	2874000	Happy happy day
2874000	2876000	Ken Kutaragi
2876000	2878000	He of the crayon eating
2878000	2880000	Bicycle helmet wearing
2880000	2882000	You know
2882000	2884000	Leash
2884000	2886000	I want to make more further shots of that
2886000	2888000	He who sucks so bad
2888000	2892000	Has retired from his position
2892000	2894000	With the Playstation
2894000	2898000	But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI
2898000	2900000	So
2900000	2902000	Everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief
2902000	2904000	Except
2904000	2906000	Guess what happens when you cut off this head
2906000	2908000	Another one has regrown in its place
2908000	2912000	In the form of Kazuo Hirai
2912000	2914000	Kutaragi is a hydra
2914000	2916000	Yes
2916000	2918000	Giant enemy hydra
2918000	2920000	Anyways
2920000	2922000	What's a Nubian
2922000	2924000	Shut the fuck up
2924000	2926000	I don't know I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason
2926000	2928000	I love that whole scene
2928000	2930000	What's a Nubian
2930000	2932000	Bitch you almost made me laugh
2932000	2934000	Anyways
2934000	2936000	I love
2936000	2938000	But fear not
2938000	2940000	Because the craziness at Sony is still not over
2940000	2942000	Ken may be gone
2942000	2944000	But their PR department is still there
2944000	2946000	To make a complete ass of themselves
2946000	2948000	Including such things as
2948000	2950000	The Playstation 2 launch party
2950000	2952000	For God of War 2
2952000	2954000	In the UK
2954000	2956000	They've decided to celebrate this in the non offensive way
2956000	2958000	At all by offering
2958000	2960000	A decapitated goat
2960000	2962000	Which
2962000	2964000	Guests were invited to
2964000	2966000	Reach in and eat offal
2966000	2968000	From the stomach of the goat
2968000	2970000	Also there were naked chicks there as well
2970000	2972000	So
2972000	2974000	Apparently people are a little pissed off at the fact
2974000	2976000	That there was a decapitated goat there
2976000	2978000	That was still
2978000	2980000	Warm you know
2980000	2982000	PETA
2982000	2984000	Didn't you eat PETA
2984000	2986000	Earlier
2986000	2988000	People eating tasty animals
2988000	2990000	But apparently
2990000	2992000	People were pissed off at this
2992000	2994000	I'm pissed off because I wasn't invited
2994000	2996000	Sounds like fun
2996000	2998000	They had topless girls
2998000	3000000	That were dripping
3000000	3002000	Grapes into guests mouths
3002000	3004000	Male model portraying Kratos
3004000	3006000	And
3006000	3008000	He was handing out garlands
3008000	3010000	Apparently
3010000	3012000	The international fund for
3012000	3014000	Animal welfare said
3014000	3016000	It was outrageous that the animals death
3016000	3018000	Have to be used to sell a few computer games
3018000	3020000	Dude
3020000	3022000	I dare one of our listeners to email
3022000	3024000	PETA a link to one of these stories
3024000	3026000	What is their website?
3026000	3028000	PETA2.org or something
3028000	3030000	I once
3030000	3032000	Went out with someone who worked for PETA
3032000	3034000	And man they're nuts
3034000	3036000	So I want to see what happens when they get
3036000	3038000	A hold of this story
3038000	3040000	I don't know I'm sick
3040000	3042000	I have a problem
3042000	3044000	There's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen
3044000	3046000	When PETA gets a hold of what's going on here
3046000	3048000	Honestly I mean
3048000	3050000	Other than the fact that it is kind of cool though
3050000	3052000	That they do have like you know
3052000	3054000	Topless chicks there
3054000	3056000	But
3056000	3058000	What PR guy thought it was a great idea
3058000	3060000	To decapitate a goat at a party
3060000	3062000	And have people eat from its entrails
3062000	3064000	I mean
3064000	3066000	Who proves this crap?
3066000	3068000	Like I mean seriously was some guy
3068000	3070000	Like sitting there playing a game or something
3070000	3072000	Yeah I need you to prove this
3072000	3074000	PR event info
3074000	3076000	Back to playing God of War 2
3076000	3078000	I could play the sex minigame
3078000	3080000	Maybe it was an animatronic goat
3080000	3082000	Not judging by the picture on that article
3082000	3084000	They blurred out
3084000	3086000	The decapitated goat
3086000	3088000	Blurred out the decapitated head
3088000	3090000	That apparently was hanging on by a string
3090000	3092000	Still
3094000	3096000	Is that like some type of you know
3096000	3098000	Ancient Roman custom?
3100000	3102000	They seem to think so
3102000	3104000	I want to say I was reading some thread about this
3104000	3106000	On the internet and someone came out and said
3106000	3108000	Well actually you know I
3108000	3110000	I live with a scholar on Greece
3110000	3112000	And no they didn't do this at all
3112000	3114000	So they got it wrong
3114000	3116000	I have no idea if this is true or not
3116000	3118000	It says apparently
3118000	3120000	Well dude
3120000	3122000	I can hear the Sony meeting now
3122000	3124000	And the Angra PD letters start coming
3124000	3126000	Whoa we read about it on Wikipedia
3126000	3128000	So it must be true
3128000	3130000	I mean what do you mean
3130000	3132000	They didn't decapitate goats in Greece
3132000	3134000	It was on Wikipedia
3136000	3138000	Yeah
3138000	3140000	Speaking of things hanging on by a string
3140000	3142000	Kudaraki may have some hope left
3142000	3144000	In where he can go next
3144000	3146000	I mean true he's going to be on the board at you know Sony or whatever
3146000	3148000	But
3148000	3150000	Very interesting
3150000	3152000	Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment
3152000	3154000	Of course Iwata being the president of Nintendo
3154000	3156000	Iwata stated quote
3156000	3158000	They would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo
3158000	3160000	Yeah
3160000	3162000	Doesn't that prospect make you excited?
3162000	3164000	Kudaraki would be like
3164000	3166000	We will be producing 10 billion wii's
3166000	3168000	Next week
3168000	3170000	Rob it makes me so excited
3170000	3172000	That I feel irregular
3174000	3176000	Now of course the likelihood of this actually happening
3176000	3178000	Is slim to none
3178000	3180000	Seeing as you know Kudaraki is still on the board
3180000	3182000	Over at Sony Europe
3182000	3184000	And also you notice Iwata didn't say exactly
3184000	3186000	What Kudaraki would do at Nintendo
3186000	3188000	You know
3188000	3190000	I think the rest of the quote
3190000	3192000	The quote was would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo
3192000	3194000	And then the rest of the quote was
3194000	3196000	In the available warehouse position
3196000	3198000	That we have
3198000	3200000	Tailing out the wii's to best buys all over the world
3200000	3202000	They named him chief operating officer of crayons
3202000	3204000	Of the janitorial department
3204000	3206000	You realize the acronym for which is kook
3206000	3208000	Anyway
3208000	3210000	So moving forward
3210000	3212000	How about some news that doesn't involve Kudaraki please
3212000	3214000	Well kind of
3214000	3216000	Alright
3216000	3218000	The Playstation store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma
3218000	3220000	The demo is available
3220000	3222000	Here in the US
3222000	3224000	And also a demo
3224000	3226000	For Virtua Tennis
3226000	3228000	So that's pretty cool
3228000	3230000	Also trailers for
3230000	3232000	Gauntlet 2
3232000	3234000	The Wheelman
3234000	3236000	John Woo's Stranglehold
3236000	3238000	And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma
3238000	3240000	Is set for June
3240000	3242000	So basically you could sum this
3242000	3244000	Whole story up by basically saying
3244000	3246000	Playstation network actually
3246000	3248000	Gets content
3248000	3250000	There was Tekken
3250000	3252000	I guess that's true
3252000	3254000	There was Tekken
3254000	3256000	There was Xbox 360
3256000	3258000	Hey to their credit
3258000	3260000	Has upped it to two arcade titles a week
3260000	3262000	Recently so you know
3262000	3264000	More than some of us can handle
3264000	3266000	So there you go
3266000	3268000	Speaking of stuff coming out soon
3268000	3270000	We're going to take a look around the world
3270000	3272000	At some various release dates
3272000	3274000	What's coming up in the near future in some various countries
3274000	3276000	Around the world
3276000	3278000	And during my portion of this segment
3278000	3280000	I usually talk about what's going on in Japan
3280000	3282000	With the Japanese release dates
3282000	3284000	Really not a lot
3284000	3286000	There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii
3286000	3288000	And for the DS but honestly game wise
3288000	3290000	As far as Japanese release dates go
3290000	3292000	There's really only like one game
3292000	3294000	Coming out
3294000	3296000	And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS
3296000	3298000	Called Osawari Tantai
3298000	3300000	Osawarina
3300000	3302000	Also known as Good Prince
3302000	3304000	And it's an adventure game coming out from
3304000	3306000	I'm not sure who actually
3306000	3308000	Is putting this out
3308000	3310000	Success is putting this out
3310000	3312000	Based on an anime game
3312000	3314000	I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here
3314000	3316000	Looks to be
3316000	3318000	Well very boring actually
3318000	3320000	Is what the game looks to be
3320000	3322000	So if you are interested in boring games check that one out
3322000	3324000	That's it for Japanese release dates
3324000	3326000	There's really nothing coming out this week over there
3326000	3328000	We want more release dates
3328000	3330000	More
3330000	3332000	More
3332000	3334000	Spelled with an A
3334000	3336000	Okay
3336000	3338000	You can get really excited about
3338000	3340000	A face cover portable
3340000	3342000	Coming out on the Sony PSP
3342000	3344000	In black, blue, pink, and white
3344000	3346000	That's my favorite game already
3346000	3348000	Face cover portable
3348000	3350000	You stick the PSP in front of your face
3350000	3352000	And it puts like
3352000	3354000	Different faces on your face
3354000	3356000	I think it's great that they have a face cover
3356000	3358000	In black when the PSP is black
3358000	3360000	Oh it's a system cover
3360000	3362000	I get it
3362000	3364000	Anyways for the US we actually do have some things
3364000	3366000	Coming out
3366000	3368000	There's going to be Spiderman 3 the game
3368000	3370000	Coming out on Friday to coincide with movies
3370000	3372000	Basically on every system
3372000	3374000	In fact the Playstation 3 is getting
3374000	3376000	A special limited edition one as well
3376000	3378000	On the Wii
3378000	3380000	We are also getting Heat Seeker
3380000	3382000	Which is also coming out on Playstation 2
3382000	3384000	As well
3384000	3386000	Also Legend of the Dragon
3386000	3388000	Which is based off some really crappy
3388000	3390000	I guess TV animated series
3390000	3392000	On the Disney channel
3392000	3394000	And it's coming out on the Wii
3394000	3396000	And Playstation 2 as well
3396000	3398000	Also this week though
3398000	3400000	We should be seeing
3400000	3402000	God
3402000	3404000	I want to say
3404000	3406000	There's actually
3406000	3408000	Not too much else coming out
3408000	3410000	There's the cube on
3410000	3412000	PSP which is like a puzzle game
3412000	3414000	The ultimate board game collection
3414000	3416000	Which is coming out from
3416000	3418000	Or it's being distributed through
3418000	3420000	Capcom
3420000	3422000	The ultimate in board games
3422000	3424000	It's a board game collection
3424000	3426000	We're going to fuck you up
3426000	3428000	With some sorry
3428000	3430000	You can't handle
3430000	3432000	All this clue we got up in here
3432000	3434000	But here's
3434000	3436000	I think I'll leave it with the
3436000	3438000	Some of the best stuff right here
3438000	3440000	We've got
3440000	3442000	This part's cheesy
3442000	3444000	On the PC
3444000	3446000	Fairy Godmother Tycoon
3446000	3448000	Is coming out
3448000	3450000	Once again proving that there are way too many
3450000	3452000	Board game tycoon games
3452000	3454000	Board game tycoon
3456000	3458000	Yeah
3458000	3460000	I vote for
3460000	3462000	Although I did find the coolest board game today
3462000	3464000	And apparently it's one that's been out for a while
3464000	3466000	And I just didn't know about it
3466000	3468000	Anti-monopoly
3468000	3470000	I've never heard of anti-monopoly
3470000	3472000	That's why when you win the game you lose
3472000	3474000	Because the government breaks you up
3474000	3476000	I think so
3476000	3478000	Anyway how about some UK release dates
3478000	3480000	That point to owning Baltic Avenue
3480000	3482000	And Mediterranean
3482000	3484000	I think it's good PR
3484000	3486000	Anyway
3486000	3488000	All these release dates are for the 4th
3488000	3490000	We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops
3490000	3492000	On PSP
3492000	3494000	We have Mindy Storm on DS
3494000	3496000	We have Tony Hawk's Project 8
3496000	3498000	On PSP
3498000	3500000	Untold Legends Dark Kingdom on Playstation 3
3500000	3502000	And Final Fantasy 3 for the DS
3502000	3504000	Yay
3504000	3506000	Final Fantasy 3 is a good one
3506000	3508000	There's a lot of good games in that
3508000	3510000	It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out
3510000	3512000	Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good
3512000	3514000	Yeah, good stuff
3514000	3516000	Man later on they're getting some other really good games
3516000	3518000	Like Mario Strikers
3518000	3520000	Ooh Spongebob
3520000	3522000	Actually I heard that Strikers really sucks
3522000	3524000	But you didn't hear that from me
3524000	3526000	Hey how about Picross
3526000	3528000	There you go
3528000	3530000	Alright anyhow
3530000	3532000	Moving on to stuff coming out in the future
3532000	3534000	Eternal Sonata
3534000	3536000	Eternal Sonata of course known as what
3536000	3538000	Trusty Bell over in Japan we're getting
3538000	3540000	Eternal Sonata and what's interesting
3540000	3542000	Is that the ESRB is showing that this game
3542000	3544000	Is not just coming out on the Xbox 360
3544000	3546000	But it's also coming out on the Playstation 3
3546000	3548000	Kind of interesting because
3548000	3550000	You've heard about all these you know exclusive
3550000	3552000	Games going from the Playstation 3
3552000	3554000	Over to the Xbox 360
3554000	3556000	But this is one you know I think a lot of people were looking forward to
3556000	3558000	That now seems to have gone the other way
3558000	3560000	Of course if I recall right Eternal Sonata
3560000	3562000	Was never promised as an exclusive title
3562000	3564000	Either way so it's not like this is like
3564000	3566000	Huge like OMG
3566000	3568000	Microsoft got pwned type news
3568000	3570000	No it's just you know hey it might be coming
3570000	3572000	Out for this other platform as well
3572000	3574000	And of course this would be the one that's what it's based all
3574000	3576000	Off what Chopin's music
3576000	3578000	Or something
3578000	3580000	I think that's right
3580000	3582000	It looks like an interesting title based on the
3582000	3584000	Screenshots it looks very like Final Fantasy
3584000	3586000	Ish and I like how the
3586000	3588000	Characters names are like Polka
3588000	3590000	And Allegretto and all that stuff that's cute
3590000	3592000	It's basically about
3592000	3594000	A magical land that
3594000	3596000	When you get terminally
3596000	3598000	Ill you go to this magical land
3598000	3600000	That's what happens
3600000	3602000	It's like that cloud thing wait so this is
3602000	3604000	Make-A-Wish the game? Basically yes
3604000	3606000	Okay
3606000	3608000	Anyways
3608000	3610000	The Playstation Network is also getting
3610000	3612000	Some other interesting games coming out
3612000	3614000	Including a game
3614000	3616000	Called Snakeball which is supposedly
3616000	3618000	The
3618000	3620000	The funkiest online sport
3620000	3622000	Ever created
3622000	3624000	The quotes IGN
3624000	3626000	So no idea what exactly
3626000	3628000	That's gonna be but
3628000	3630000	I don't know it looks cute I guess
3630000	3632000	It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there
3632000	3634000	So that's kinda neat
3634000	3636000	That's cute except the game is called
3636000	3638000	Snakeball
3638000	3640000	That's just asking for trouble in VR
3640000	3642000	But anyways it says
3642000	3644000	And I believe Snakeball could be a euphemism for
3644000	3646000	Penis
3646000	3648000	Because there's a snake and balls
3648000	3650000	Snakeball you I guess
3650000	3652000	Are donning your disco shoes
3652000	3654000	And you glide across a dance floor
3654000	3656000	On a hover snake
3656000	3658000	While collecting colored balls to score
3658000	3660000	Points and it says other players
3660000	3662000	Can rapidly reduce your point
3662000	3664000	Tally by flicking you with their
3664000	3666000	Tails or blasting you with
3666000	3668000	Their weapons and I guess
3668000	3670000	It's gonna support
3670000	3672000	An option to
3672000	3674000	Import your face and map it on to stuff
3674000	3676000	I don't know
3676000	3678000	Looks okay it's kinda neat
3678000	3680000	The other thing that they're gonna be getting
3680000	3682000	Is a brand new game called
3682000	3684000	Stardust HD
3684000	3686000	Which I guess is a cross between asteroids
3686000	3688000	And I guess
3688000	3690000	Since everybody compares this
3690000	3692000	Games to this
3692000	3694000	Geometry Wars
3694000	3696000	So yet another game
3696000	3698000	Where you blow up a lot of shit
3698000	3700000	I think a game is like Geometry Wars
3700000	3702000	If you shoot stuff
3702000	3704000	Hostile one in our chatroom
3704000	3706000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com has a comment on the
3706000	3708000	Snakeballs game he says
3708000	3710000	Get these motherfucking snakeballs off
3710000	3712000	My motherfucking console
3712000	3714000	Get it? Like snakes on
3714000	3716000	Yeah get it?
3716000	3718000	Movie sucked
3718000	3720000	Dude I love snakes on the plane but I really liked it
3720000	3722000	Just for the situation I saw it in
3722000	3724000	Where me and Meg Z and Chris all had stuffed
3724000	3726000	Snakes that we picked up at the uh
3726000	3728000	The Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater
3728000	3730000	I thought you were gonna say it was an in flight movie
3730000	3732000	That would've been great
3732000	3734000	Can I touch you? Or will I
3734000	3736000	Will I bleed from your awesomeness?
3736000	3738000	I don't know
3738000	3740000	Wow
3740000	3742000	I feel like death
3742000	3744000	I got gay from Rob
3744000	3746000	It's all over my foot
3746000	3748000	Alright
3748000	3750000	Dark Sakura the gay foot
3750000	3752000	Rob
3752000	3754000	Oh my god Dark Tetsuya said touch DS
3754000	3756000	That was funny
3756000	3758000	Anyway
3758000	3760000	So guess what we have
3760000	3762000	Wait a minute
3762000	3764000	Wait a minute
3764000	3766000	Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?
3766000	3768000	It's fucking awesome I can't stop
3768000	3770000	Dude
3770000	3772000	I was like touching Dark Sakura's foot and I was like hee hee
3772000	3774000	And I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear
3774000	3776000	I saw Loki like drinking
3776000	3778000	The sauce from McDonald's
3778000	3780000	I was because it's so tasty
3780000	3782000	Oh my god that's nasty
3782000	3784000	Sweet and sour sauce
3784000	3786000	I ran out of nuggets
3786000	3788000	Anyway
3788000	3790000	Are you one of those people that bitches at the drive through
3790000	3792000	Because they're like okay
3792000	3794000	If you only get six nuggets
3794000	3796000	You only get one sweet and sour sauce
3796000	3798000	Pack and if you want more
3798000	3800000	You gotta pay ten cents extra
3800000	3802000	Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them
3802000	3804000	Apparently
3804000	3806000	No two's enough
3806000	3808000	For like a ten piece nuggets
3808000	3810000	Or whatever but you know
3810000	3812000	They gave me three so what the fuck am I supposed to
3812000	3814000	I can't just save it for next time
3814000	3816000	Think about it Rob that's like a shot for ten cents
3816000	3818000	Dude I mean
3818000	3820000	I take syrup shots I mean come on
3820000	3822000	Do you eat the jams
3822000	3824000	At like waffle country waffles
3824000	3826000	Oh god
3826000	3828000	I don't like jam
3828000	3830000	Nasty nasty nasty
3830000	3832000	You took syrup shots with everybody Rob
3832000	3834000	I'm gonna finish drinking this now
3834000	3836000	I was drunk
3836000	3838000	At Roscoe's?
3838000	3840000	I don't know it's just my excuse for everything
3840000	3842000	Fine so guess what Sony's giving us
3842000	3844000	Food
3844000	3846000	Crabs? Aids?
3846000	3848000	Hot shots tennis
3848000	3850000	Oh I was gonna say shots
3850000	3852000	You can dress up the little girls in different costumes
3852000	3854000	That's not very hot
3854000	3856000	It's hot shots
3856000	3858000	I guess it's supposed to be cute
3858000	3860000	Yummy
3860000	3862000	So yeah hot shots tennis
3862000	3864000	Yay next
3866000	3868000	I love your reporting DarkSakura
3868000	3870000	You don't even bother to give us
3870000	3872000	The details you just like
3872000	3874000	Yeah Sony's making a hot shots
3874000	3876000	Tennis game and you can dress chicks up
3876000	3878000	But this game sucks
3878000	3880000	I can do that in Dead or Alive and then this one I get bouncing
3880000	3882000	Boobies so huh
3882000	3884000	Alright
3884000	3886000	Well of course
3886000	3888000	E3 is coming to town of course
3888000	3890000	It's coming to Santa Monica
3890000	3892000	Where exactly in town they haven't really said
3892000	3894000	From what I understand they've kind of like told people
3894000	3896000	Okay be on the street corner
3896000	3898000	Oh yeah the invitations at the house I could have looked there
3898000	3900000	Well they're gonna tell you like be on the street corner
3900000	3902000	And then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up
3902000	3904000	And it's like going to a rave
3904000	3906000	Apparently is what E3 is tuned into
3906000	3908000	Like dude there's gonna be like this sweet party
3908000	3910000	At this like vacated airport hangar
3910000	3912000	But like we can't tell you where it is on the flyer
3912000	3914000	It's like an unmarked bus is gonna come pick you up
3914000	3916000	And take you to the location
3916000	3918000	It's gonna be an all night party
3918000	3920000	One of the E's now stands for Ecstasy
3920000	3922000	Apparently
3922000	3924000	It was like E4
3924000	3926000	We're putting the E in E3
3926000	3928000	Well anyhow the interesting thing about E3
3928000	3932000	Is that last year there were 400 companies
3932000	3934000	Debuting stuff at E3 and showing off their latest stuff
3934000	3938000	This year there are 32 companies
3938000	3940000	Showing off at this year's E3
3940000	3942000	Now granted Sony's on the list
3942000	3944000	Microsoft's on the list
3944000	3946000	And Nintendo's on the list
3946000	3948000	Because all the companies that are debuting stuff
3948000	3950000	Is a lot of the big big companies
3950000	3952000	Uh it's basically
3952000	3954000	Kenshi Hall was where you know
3954000	3956000	Where those 400 companies were last year
3956000	3958000	But it's still kind of surprising there
3958000	3960000	You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus
3960000	3962000	I guess not
3962000	3964000	So uh
3964000	3966000	The invitations are down by the way
3966000	3968000	To between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year
3968000	3970000	60,000
3970000	3972000	Is one of the companies that's gonna have a booth there
3972000	3974000	G4 because you know they always have a booth
3974000	3976000	No G4 is not on the exhibitors list
3976000	3978000	But they will probably still somehow have like
3978000	3980000	500 people
3980000	3982000	At E3
3982000	3984000	All in those ugly shirts
3984000	3986000	Well anyway
3986000	3988000	I realized Dark Sakura got an invite
3988000	3990000	To E3 but
3990000	3992000	Have you even followed up on it?
3992000	3994000	I think you need to
3994000	3996000	I've been reading Twitter
3996000	3998000	I got my invite and I did my confirmation
3998000	4000000	So I've got my physical thing in the mail
4000000	4002000	Lucky you
4002000	4004000	Have fun, take pictures
4004000	4006000	Wait a minute
4006000	4008000	Loki and I are sitting here going
4008000	4010000	God damn motherfucking E3
4010000	4012000	And you're like
4012000	4014000	Oh yeah I got an invite just kind of sitting at home
4014000	4016000	I don't know I may not go
4016000	4018000	I actually am putting my focus on my education
4018000	4020000	So maybe
4020000	4022000	I don't know if people want to give me money I'll go
4022000	4024000	Cause it's kind of expensive to stay down there
4024000	4026000	I hope you're listening ESA
4026000	4028000	Fuckers
4028000	4030000	This is when you're inviting people that don't want to go
4030000	4032000	I didn't say I don't want to go
4032000	4034000	I can't afford to go
4036000	4038000	My name is Dark Sakura
4038000	4040000	AKA Jamie Summers
4040000	4042000	And I think you should let me into E3
4042000	4044000	I'm really angry about things
4044000	4046000	Let me play your game god damn it
4046000	4048000	No no
4048000	4050000	If they would give me a place to stay
4050000	4052000	Then I would be happy
4052000	4054000	I just wear glasses do my hair
4054000	4056000	And that little A style that Dark Sakura has hers
4056000	4058000	And I can sneak in as her
4058000	4060000	Yeah but you have to
4060000	4062000	I want to play your game does it have boobs
4062000	4064000	Whatever
4064000	4066000	Jamie could be a guys name
4066000	4068000	Whatever
4068000	4070000	Alright anyhow
4070000	4072000	This is California it's high me
4072000	4074000	I'm sorry
4074000	4076000	Whatever
4076000	4078000	Well anyway every time I hear about E3
4078000	4080000	And how it's kind of going a little bit downhill
4080000	4082000	And the fact that there's this big party going on
4082000	4084000	And I'm not invited
4084000	4086000	I get a little bit angsty
4086000	4096000	I know what that means
4096000	4098000	Dark Sakura would you care to start us off
4098000	4100000	With the FUs of the week
4100000	4102000	Matthew of the week goes
4102000	4104000	It's very simple
4104000	4106000	Goes to stupid drama
4108000	4110000	And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland
4110000	4112000	On my birthday
4112000	4114000	Hey dude the lines were short
4114000	4116000	And the teacups were not being opened
4116000	4118000	That was sad
4118000	4120000	And and and and and
4120000	4122000	The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain
4122000	4124000	Fuckers
4124000	4126000	And and and and and
4126000	4128000	Yeah done
4128000	4130000	Loki
4130000	4132000	Fuck you to the dumbass that ran
4132000	4134000	Our games at Qsar last night
4134000	4136000	Because you are
4136000	4138000	A dumb fucking
4138000	4140000	The job I mean because I've done the job
4140000	4142000	It's not that fucking hard
4142000	4144000	And now you've failed at every aspect of it
4144000	4146000	And like when I was playing in front of him
4146000	4148000	He was like mystified like I was doing magic
4148000	4150000	Or something you know
4150000	4152000	So how are you doing that
4152000	4154000	Horrible
4154000	4156000	The Qsar has really gone downhill in Vacaville
4156000	4158000	All packs are all fucked up
4158000	4160000	So fuck them for screwing that up
4162000	4164000	I would like to give an FU to Loki's wife Nellie
4164000	4166000	For shooting me fifty-eight times
4166000	4168000	In one game at said Qsar
4168000	4170000	Because the
4170000	4172000	Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on
4172000	4174000	The defense shields so she could just shoot me
4174000	4176000	Over and over and over and over and over again
4176000	4178000	Which is what she did she just basically held the gun up to my back
4178000	4180000	And kept shooting because those
4180000	4182000	I could not shoot the base like something was wrong
4182000	4184000	With those bases but I had a fun time
4184000	4186000	At laser tag FU to Loki for not opening up his own
4186000	4188000	Laser tag arena for being too like
4188000	4190000	Oh yeah
4190000	4192000	Oh wait what's that
4192000	4194000	Oh it's twenty or it's
4194000	4196000	You know two million dollars in my ass
4196000	4198000	You know wow
4198000	4200000	Look at that
4200000	4202000	Get a loan or something I don't know
4202000	4204000	Rescue us from horrible Qsars around the world
4204000	4206000	Anyway what else do I have an FU too
4206000	4208000	I don't know
4208000	4210000	I guess that's it
4210000	4212000	Just an FU to Nellie
4212000	4214000	Warrior Bob any FUs you have to get off your chest
4214000	4216000	I'm actually a fairly happy guy
4216000	4218000	I don't have a whole lot of FUs
4218000	4220000	So if anything it's to Sony for the drives
4220000	4222000	Not reading blue discs
4222000	4224000	Because that makes me angry
4224000	4226000	And to Jobs for not being open for me
4226000	4228000	Because I'm unemployed
4228000	4230000	Unemployment sucks
4230000	4232000	I'm working on it
4232000	4234000	I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now it kind of sucks
4234000	4236000	Honestly blue discs make me more angry
4236000	4238000	You should say
4238000	4240000	An FU to the Rob D for sounding like you
4240000	4242000	I don't know it's kind of weird
4242000	4244000	The Rob D sounds like me
4244000	4246000	Yes I don't know if you've ever listened to this day in gaming podcasts
4246000	4248000	But you guys have a very similar voice it's kind of interesting
4248000	4250000	I'm going to have to go listen to that now
4250000	4252000	It's interesting it's not a bad thing
4252000	4254000	He's got a great radio voice
4254000	4256000	Well thank you very much
4256000	4258000	I sleep all night so I'm totally unconscious
4258000	4260000	I have no idea what I'm running around doing
4260000	4262000	Maybe we're the same guy
4262000	4264000	Well he's in chat right now though
4264000	4266000	I don't know if that's possible
4266000	4268000	Unless you're like that chick on Heroes
4268000	4270000	Who can use the internet with her brain
4270000	4272000	That would be so distracting
4272000	4274000	No I'm not like the chick on Heroes
4274000	4276000	And yeah that stupid bitch on Heroes
4276000	4278000	Fucking A
4278000	4280000	I sign up for the damn viral websites
4280000	4282000	And she spams me all this shit
4282000	4284000	All the time
4284000	4286000	Had I known her secret power was spamming people
4286000	4288000	I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site
4288000	4290000	There's an F you
4290000	4292000	F you to freaking spam bots getting into my forums
4292000	4294000	F you to PHPBB
4294000	4296000	For making it really hard for me to fix that
4296000	4298000	And F you to get into spam bots
4298000	4300000	And the other thing I hate fucking spam
4300000	4302000	That has to do with the stock market
4302000	4304000	I don't play the stock market
4304000	4306000	Why the fuck would I care what companies
4306000	4308000	Want me to buy
4308000	4310000	Amanda sent me the best title though from a spam email
4310000	4312000	You exemplify carrot
4312000	4314000	Whatever happened to Spamusement
4314000	4316000	That was like my favorite online
4316000	4318000	Have there been updates?
4318000	4320000	That was my favorite online comic
4320000	4322000	Anywhere with Spamusement
4322000	4324000	And they just kind of stopped doing updates
4324000	4326000	I mean I realized
4326000	4328000	Maybe the guy like you know real life
4328000	4330000	Comes first and maybe had something else he wanted to do
4330000	4332000	That doesn't make me any less sad
4332000	4334000	He could just pass it off to somebody
4334000	4336000	No the last one was October 20th
4336000	4338000	That makes me sad
4338000	4340000	Spamusement go look in the archives
4340000	4342000	The older cartoons at Spamusement.com
4342000	4344000	It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life
4344000	4346000	It's great
4346000	4348000	Anyways
4348000	4350000	Oh god some of these are kind of gross
4350000	4352000	So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out
4352000	4354000	From Mr. Bishi
4354000	4356000	It's a new Docomo
4356000	4358000	Sounds like Kokomo
4358000	4360000	Anyways D9-04i
4360000	4362000	And apparently
4362000	4364000	It's going to have a motion sensor built into it
4364000	4366000	Or I believe
4366000	4368000	There was something about it using its camera
4368000	4370000	To detect motion
4370000	4372000	Anyways
4372000	4374000	It's a fucking Wii phone type thing
4374000	4376000	And you're going to be able to use it to play games
4376000	4378000	And a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it
4378000	4380000	Of course
4380000	4382000	Katamari Portable
4382000	4384000	And You Are Gundam
4384000	4386000	So I guess that's neat
4386000	4388000	But I hope they don't release them in the US
4388000	4390000	Because
4390000	4392000	People have enough trouble driving
4392000	4394000	Let alone playing TILTI games
4394000	4396000	On their cell phone
4396000	4398000	Driving while side talking
4398000	4400000	How about just shut up and drive
4400000	4402000	That's what I vote for
4402000	4404000	And further proof that Namco intends to just
4404000	4406000	Poop all over the Katamari franchise
4406000	4408000	While the creator has gone off to greener pastures
4408000	4410000	But then you can roll it up into an even bigger ball
4410000	4412000	And set it on fire
4412000	4414000	With your cell phone for god's sake
4414000	4416000	Roll it up and light it
4416000	4418000	There we go
4418000	4420000	New Katamari game, Katamari Weed
4420000	4422000	Katamari Weed
4422000	4424000	Wow, well anyway
4424000	4426000	That's going to bring Segment A
4426000	4428000	Of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here
4428000	4430000	And we'll be back after a quick break
4430000	4432000	With more of Orange Lounge Radio
4432000	4434000	Because as you know we tape in two
4434000	4436000	Well maybe you don't know because we were gone last week
4436000	4438000	So maybe you need a little bit of a refresher
4438000	4440000	But Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves
4440000	4442000	Live on Sunday night
4442000	4444000	And this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately
4444000	4446000	And then the second half will follow sometime mid week
4446000	4448000	So we're going to take a break here
4448000	4450000	And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4450000	4452000	Thanks for watching and have a great week
