Orange Lounge Radio
Just head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com All the details are there.
Or whatever program you use to get this program, like maybe iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show, there should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.
So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.
And of course our chat room is over at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.
And we always like to read your comments.
And of course the skyline will be open in the show a little later.
The Eye Toy is no more, as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.
Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out, and it's called just the Eye, not the Eye Toy, because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.
And the camera will now, instead of taking a 320 by, or no,
I think before, like, the camera was only taking, like, what, 300 by 200 pixels?
I mean, it was really small.
Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.
That's not bad.
It's not HD, but that's not bad.
Or 320 at twice that.
Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye.
But I guess so.
So there you go.
It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.
You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.
Enjoy.
Does this have anything to do with the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.
Anyways, it is going to use the iCamera, and it's going to be a card game.
Hurrah!
I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like $80 if this game is bundled in there, so...
I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.
Now, to be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.
Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.
Looks exactly the same to me.
Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.
I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff.
Let me put it this way.
Granted...
The camera is better than the last camera.
But let's just look at the examples here.
And I'm not just saying, you know, that the eye toys suck.
Because, to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks.
as well, and, you know, this, hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special, you know, I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that, if that's, you know, actually what it can do, then great, you know, I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that, and according to this, I think you can, but if it does suck, I'm gonna be fucking pissed, again, but I'm not buying it.
I was gonna say, are you actually buying this to try it out?
There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.
Don't buy it, exactly.
I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.
That was very fucking lame.
I wanted that game to be so good and then it required the camera and I said, screw it.
That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera, but I don't want to use it.
It's useless.
I seriously don't even want to play it.
It's useless.
Stupid.
Apparently in multiplayer, though, you get to see other people playing the game, which might be kind of funny.
No.
I would play it just so I can play it.
If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet, maybe somebody in chat can clarify, but if that's true, that you can play that by waving your arms and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing,
What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube and we could all have a laugh.
That might be a good use of the... You can already do that with DDR, though.
That might be a good use of the Xbox 360 video game.
I did show him the orange bat, by the way.
Alright, anyway.
Oh, yes.
The bat.
That's old.
I saw the bat.
Did you go to her house and play pinball?
Yeah, you know, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.
Sorry.
DarkSakura invited me over and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games.
Marvel Ultimate Alliance
It's not a very good joke.
There's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?
I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.
You can play Spider Woman.
My word.
Anyway.
Pinball's awesome.
So, moving forward, shall I?
God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.
Hasbro actually is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game God, why?
Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast Oh no And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us Our card crack!
Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.
Me too.
Well, I didn't play it very long.
I started playing Magic again.
I had my black-bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books, turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to... I just gave them away because they were... Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?
Why don't you sell half of it?
No, but... I sold what I could out of it, like my moxes.
No, I go outdoors.
I sold my moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.
I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.
Nerd alert!
Nerd alert!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
This show has reached maximum nerd levels.
The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get.
Wow, that goes back a ways.
Wow, that goes back a ways.
But you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same because the camera doesn't know any different.
It's a fucking camera.
It sees a card and boom, works.
I was going to ask you about this.
So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there.
In fact, it's really complicated to play the game because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated because otherwise it'll just recast the card because the game doesn't know.
It's very fucking complicated to play and when I asked them, I'm like...
Well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?
Uh... What's the point of this game?
Uh... See, it's just... It's retarded.
It's a fucking tech demo.
It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box, but the problem is...
It's thinking a little too far outside of the box.
It's one thing to think outside the box if the box, you know, is made out of cardboard.
I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.
All it's going to do, all it's really going to do is supplement, like, you know, if they want, let's say, for example, they want to take this and make, like, an official...
Magic the Gathering, Game, The Judgment, or something like that.
And actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever, and it just enhances that.
So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that, you can place them down and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.
Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster!
But to be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though...
I don't think anyone's going to give a shit, and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place.
Like any other itoy game that's out on the market right now, because they're frustrating and don't work properly.
I will give a shit when you can hack that thing, like people have hacked other games, to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in, so we can get our OLR game going.
And we can see a little dancing Rob, whenever we put his cart down.
Oh, hooray.
I am so excited, I just can't hide it.
That will go on YouTube.
Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube, Sony is creating a service called iVio.
It's a video sharing site in Japan, and of course, you know, it's something that's going to, hopefully, if PlayStation gets their way and Sony will compete against YouTube.
Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now, but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.
What's interesting about it is that you can actually download PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.
There will be a mobile version of this service as well, and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.
Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped, which is kind of funny.
So there it is.
So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that, oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation Eye, you'll also be able to upload those to the service, and then so you can hopefully someday download Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.
I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.
My homes, my homes, my homes.
And it's definitely not in slow motion.
Come on, just... My lovely lady homes.
Come on, Loki.
So retarded.
Anyways.
So, some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.
They've actually put out a new patent.
I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.
James Patrick in chat says, How is it a good idea?
Just go to YouTube.
So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.
Zing.
Sorry, Loki.
Anyways, so they have a brand new patent, and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.
And what this basically is in layman's terms is it will actually use your console to have...
communicate with other devices like handheld devices so say for example I have a Playstation 3 although this isn't a Microsoft thing but say I had a Playstation 3 and it had this thing in it and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers but at the same time my game system is communicating to my PSP to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster so this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to I guess speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out you know
More polygons and whatnot.
Or full proteins!
Goody, goody, goody!
Fuck that shit.
I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.
I am damn well not wasting my console resources, wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.
So this is like the original design for the cell processor, where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together, except that it works with things that aren't Sony-branded.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Alright.
Wait, is this Microsoft?
This is Microsoft, right?
Yeah, this is Microsoft.
It says, basically, in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones and consoles, in a way that increases the processing power of all the connected devices.
The more gaming components in the network, the more computing power is generated.
So, can you imagine... So, it's Voltron.
No, it's not gay and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.
No, it's Voltron!
I liked Vehicle Voltron.
Microsoft has just patented Voltron.
It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.
That's what it is, it's Voltron.
It doesn't have theme music, it isn't Voltron.
I like Vehicle Voltron.
I like Vehicle Voltron.
Hey, guess what?
What?
I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.
A lot cooler.
Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.
Yes, DarkSakura, a lot cooler.
Tron!
Tron.
Tron.
That's like Voltron without a V. You can't make Voltron without Tron.
Great minds.
Rob, three words for you.
Great minds think like me.
End of line.
Anyway.
Four words for you.
Die in a fire.
For people who don't know, Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever, which I have on Laserdisc and DVD.
I have like the uber, uber Laserdisc that's like this big fat box of Tron.
And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.
This reminds me of something, if I may real quick.
No.
No, DarkSakura, trust me, this will have your blessing.
What?
Why does that have to do with Tron?
F you to Disney for not having the People Mover.
I know, all because that stupid grad jumped off of it.
Because the People Mover was only... Let's graduate high school and jump off the People Mover.
Tron ride at Disneyland.
Because you could go through, like, Tron, which was the coolest thing ever, and I believe Tim Curry narrated it, which makes it just double cool.
You know what they could do though?
The people movers actually just do the things together like a little track ride and have it enclosed.
Yes, it was called the Rocket Rods.
Also, someone died on that one and they removed that as well.
Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad and I rode on it in the back.
Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some gaming.
Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool because it was like the people movers except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.
Same track.
It went through the Tron thing too.
It was just like real fast.
No narration.
Tron.
Tron.
Sark is ready, are you?
and so we're getting, oh sorry, another note to that was two classics returned this summer to the arcade, more data to be downloaded soon.
So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.
That is so freaking rad, I can't even contain myself.
I found a Discs of Tron machine.
Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games ever.
That was an excellent game.
The light cycles, that little cone thing, oh my god.
Did you ever play Tron 2.0?
No, I never did.
I have, there's something that Dan downloaded a while back, and it was pretty fun.
It's actually just a light cycle game.
I was about to say, the online one?
Yeah, the online light cycle game.
That was pretty cool.
But no, that Tron 2.0, though, was supposed to be like a big playthrough game.
I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.
Dude, why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?
Because you're a nerd?
No, Dan was using my laptop last, and, oh God.
Anyway.
Tron is one year off from Prawn.
That's true.
Do you know how everyone misspells porn?
Prawn.
Tron.
TR0N.
Discs of prawn.
Oh no, that's what DarkSakura denies having, is hard discs of prawn.
What?
End of line.
Oh wait, no, I pointed, I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?
Loki's like sitting here going, are you gonna cut her off yet with the next story?
And I'm going, come on, Loki, get into your story.
Oops, it's my turn.
Hi.
Rob.
What?
No, no, no.
I just wanted to try that one time.
It doesn't work for you.
It works for her.
It's actually kind of fun.
No, it's not.
There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on the way.
Now, it's one step above a rumor because Harmonix fans seem to call the first set of arcade packs before they came out.
So this looks like it could be pretty...
Pretty true is that there are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.
Pack 1 will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett, and Coach Ice by Audioslave.
Content Pack 2 will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones, and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.
And Content Pack 3 will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand, and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.
Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,
then fail.
Although I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price they changed.
I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had like these one packs that cost, you know, 200 points and these other packs that cost like, you know, 100 points?
That would look kind of stupid.
So I think they're going to be the same price, like it or not.
Everybody bought them.
The market sustains it.
Yeah.
I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.
Exactly.
Ditto.
And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.
That's kind of rad.
That was the one pack I really didn't want.
I didn't enjoy it.
Any of those songs nearly as much as the others.
Anyways, there is a rumor that the Bioware sci-fi role-playing game, this phenomenal game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.
And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
So it's rumor mill, yada, yada, yada.
It's actually moved.
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.
Did you say it's actually true?
Probably.
And how would you know this?
Because I heard about it before.
But it's probably true.
It's not done.
Let me put it this way.
It's not coming out right now, but definitely later.
So September until you get your Mass Effect.
At least.
At least.
I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at 2Human, delayed to, like, next year.
Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because their games division is actually reporting lower sales by 21%.
Basically, they've had a...
Drop from $402 million for this quarter last year to $315 million.
So that's quite a bit.
They're basically saying the revenues are actually down by $1.2 billion.
Of course, that's not surprising.
They've lost a lot of money before with their product.
Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.
Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter 2003.
See, there's that shipped again.
It's not sold, it's shipped.
Shipped equals sitting on storage shelves collecting dust.
But also during the same time, their operating losses fell by 20%.
So maybe it's going to balance?
They'll pull through.
They have the resources.
It's Microsoft.
They have the power of gates.
Because he's tainted them.
It'll be fine.
They'll be fine.
Halo 3's on its way.
Halo Wars.
They'll be fine.
I see their parachutes.
Alright.
This is not going to help their situation though much.
Sorry.
Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't have any sort of idea what's coming out the list of
Mass Effect for September as well.
You heard it from Gamefly!
It's September!
Because they were listing some other weird title called Beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out.
Ever.
Didn't some little internet radio site somewhere mention that one once?
We disavow all knowledge of that.
Yeah, Loki's afraid of getting Namco'd by 9Microsoft.
Namco is a verb now.
Uh...
Out of some site, somewhere.
Something we wish would get Namcode is this, although I don't see how that's possible.
But look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox Live Marketplace recently.
And what they are is they're 100 MS Point videos.
That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.
Basically, all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears of War.
And they have one of these videos for each chapter.
So basically you could spend, what, about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.
That's awesome, except for the facts that YouTube and GameFAQs and many other gaming sites will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing!
So Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.
It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell strategy guides.
So should they stop publishing strategy guides since GameFAQ is out there?
To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things that you can't really get online.
and they make great coffee table books for the gamer.
They really do.
I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is, but a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of cool art and stuff.
I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.
I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.
Same thing with strategy guides.
I don't know about these videos, though.
I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay, because if there's suckers out there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're gonna sell it, and that's just gonna motivate them to make more.
I'm just gonna say a preemptive F you to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy-type videos for free.
Hmm.
Well, apparently Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kanan Lynch and Crossfire.
Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but, well, news to me, but they are now coming out in both systems.
I don't know why this is a big surprise, because, I mean, how many games like before came out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?
I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.
Who gives a fuck anyways?
I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.
So, you know, Heavenly Sword, ooh.
So, you know, whatever.
Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing exclusive things.
So, you know, there's been a lot of rah-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May Cry's coming out on 360, blah-blah-blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's working the other way.
I don't know.
I think it's just really... It's not surprising, though.
I mean, that's just... Why would you publish something for one system?
Only one system?
Unless... I don't know.
I don't know why you would just do that.
If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?
I mean...
More people.
Even if it is only a few million more, more is better.
So, I don't know.
Raven Stolfen is in our chatroom and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.
It's like, I do not give a shit.
I thought we were like that every week.
I don't.
I really don't some weeks.
Let's see.
And Kiki's in our chatroom.
That's a new name.
I don't recognize that.
Hi, Kiki.
Says, Rob, Rob, Rob, I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.
Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.
Sounds awesome.
All right.
Deakman says, announcement of the podcast, my girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.
Oh.
Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.
Oh, what's that?
Oh, my.
No.
Really, DarkSakura?
You have Deakman's baby?
No.
You're carrying Deakman's baby?
Hi, married.
I don't even carry my own husband.
We kid, we kid, we kid.
Um, I, um, wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 a.m.
by a cesarean.
Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 a.m.
He is six pounds, eight ounces.
How come you have it at 6.66 a.m.?
Yeah, Rob, duh.
It's a joke, people.
It's a joke.
But his name is Julian Donald.
Um, she had a... He just did not want to come out anyway.
So, um...
I did want to share that though with everyone because I'm very... I feel what that baby's going through.
Not wanting to come out.
Seriously though, this is my friend's first baby.
And I'm very excited for her.
Congratulations to her.
Thank you.
And to Deakman.
See, we have someone nice in the room wrong.
And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?
God of War.
Let's send it... How about a decapitated goat?
It's an offering.
No.
I think it's great though because his parents are both Trekkies.
His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.
They didn't name the kids Spock, did they?
His name is Julian.
Wait a minute, wasn't that Picard's real name or something?
Jean-Luc?
Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.
I swear I read that in some dig article this week.
It was supposed to be Julian Picard and they changed it last minute.
I think we have another segment to do.
Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and I'm so excited that DarkSakura is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails for you to read.
Let's start the mailbag segment.
Hooray!
You can read them with that attitude.
Anyway, first email is from Ariz... I guess that's how it's pronounced.
Should I get an Xbox 360?
I have a high def monitor that can support 360 VGA.
I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.
Is it worth it?
No, get a Wii.
No, you should get a 360.
I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need live.
I have live and I don't play games over it.
Although I do like to download some arcade games but you'd be fine without it.
Get a Wii.
A.Z.H.P.
Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad, dirty jokes that people have been coming up with.
I'm here to save you guys.
I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.
Let me pull up the ad!
Oh god, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will share with our chatroom right now.
There you go, everybody.
Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual innuendos in it.
It actually is too small for me to read.
I use a higher resolution, obviously.
Anyway, um, oh no, here it is.
The text says this, and this is no joke.
Please have this read in the sluttiest voice you can find in the studio.
Well, fuck that, I'm going to use my regular voice.
There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night, and you're warm and safe in your living room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.
Killing vampires goes great with friends, and the closest ones you have here are helping you through a tough level.
You pause, there are monsters up ahead, and you're unsure of how to proceed.
You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.
Perhaps it's something in the juice.
Perhaps it's the high from the intense side-scrolling action that only NES can deliver, which is alike as the Genesis had it too, and so did the Master System.
But there seems to slow around the two of you.
You don't look away.
You can't.
There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.
It scares you, yet you must have it.
Your gaze never breaks, neither does his.
There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions in Fantasylands.
Tonight there will be a new adventure.
Nintendo, now you're playing with power.
I was going to say, what did you see in his eyes?
You saw blast processing.
I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.
In the U.S. ?
or Japan or whatever.
Oh, really?
That's where it's at.
Korea?
All right.
I wonder about that.
Yeah, you're right.
Anyway, next email, shall I?
Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every week.
That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.
Can I say it real fast?
I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.
I'm like the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck.
I actually like your show.
Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.
But today I actually like it.
Can I continue, please?
All right, sorry.
For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.
Week after week I listen to the cowardly, beat-around-the-bush responses, Apple sucks, Apple blows.
Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well-thought-out, valid response to that argument.
Is it because you can't run Windows?
Oh wait, yes you can.
Is it because you can't play The Sims?
And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance?
Oh wait, yes you can.
Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?
Would you feel better if they called it a Zunecast?
By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?
I guess because me and Chris bought a Mizzun, hi.
Weren't you listening to this?
You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got a Mizzun, hi.
And sure you did just out of spite.
Have you tried to install Vista yet?
I believe if you did, you'll notice that it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?
Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total ripoff of the Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.
It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.
Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?
Oh, and this was by...
God, I'm sorry I closed the email.
God wrote that email?
I'm sorry, person.
You are fucked, Loki.
I closed your email.
I'm sorry, person.
Oh, wait, here it is.
It's by JG2000.
Oh, not God.
One of those.
I was going to say, if God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.
I'm not fucked.
No, but seriously, though, I mean, let's talk about...
what they're doing, like, to basically advertise the, you know, the iMac right now.
They're talking about how, you know, oh, yes, programs are so hard to install, but with, you know, Apple, you don't have to do anything, because they're all preloaded on there for you.
Well, that's good that you've preloaded the software that'll actually run on a Mac, you know, versus, you know, actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and we're not talking about, like, Doom 2 or stuff like that.
You know, oh, goody, Prey plays on there.
Wonderful.
You know, that's
That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.
But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it based on colors or flavors, as I should put it.
Who cares what color the damn system is?
If I can't fucking install... Nintendo DS?
Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.
That's retarded that they even sell by colors.
But...
To be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.
I really don't.
I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.
It sucks.
I'm not going to buy one.
And you know what?
If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.
But you know what?
When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice, but
whenever I guess the next next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out Mac's definitely not going to be able to play it.
Eh, I still like being bi with computers.
I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop.
Works great.
I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things and do emails.
It's quick.
I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh, well the, you know, iDVD, it's so awesome, you know, it's, so he's used, there's programs out there that use, you know, they're on everything.
It,
I don't get... Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because all the programs are there for you and you don't need to download any extra stuff.
But you know what?
People like me who aren't super basic with computers like to have that option to customize things and I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.
Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.
So shall I move on to the next email then?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Boobs, please.
Thank you.
I'm just writing to let you know.
Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?
That was me saying that because you said, guys.
And I'm like, no.
No.
BPC, thank you.
I thought that was a request.
I'm like, well, if you really want, I'll just... Rob.
No.
I don't need that.
Anyway.
I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.
Oh, thank you.
I'm studying abroad for my junior year of high school in Italy right now.
Lucky.
So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.
That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.
They never fail to disappoint.
And they never fail to disappoint.
What?
Okay.
They never...
Anyway.
I don't think that was what they meant.
I don't think that's what they meant.
Chirp, chirp, chirp.
Because everything else is all positive.
Like, what?
Anyway.
I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up hearing you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.
Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint.
I haven't put a review up yet, I should do that.
Could you do that?
Could you put a five?
There's OLR never fails to disappoint.
This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.
Thank you.
Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.
I saw that.
That was beautiful.
Okay, anyway.
Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer, more specifically a Bitmoni fan, care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn, Moongina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.
I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.
You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.
Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.
I won't say the last name unless he wants me to.
P.S.
I challenge Sky's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to duel to the death over said throne at any time.
Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky, unwashed toilet.
Okay.
You...
I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at Halo 2.
But what if you fail to disappoint?
Then you lose.
So hey, I'm really curious.
Matthew, was that the name?
Yeah.
Matthew, you're in Italy, and that's pretty awesome.
First of all, listener base is international.
Rock.
Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan, and I'm curious.
What is the Bimani in arcade scene like over there?
I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never heard this confirmed.
I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.
Not Japan.
Well, yeah, Japan.
Well, unless you count, you know, Ticket Games and Pachinko.
Wait, Japan has tons of arcades.
Which I do.
Anyway, the last email tonight.
This is from Sakura Max.
Anime was created because we killed ourselves because hot anime chicks don't exist in real life.
Okay.
I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.
I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth.
Two weeks ago referenced in my email.
Rhea Dracer.
Recommend any MMOs.
I already played MapleStory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy Online.
FlyFF, Gunbound, Gunzi, and Ragnarok.
I think that's it.
Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.
Dude, those guys' emails... Okay, that guy's emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.
Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like... I can't say I have.
Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.
No, seriously, no, no, seriously.
No, I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is a site I love.
But like, you know, if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, you know...
uh, World Peace, I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, you know, it's like all these random things.
What's this guy saying?
Like, he's like, I was once served in a tavern, medium rare.
Like, what?
It's like poetry, practically.
I love the signature best on this, though.
Let me read this to you.
Sakura Max, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.
You get, like, you get a gold star just for your closing to that email.
You can play Loki's game.
Done!
Next, please.
Alright.
Well then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Meanwhile, more news.
And we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.
I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.
There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.
Robert Garcia, the man who brought us Dan Hedeke.
Right.
Yahoo!
I get that joke.
Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.
I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2 and this is again thanks to the ESRB who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.
It's like the ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.
And of course the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally came out on the Neo Geo.
Awesome!
And you know what else it does?
It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.
You know, they've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.
They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.
I mean... Make something new!
Well, weren't Neo Geo games supposed to become a virtual console anyway?
That's not new.
That's old shit again.
There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.
That was new.
And it was really good.
Oh, well, one game.
I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.
Alright, well, anyway.
So that's an art of fighting.
Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to the DS.
And yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on touchscreen.
Yay!
Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Dance 2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.
Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that song that goes, I don't wanna work, I just wanna bang on Z-Drum all day.
You know that song?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious about a person jailed for the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack!
So it's like a shooter that's like House of the Dead and what's that other one?
Like the Ghost Squad.
Like a light gun shooter.
Touch the Dead
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Awful.
So disgusting.
Apparently it came from a butcher, making that okay.
Because it's from a butcher.
Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?
Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.
Well, but you can actually buy goat meat.
You can buy horse meat on the market.
They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.
They sell horse meat for international consumption.
I know, and I really want some.
But anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have.
They were doing all the jokes.
Like, this really gets my goat.
This is nothing to lose your head over.
Gotta love the Internet.
Well, the Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly because they opened it up and free and all that stuff.
One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put gay marriage in the game.
They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.
In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're not going to have marriage in the game at all.
It's stupid.
Why would you want marriage in the game?
In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.
It was completely pointless.
You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.
This is stupid.
I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.
You actually could share your hit points.
You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.
There were also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody else.
And on the private server I played on, the mods would actually have it.
Where in the game it was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.
If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you can marry anything.
Including the villains and creatures that you're fighting.
You would cast a spell and... I married a zombie!
I married the rabbit!
No, I'm gonna kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.
No, it's like The End of Shaun of the Dead.
But I still have the ring!
He's my husband!
Wow.
Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that, you know, the Lords of the Ring Online, they decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the original books.
And although they had some interspecial, you know, like a dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were going to have that.
There was no mention in the books ever of males, two males or two females marrying, so they weren't going to put it in the game.
You know the elves are doing it.
But who knows.
They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull the marriage option all together.
And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining Lords of the Ring online, you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game, because the game sucks.
A lot.
If you want to play Lords of the Ring online, just go play World of Warcraft.
Seriously.
Did you say Lords of the Ring?
I don't know.
So Lords of the Ring is you've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.
Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.
That's their problem.
It's a load balancing issue.
Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever you want in the game.
Actually, we have another announcement speaking of marriages.
Okay.
This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.
His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today, and she said yes, and they're getting married in an anime con.
Are they listening to the show?
I believe so.
Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.
This is Don't Give a Shit Night.
I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards.
Especially Loki.
I just got this on a PM.
I just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a dump right now.
Did he get married to him?
This is about marriage right now.
Oh my god, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.
Does this show cause people to want to release or something?
It's possible.
Okay, hey, congratulations to Ranma's friend, because that's awesome.
And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still hoarse from California screaming.
And congratulations to your other friend's bowels.
That's amazing.
Awesome.
Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version.
Because, you know, the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created, causing the game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.
But, as you're probably listening to this podcast now, or tomorrow if you're listening to it live, there will be a patch.
So, yay!
Your expansion will work.
As it should have when you first downloaded it,
Have they tested the damn game?
Tested the game.
That's very important.
Don't just release his shit and patch it later.
That's all I got.
Alright.
Anyway.
Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about.
Because, um... What?
It's the theme.
It really is.
Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.
Well, just because I hate Warhammer.
Warhammer 40k.
because I know people, I had an ex who would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.
And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool and I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.
But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.
So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed.
in the US and in Europe until first quarter 2008.
So yeah.
And in other news, Rice Prince of All Cosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.
You guys are so freaking mature.
I was just picking that up.
Mature.
Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe... Did it say yes or no?
I mean, seriously.
Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.
Dear God, why?
That game is shit on ice.
Exactly why I used that transition.
No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.
Well, I think... Okay, so I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind of loose and just... You run around... God damn it.
Loose like the bowels?
I should have thought that up before I said that.
They were not terribly... Okay.
Okay.
X, X, Y X, X, Y X, X, Y
X, X, Y. Oh, that batch of monsters is dead.
Let's go to the next zone.
X, X, Y. X, X, Y. It's like all you did in the whole game.
That's three buttons.
Most RPGs have one attack.
So, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.
It's called Ambition of the Illuminous.
And I have to confess, the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said Abortion of the Illuminous.
Like, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.
Like, I actually read that.
I was like, what?
Abortion of the Illuminous?
And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous.
And, yeah, that's the title.
And there's going to be some new weapon types.
Madug, Shadug, and Whip.
And also there'll be new Photon Arts.
and, uh, yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's gonna be new planets as well, I don't see how there couldn't be.
Uh, if you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.
If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're gonna have to buy a new disc.
Which seems weird, because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.
I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello.
Oh, well.
Um, so there it is.
Abortion of the Illuminous, coming soon.
Abortion of the Illuminous.
That's so wrong.
But anyways, um, now if
The brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today.
And if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could, of course, hack your current drive for, say, about $80 and get 120GB as well.
and this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things you can create your own 120 gig drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.
I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there without having to hack the whole drive apart which I'm sure someone can create.
If it's not already available.
To just do that.
Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.
Why they don't have that anyways, you know, is beyond me.
But there you go.
Save $100.
If you're not going to buy an Elite system, just want a larger hard drive.
Might as well.
Alright.
Hackin' and crackin'.
Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the internet and sometimes she stumbles upon a website that she wants to share with all of you.
It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.
The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.
It's real life comics.
And from what I understand, he used to, I think, buy comics from my husband at the GameStop.
He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.
Yeah, okay, well he was local then.
But it's a pretty cool webcomic.
I say check it out.
The URL is reallifecomics.com So it's funny.
It's good.
Alright.
I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.
Over in Folsom.
Really?
Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time that I saw a picture of him on his site.
Like, whoa!
That guy.
Did we ever run into each other playing DDR?
Back in the day?
Did you play it Folsom?
We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.
Geez.
Years ago.
I wonder, do I know you?
2001?
Did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?
Back in the day, yeah.
Wasn't that SCAT?
That was SCAT.
Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament?
Oh, God.
Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.
I started playing when I was 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.
Oh, funny.
Small world.
Small world, gee.
Yeah, exactly.
Not as small as my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives down my street.
Also happens to be in Denmark.
Very strange.
And they meet and have lunch.
All right, well, it is a small world, and we want to open up the world to call our show right now.
on the Skype line.
If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call on the old telephone.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
And we'll take our calls on Skype.
And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, and you always go, why is it the same people calling into the show every week?
Well, hey, it's an open line.
All I gotta do is give us a call Sunday.
I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific Time, you can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.
So there you have it.
8.30 Pacific Time.
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello.
This is the dead goat from the God of War story.
Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.
Dead goat, do you have a name?
My name's Bill.
I don't know.
Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.
Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.
I thought that was kind of gross.
But you got to hang out with topless women.
I couldn't do anything with them.
None of them were into golf.
It made me go wah.
Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, Dead Goat?
Bill?
I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.
Wah.
They want me to tell you to buy God of War 2 if you have it.
Wah.
Well, I will definitely have to consider that.
I mean...
You know, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our station.
Especially from beyond the grave.
So, shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.
Well, thanks for letting me call in.
I love listening to your show.
No problem.
Actually, I have another question.
Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary episode?
Um...
I'll get back to you off the show.
I don't want to talk about it on the air.
All right.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Okay?
Let us know, Bill.
Okay.
Thanks, Rob.
All right.
Take care.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
There's tons of stupid people on the Internet.
What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?
That's what I want to know.
How do you get Skype in the graveyard?
I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, talking into a mic.
We need to Photoshop that.
So they go, crap, the levels are off.
I need to adjust the microphone.
It's the guy who called it.
Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?
Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?
I called it in the chat room.
What?
It's a shit show.
This is the what?
I called it.
You don't give a shit tonight.
I know.
Well, we don't give a shit.
Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?
What do you call tonight?
I'm sorry, Rob.
I'm pissing you off.
I just want to say I love it.
I love the tone.
You love the tone tonight?
Yeah, I love it.
I love that you go like, Kanan Lynch is going to the PS3.
I just don't give a shit.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.
Maybe, I don't know, maybe DarkSakura and I rode California Screamin' one too many times and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.
I don't know.
That was, that made me laugh when you went like, everyone was like, oh my god, DataLynch is going multi-platform and you just go like, I don't give a shit.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Well, what else is on your mind gaming-wise this week, Ravis Dolvin?
Well, the Xbox Wii came out today and I think they're left.
The what came out?
Elite.
Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.
Well, DarkSakura, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.
Yes, I did.
Now, what made you want to get one?
It wasn't me, it was Dan, because our old one died.
Oh, that's right, you guys had no one that died.
Okay, well, I can see that.
Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?
When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from them.
So I would like someone else to get an Elite.
Yeah, but I felt, well, hold, now let me hear, I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.
The DS Lite was an upgrade?
Yeah, I had a DS Bad and I upgraded to a DS Lite.
Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing.
But with the Xbox 360 Elite, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not that much new to it.
How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?
I can't.
That's why I don't care.
Well, then there you go.
alright, left the tone, thank you one more thing?
this is a great show I hope you do another bullshit episode we'll see, we'll see what kind of mood we're in next week alright, thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin later alright, that was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call let's go back to the phones and take another call if you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
hi, this is Chris hi, Chris what's on your mind, buddy?
Oh, wow.
First of all, I just wanted to say I like the show.
I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.
I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.
Welcome to the live experience.
Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.
Ah, congratulations.
That's right, Sundays are big days for Wiis.
Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buy or Toys R Us was going to have them?
Is that how you got them?
No, I actually had a friend from work.
He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wii's in today.
That was like the most they had ever coming at one time.
Very cool.
Did you buy any games for the Wii?
No, I didn't.
I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe rent something.
I wasn't really interested in that.
I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago and
and now they have like 45 Wii's coming out as if they were competing.
Oh, that's a good thought.
Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wii's maybe to kind of have a big push the day the Elite came out?
So that way, you know, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually have Wii's in stock.
Hmm, maybe I should get that instead.
No, I don't think so.
Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?
No, I kind of feel...
They just threw that out there.
It really isn't a real successor to the original one.
Yeah, I pretty much feel like that's what they all did.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's definitely a good way to go.
Yeah, but what about all the good things Kutaragi did?
I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?
I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.
He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night, is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.
Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?
I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but...
At some point, you gotta put them down, so... And what about all the great things that Goat did?
No, it's dead.
They had to put them down.
RicePrince of all cosmos in the chatroom says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.
Sounds like a great idea.
Alright, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?
Uh, no, that's basically it.
Actually, I wanna know which game you think I should get for the Wii.
Um...
Excite Truck
Excite Truck's not bad.
I was going to say Excite Truck too.
Does it use a controller?
I want to be able to use the Wiimote a little bit more.
Yes, all those games.
Not so much Super Paper Mario.
I mean, it does incorporate it a little bit.
You do thuds by shaking the thing.
But yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wiimote like a normal controller, but you steer with it.
You turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.
and then of course Legend of Zelda is like all about using that like you swing it like a sword and all that crazy stuff.
Okay, alright, thanks.
Alright, no problem, Chris.
Thanks for calling the show and call us back sometime.
Alright, take care.
Later.
We like new callers.
This is a good show.
Maybe we need to take vacations more often because we get new guests in studio and we get new callers.
Not that we don't appreciate the old callers too.
Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Uh, it's Legend of Zaku.
Uh, hello, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Uh, nothing much.
Just coming back from Queens, playing Poppin' 8, and pumping up.
I love people calling this show.
I go, hey, what's up?
Ah, nothing.
I just thought I'd call and let you know I did stuff today.
No, I'm just kidding.
What do you think of tonight's show?
Any stories you want to comment on?
You know it's official now that Supernova 2 test location has already been announced for like next month.
Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.
Actually, that was my post.
Was it?
I don't know.
Yeah, I contributed.
Maybe you submitted it and we ran it.
I don't know.
I did.
Well, good.
You know, I think, actually, Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us and, like, two Japanese Bomani sites linked to that story.
So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.
So good job.
Yay.
All right.
So tell us, how did you come across this information about the location test?
No, it's just...
All right, since I know you're such a hardcore, you know, Bomani and music game fan because you've been listening to us, you know, since, you know, the day when that's all we talked about on this show.
What do you hope is the number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?
Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1.
Unlockables, pretty much.
You know how DDR Max was back in the day.
It only had like 60 songs.
It didn't have any returning songs.
It just had brand new songs.
And there wasn't really that much.
And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and
and added new ones and had an unlock system.
Okay, I gotcha.
And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards was unlocking all this stuff.
Yeah, I mean, think about it.
If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami to gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.
And we already know the outcome of that.
I guess so, if we're getting a Supernova 2.
Mm-hmm.
That and hopefully, you know,
They are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar to EMUs.
You know, something that's not necessarily connected online.
Like a card system, like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.
Build your own dancer.
It'll be fun.
Not even that, just track scores, you know, battle people and stuff like that.
Buy hot pants for your character.
Hopefully Konami would
would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent in Supernova this time.
Toshin's yelling Link support in chat room.
Yes.
I hope they found a good workaround.
That's all I'm saying.
Let's see what else is being said in chat here.
GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bomani.
Well, that too.
I mean, and also like revival songs that haven't been revived in a long time.
Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.
I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.
You know, stuff like that.
Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bomani.
Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.
Well, what do you expect?
Hey, it ruined my life too.
That's how I met DarkSakura.
Hugs and kisses and bunnies.
Love you.
Rob, what?
She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.
Yes, I do.
Let's see.
James Patrick says DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.
DDR is pretty big.
What?
500?
Really?
Where's that sales figure come from?
Cite your source, James Patrick.
Yeah, I'd be damned if it reaches a million.
And we don't even know when they're jumping.
I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know, for any future DDR mixes.
obviously I don't see that happening now so is it going to hold on to the PS2 as long as possible there's a big install phase backing it up alright well Zaku we're going to let you go but are you going to drive out to the test of Supernova 2 I don't know maybe I don't even know if I have vacation time but I'll probably get the videos you know eventually and hopefully once Supernova 2 comes in the city then I'll be able to decide for myself alright well good luck with that have fun
Alright, later dude.
Bye.
Oh, Zaku's hilarious.
He's got the best voice.
Yeah, this is Colin talking about Supernova.
You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music games.
I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow no rules.
When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like when you meet them.
No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York City.
He's a good kid.
But we just give him a hard time on this show because he's been listening for a long time and we can't.
Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York City the week of June 9th.
That's all I'm saying for now.
I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.
June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York City, which is good.
I love New York City.
Love it, love it, love it.
So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of
make an appearance, and so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo World Store with people just loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.
All right.
Let's see.
TheRobD in chat says, Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.
We'd love to do that if we had the money.
I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?
Yeah, they'll be there.
They're going to ASEN.
So the OLR lesbians will be there.
So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.
I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN.
So look for them.
They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.
We'll be at FONAME.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hell.
We should have announced that at the top of the show.
Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.
We did get confirmed for this year's FONAME.
We're going to be doing a live show from FONAME the Saturday of FONAME at 2 p.m.
We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right.
We only have the one.
Which is fine, because we didn't really need two last week.
Your panels were book solid.
Yeah, so... We're lucky to get a Saturday.
Yeah, that's awesome.
That's a good time.
So, Saturday at 2, we'll be there taping one of our shows live.
And for that reason, we will not be live Memorial Day weekend.
Because some folks will be staying at Faname.
I have other commitments.
I'm going to be going to Faname for like a day and a half.
We still need to talk about that.
Yeah, I have other commitments.
So, we'll see.
All right.
I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with the rest of them, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco.
I'm very excited about it because that's the thing I'm really into is bad movies like Rocky Horror and all that.
Excellent.
Alright.
So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line and let's ask right now if there's any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.
Okay.
Well, something interesting you should know.
The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess.
And a review on IGN saying that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the Blu... Was it the Blu-ray Java or whatever?
The BD Java.
It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.
There used to be one for a five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha!
Some other fun stuff.
I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend but they had the announcement for Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and it looks pretty fucking awesome and of course Tom Clancy's End War which is supposed to be an online persistent war you're basically going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other so that's kind of neat
And let's see what else.
Oh, LEGO Star Wars 2 and Saints Row have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both those games are available for $29.99.
Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.
Saints Row is fucking awesome.
I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game, I never bought it, so maybe I will now.
There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disguise are coming to the PS3.
That's kind of interesting, I guess.
I know it was your new Disgaea game coming out, I thought.
Or maybe that's called Deceptive, I'm thinking.
Let's see, what else do we have here?
Yeah, I think that was pretty much it.
Yeah.
Alright.
DarkSakura, you got anything?
Any last minute stories?
No.
Oh, alright.
I guess that does it then for tonight's Warrior Bob.
You got anything you've read about?
Um...
So, the show I used to co-host, PressStart.TheFighting.org Are they still on?
Yeah, they still are.
I've just left.
I Skype in now and again.
Oh, okay.
But first I want to plug them.
Second, I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week.
So, ha, that's our news.
Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.
Ah, yes, that's right.
That's coming up, what, Friday?
It was two days ago.
Oh, two days ago.
I think so.
Yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.
Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st?
I think they said it'll be done when it's done.
They want to make a good game.
If it takes that long, it'll take that long.
I guess so.
This game better do my dishes.
That's all I have to say.
It better be that freaking good.
I mean, they named it after the development time.
That was innovative, right?
I guess so.
All right.
I guess that's it.
Thank you for watching!
but yeah, you got your mic there so anyway, thanks for being on the show thank you for having me, it's been a pleasure awesome radio voice, chat loves you guys chat room loves you and wants you to come back make sure you do come back soon thank you very much final thought oh, that was my final thought, thank you for having me alright, there you go, good enough my final thought my final thought is garlic is delicious and keeps the vampires away
Loki, your final thought.
Apparently that Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and StarCraft 2 as well.
Wouldn't that be one and the same?
No, they're going to be two different games.
My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.
But it costs money and I don't have money.
That's my new final thought, is I want you to open a laser tag arena.
Me too.
DarkSakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.
Reject false icons.
It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.
It's good to see it make a comeback.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
Without you guys, we would die.
Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.
So it's you guys that help support us.
Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two friends.
They don't even have to be friends.
Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to us.
and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world and if you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even more you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or Podcast Alley or any of those sites that are like hey rate your favorite podcast because then we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people bother to look at it and if you really really like us and you can do it you'll send us invitations to E3 that's also a good idea
On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
