14171	19617	Tonight, April 1st, 2007, it's no joke that Sonic and Mario are teaming up for an Olympic game.
19637	25864	The Xbox 360 Elite gets officially unveiled, and we talk about who is already upset with the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer.
33314	38978	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week, no really this time, of Orange Lounge Radio.
39078	45303	We are that internet podcast dedicated to video game culture, the gaming lifestyle, and what you, the gamer, really want to know about.
45583	50347	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50627	50927	Yo.
51207	51868	How you doing, Jamie?
52588	53849	My nose is full of goo.
54249	54670	Gross.
55210	57672	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
57852	58192	Hello.
58212	58973	How you doing, Loki?
59073	59593	I'm doing good.
59754	61675	Alright, we have some special guests in the studio tonight.
61994	62635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
91123	91603	There you have it.
91643	92924	Chris is here tonight, everybody.
93644	94485	Hi, Rob.
94685	96586	And she is a lesbian, but not the giggling type.
97766	98286	No, I'm not.
99027	101067	Well, once in a while, if I tell a funny joke, she might giggle.
101708	103308	Yeah, laugh like a hyena is more like it.
103428	103669	All right.
103969	107550	And joining us all the way from Wisconsin, say hello to Meg Z. Hi.
107830	108471	How you doing, Meg Z?
109151	109431	I'm okay.
109731	111092	Thanks for your help with the show earlier.
111132	111692	Appreciate it.
112092	112392	Oh, hi.
112632	112913	Hi.
114233	117294	She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something.
117555	118455	Yeah, I'm looking at porn.
118948	119248	Hot.
119368	120909	Are you downloading lesbian porn on my Mac?
120929	121329	Hells yeah.
121429	121790	Hot.
122250	122670	All right.
123391	126572	Well, anyway, again, you know, our April Fool's joke was all in good fun.
126612	129894	If you don't know what it is yet, go back in the podcast archive and check it out.
129954	132456	But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight.
132896	136458	Just a little bit of a disclaimer first, though, because we want to say.
137069	137209	Um, um,
167236	168397	I really didn't get a pinbot.
169337	170097	Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
170117	171358	Pinbot sounds awesome, though.
171718	171958	I know.
172138	174059	I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one.
174340	175620	You know, you weren't here last week.
175660	176281	We missed you.
176561	177661	I had the plague.
177821	178041	I know.
178061	178642	The disease.
178782	185745	But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino, and I totally thought of you, and I wish I could have stole it for you.
185865	186686	I has played one.
187666	189627	At California Extreme or whatever they call it?
190068	190248	Yep.
190488	191408	I want to go to that this year.
191668	192049	Sounds hot.
192509	192949	It was great.
193140	194140	Anything you wanted to add, Loki?
194460	197061	I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters.
197581	198261	It's kind of cool.
198501	201842	It's like a shoot-em-up game, I guess.
201862	202823	I don't know.
203103	209564	It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard.
211145	212465	But it's fun, so we're checking it out.
212485	213265	It's a free download.
213405	218187	I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing, so if you want the link to it, check that out.
220123	221204	But you've got to be a friend.
221444	225027	Community.allgames.com Yeah, you've got to be one of my friends in order to be able to get the links.
225107	225567	So there you go.
225667	228770	Because there's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here.
228930	229731	So you should check it out.
230691	231632	It's just an awesome game.
231652	232193	That's right.
232673	233554	That's all I meant.
234014	234354	Of course.
234955	235235	All right.
236556	237257	My gaming week.
237317	238057	What I really played.
238157	240479	I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit.
240519	242020	But with a listener of the program.
242061	242741	Not a stupid boy.
242961	243782	We were cracking each other up.
244382	246564	But I also played a lot of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
246604	247625	Just trying to make my way through that.
248001	248762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
271899	274940	I think it's a good, like, 80s arcade type game.
275001	281563	It's just that instead of getting the same old root beer, tapper, joust, those type of games, it's like something you may not have played before.
281703	282664	And it's kind of fun.
283224	286806	I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet, though, so I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game.
286826	289707	But for five bucks, honestly, so far, it's not a bad deal.
290007	294109	And I apologize about my voice and to the chatters in our chat room at chat.orangelandsradio.com.
295362	296283	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
325357	326919	and I'll see you next time.
335168	361379	and their high def pretty videos although you can't randomize them which is kind of weird and they do have music included but I've actually found the way I enjoy listening to the game is I use the XB stream program to grab podcasts and I'll play Tetris while listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack as a podcast like I don't know either our show if I want to kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major Nelson or something or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those and it's kind of fun so
362112	365174	Um, yeah, $30, not a bad deal, but I think it'll be in your bargain bin soon.
365954	367735	Um, Chris, maybe anything you guys want to add?
368135	369215	I've played Animal Crossing.
369556	370436	Animal Crossing on DS?
370736	371376	Yeah, on the plane.
371837	372257	On the plane?
372277	372637	How was that?
372657	374658	Oh, you didn't use the Wi-Fi, though, on the plane, did you?
374678	375058	Of course not.
375078	375438	That's good.
375658	383042	No, but, um, I haven't played for, like, three months, and everybody in my village was like, Bitch, I invited you to tea, like, five months ago!
384042	389145	And I'm like, I'm sorry, and there was, like, a gajillion weeds, and I had a bunch of mail, and it was a mess.
389165	391706	But I cleaned it up all the way from Madison to
393571	395572	So it took you that long to clean up your village?
395612	398294	Kind of, and then make everybody not mad at me anymore.
399635	400575	Alright, well good times.
401896	418207	I wonder if there's still, I guess there probably still is a real active Animal Crossing community online, because I was thinking, wow, if I just got the game now, like most people I know quit playing that a long time ago, so there'd be nobody left to visit my village, but I guess there's still a pretty active community online somewhere, huh?
418247	419388	Chris, anything you wanted to add?
420215	423598	Well, I actually really did play World of Warcraft, because that's the only game.
424498	425319	Fuck you.
425739	426059	Fuck!
426480	427380	Shut up.
430182	434125	I had to spend a lot of time waiting for Megzi to get here, so I did that by playing WoW.
434185	436146	Although, I did it more as an experiment.
436286	447254	I have found if you go to any of the major areas where there are lots of people in traffic, and you have a girl character, and you start making her dance, watch how many guys decide to join in.
447494	448475	It's very funny.
450024	451345	It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not.
451605	454926	Not when you're a tauren, I'm finding out, because nobody wants to dance with a cow.
455306	457107	I like to dance with a cow.
457187	461509	It works well with the elves and sometimes the humans, just because there's a lot of traffic.
461849	463989	But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you.
465330	468231	It is, especially when you're sitting there knowing, wow, these guys have no clue.
468371	468811	Yeah, really.
469351	471632	Some guy asked me ASL, and I said male.
471652	474093	I said male, 42, Arizona.
474113	474153	No.
477041	478242	And he walked away.
479683	479964	Awesome.
480024	480544	It was very funny.
481305	483386	Uni's in our chat saying, I'm going to make a Draenei.
483486	484927	Dude, the Draenei chicks are hot.
486288	486689	They are.
486709	487309	Draenei.
487549	488050	Oh, my God.
488090	489591	I'd bang those if I could.
490192	492974	You know, I might be gay and all, but even if I think the Draenei chicks are hot, what can I say?
492994	493894	I just like their accent.
494074	494275	Yeah.
494555	494995	That's hot, too.
495175	496076	Not enough rage.
496897	497197	All right.
497277	498198	So there it is.
498558	499879	Conclusion of our gaming weeks.
500479	500620	So...
501918	504078	Let's do some real brief housekeeping here.
504699	505979	I have to keep this a little bit vague.
506019	509720	We were going to say a little more about it, but I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to.
510960	519221	Obviously, it pains us, journalistically, to have to go back and remove something that used to be there before.
519841	522042	Trust me, we did not enjoy doing that.
522242	528143	We didn't want to do it, but as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand, we kind of had to do it.
528832	533134	Um, unfortunately, Orange Lounge Radio is a hobby for us, and it doesn't pay the bills.
533594	536456	So when push comes to shove, um, things gotta change.
536876	539677	But, um, we also believe in karma.
539997	541158	What goes around comes around.
541898	549241	And, uh, I think what we do here is really great for the community, and we give a lot of publicity to a lot of, um, great up-and-coming games.
549441	550482	We don't get paid for it.
550642	552603	They don't pay for us to talk about their games.
553243	557325	And, uh, I guess the only impression we can kind of take away from this is that, um,
557731	558712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
585242	608373	GameStop had their financial conference call, I guess, their investor conference call, and the COO, Dan D'Amato, I think that's how you pronounce his name, was talking a little bit about the crippling Wii shortage that's been kind of happening ever since the system came out, and particularly bad with this month, or I should say last month, March,
609706	613548	He was quoted saying, I don't think it's going to be an issue going forward.
613588	621892	I think this is just my opinion, but I think Nintendo intentionally dried up the supply because they made their numbers for the year.
622272	626034	The new year starts April 1st, and I think we're going to see the supply flowing.
627434	632957	Now, it's interesting, of course, Nintendo responded to that saying, no, that's not true.
633037	637059	They never intended for a shortage to actually happen, and
638098	639120	and so on and so forth.
639180	651855	Of course, my opinion on that is, if they're really drying up the sources on purpose, they're not going to go, yeah, we're holding them back because we hit our numbers for the year, so sorry if you can't get one.
652075	653997	That's just going to piss people off.
655139	655559	Anyways,
657206	672700	Long story short, I don't know, I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers, but I know that the systems haven't been in stores for a long time, and I know at least distribution as a whole hasn't been able to get a hold of them for the month of March.
672820	683390	I mean, they pretty much allocated everything to retail, so what little there was in retail, I don't know if it's because they did it intentionally, or if it was just they were
684364	689548	Really behind and really can't make enough, you know, either way.
689988	691490	Hopefully it'll start getting better in April.
691890	694312	And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario.
694532	695272	April fools.
695833	696273	No, just kidding.
697494	705881	What I'm wondering, though, is, and this is something I've been kind of wondering about this week, is that I seem to remember last year, obviously Xbox 360 had some real shortage problems as well.
706441	712706	And we were pretty harsh with the Xbox 360 and Microsoft and, you know, why the F aren't there more systems out there and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
713346	717149	It seems like we've been a little more forgiving of Nintendo through all this.
717229	718349	I'm trying to figure out why that is.
718690	726134	Is that because they have more consoles out there on the market so that those of us diehards that really wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier?
726454	730317	Or is that because we were smarter about it this time when we all camped out and got them or did whatever we did?
730377	739783	I think we're just a little bit smarter about it and also the fact that, I mean, the 360 was kind of the first next-gen console so it was something you really had to have it.
740383	741584	A lot of times now it's like,
742065	743205	Well, the Wii's not out.
743345	748047	Oh, well, I'll just play my 360 or I'll just play my PlayStation 2 or something like that until it comes out.
748467	756289	There's really... And also, it'd be a little different if Super Mario Galaxy was out there now versus, you know, later or Smash Bros.
756709	757709	Brawl or something like that.
758230	761210	If that stuff was out there now, you know, that would be a little bit different.
761250	766152	But I mean, personally, I don't... But to be honest, Perfect Dark Zero was nothing to get that excited about for me.
766292	769353	I mean, and the Xbox launch games were nothing like, oh, I gotta have it.
769493	769773	True.
769793	769953	And...
771161	779369	I just wanted the system as a whole, you know, I don't know, the download, the live, I don't know, I just wanted the damn thing a year ago, you know, and I was frustrated when I couldn't get one.
779549	785034	I would think it'd be pretty dumb even if they are hitting their numbers to, you know, intentionally drive the market.
785274	788297	I don't think that's even, I mean, I just think they just can't produce enough of these.
788357	790779	I mean, it's even the issue with their accessories.
790819	797625	I mean, that's kind of a good, you know, point right there that they just don't have enough accessories out there even to, you know,
798112	808516	I guess I'm just wondering aloud here, are we being fair to Nintendo?
809276	811757	Are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft the same way?
812566	815968	Fuck no, they should be getting more systems out there because it's built on goddamn technology.
816028	817048	It's been out forever.
817328	818729	I mean, with the goddamn GameCube.
818809	820230	Produce more fucking systems.
820410	822951	And Duscap in our chatroom agrees with you.
823011	825773	Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube version 2?
826633	830015	SSJ on 100 Mount wants to know, how long did the 360 shortage last?
830375	833577	I got mine in February, but I think it was resolved in April, May.
833757	834417	It was May, yeah.
835540	836180	I work at GameStop.
836200	838841	It lasted until about mid-March, April.
838901	840342	You could walk into a store.
840362	843623	I think I saw the first available one around the end of January.
844783	848324	But seriously, though, they need to get on top of at least the systems out there.
848624	850325	I mean, okay, great.
850605	852586	They want to keep the demand up or something like that.
852746	853966	I think the demand's up there.
854026	855266	People want to buy this thing.
855346	860128	And if it's any kind of indicator, you basically show your friends this thing.
860328	860828	Game System.
860848	865849	If they don't have it yet, after playing with it for a little bit, they're just like, God, I gotta get one of my own.
866229	874912	I would think you would want as many systems out there as possible to get as many impressions as possible to sell even more systems, which in turn, you sell more software, make more money.
875412	877632	So, I don't think they're doing it on purpose.
878572	884174	And, I mean, everyone's kind of running with this, you know, before because it's the CEO, it's his opinion.
884434	885534	And that's it.
885674	887375	I mean, it's as valid as my opinion.
887475	889155	So, I don't know.
889778	891279	We don't know, you can only speculate.
891559	896182	All that matters is, it's April now, more systems in stores.
897883	901906	Well, at least we do have some good news, and this is no joke.
903867	915255	Nintendo and Sega have both stated that Miyamoto is going to be part of the development of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
915275	915635	So...
919159	931346	They're actually talking specifically that there are going to be, not just that there's a number of different titles, from what I'm seeing anyway, but the game is being created by Sega with work by Miyamoto.
932787	938791	I'm sorry, when it comes down to the 500 meter dash or whatever the hell it is, Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario.
939531	940692	Mario's a big fat plumber.
940912	942693	He's going to tear his ass open.
942713	944214	Who lives on a diet of mushrooms.
945868	949152	Megsie's pointing at her shirt getting upset because she's wearing Flying Mario.
949472	954939	Okay, but in defense, Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to the high jump and shit like that because he's got hops.
955260	956621	But fucking Sonic will beat him.
956861	958924	What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?
961147	961527	Yeah.
961928	965252	Well, Sonic can go faster than the goddamn speed of sound, so there.
968883	976124	I think Mario will also have Sonic beat in the ability to make a good next-gen game competition.
978325	979305	But you know who will win?
979645	984946	Nintendo and Sega, because they have tricked you into buying a goddamn Olympics game.
986626	993048	If history has shown you anything, Olympics games suck really bad.
993688	994008	So...
994787	996568	You know, personally, I don't know.
996608	998870	If this gets you interested in the Olympics, hooray.
999890	1000671	I'm not falling for it.
1000691	1002031	I ain't buying this shit.
1002992	1004253	Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.
1004573	1006414	FunnyDL had a really quick comment on the last story.
1006534	1010597	People, Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now and fans keep buying their bullshit.
1010997	1015299	Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage or the Nintendo 64 shortages?
1016100	1016900	No, you must be old.
1017561	1018121	No, I'm just kidding.
1018762	1022164	I wasn't really following gaming back then as closely as I am now.
1022204	1024325	I mean, a little bit, but, you know, I was much younger and
1024673	1029854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1053240	1054601	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1076608	1080630	This games magazine, Game Reactor, put this image up on the internet.
1080650	1081931	And then, of course, it caught wildfire.
1081971	1084872	They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image of Knights.
1084932	1087833	But there it is, a world exclusive on Knights.
1087953	1092776	And I'm sure they just beat the punch to some American publication that's going to have the same thing.
1092996	1096177	Well, actually, we learned about that previously in the teaser thing.
1096197	1098918	And I was going to say, there's also been screenshots out there now, too.
1099018	1100199	So it looks kind of cool.
1101658	1102779	Now here's a question, though.
1102859	1109582	You know, Sonic games as of late, ever since the Dreamcast, have not been that great.
1109782	1117605	So is this Sega's chance to redeem themselves, or should we just prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment?
1117965	1119306	I want another Clockwork Knights.
1120626	1122827	DarkSakura, I know you've been a longtime Sonic fan.
1122867	1124328	What are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii?
1124348	1125608	Do you think they can make a good one?
1125888	1126269	Happy.
1126789	1127189	Happy.
1127209	1127309	Happy.
1127974	1131056	What if it turns out like Sonic on 360 and PS3?
1131317	1131777	It can't.
1131937	1132357	It's on the Wii.
1133718	1134999	You think that'll be at Saving Grace?
1135399	1136780	Wii!
1137381	1145146	To be honest, though, I mean, it's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog, so control issues won't be that big of a problem, I'm hoping.
1145406	1145727	I hope.
1147008	1147388	We'll see.
1147888	1148549	Well, there it is.
1148989	1150570	Nights is confirmed and coming out.
1152411	1156294	Not to say told you so, but... But yeah.
1156772	1159754	Megzi, wait, wait, before we get into the next story, Megzi, you're squeeing over there.
1160634	1162195	I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie.
1162235	1167337	As a Knights fangirl, I mean, Sega's kind of done a lot of misfires lately.
1167858	1169598	What's going to stop them from misfiring this one?
1169759	1170619	Because it's Knights.
1172380	1176622	But Sonic was cool, and Sonic on PlayStation 3 and 360 was not fun.
1177522	1178543	Okay, that's Sonic.
1181520	1183381	Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.
1184242	1184702	You know what?
1184762	1186884	It will be good because it is nights, period.
1188385	1192888	But, okay, Mario is Missing had Mario in it, and it wasn't that much fun.
1192928	1194789	Mario is Missing was the shit.
1196751	1197831	You're just easy to please.
1197911	1198312	I don't know.
1199152	1200113	I don't know what else to think.
1200133	1201754	I have no idea.
1202074	1203375	Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?
1204156	1205637	I said you have no idea.
1205997	1206938	Ooh la la.
1208038	1208739	Any who hates...
1210259	1214501	and that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it.
1214822	1220065	The E3 event or E3-like event that you can go to because it's open to the public.
1221185	1222086	God help us all.
1222746	1234173	Anyways, so one reason you're probably going to want to go there other than the fact that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of...
1235615	1236275	Huge lineup.
1236355	1244099	Hopefully by that time we'll see the big Super Mario Galaxy and Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.
1244579	1246820	But it should be interesting.
1246840	1251902	I know, especially if they're on board, then it's likely other people will jump on board as well.
1253242	1256044	So anyways, E for Everyone or E for All.
1256264	1259145	It's going to be coming October in LA.
1259265	1262126	Same place as the original E3.
1262526	1263127	And only $100 to get in.
1264921	1268802	and there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.
1269902	1272082	Wow, that's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.
1272142	1275703	I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there?
1276443	1276883	You know what?
1277103	1279124	I have to admit, I'm interested.
1279344	1281984	I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.
1282104	1285865	I think I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.
1286425	1288885	200,000 people in half the exhibition space.
1289746	1291526	Yeah, that's going to be very uncomfortable.
1291586	1291846	I don't know.
1292170	1294611	But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.
1294971	1295331	I don't know.
1295391	1297012	That is a very lofty goal.
1297752	1299352	But E3 was crowded as it is.
1299453	1300273	I mean, I don't know.
1300793	1307155	But I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because we did not feel the love.
1307555	1313077	Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some reason it didn't happen.
1313097	1315038	I don't know what possibly went wrong there.
1315118	1318699	But, yeah, we're not going to E3.
1318859	1319820	Well, I'm not.
1320060	1320660	Loki's not.
1323201	1323621	I am!
1324302	1327003	You know when E3 started going down?
1327103	1329383	You know what was the mark of it starting to go down?
1329403	1330804	It was that they got rid of the booth babes.
1334485	1335305	No, no, no.
1335325	1343468	The mark of it going down was having to fight my way around a crowd that's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.
1343968	1346429	That's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark.
1346489	1349650	When Paris Hilton was getting those kinds of lines at E3, I was like,
1350740	1353181	What's wrong with this picture?
1355022	1355742	But the booth babes?
1356503	1358584	Well, there'll be booth babes at E4ALL, I'm sure.
1359264	1359564	There you go.
1359584	1360785	Are you going to go to E4ALL, maybe?
1360905	1361225	I don't know.
1361665	1362966	I'm thinking about it.
1363546	1363826	I don't know.
1363866	1365187	I want to know a little more about it.
1365407	1369089	I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be the must-have?
1369109	1371030	Seriously, am I going to pay $100 to wait?
1372891	1399923	5 hours to play a game I mean seriously there's 200,000 if 200,000 people actually are first off I don't know that that could actually work especially with like fire codes and stuff but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000 people in there as it was last year with E3 70,000 people I believe and it was fucking crowded and now you have half the space and more than double the people fuck that
1400789	1403111	JV Mon says $200,000 could be a typo.
1403171	1403731	Maybe they meant to say $20,000.
1404111	1405472	$20,000 is not bad.
1405612	1407513	I'll do $20,000.
1407553	1412596	And that's not a bad showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.
1412636	1417219	If they can pull off $20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first year out the gate.
1417399	1418520	So, well, we'll see.
1418740	1420161	Best of luck to E4ALL.
1420681	1422762	And I think I'm going to go.
1422883	1424764	I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it.
1425044	1425784	I want to go.
1425864	1427185	I want to go to E3, though.
1428526	1430167	Well, we don't always get what we want, sadly.
1431192	1442455	Like I said, we give free publicity games on this show, so if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your work cut out for you, Jamie.
1443515	1444736	Hey, I'm amazing.
1444916	1447076	You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?
1447376	1448056	Like we did last year?
1451137	1451497	Chirp.
1452658	1453958	So guess what's not live?
1454338	1454858	Zombies.
1455578	1456659	They're in Resident Evil.
1456939	1458259	My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.
1458911	1460272	That's okay, your face looks like one too.
1460412	1460652	Hey!
1462113	1464435	So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?
1465536	1474803	It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, is going to be at 480p, progressive scan, 16 to 9 widescreen.
1476244	1476805	Isn't that great?
1478085	1482109	Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this or whatever.
1482169	1483830	I mean, hooray for, you know...
1484281	1485802	Doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.
1485842	1489425	It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.
1490086	1496551	There will be after the Capcom Gamers Day thing, which I think that's in the next couple weeks here.
1497012	1504518	There's been mumblings that that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers Day.
1505499	1507040	Because they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?
1507381	1511404	Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.
1512185	1512625	That's true.
1513697	1514838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1533903	1544632	Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter 2 Turbo is going to be making its way to Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter 2 just came out not that long ago.
1544692	1548075	It's kind of like, obviously Street Fighter 2 Turbo was the superior game.
1548455	1550157	I don't know why anyone would want to have both.
1550677	1555461	You know, at least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between the games.
1555841	1557963	But now it's kind of like, sucker.
1559525	1561106	And you still can't play it online.
1561806	1562807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1588280	1617713	Final Fight Arcade I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console but these are a little more exciting other Virtual Console releases because Hudson updated an official list so we know these will be happening for sure Bonk's Revenge which I assume comes as a surprise to no one will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console also Bravo Man Shock Man and Battle Lode Runner which is kind of cool because Lode Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love
1618117	1624939	And I have to be honest, I'm not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting very excited over this game, so it must be good.
1626020	1627420	You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.
1627440	1628361	Do you know Battle of Lode Runner?
1629321	1629741	Actually, no.
1630601	1630961	Interesting.
1631362	1633242	Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.
1633282	1641245	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week.
1642166	1644147	And we've got some good stuff coming out in the U.S.
1644628	1652953	It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2, we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.
1653614	1655375	It's kind of a good kids game, I guess.
1656595	1665921	If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones, or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.
1666102	1667002	I have a random question.
1667062	1669444	Can you use a karaoke revolution mic with these games?
1669584	1669704	No.
1669724	1669764	No.
1671135	1671895	Bastards!
1672455	1681298	But hey, you know, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of them, and it's the normal price of, like, Karaoke Revolution, so.
1681398	1681918	Well, I know.
1682238	1685099	I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but, you know.
1685679	1687379	Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.
1687859	1688159	Anyways.
1688179	1690140	I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.
1690300	1691500	Yeah.
1691700	1698802	Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that
1699204	1704745	PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Pimp My Ride, Rappala Trophies, on the 360, on the Playstation 3, Enchanted Arms,
1728519	1730260	Same damn game as before.
1730280	1732020	I believe they added maybe a few things to it.
1732900	1735181	And, see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia, Rival Sword.
1735201	1735821	I already said that.
1735861	1736181	Let's see.
1736542	1738902	Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out.
1739502	1740803	Also a port of the GameCube game.
1741823	1742183	Let's see.
1742383	1747085	On PC, um... The Sims 2 Celebration.
1747805	1748725	That looks kind of neat.
1749646	1755568	And a bunch of other crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way.
1756388	1756968	And, um...
1757352	1759314	I thought you were getting my copy early.
1760575	1761155	What happened?
1761275	1762376	It comes out Wednesday.
1786778	1788740	I still miss... I'm working on it.
1789340	1791022	Pull through for me.
1791042	1793824	I have to be the coolest kid on the block and have it before anyone else.
1794625	1797287	What do you mean you have it?
1797307	1797848	You're a liar.
1798048	1798588	April Fools.
1798989	1799369	Megzy.
1800350	1802392	Full of lies and loos.
1802972	1803893	Alright, just get hard.
1804053	1804293	Love ya.
1804574	1808717	Alright, well let's move on to more release dates.
1808777	1809398	How about the U.K. ?
1811585	1813445	Well, here's what we've got coming out.
1813846	1816346	On the 5th, we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords.
1817946	1820847	We also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360.
1821487	1829689	On the 6th, we have Frontline Fields of Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and The Red Star on PS2.
1831229	1833090	I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.
1834210	1834710	What's that about?
1836022	1836523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1858908	1860269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1886727	1890629	It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have a ball.
1891089	1901333	PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.
1901953	1909937	Netsu Chu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachislot Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love your pachinko.
1911197	1912738	It looks like some sexy ladies there.
1913547	1914388	Gambling Sim with Sexy Ladies
1932887	1933747	I have no fucking clue.
1934547	1935188	But you played it?
1935268	1942970	I was in Japan and they told me, like, you gotta play pachinko because it's like one of those Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.
1943470	1947831	And so I went to this pachinko parlor and put like $10 in and it ate my $10.
1948031	1948891	I didn't know what to do.
1949571	1950531	It's basic, okay.
1950912	1953752	I don't know the basics of the game, I'm sure somebody... It's legalized gambling.
1953772	1955073	It's pretty much legalized gambling.
1955153	1955933	You sit there, you put...
1957557	1960498	You put these little metal balls in certain spots.
1960539	1964581	I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little metal balls.
1966822	1968402	I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.
1970003	1977207	And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes... Yeah, shut up!
1977227	1978888	This game sounds fucking hot!
1980202	1984224	You can exchange those for prizes or you can usually go around the corner and get money for them.
1984425	1988967	Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and what not and it gives you money.
1989347	1991669	But Rob makes me too gross.
1992609	1994550	I've collected a lot of balls over the years.
1994651	1995471	Where's my prize?
1997132	1999113	I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.
2000414	2001775	You have your own set of balls.
2001855	2003716	Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.
2004963	2011108	That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant, very similar to the ones that would serve Rocky Mountain Oysters, you know?
2011749	2012590	Rack of lamb?
2012830	2013671	Rack of balls?
2016773	2020036	Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.
2021498	2025041	Do you even care what's coming out on Nintendo DS in Japan?
2025101	2025621	Sure you do.
2025721	2031246	Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.
2032597	2050260	and of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover but I assume that this is like a simulation game that teaches you manners because you can pick A, B, C and it looks like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever so this is interesting to say the least.
2051280	2056261	Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.
2056321	2057602	Isn't that series ever going to die?
2057622	2058322	I like that.
2058842	2059382	Probably never.
2059402	2060182	Yab is old.
2061220	2066121	And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam games.
2066541	2069401	Rengo vs. ZAFT Portable.
2071262	2072802	There you have it, Japanese release dates.
2074382	2075062	Aren't we happy?
2075763	2076403	We are happy.
2076803	2083564	One thing, though, that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting yet another firmware, 3.30.
2084804	2086584	And what will it give you?
2086785	2088505	Well, some interesting stuff.
2088665	2089285	For example...
2090753	2115295	you can have some brand new video sizes including full screen video now at 480x272 the native resolution of the PSP somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution for which is actually DVD resolution that's 480p I don't know how the hell that's going to fit since there's not that many pixels on the damn screen but okay sure
2116330	2126820	Um, and then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, um, which I believe is the T-Mobile hotspots and you get like 60 days, uh, like a trial for that or something.
2127521	2131024	Um, it will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there.
2131124	2139232	So, you know, you may want to wait a little bit because, um, let's see.
2139571	2147235	because there's some good news and that is that like most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.
2147836	2157381	And yeah, it's been cracked already and actually the rumor is that Dark Galaxy is working on a custom firmware for 3.30.
2158342	2163025	So I would say give it a couple more weeks and you'll probably see this on the internet.
2164085	2167947	Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a...
2169656	2173698	was a TA-82 PSP motherboard in there.
2174479	2176780	And you have the custom firmware already on there.
2176800	2179481	If you try to upgrade to this, it may break your PSP.
2179541	2182983	So you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have the custom firmware in there.
2183043	2183803	So just be careful.
2185464	2188566	Well, better hope that people heed that, right?
2189066	2189266	Yes.
2190127	2196330	Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's really surprised by this.
2196940	2199201	David Hader, Blood Elves, World of Warcraft
2227159	2227859	He's awesome.
2228419	2231560	He also, like, wrote the first X-Men movie, too.
2232060	2232480	Really?
2233080	2233701	The first two movies.
2233721	2234241	He wrote it?
2234721	2234921	Yes.
2235381	2236361	I did not know that about him.
2236461	2237201	I'm so sorry, guys.
2237221	2238702	My voice is giving out so bad tonight.
2239822	2241922	Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.
2243323	2244983	Oh, I didn't realize that's what he did.
2245903	2247544	You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know.
2247564	2248664	And he also did Applebee's commercials.
2249704	2250785	I found his voice real.
2251205	2252545	I want my baby back, baby back.
2253180	2255781	Oh, Drew Nami says, no, David Hayter did not do the Blood Elves.
2255841	2258202	Well, somebody pulled an April Fool's joke on me then.
2258902	2259302	Bastards.
2260883	2263144	I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.
2264324	2264645	My bad.
2265065	2274288	Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I think, for the game.
2276029	2277730	Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?
2277870	2280411	But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.
2280871	2281191	Oh, cool.
2282879	2286020	They still have to do the translations.
2286480	2287041	I guess that's true.
2287181	2290842	The game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.
2292402	2300125	Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.
2300165	2304887	They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than Talladega Nights was.
2304927	2307428	That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.
2307928	2308168	But
2308621	2313550	They were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network and then the first 20,000 were going to get their movie.
2314011	2315153	But nobody's gotten it yet.
2315609	2317069	Casino Royale is fucking awesome.
2317149	2318630	I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.
2318850	2319770	It's so good.
2319930	2322130	I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.
2323031	2324951	It's not all I freaking talk about.
2325091	2328012	Have you seen the new Bond movie?
2328072	2329012	It's freaking hot.
2329092	2334273	Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie because it's really good and you should see it too.
2334593	2337334	I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either and it was really good.
2337614	2339014	No, I hate fucking Bond.
2339034	2340234	You know, this just isn't working out.
2342315	2344135	I love it when lesbians fight on this program.
2345273	2345694	Let's see.
2346254	2357560	Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember, you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets mailed to you.
2357980	2358160	Ouch.
2360478	2363741	Perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.
2363921	2367424	Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation 3.
2367684	2368585	It was bundled in there.
2369065	2373829	Well, it was bundled in and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?
2374169	2374509	That's true.
2374529	2376211	It was like a real special something, huh?
2376851	2380494	Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.
2382776	2383396	You're special ed.
2383416	2385078	You're special ed.
2385098	2389081	Last night... So you may be waiting a while to get your
2389874	2391675	Copy of Casino Royale.
2392275	2397278	Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation 3.
2398679	2408264	According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.
2408904	2417269	And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful platform and developing technology and products for
2417702	2447391	and their plan on developing technology and products for this console says however we believe that the install base will be high enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year so not only do you have to wait until 2008 you have to wait until the second half of 2008 which fiscal year for most companies is from I believe April to April I want to say or March to March or something like that so second half would actually be fall of 2008 no Tomb Raider on Playstation 3 for you
2447901	2454644	You know what, I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises could this affect?
2456505	2457005	Juice X?
2458445	2459146	I'm trying to remember.
2459166	2463107	Eidos, recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.
2463167	2466409	They were doing, like, Battle Stations, Midway.
2467229	2468890	I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.
2469430	2470690	Thief, Hitman.
2471030	2471671	Hitman, yeah.
2471791	2472851	Oh, that's a pretty big series.
2472911	2473471	Okay, there you go.
2474592	2474812	Huh.
2475925	2486832	Well, I don't know, none of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted to try, Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and I just, I haven't, you know, so many games, so little time.
2487513	2490775	And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there, too.
2490795	2496059	That's true, that's true, it looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain, too, forgot about that.
2497480	2501202	Alright, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008.
2502878	2503178	DarkSakura.com
2533860	2537681	Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random.
2538241	2539762	And it's transmission.org.
2540722	2543683	It's t-r-a-n-s-mission.org.
2544263	2549145	And it's a UK website for the club scene for transvestites.
2551446	2551946	So I'm done.
2555167	2556828	Did you actually browse the website?
2556848	2558808	I mean, what kind of... I was looking for shoes.
2560109	2560809	You were looking for...
2561280	2561620	Wait a minute.
2561640	2562981	I was looking for shoes.
2563141	2564282	Stop the damn music for a minute.
2565102	2573386	How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual clubs in Britain?
2573786	2579730	Because there's a link on here, on their links page, there's a shops link and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.
2580670	2581050	These shoes are $300.
2581090	2584992	These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.
2585352	2586333	Let's get them!
2587398	2588138	So, yeah.
2588158	2589158	You started it wrong.
2589178	2589999	You started it wrong.
2590019	2591099	I guess I, I don't know.
2591119	2592059	I guess I deserve that.
2592139	2592459	I don't know.
2592759	2593719	Let me borrow that top.
2594039	2596740	Well, Kelly is a pretty, pretty famous transit.
2596760	2597920	You want the rest of my water bottle for now?
2598500	2598940	I'm not sick.
2598960	2599881	Okay.
2599901	2601741	Let me go, let me go bribe people.
2602901	2603161	All right.
2603621	2605642	Chris is going to go bribe people, try to get us some drinks.
2605662	2607022	I'm going to give people some blowjobs.
2607042	2607322	All right.
2607382	2607722	Anyhow.
2610403	2617124	Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NC Soft and ArenaNet because they are putting out
2617543	2621305	Guild Wars 2 is coming out in the second half of 2008 officially announced
2645236	2648399	And they are going to follow what worked for them with Guild Wars.
2648939	2650861	No monthly subscription fee.
2651762	2655325	But the world will always be available just like the original Guild Wars.
2655345	2657747	So that's kind of cool, especially for those folks in the Guild Wars.
2658308	2665494	But what I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?
2665734	2669618	I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.
2669698	2670239	EverQuest 2...
2671004	2675266	didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got because people didn't want to leave their characters behind.
2675626	2683769	So I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate or if because, eh, I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there'll be some extra incentive.
2685650	2698356	I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2 just to, you know, make people buy everything they want.
2698416	2698896	So there you go.
2699642	2700763	Gotta collect them all!
2702224	2703284	Gotta get them all!
2730430	2735034	And her article this week was, Lady, get off the road.
2735675	2739298	And it's basically talking about, Men say women are bad drivers.
2739398	2745883	This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license photo to prove it.
2746423	2749146	I take my on-road duties seriously.
2750166	2751848	And basically her complaint is,
2754933	2768778	I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?
2769118	2774180	But she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.
2774260	2776481	No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.
2777021	2781243	She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper-to-bumper trying to go across the Bay Bridge.
2782008	2783629	Text messaging while driving.
2784209	2785810	You can't text message break up!
2785830	2787771	You can't text message break up!
2788571	2793453	So, yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.
2793914	2796075	True story, I am not shitting you.
2796135	2799216	That takes a special kind of loser.
2799336	2801457	This is why you women get a bad rap.
2802477	2803378	Exactly!
2804722	2806544	You wanna know why men get a bad rap?
2806564	2807265	Sure.
2807305	2808046	Small penis cars.
2808106	2808687	Bring it, bring it.
2808787	2814934	Every single fucking time I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.
2815014	2815975	What the hell is that car called?
2817057	2817617	What is that car?
2818218	2818779	It's like a Ford...
2821197	2823839	I don't know, it's one of the new little beamers I've got.
2824239	2832024	So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that they've got a bigger cock than I do.
2832184	2834966	I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.
2835986	2842570	Now what you boys don't know is that Chris has a very big cock in her top dresser drawer.
2842870	2844992	Exactly, and it vibrates.
2845432	2846673	Beat that motherfucker.
2848183	2848924	Not as big as mine.
2849284	2849704	That's right.
2849885	2850825	Hers is detachable, though.
2851366	2854929	So... Shut up, Rob.
2855430	2857471	But, yeah, you men are just as bad.
2857491	2858012	Lesbian sex.
2858032	2860714	Men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that, Kurt.
2861535	2864778	Okay, and maybe... Okay, so... Sorry, do you want to finish the article?
2864798	2865398	Yeah, yeah, I want to finish.
2865699	2872144	Anyways, so they go on to complain, basically, that men, you know, are, you know, driving fast and they're breaking...
2873246	2875887	And they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.
2875927	2880328	They're all, just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.
2880428	2883369	Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.
2883729	2886750	They've got awful driving written all over them.
2887411	2890152	Yeah, I don't think games are reality.
2890592	2890992	Duh.
2891032	2893913	You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!
2894213	2895533	I get extra points for that!
2895873	2897194	No, I'm not a retard, okay?
2897314	2897454	So...
2898331	2899933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2914938	2915559	That's the difference.
2915899	2919302	Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?
2919362	2925387	That's why, you know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great.
2925467	2928670	Then we can go out there and play that, and you'll have something to play.
2929070	2942281	But, and I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are, you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that.
2943124	2945024	But usually I let them pass me, no problem.
2945144	2951406	But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway, talking on her cell phone, swerving all over the place, not using her signal.
2952186	2956807	And, you know, goddamn, might as well stop and back up on the freeway.
2956827	2958807	And I have seen that, by the way, before.
2960647	2961568	That's what pisses me off.
2961588	2964888	And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples.
2965068	2967809	Actually, a lot, a lot, a lot of bad apples out there, too.
2967869	2969089	Kind of spoiled a bunch, and...
2969946	2974268	You know, women should just get pissed off at these stupid people who drive... It's really SUV drivers.
2975408	2978369	I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.
2979290	2980890	I actually have to agree with you.
2981851	2985232	Those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with fire.
2986052	2986573	And you know what?
2986593	2989094	The guys that speed out there, they end up crashing anyway.
2989174	2990574	So it's all bad drivers.
2991054	2992235	I'm sorry, I missed something.
2992275	2993775	What the fuck does this have to do with games?
2993855	2995076	It doesn't have to do anything with games.
2995666	2997487	Why the fuck did you bring this story up then?
2997887	3005810	Because it was on Joystick, and because it was... And because it's basically, they're talking about Need for Speed, Excite Truck, and Burnout, and stuff like that.
3006770	3010171	Kind of blaming, I guess... So what, is that how the article reads?
3010511	3016373	Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop texting, blah, blah, blah.
3016494	3017054	That's what I read.
3017074	3018734	Excite Truck, Burnout, okay, thanks.
3019094	3019455	Is that it?
3019715	3020455	That's what I read.
3020555	3022456	That's how my guy filter went through that.
3022496	3023256	You know, that's basically...
3023746	3025568	It's like, squawk, squawk, squawk.
3026608	3027209	Meds suck.
3027249	3028190	Squawk, squawk, squawk.
3028670	3030071	I thought that was your wife talking to you.
3031152	3031493	Oh, no.
3031773	3032053	Or me.
3032453	3032754	Or me.
3034455	3037818	Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.
3038779	3039779	That's right, that's right.
3039940	3044083	I'm going 120 miles on the freeway wondering why somebody going 80 is in my way.
3044103	3049307	Okay, I'm going to go find people.
3049347	3049588	Next!
3049808	3050368	Okay.
3050729	3050969	Wow.
3051744	3058448	Oh, by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills at racing since because they need to practice.
3058828	3063671	Women, they're already such good drivers that they could squander their free time on destruction.
3065952	3066812	So, SmackDown.
3067673	3068553	Wait, wait, wait.
3068894	3071295	Are you politely commenting for a reason here?
3071355	3075017	Because anytime there's a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it.
3075037	3076878	But tonight, strangely quiet.
3077218	3080520	I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in or if you just
3082339	3084141	I don't know.
3084401	3085602	I'm trying to get a feel.
3085802	3087103	What is going through Jamie's mind?
3088044	3092748	Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective.
3094030	3094810	Moving forward.
3095791	3097653	Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.
3099194	3100695	What does that have to do with anything?
3100715	3102397	It has to do with bad driving and good driving.
3103438	3104859	So how about Smackdown, right?
3105920	3107962	There's going to be some Smackdown in here pretty soon.
3109575	3117641	on a new Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 edition to be on the PS3, Wii, DS, also a bunch of other shit.
3118501	3132871	So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system, you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff.
3133849	3147555	and some of the fan requested updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience, out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff.
3147935	3153978	But I just think SmackDown vs. Raw is funny because it's like, you know, wrestling is like soap opera for guys.
3155902	3157543	Well, can you retire... Not this guy.
3157883	3165185	Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start your own reality show that appears on VH1?
3165286	3167086	You know, stuff like that.
3167126	3169567	Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan, though, he comes back a year later.
3169587	3172808	It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right?
3172988	3173389	Or whatever?
3174949	3176650	I'm so gay, obviously.
3177070	3178150	I don't know what I'm talking about.
3178590	3179831	Alright, well...
3180640	3185564	I, uh, you like the last SmackDown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up, DarkSakura?
3185744	3187186	Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.
3188286	3192170	And, um, who puts the SmackDown when you and Dan do battle in SmackDown?
3192770	3194612	Um, I just make characters and make him use them.
3195112	3195392	I see.
3195773	3197514	I usually make really kick-ass characters, though.
3197974	3207042	Like, on the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was, like, this really pretty boy in Degeneration X, and then we just let him play in, um, in, uh,
3208012	3212214	On Watch Mode, where you could just watch all the matches, and he won every single match, had all the belts.
3213154	3214434	We even put him in a women's match.
3216555	3218516	That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game.
3218596	3220396	But still, he had all the belts.
3220797	3221497	He was fucking awesome.
3222077	3222497	All right.
3222597	3223818	I just remember because he was pretty.
3225198	3225658	Pretty Boy.
3225698	3227599	Was that his wrestling name, Pretty Boy?
3227779	3233601	No, he had some cool name, but he was just... I think his name was actually just Mr. X. How original.
3234241	3234521	All right.
3235342	3236402	Macy, what, you had something to say?
3237734	3238995	Macy has a joke about wrestling.
3239035	3239475	Sure, why not?
3239815	3242637	We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with a joke.
3243397	3246219	The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.
3248080	3248640	How's that?
3249621	3252242	Just watch professional wrestling and then watch some gay porn.
3252903	3255464	Not much difference.
3255484	3255744	All right.
3255904	3257465	Some advice from Macy there.
3258606	3258926	All right.
3258986	3260687	Well, we are going to take a quick break here.
3262588	3265670	Hey, the lesbians saw boobies.
3267139	3268941	What are you looking at here?
3269061	3275566	I'm on Destructoid, and I'm just scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore69, Celebrity Boobs, and Nakedness, etc.
3275986	3282812	And they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller on there.
3284113	3285534	Is it like an April Fool's joke or something?
3285554	3285954	I don't know.
3286214	3287535	I'm just scrolling down.
3288076	3290918	They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.
3292179	3293020	I do like that site.
3293060	3293600	It's a lot of fun.
3294641	3295622	Alright, um...
3296095	3298857	I guess that's going to do it though for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
3298877	3304541	And if you're thinking, gosh, this was a little short, well, you know, don't forget we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was a separate show.
3304961	3309304	But we will be back for your full Part B right after a quick little segment here.
3309805	3313848	And coming up in Part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite because there's a lot on that.
3313868	3319892	We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers, Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.
3319952	3325756	Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.
