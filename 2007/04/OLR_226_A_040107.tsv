14000	16000	Tonight April 1st, 2007
16000	19000	It's no joke that Sonic and Mario are teaming up for an Olympic game
19000	22000	The Xbox 360 Elite gets officially unveiled
22000	27000	When we talk about who is already upset with the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer
27000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week
36000	39000	No really this time of Orange Lounge Radio
39000	42000	We are that internet podcast dedicated to video game culture
42000	45000	The gaming lifestyle and what you the gamer really want to know about
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura
49000	50000	Jamie Summers
50000	51000	Yo
51000	52000	How you doing Jamie?

55000	57000	Also joining us tonight say hello to Tech Master Loki
57000	58000	Hello
58000	59000	How you doing Loki?
59000	60000	I'm doing good
60000	62000	Alright we have some special guests in the studio tonight
62000	64000	They helped us out with our little April Fools joke tonight
64000	67000	If you didn't check it out the reason why you may not have gotten it
67000	71000	Is because we are going to push the April Fools joke show
71000	74000	Right around the same time we push out this show
74000	77000	So iTunes may not catch it but we wanted to build it that way
77000	80000	So that you know those folks that want to skip through the April Fools joke
80000	83000	Cause you know April Fools is lame or whatever can do that
83000	86000	But those that want to hear what a really funny job Chris and Megsy
86000	90000	And well myself and everybody else did with that can hear it
90000	93000	So there you have it Chris is here tonight everybody
93000	94000	Hi Rob
94000	97000	And she is a lesbian but not the giggling type
97000	98000	No I'm not
98000	101000	Well once in a while if I tell a funny joke she might giggle
101000	103000	Yeah laugh like a hyena is more like it
103000	107000	Alright and joining us all the way from Wisconsin say hello to Megsy
107000	108000	Hi
108000	109000	How you doing Megsy?
109000	110000	I'm okay
110000	112000	Thanks for your help with the show earlier appreciate it
112000	113000	Oh hi
113000	114000	Hi
114000	117000	She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something so
117000	119000	Yeah I'm looking at porn
119000	121000	Hot are you down low on lesbian porn on my Mac?
121000	122000	Hells yeah
122000	123000	Hot right
123000	126000	Well anyway again you know our April Fools joke was all in good fun
126000	130000	If you don't know what it is yet go back in the podcast archive and check it out
130000	133000	But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight
133000	135000	Just a little bit of a disclaimer first though
135000	139000	Because we want to say that it is April Fools day today
139000	142000	So we've been trying to be very careful in what stories we picked out tonight
142000	145000	We didn't take any extra submissions for our show roll after last night
145000	148000	And we're not going to be accepting any last minute submissions through our chat room today
148000	153000	As we usually do just because we're going to try to keep it as legitimate as possible
153000	158000	First off also we did our gaming weeks in the previous show
158000	160000	But I want to see if anybody wanted to expand on that
160000	162000	Because I know we were being a little silly in the April Fools show
162000	166000	Does anybody have anything they want to say in their gaming week that they didn't say in the previous show?
166000	169000	I really didn't get a pin bot
169000	171000	Aww I'm sorry to hear pin bot sounds awesome though
171000	174000	I know I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one
174000	176000	You know you weren't here last week we missed you
176000	178000	I had the plague, the disease
178000	182000	But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino
182000	185000	And I totally thought of you and I wish I could have stole it for you
185000	187000	I has played one
187000	189000	At California Extreme or whatever they call it?
189000	190000	Yep
190000	192000	I want to go to that this year sounds hot
192000	193000	It was great
193000	194000	Anything you wanted to add Loki?
194000	197000	I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters
197000	198000	It's kind of cool
198000	202000	It's like a shoot em up game I guess
202000	203000	I don't know
203000	210000	It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard
210000	213000	But it's fun we're checking it out it's a free download
213000	216000	I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing
216000	219000	So if you want the link to it check that out
219000	221000	But you got to be a friend
221000	223000	community.allgames.com
223000	225000	You got to be one of my friends and I'll be able to get the link
225000	226000	So there you go
226000	229000	There's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here
229000	230000	So you should check it out
230000	232000	It's just an awesome game
232000	234000	That's all I meant
234000	235000	Of course
235000	236000	Alright
236000	238000	My gaming week what I really played
238000	240000	I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit
240000	243000	But with a listener of the program not a stupid boy
243000	244000	We were cracking each other up
244000	246000	But I also played a lot of Castlevania 70 of the night
246000	248000	Just trying to make my way through that
248000	249000	Which of course I love
249000	251000	You know what I surprisingly liked a lot though
251000	253000	Is Jetpack Refueled I didn't think I'd like this game
253000	255000	Because I thought it looked a little cheesy
255000	257000	But I think that's kind of why I like it
257000	259000	Is because it really does remind me of
259000	261000	You know an old Commodore 64 type game
261000	263000	Which you know well it kind of was
263000	265000	So but it's the type of game I totally grew up on
265000	267000	And they really did give it an overhaul
267000	269000	For Xbox 360
269000	271000	You know it's only five bucks
271000	273000	I think it's a good like
273000	275000	Like an 80's arcade type game
275000	277000	It's just that instead of getting the same old
277000	279000	Root Beer Tapper, Joust those type of games
279000	281000	It's like something you may not have played before
281000	283000	And it's kind of fun
283000	285000	I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet though
285000	287000	So I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game
287000	289000	But for five bucks honestly so far
289000	290000	It's not a bad deal
290000	291000	And I apologize about my voice
291000	293000	And to the chatters in our chat room
293000	295000	At chat.orangelandradio.com
295000	297000	Who say I still sound like a woman
297000	298000	From the previous show
298000	300000	Screw you I have no voice left
300000	301000	From yelling a lot last night
301000	303000	I was at Rocky Horror MCing
303000	304000	So I have like no voice
304000	306000	I've been drinking hot tea all night
306000	308000	To try and make myself feel better
308000	310000	Chris is amazing
310000	312000	Oh I'm sorry Tetris Evolution
312000	314000	I also bought
314000	316000	And hey it's Tetris
316000	318000	$30 not a bad deal
318000	320000	Pretty easy achievement points
320000	321000	All things considered
321000	323000	Online play is like you remember it
323000	325000	On the Game Boy version
325000	327000	But
327000	329000	I don't know why they didn't do it as an
329000	331000	Xbox Live Arcade title
331000	333000	I don't know I think a lot of people are going to be wondering that
333000	335000	Because yes you can have videos
335000	337000	And they're high def pretty videos
337000	339000	You can't randomize them which is kind of weird
339000	340000	And they do have music included
340000	342000	But I've actually found the way I enjoy listening
342000	344000	To the game is I use the
344000	346000	XB stream program to grab
346000	348000	Podcasts and I'll play Tetris while
348000	350000	Listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack
350000	352000	As a podcast like I don't know
352000	354000	Either you know our show if I want to
354000	356000	Kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major
356000	358000	Nelson or something you know
358000	360000	Or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those
360000	362000	And it's kind of fun so
362000	364000	Yeah $30 not a bad deal but I think it'll be
364000	366000	In your bargain bin soon
366000	368000	Chris make see anything you guys want to add
368000	370000	I've played Animal Crossing
370000	372000	Animal Crossing on DS? Yeah on the plane
372000	374000	On the plane how was that we can't you didn't use the
374000	376000	Wi-Fi though on the plane did you? Of course not
376000	378000	No but I haven't played for like
378000	380000	Three months and everybody in my village was like
380000	382000	Bitch I invited you to tea like
382000	384000	Five months ago
384000	386000	And I'm like I'm sorry and there was like
386000	388000	A gajillion weeds and I had a bunch of
388000	390000	Mail and it was a mess but I cleaned it up
390000	392000	All the way from Madison to
392000	394000	Here
394000	396000	It would be that long to clean up your village
396000	398000	Kind of and then make everybody not mad at me
398000	400000	Anymore
400000	402000	Alright well good times
402000	404000	I wonder if there's like a still
404000	406000	I guess there probably still is a real active
406000	408000	Animal Crossing community online cause I was thinking
408000	410000	Wow if I just got the game now like most people
410000	412000	I know quit playing that a long time ago
412000	414000	So there would be nobody left to visit my village
414000	416000	But I guess there's still a pretty active
416000	418000	Community online somewhere huh
418000	420000	Chris anything you want to add
420000	422000	Well I actually really did play
422000	424000	World of Warcraft cause it's the only game
424000	426000	Fuck you
430000	432000	I had to spend a lot of time waiting
432000	434000	For Meg Z to get here so I did that by playing
434000	436000	Wow although I did it more as an experiment
436000	438000	I have found if you go to any of the major
438000	440000	Areas where there are lots of people in traffic
440000	442000	And you have a girl character
442000	444000	And you start making her dance
444000	446000	Watch how many guys
446000	448000	Decide to join in it's very
448000	450000	Funny it doesn't even matter
450000	452000	It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not
452000	454000	Not when you're a tauren I'm finding out
454000	456000	Cause nobody wants to dance with a cow
456000	458000	I like to dance with a cow
458000	460000	It works well with the elves and sometimes
460000	462000	The humans just cause there's a lot of traffic
462000	464000	But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you
464000	466000	It is
466000	468000	Especially when you're sitting there knowing wow these guys have no clue
468000	470000	Yeah really
470000	472000	Like some guy asked me ASL and I said
472000	474000	Mail
474000	476000	I said mail 42 Arizona
476000	478000	And he walked away
478000	480000	Awesome
480000	482000	It was very funny
482000	484000	He's in our chat saying I'm going to make a draenei
484000	486000	Dude the draenei chicks are hot
486000	488000	They are
488000	490000	Oh my god I'd bang those if I could
490000	492000	You know I might be gay and all but even I think the draenei
492000	494000	Chicks are hot what can I say
494000	496000	I just like their accent
496000	498000	Not enough rage
498000	500000	Alright so there it is conclusion of our gaming weeks
500000	502000	So um
502000	504000	Let's do some real brief housekeeping here
504000	506000	I have to keep this a little bit vague
506000	508000	We were going to say a little more about it
508000	510000	But I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to
510000	512000	Obviously it pains us
512000	514000	Journalistically
514000	516000	To have to go back and remove
516000	518000	Something that used to
518000	520000	Be there before
520000	522000	Trust me we did not enjoy doing that
522000	524000	We didn't want to do it
524000	526000	But as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand
526000	528000	We kind of had to do it
528000	530000	Unfortunately Orange Lounge Radio
530000	532000	Is a hobby for us
532000	534000	And it doesn't pay the bills
534000	536000	Push comes to shove
536000	538000	Things got to change
538000	540000	We also believe in karma
540000	542000	What goes around comes around
542000	544000	I think what we do here is really great
544000	546000	For the community and we give a lot of
546000	548000	Publicity to a lot of
548000	550000	Great up and coming games
550000	552000	We don't get paid for it
552000	554000	They don't pay for us to talk about their games
554000	556000	I guess the only impression we can take away from this
556000	558000	Is that
558000	560000	If a company doesn't want us to talk about their games
560000	562000	I guess there's a lot of other
562000	564000	Dependent games that aren't getting enough exposure
564000	566000	That we should maybe be spending our time talking about
566000	568000	A little more like to Miki Fighters
568000	570000	Miki Fighters
570000	572000	It's fun, it's free
572000	574000	It's a good price
574000	576000	We've certainly been spending a lot of time this week
576000	578000	Kind of reassessing I don't want to go about doing things
578000	580000	Still be the same Orange Lounge Radio
580000	582000	You know and love
582000	584000	Let's get into some news
584000	586000	Game Stuff have their
586000	588000	Financial conference call
588000	590000	I guess their investor
590000	592000	Conference call
592000	594000	The COO Dan D'Amato
594000	596000	I think that's how you pronounce his name
596000	598000	Was talking a little bit about the crippling
598000	600000	Wii shortage that's been
600000	602000	Kind of happening ever since the system came out
602000	604000	And particularly bad
604000	606000	You know with this month
606000	608000	Or I should say last month
608000	610000	March
610000	612000	He was quoted saying I don't think it's going to be
612000	614000	An issue going forward
614000	616000	I think this is just my
616000	618000	This is just my opinion but I think Nintendo
618000	620000	Essentially dried up the supply
620000	622000	Because they made their numbers for the year
622000	624000	The new year starts April 1st
624000	626000	And I think we're going to see the supply flowing
626000	628000	Now
628000	630000	It's interesting of course
630000	632000	Nintendo responded to that saying
632000	634000	No that's not true they never intended
634000	636000	For you know shortage to actually happen
636000	638000	And
638000	640000	You know so on and so forth of course
640000	642000	You know my opinion on that is
642000	644000	I mean if they're really drying up the
644000	646000	You know the sources on purpose
646000	648000	They're not going to go yeah we're holding them back
648000	650000	Because we hit our numbers for the year so
650000	652000	Sorry if you can't get one
652000	654000	I mean that's just going to piss people off
654000	656000	So anyways
656000	658000	You know long story short
658000	660000	I don't know you know
660000	662000	I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers
662000	664000	But I know that the systems haven't been in stores
664000	666000	For a long time and I know
666000	668000	You know at least distribution
668000	670000	As a whole hasn't been able to
670000	672000	Get a hold of them for
672000	674000	The month of March I mean they pretty much
674000	676000	You know
676000	678000	Allocated everything to retail
678000	680000	So what little there was in retail I don't know
680000	682000	If it's because they did it intentionally
682000	684000	Or if it was just they're
684000	686000	Really behind and they really
686000	688000	Can't make enough you know
688000	690000	Either way
690000	692000	Hopefully it'll start getting better in April
692000	694000	And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario
694000	696000	April fools
696000	698000	No just kidding
698000	700000	What I'm wondering though is and this is something I've been kind of wondering
700000	702000	About this week is that I seem to remember
702000	704000	Last year obviously Xbox 360
704000	706000	Had some real shortage problems as well
706000	708000	And we were pretty harsh
708000	710000	With the Xbox 360 and Microsoft
710000	712000	And you know why the F aren't there more systems out there
712000	714000	And blah blah blah blah
714000	716000	It seems like we've been a little more forgiving
716000	718000	Of Nintendo through all this and I'm trying to figure out
718000	720000	Why that is is that because they just they have
720000	722000	More consoles out there on the market
722000	724000	So that those of us diehards that really
724000	726000	Wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier
726000	728000	Or is that because we were smarter about it this time
728000	730000	When we all camped out and got them or whatever
730000	732000	I think we were just a little bit smarter about it
732000	734000	And also the fact that I mean
734000	736000	The 360
736000	738000	Was like kind of the first next gen console
738000	740000	So it was like something you really had to have it
740000	742000	You know a lot of times now it's like
742000	744000	Well the Wii's not out oh well I'll just play my
744000	746000	360 or I'll just play my Playstation 2
746000	748000	Or something like that until it comes out
748000	750000	There's really and also it'd be a little
750000	752000	Different if Super Mario Galaxy
752000	754000	Was out there now
754000	756000	Versus you know later or Smash Brothers
756000	758000	You know Brawl or something like that
758000	760000	If that stuff was out there now
760000	762000	You know that'd be a little bit different but I
762000	763000	I mean personally I don't
763000	765000	But to be honest Perfect Dark Zero is nothing to get that
765000	767000	Excited about for me I mean and the Xbox
767000	769000	Launch games were nothing like oh I gotta have it
769000	771000	True and
771000	773000	I just wanted the system as a whole you know
773000	775000	I don't know the download
775000	777000	The live I don't know I just wanted the damn thing
777000	779000	A year ago you know and I was frustrated when I couldn't
779000	781000	Get one I would think it'd be pretty dumb even
781000	783000	If they are hitting their numbers to
783000	785000	You know intentionally drive the market
785000	787000	I don't think that's even I mean I just think
787000	789000	They just can't produce enough of these I mean
789000	791000	It's even the issue with their accessories
791000	793000	I mean that's kind of a good you know point right there
793000	795000	That they just don't have enough accessories
795000	797000	Out there even to
797000	799000	You know fill the market and you can't
799000	801000	Tell me that that stuff's hard to produce
801000	803000	I mean come on
803000	805000	I guess I'm just wondering aloud here
805000	807000	Are we being fair
807000	809000	To Nintendo like
809000	811000	I mean are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft
811000	813000	The same way
813000	815000	Fuck no they should be getting more systems out there
815000	817000	Some goddamn technology has been out forever
817000	819000	I mean with the goddamn GameCube
819000	821000	Produce more fucking systems
821000	823000	And Dustcap in our chat room agrees with you
823000	825000	Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube
825000	827000	Version 2
827000	829000	SSJ100Matt wants to know how long did the 360
829000	831000	Shortage last I got mine in February
831000	833000	But I think it was May
833000	835000	It was May yeah
835000	837000	I work at Gamestop it lasted until about
837000	839000	Mid March April
839000	841000	You could walk into a store I think I saw
841000	843000	The first available one around the end of January
843000	845000	But seriously though
845000	847000	They need to get on top of
847000	849000	At least the systems out there
849000	851000	I mean okay great
851000	853000	They want to keep the demand up or something like that
853000	855000	I think the demand's up there
855000	857000	People want to buy this thing and if it's any
857000	859000	Kind of indicator
859000	861000	I mean you basically show your friends this
861000	863000	Game system if they don't have it yet
863000	865000	After playing with it for a little bit
865000	867000	They're just like God I gotta get one of my own
867000	869000	I would think you'd want as many systems out there
869000	871000	As possible to get as many impressions as possible
871000	873000	To sell even more systems
873000	875000	Which in turn you sell more software and make more money
875000	877000	So I don't think they're doing it on purpose
877000	879000	And I mean
879000	881000	Everyone's kind of running with this
881000	883000	You know before because it was the CEO
883000	885000	It's his opinion and
885000	887000	That's it I mean it's as valid as my opinion
887000	889000	So I don't know
889000	891000	We don't know you can only speculate
891000	893000	All that matters is
893000	895000	It's April now more systems in stores
897000	899000	Well at least
899000	901000	We do have some good news
901000	903000	And this is no joke
903000	905000	Nintendo and Sega
905000	907000	Have both stated
907000	909000	That Miyamoto is going
909000	911000	To be part of the development
911000	913000	Of Mario and Sonic
913000	915000	At the Olympic Games
917000	919000	So
919000	921000	They're actually talking specifically
921000	923000	That there are going to be
923000	925000	Not just that there's a number of different titles
925000	927000	From what I'm seeing anyway
927000	929000	But the game is being
929000	931000	Created by Sega with work by Miyamoto
931000	933000	I'm sorry
933000	935000	When it comes down to like the 500 meter dash
935000	937000	Or whatever the hell it is
937000	939000	Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario
939000	941000	Mario's a big fat plumber
941000	943000	Tear his ass open
943000	945000	Who lives on a diet of mushrooms
945000	947000	Megsy's pointing at her shirt
947000	949000	Getting upset because she's wearing flying Mario
949000	951000	Okay but in defense
951000	953000	Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to
953000	955000	The high jump and shit like that because he's got hops
955000	957000	But fucking Sonic will beat him
957000	959000	What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?
959000	961000	Yeah
961000	963000	Well Sonic can go faster
963000	965000	Than the god damn speed of sound
965000	967000	So there
967000	969000	I think
969000	971000	Mario will also have Sonic
971000	973000	Beat in the ability
973000	975000	To make a good next gen
975000	977000	Game competition
977000	979000	But you know who will win?
979000	981000	Nintendo and Sega
981000	983000	Because they have tricked you into
983000	985000	Buying a god damn olympics game
985000	987000	If history
987000	989000	Have shown you anything
989000	991000	Olympics games suck
991000	993000	Really bad
993000	995000	So
995000	997000	Personally I don't know
997000	999000	If this gets you interested in the olympics
999000	1001000	Hooray I'm not falling for it
1001000	1003000	I ain't buying this shit
1003000	1005000	Let's see I'm looking at chat room
1005000	1007000	Funny deal had a really quick comment on the last story
1007000	1009000	Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now
1009000	1011000	And fans keep buying their bullshit
1011000	1013000	Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage
1013000	1015000	Or the Nintendo 64 shortages?
1015000	1017000	No you must be old
1017000	1019000	No I'm just kidding
1019000	1021000	I wasn't really following gaming back then
1021000	1023000	As closely as I am now
1023000	1025000	I mean a little bit but I was much younger
1025000	1027000	And a lot of that didn't sink in like it does now
1027000	1029000	Let's see
1029000	1031000	Also moving on here
1031000	1033000	MooMooCannogram says
1033000	1035000	DarkSakura
1035000	1037000	Y'all know that there are other characters in the game
1037000	1039000	Well I would say yeah
1039000	1041000	But Mario and Sonic being in the same game
1041000	1043000	Is kind of news worthy
1045000	1047000	So what if there's other characters
1047000	1049000	Just seeing Miyamoto with Sonic
1049000	1051000	Is weird
1051000	1053000	It doesn't matter who else is in the game
1053000	1055000	To some extent really
1055000	1057000	Alright
1057000	1059000	Well moving on to
1059000	1061000	Something that did not turn out to be an April Fools
1061000	1063000	Joke and I told you it wasn't
1063000	1065000	If you want to go back a couple weeks I said
1065000	1067000	Look I know something you don't know
1067000	1069000	But this Knights thing is not bullshit
1069000	1071000	And sure enough
1071000	1073000	It's not bullshit
1073000	1075000	A magazine cover was leaked out of
1075000	1077000	I believe this is Sweden
1077000	1079000	This games magazine
1079000	1081000	Game Reactor put this image up on the internet
1081000	1083000	And then of course it caught wildfire
1083000	1085000	They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image
1085000	1087000	Of Knights but there it is
1087000	1089000	A world exclusive on Knights
1089000	1091000	And I'm sure they just beat the punch
1091000	1093000	To some American publication
1093000	1095000	Just going to have the same thing
1095000	1097000	As previously in the teaser thing
1097000	1099000	And I was going to say there's also been screenshots out there now too
1099000	1101000	So it looks kind of cool
1101000	1103000	Now here's a question though
1103000	1105000	You know Sonic games as of late
1105000	1107000	Ever since the Dreamcast
1107000	1109000	Have not been that great
1109000	1111000	So is this
1111000	1113000	Sega's chance to redeem themselves
1113000	1115000	Or should we just
1115000	1117000	Prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment
1117000	1119000	I want another Clockwork Knights
1119000	1121000	Dark Soccer
1121000	1123000	I know you've been a long time Sonic fan
1123000	1125000	But what are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii
1125000	1127000	Do you think they can make a good one?
1127000	1129000	What if it turns out
1129000	1131000	Like Sonic on 360 and PS3
1131000	1133000	It can't, it's on the Wii
1133000	1135000	You think that will be it saving grace?
1135000	1137000	WEEEEEE
1137000	1139000	Be honest
1139000	1141000	It's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog
1141000	1143000	Control issues won't be
1143000	1145000	That big of a problem
1145000	1147000	I hope
1147000	1149000	We'll see
1149000	1151000	Well there it is
1151000	1158440	Um, not to say told you so, but, but yeah, Maisie, wait, wait, before we get to the next
1158440	1159920	story, Maisie, you're squeaking over there.
1159920	1165320	What I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie as a Knights fan girl, I mean, could, Sega's
1165320	1167480	kind of done a lot of misfires lately.
1167480	1169980	What, what's going to stop them from misfiring this one?
1169980	1172560	Because it's Knights.
1172560	1177240	But Sonic was cool and Sonic on PlayStation three and 360 was not fun.
1177240	1178240	Okay.
1178240	1179240	That's Sonic.
1179240	1184280	Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.
1184280	1185280	You know what?
1185280	1188520	It will be, it will be good because it is Knights period.
1188520	1193000	But okay, Mario is missing had Mario in it and it wasn't that much fun.
1193000	1196840	Mario was missing was the shit.
1196840	1197840	You're just easy to please.
1197840	1198840	I don't know.
1198840	1201400	There's no, I don't know what else to think.
1201400	1204080	Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?
1204080	1205880	I said, you have no idea.
1205880	1208080	Ooh, la la.
1208080	1217280	In that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it, the E3 event or E3 like
1217280	1222560	event that you can go to because it's open to the public, God help us all.
1222560	1226360	Um, anyways, so one reason you're probably gonna want to go there other than the fact
1226360	1230320	that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to
1230320	1236640	be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of, um, huge lineup.
1236640	1240760	Hopefully by that time we'll see, you know, the big, you know, Super Mario Galaxy and
1240760	1244680	Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.
1244680	1246880	But um, it should be interesting.
1246880	1251040	I know, especially if they're on board then, you know, it's likely other people will jump
1251040	1253280	on board as well.
1253280	1259920	So anyways, E for everyone or E for all, it's going to be coming October in LA, same place
1259920	1264800	as the original E3 and only $100 to get in.
1264800	1269040	And there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.
1269040	1270040	Wow.
1270040	1272160	That's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.
1272160	1276480	I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there.
1276480	1277480	You know what?
1277480	1279280	I have to admit I'm interested.
1279280	1282040	I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.
1282040	1286200	I think I'm, I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.
1286200	1289240	200,000 people in half the exhibition space.
1289240	1290240	Yeah.
1290240	1291240	That's going to be very uncomfortable.
1291240	1292240	I don't know.
1292240	1294640	But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.
1294640	1295640	I don't know.
1295640	1299440	That is a very lofty goal, but E3 was crowded as it is.
1299440	1305920	I mean, I don't know, but I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because
1305920	1307600	we did not feel the love.
1307600	1312000	Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some
1312000	1313120	reason it didn't happen.
1313120	1318840	I don't know what possibly went wrong there, but yeah, we're not going to E3.
1318840	1322400	Well, I'm not, Loki's not.
1322400	1327160	You know, you know, I am, you know, you know, you know, when E3 started going, going down,
1327160	1330080	you know, you know, it was the mark of it, of it starting to go down because they got
1330080	1337000	rid of the booth, babes, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1337000	1338000	I don't know.
1338000	1340720	Going down was having to fight my way around the crowd.
1340720	1344080	That's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.
1344080	1347780	That is that's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark when Paris Hilton was getting those
1347780	1349160	kinds of lines at E3.
1349160	1352720	I was like, what's wrong with this picture?
1352720	1358160	This is it, but the booth babes, well, there'll be booth babes at E4 all.
1358160	1359160	I'm sure.
1359160	1360160	There you go.
1360160	1361160	Are you going to go to E4 all?
1361160	1362160	Maybe.
1362160	1363160	I don't know.
1363160	1364160	I'm thinking about it.
1364160	1365160	She says, no, I don't know.
1365160	1366160	I want to know a little more about it.
1366160	1368240	Like what is the, I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be
1368240	1369240	the must have?
1369240	1370240	Yeah.
1370240	1374000	I mean, seriously, am I going to pay a hundred dollars to wait five hours to play a game?
1374000	1376200	I mean, seriously, there's 200,000.
1376200	1382680	If 200,000 people actually are, first of all, I don't know that that could actually work,
1382680	1388920	especially with like fire codes and stuff, but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000
1388920	1393760	people in there as it was last year with E3, 70,000 people, I believe.
1393760	1395600	And it was fucking crowded.
1395600	1399480	And now you have half the space and more than double the people.
1399480	1400480	Fuck that.
1400480	1403280	Uh, JVMON says 200,000 could be a typo.
1403280	1409320	Maybe they meant to say 20,000, which is a bad, and that's not a bad, that's not a bad
1409320	1412440	showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.
1412440	1416440	You know, if they can pull off 20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first
1416440	1417440	year out the gate.
1417440	1418880	So, well, we'll see.
1418880	1420800	Best of luck to E4ALL.
1420800	1424960	And um, I think I'm going to go, I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it, but
1424960	1425960	I want to go.
1425960	1431280	I want to go to E3 though, but yeah, well, we don't always get what we want sadly.
1431280	1436000	Like I said, you know, we give free publicity, we give free publicity to games on this show.
1436000	1441180	So if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your
1441180	1442880	work cut out for you, Jamie.
1442880	1444240	Hey, I'm amazing.
1444240	1447440	You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?
1447440	1449080	Like we did last year.
1449080	1450080	Chirp.
1450080	1454720	So guess what's not live?
1454720	1455720	Zombies.
1455720	1456940	They're in Resident Evil.
1456940	1459040	My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.
1459040	1460040	That's okay.
1460040	1461520	I'm going to.
1461520	1462520	Hey.
1462520	1465640	So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?
1465640	1471680	It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii is going to be at 480p progressive
1471680	1475000	scan 16 to 9 widescreen.
1475000	1477400	Isn't that great?
1477400	1481520	Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this
1481520	1482520	or whatever.
1482520	1485920	I mean, hooray for, you know, it doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.
1485920	1489920	It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.
1489920	1495320	There will be after the Capcom Gamers' Day thing, which was, I think, I think that's
1495320	1497160	like in the next couple of weeks here.
1497160	1500760	There's been mumblings that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for
1500760	1505760	the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers' Day, because
1505760	1507520	they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?
1507520	1508520	Yeah.
1508520	1512320	Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.
1512320	1513320	That's true.
1513320	1517320	All right, well, we do know some things that are coming out.
1517320	1522600	Well, I guess it is still a little bit of a rumor, but these have a lot more foundation
1522600	1527440	to them, and that would be Final Fight and Street Fighter II Turbo making an appearance
1527440	1528560	on the Virtual Console.
1528560	1534000	We know this because it has shown up on the ESRB's list of clear titles.
1534000	1540240	Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter II Turbo is going to be making its way to
1540240	1544720	Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter II just came out not that long ago.
1544720	1548320	It's kind of like, obviously, Street Fighter II Turbo was the superior game.
1548320	1551000	I don't know why anyone would want to have both.
1551000	1554960	At least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between
1554960	1559760	the games, but now it's kind of like, sucker.
1559760	1564360	You still can't play it online, but if you want to relive it in all its Super Nintendo
1564360	1567440	glory, you have that ability.
1567440	1570960	Final Fight, by the way, sucked on Super Nintendo, I thought, because it-
1570960	1571960	Booze!
1571960	1572960	I have all those games.
1572960	1574160	But it didn't have Guy in it, and yes-
1574160	1575800	I have Final Fight Guy.
1575800	1578960	But in Final Fight Guy, it didn't have Cody in it.
1578960	1581000	It's like they just replaced the sprites or whatever.
1581000	1582000	No they didn't.
1582000	1583000	And there was like stages missing.
1583000	1585120	He had his moves.
1585120	1587320	That's why it was all about Final Fight CD.
1587320	1590600	Or yeah, or just Final Fight Arcade, you know, I don't know.
1590600	1595160	I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console, but these are a little
1595160	1600280	more exciting, other Virtual Console releases, because Hudson updated an official list, so
1600280	1605080	we know these will be happening for sure, Bonk's Revenge, which I assume comes as a
1605080	1608880	surprise to no one, will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console.
1608880	1614760	Also Bravo Man, Shock Man, and Battle Lode Runner, which is kind of cool, because Lode
1614760	1618960	Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love, and I have to be honest, I'm
1618960	1622460	not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting
1622460	1626080	very excited over this game, so it must be good.
1626080	1627480	You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.
1627480	1628480	Do you know Battle Lode Runner?
1628480	1629480	I remember.
1629480	1630480	I totally know.
1630480	1631480	Hmm.
1631480	1632480	Interesting.
1632480	1633480	Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.
1633480	1634480	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1634480	1642560	Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week, and we've
1642560	1644640	got some good stuff coming out in the US.
1644640	1650960	It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2,
1650960	1653720	we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.
1653720	1656600	It's kind of a good kid's game, I guess.
1656600	1661680	If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones,
1661680	1666000	or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.
1666000	1667120	I have a random question.
1667120	1670080	Can you use a Karaoke Revolution mic with these games?
1670080	1671080	No.
1671080	1672080	Bastards.
1672080	1677640	But hey, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of
1677640	1681120	them, and it's the normal price of karaoke revolutions.
1681120	1682120	Well, I know.
1682120	1685160	I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but you know.
1685160	1687720	Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.
1687720	1688720	Anyways.
1688720	1691480	I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.
1691480	1692480	Yeah.
1692480	1699040	Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that
1699040	1702680	got ported over, and it's very, very cheap.
1702680	1709320	Let's see, PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, that is also coming out on the Wii, and Pimp
1709320	1713400	My Ride will be making its way out on the PSP as well.
1713400	1717480	I don't know if you should be too excited about that.
1717480	1723240	Rapala Trophies, if you're into bass fishing, hooray, on the 360.
1723240	1728700	On the PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, which should be pretty cool.
1728700	1733080	Same damn game as before, I believe they added maybe a few things to it.
1733080	1735960	And let's see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, I already said that.
1735960	1740760	Let's see, Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out, also ported the GameCube
1740760	1741960	game.
1741960	1750360	Let's see, on PC, The Sims 2 Celebration, that looks kind of neat, and a bunch of other
1750360	1756520	crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way,
1756520	1760680	and actually, Locomania sounds kind of fun.
1760680	1762400	That might be kind of neat.
1762400	1769240	And then, let's see, on the DS, Cake Mania, and Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales,
1769240	1771500	that should be pretty cool.
1771500	1776360	And then, finally, the game, probably going to be picking up this week, Guitar Hero 2,
1776360	1781080	making its way to the 360, so, pretty awesome.
1781080	1784760	I thought you were getting my copy early, what happened?
1784760	1787840	Comes out Wednesday.
1787840	1789440	I'm working on it.
1789440	1793760	Pull through for me, I have to be the coolest kid on the block, and have it before anyone
1793760	1794760	else.
1794760	1797000	What do you mean you have it?
1797000	1803440	You're a liar, April Fools, Magsy, full of lies and loos.
1803440	1805560	Just get heart, love ya.
1805560	1808800	Well let's move on to more release dates.
1808800	1811800	How about the UK?
1811800	1817960	Well here's what we've got coming out, on the 5th we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords,
1817960	1823080	we also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360, on the 6th we have Frontline Fields of
1823080	1831160	Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and the Red Star on PS2.
1831160	1834280	I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.
1834280	1835840	What's that about?
1835840	1839440	I just remember it was shooting stuff, and I like guns.
1839440	1844320	It's an old acclaimed game that finally got published, and it's being made into a movie,
1844320	1847400	it's based off of a comic book series as well.
1847400	1849000	Yeah, what he said.
1849000	1850000	Alrighty.
1850000	1855440	Well, moving on over to Japan and checking out what's on their release date schedule.
1855440	1860300	Cold Set Saga is getting an updated version out in Japan this week, which I think is kind
1860300	1861300	of interesting.
1861300	1864880	I thought the game had already come out, but it looks like they're getting an updated version.
1864880	1867840	I'm not sure what exactly they've updated, but there you have it.
1867840	1871240	If you're a Cold Set fan, I'm sure you're going to want to pick that up.
1871240	1876180	Also coming out, Championship Manager 2007 in the Asian territories.
1876180	1879200	On the Nintendo Wii, Barnyard comes out in Japan.
1879200	1881900	I'm not sure if this is a game we already have here.
1881900	1883240	I think it is.
1883240	1884240	Is it based on the movie?
1884240	1885240	It is, yeah.
1885240	1886240	Blech.
1886240	1890240	It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have
1890240	1891240	a ball.
1891240	1897040	PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into
1897040	1901960	Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.
1901960	1909240	Netsuchuu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachi Slots Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love
1909240	1911240	your pachinko.
1911240	1913080	It looks like some sexy ladies there.
1913080	1914080	Actually, wait.
1914080	1915200	I don't know, though.
1915200	1917720	That might actually be just a slot machine game.
1917720	1920080	Maybe that's why they go on pachi slots.
1920080	1923360	I'm sure they've got pachinko in it, too, though.
1923360	1924360	Come on.
1924360	1925360	It's a gambling sim.
1925360	1927400	A gambling sim with sexy ladies.
1927400	1928800	I've never played pachinko.
1928800	1930520	Can you explain pachinko to me?
1930520	1932840	How exactly does it work?
1932840	1933840	I have no fucking clue.
1933840	1935240	But you played it?
1935240	1940760	I was in Japan, and they told me, you've got to play pachinko, because it's one of those
1940760	1943720	Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.
1943720	1948560	So I went to the pachinko parlor and put $10 in, and it ate my $10, and I didn't know what
1948560	1949560	to do.
1949560	1950560	It's basic.
1950560	1951560	Okay.
1951560	1952560	I don't know the basics of the game.
1952560	1953560	I'm sure somebody-
1953560	1954560	It's legalized gambling.
1954560	1955560	It's pretty much legalized gambling.
1955560	1960480	So there you put these little metal balls falling in certain spots.
1960480	1963600	I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little
1963600	1964600	metal balls.
1964600	1970120	I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.
1970120	1974640	And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes-
1974640	1980240	This game sounds fucking hot.
1980240	1983780	You can exchange those for prizes, or you can usually go around the corner and get money
1983780	1984780	for them.
1984780	1989520	Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and whatnot, and it gives you money.
1989520	1992480	But Rob makes you eat too gross.
1992480	1994760	I've collected a lot of balls over the years.
1994760	1995760	Where's my prize?
1995760	2000440	I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.
2000440	2001900	You have your own set of balls.
2001900	2005060	Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.
2005060	2009400	That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant very similar to the ones that
2009400	2011860	would serve Rocky Mountain oysters, you know?
2011860	2014360	Rack of lamb, rack of balls.
2014360	2022640	Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.
2022640	2025200	Do you even care what's coming out of Nintendo DS in Japan?
2025200	2026200	Sure you do.
2026200	2032640	Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.
2032640	2036160	And of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover, but I assume that this
2036160	2041240	is a simulation game that teaches you manners, because you can pick A, B, C, and it looks
2041240	2047200	like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever.
2047200	2051420	So this is interesting, to say the least.
2051420	2056360	Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.
2056360	2057920	Isn't this series ever going to die?
2057920	2058920	I like that.
2058920	2059920	Probably never.
2059920	2060920	The app is old.
2060920	2065720	And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Soup Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam
2065720	2066720	games.
2066720	2071360	Nintendo vs. ZAFT Portable.
2071360	2074480	There you have it, Japanese release dates.
2074480	2075480	Aren't we happy?
2075480	2076840	We are happy.
2076840	2082000	One thing though that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting
2082000	2084920	you yet another firmware, 3.30.
2084920	2087040	And what will it give you?
2087040	2088720	Well, some interesting stuff.
2088720	2096360	For example, you can have some brand new video sizes, including full screen video now at
2096360	2100520	480x272, the native resolution of the PSP.
2100520	2110620	Somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution, which is actually DVD resolution, that's 480p.
2110620	2113320	I don't know how the hell that's going to fit, since there's not that many pixels on
2113320	2116880	the damn screen, but okay, sure.
2116880	2121420	And then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, which I believe
2121420	2128000	is the T-Mobile hotspots, and you get like 60 days, like a trial for that or something.
2128000	2135360	It will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there, so you know, you may want
2135360	2143320	to wait a little bit because, let's see, because there's some good news, and that is that like
2143320	2147960	most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.
2147960	2155640	And yeah, it's been cracked already, and actually the rumor is that DarkAlex is working on a
2155640	2161640	custom firmware for 3.30, so I would say give it a couple more weeks, and you'll probably
2161640	2164380	see this on the internet.
2164380	2172960	Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a TA82PSP
2172960	2177660	motherboard in there, and you have the custom firmware already on there, if you try to upgrade
2177660	2181960	to this it may break your PSP, so you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have
2181960	2184600	the custom firmware in there, so just be careful.
2184600	2189480	Well, better hope that people heed that, right?
2189480	2190480	Yes.
2190480	2195140	Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's
2195140	2201960	really surprised by this, is that the man, the voice, David Hayter, is returning as Solid
2201960	2205700	Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriot.
2205700	2208340	That just makes me absolutely so happy.
2208340	2215800	Also coming back are the voice actors for Raiden, Roy Campbell, and Otacon, so that's
2215800	2218840	very cool.
2218840	2222900	And that actually just makes me very happy.
2222900	2227240	Isn't David Hayter also the voice of the blood elves in World of Warcraft?
2227240	2228460	He's awesome.
2228460	2233120	He also wrote the first X-Men movie, too, the screenplay.
2233120	2234120	The first two movies.
2234120	2235120	He wrote it?
2235120	2236120	Yeah.
2236120	2237120	I did not know that about him.
2237120	2238120	I'm so sorry, guys.
2238120	2239920	My voice is giving out so bad tonight.
2239920	2243800	Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.
2243800	2246000	I didn't realize that's what he did.
2246000	2248000	You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know where that's going.
2248000	2249640	And he also did Applebee's commercials.
2249640	2251160	I found his voice reel.
2251160	2252920	I want my baby bit, baby bit.
2252920	2256240	Oh, Jiranami says, no, David Hayter did not do the blood elves.
2256240	2260880	Somebody pulled the Napier Fools joke on me then, bastards.
2260880	2264400	I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.
2264400	2265400	My bad.
2265400	2272720	Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I
2272720	2273880	think.
2273880	2274880	For the game.
2274880	2275880	Hmm.
2275880	2277800	Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?
2277800	2280880	But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.
2280880	2281880	Oh, cool.
2281880	2283880	You'll have to check that out, then.
2283880	2285920	They still, you know, have to do the translations.
2285920	2286920	I guess that's true.
2286920	2287920	That's true.
2287920	2292600	Because the game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.
2292600	2296040	Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was
2296040	2300240	promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.
2300240	2303800	They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than
2303800	2305160	Talladega Nights was.
2305160	2308200	That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.
2308200	2312840	But they were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network, and then the first 20,000 were going
2312840	2314240	to get their movie.
2314240	2315640	But nobody's gotten it yet.
2315640	2317120	Casino Royale is fucking awesome.
2317120	2319000	I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.
2319000	2320000	It's so good.
2320000	2322000	I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.
2322000	2323000	It's all she freaking talks about.
2323000	2324000	It's not all I freaking talk about.
2324000	2325000	So he's like, have you seen the Bond movie?
2325000	2326000	Have you seen the new Bond movie?
2326000	2327000	It's freaking hot.
2327000	2332880	Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie, because it's really
2332880	2333880	good.
2333880	2334880	And you should see it too.
2334880	2337160	I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either, and it was really good.
2337160	2338160	Fucking hate Bond.
2338160	2339160	No, I hate fucking Bond.
2339160	2340160	You know what?
2340160	2341160	This just isn't working out.
2341160	2342160	You know what?
2342160	2343160	Fuck you.
2343160	2345400	I love it when lesbians fight on this program.
2345400	2346400	Let's see.
2346400	2351240	Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember,
2351240	2356720	you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets
2356720	2358520	mailed to you.
2358520	2359600	Ouch.
2359600	2364080	So, perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.
2364080	2367440	Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation
2367440	2368440	3.
2368440	2369440	It bundled in there.
2369440	2374320	Well, it was bundled in, and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?
2374320	2375320	That's true.
2375320	2376960	It was like a real special something, huh?
2376960	2382880	Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.
2382880	2383880	You're special ed.
2383880	2384880	You're mom's special ed.
2384880	2385880	Anyways.
2385880	2386880	Last night.
2386880	2392080	So, you may be waiting a while to get your copy of Casino Royale.
2392080	2397240	Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation
2397240	2398240	3.
2398240	2404680	According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they
2404680	2408960	are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.
2408960	2413600	And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful
2413600	2419280	platform and developing technology and products, and they're planning on developing technology
2419280	2424120	and products for this console, says, however, we believe that the install base will be high
2424120	2428800	enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year.
2428800	2432280	So not only do you have to wait until 2008, you have to wait until the second half of
2432280	2438800	2008, which fiscal year for most companies is from, I believe, April to April, I want
2438800	2441000	to say, or March to March or something like that.
2441000	2445600	So second half would actually be fall of 2008.
2445600	2447960	No Tomb Raider on PlayStation 3 for you.
2447960	2448960	You know what?
2448960	2453840	I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises
2453840	2454840	could this affect?
2454840	2455840	Umm...
2455840	2456840	Juice X?
2456840	2463160	I'm trying to remember, Eidos recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.
2463160	2467160	They were doing like Battle Stations Midway.
2467160	2468920	I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.
2468920	2469920	Thief, Hitman.
2469920	2470920	Hitman, yeah.
2470920	2472920	Oh, that's a pretty big series.
2472920	2474920	Okay, there you go.
2474920	2475920	Huh.
2475920	2476920	Well, I don't know.
2476920	2480440	None of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted
2480440	2481440	to try.
2481440	2483960	Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and
2483960	2484960	I just, I haven't.
2484960	2485960	You know?
2485960	2487560	So many games, so little time.
2487560	2490960	And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there too.
2490960	2491960	That's true.
2491960	2492960	That's true.
2492960	2496960	It looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain too, I forgot about
2496960	2497960	that.
2497960	2504000	All right, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008, but Jamie's got a lot of love
2504000	2506720	for you all out there, don't you, Jamie?
2506720	2507720	Yeah.
2507720	2511760	And she loves to share the website she finds with you on the internet every week in a little
2511760	2514040	segment we call Dark Socras.
2514040	2516280	I really need tea or something.
2516280	2518760	My voice is cracking like I'm 12 all over again.
2518760	2523320	No, it's, well, I have tea, I have my licorice tea, but it's just not enough.
2523320	2524600	Licorice is nasty.
2524600	2525600	I'm sorry.
2525600	2526600	I love licorice.
2526600	2527600	Anyway.
2527600	2530480	Dark Socras website of the week.
2530480	2540760	Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random, and it's transmission.org.
2540760	2549840	It's T-R-A-N-S dash mission dot org, and it's a UK website for the club scene for Transvestites.
2549840	2553640	So I'm done.
2553640	2556640	Did you actually browse the website?
2556640	2557640	I mean, what kind of-
2557640	2560160	I was looking for shoes.
2560160	2561720	You were looking for, wait a minute.
2561720	2562720	I was looking for shoes.
2562720	2563720	Hold on.
2563720	2565160	Stop the damn music for a minute.
2565160	2571640	How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual
2571640	2573360	clubs in Britain?
2573360	2574360	Let's get them.
2574360	2576480	Because there's a link on here, on their links page.
2576480	2580760	There's a shops link, and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.
2580760	2582760	These shoes are $300.
2582760	2585480	These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.
2585480	2587440	Let's get them.
2587440	2588440	So yeah.
2588440	2589440	You started it, Rob.
2589440	2590440	You started it, Rob.
2590440	2591440	I guess I, I don't know.
2591440	2592440	I guess I deserve that.
2592440	2593440	I don't know.
2593440	2594440	Let me borrow that top.
2594440	2596800	It really is a pretty, pretty famous transit.
2596800	2598480	You want the rest of my water bottle for now?
2598480	2599480	I'm not sick.
2599480	2600480	Okay.
2600480	2601480	I have a drink.
2601480	2602480	Let me go bribe people.
2602480	2603480	All right.
2603480	2604840	Chris is going to go bribe people.
2604840	2605840	Try to get us some drinks.
2605840	2607320	I'm going to give people some blood.
2607320	2608320	All right.
2608320	2609320	Anyhow.
2609320	2610320	Can I help?
2610320	2611320	Can you just help?
2611320	2616400	Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NCSoft and ArenaNet, because they
2616400	2621200	are putting out not just one, but two new Guild Wars titles, for those of you guys that
2621200	2623120	are into Guild Wars.
2623120	2627580	Guild Wars Eye of the North will be a new expansion that is coming out.
2627580	2630920	It is coming out for around the holidays, 2007.
2630920	2636320	It's got 18 dungeons, 10 brand new heroes, and 150 new skills.
2636320	2637960	It's going to be pretty awesome.
2637960	2643520	Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 is also going to be coming out in the second half of 2008.
2643520	2647700	That was officially announced, and they are going to follow what worked for them with
2647700	2651820	Guild Wars, no monthly subscription fee.
2651820	2655600	The world will always be available, just like the original Guild Wars.
2655600	2658480	That's kind of cool, especially for those folks into Guild Wars.
2658480	2665680	What I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?
2665680	2669760	I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.
2669760	2674040	EverQuest 2 didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got, because people didn't want
2674040	2675320	to leave their characters behind.
2675320	2680040	I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate, or if because, eh,
2680040	2685560	I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there will be some extra incentive.
2685560	2691360	I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the
2691360	2697920	North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2, just to, you know, make people buy everything
2697920	2698920	they want.
2698920	2699920	So there you go.
2699920	2700920	Gotta collect them all.
2700920	2701920	Yeah.
2701920	2703920	Gotta get them all.
2703920	2711360	Anyways, this isn't really a news article, more of a, I guess a commentary by me, but
2711360	2718480	I was reading, there was this post on Joystiq actually, and it's a column that they do,
2718480	2725360	I believe every other week, by a woman named Bonnie Ruberg, and basically she writes a
2725360	2726880	column called Playing Dirty.
2726880	2730520	It's a column on sex and gender in video games.
2730520	2737280	And her article this week was, Lady, Get Off the Road, and it's basically talking about
2737280	2739480	men say women are bad drivers.
2739480	2744780	This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license
2744780	2746320	photo to prove it.
2746320	2750240	I take my on-road duties seriously.
2750240	2754760	And basically her complaint is that she believes that those comments about women being bad
2754760	2756960	drivers are unfounded, and in fact, it's-
2756960	2760720	Can I say something funny I saw a woman doing on the road yesterday?
2760720	2764360	No, this is, Chris, I swear to God, this is a true story.
2764360	2768840	I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?
2768840	2771840	So, but she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.
2771840	2773400	She's not even the student driver.
2773400	2774400	No, I know.
2774400	2777080	No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.
2777080	2780280	She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper to bumper trying to
2780280	2783760	go across the Bay Bridge, text messaging while driving.
2783760	2786200	You can't text message, break up.
2786200	2788640	You can't text message, break up.
2788640	2794120	So yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.
2794120	2796200	True story, I am not shitting you.
2796200	2799440	This is- That takes a special kind of loser.
2799440	2802320	This is why you women get a bad rap.
2802320	2803320	Exactly.
2803320	2806800	You wanna know why men get a bad rap?
2806800	2810780	Small penis cars every single fucking time.
2810780	2814760	I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.
2814760	2817120	What the hell is that car called?
2817120	2818120	What is that car?
2818120	2819120	It's like a four BMW.
2819120	2821600	I know, but- I don't know.
2821600	2824280	It's one of the new little beamers I've got.
2824280	2830180	So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that
2830180	2832120	they've got a bigger cock than I do.
2832120	2835080	I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.
2835080	2838840	And then they perceive- Now, what you boys don't know is that Chris
2838840	2840980	has a very big cock.
2840980	2841980	That's right.
2841980	2842980	In her top dresser drawer.
2842980	2843980	Exactly.
2843980	2848240	And when it vibrates, beat that motherfucker.
2848240	2849400	Not as big as mine.
2849400	2850400	That's right.
2850400	2851400	Hers is detachable though.
2851400	2854400	So- Shut up, Rob.
2854400	2857600	But yeah, you men are- Lesbian sex, bleh!
2857600	2861480	You men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that car.
2861480	2863680	Okay, and maybe- Okay, so men-
2863680	2864920	Sorry, do you wanna finish the article?
2864920	2865920	Sorry.
2865920	2866920	Yeah, I wanna finish.
2866920	2871640	Anyways, so they go on to complain basically that men, you know, are driving fast and they're
2871640	2876240	breaking- Oh, and they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.
2876240	2880720	They're all- Just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.
2880720	2883880	Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.
2883880	2887400	They've got awful driving written all over them.
2887400	2890120	Yeah, I don't think games are reality.
2890120	2891120	Duh!
2891120	2894080	You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!
2894080	2895680	I can make some points for that!
2895680	2897360	No, I'm not retard, okay?
2897360	2899280	So here's the thing.
2899280	2903120	I fucking hate the goddamn women that drive the giant SUVs, talking on their goddamn cell
2903120	2906380	phones, not paying attention to the fucking world, and because- Getting distracted by
2906380	2910800	stupid shit like, hey, look, there's a bird over there, and meanwhile like swerving all
2910800	2915120	over the fucking place because their conversation's interesting.
2915120	2916160	That's the difference.
2916160	2919540	Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?
2919540	2920540	That's why.
2920540	2925760	You know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great, then we
2925760	2929200	can go out there and play that and you'll have something to play.
2929200	2933600	But I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think
2933600	2937680	they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are,
2937680	2942880	you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that,
2942880	2945200	you know, but usually I let them pass me no problem.
2945200	2949080	But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway talking on the cell
2949080	2954920	phones swerving all over the place, not using her signal, and you know, goddamn, might as
2954920	2960800	well stop and back up on the freeway, and I have seen that by the way before.
2960800	2961800	That's what pisses me off.
2961800	2966400	And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples, actually a lot, a lot, a lot
2966400	2971400	of bad apples out there too, kind of spoil a bunch, and you know, women should just get
2971400	2974800	pissed off at these stupid people that drive, it's really SUV drivers.
2974800	2979200	I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.
2979200	2984800	I actually have to agree with you, those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with
2984800	2985800	fire.
2985800	2989840	And you know what, the guys at speed out there, they end up crashing anyways, so it's all
2989840	2990840	bad drivers.
2990840	2993840	I'm sorry, I missed something, what the fuck does this have to do with games?
2993840	2995680	It doesn't have to do anything with games.
2995680	2998120	Why the fuck did you bring this story up, man?
2998120	3003160	Because it was on Joystick, and because it was, and because it's basically, they're talking
3003160	3008360	about like Need for Speed, Cytruck, and Burnout and stuff like that, kind of blaming, I guess,
3008360	3010400	So what, is that how the article reads?
3010400	3015120	Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop
3015120	3016640	texting, blah, blah, blah.
3016640	3017640	That's what I read.
3017640	3018640	Cytruck, burnout, okay thanks.
3018640	3019840	Is that it?
3019840	3024720	That's what I read, that's how my guy filter went through that, you know, it's like squawk,
3024720	3028600	squawk, squawk, med suck, squawk, squawk, squawk.
3028600	3030600	I thought that was your wife talking to you.
3030600	3031600	Oh no.
3031600	3032600	Or me.
3032600	3033600	Or me.
3033600	3038960	Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.
3038960	3043080	That's right, that's right, I'm going 120 miles on the freeway, I'm wondering why somebody
3043080	3045080	going 80 is in my way.
3045080	3049000	Okay, I'm going to go fry people.
3049000	3050000	Next!
3050000	3051000	Alright, wow.
3051000	3055920	Oh by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills
3055920	3058560	at racing sims because they need to practice.
3058560	3066000	Women, they're already such good drivers that they can squander their free time on destruction.
3066000	3067000	So smackdown.
3067000	3072080	Wait, wait, wait, wait, are you politely commenting for a reason here, because anytime there's
3072080	3077160	a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it, but tonight, strangely quiet.
3077160	3083720	I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in, or if you're just rolling your eyes mentally,
3083720	3084720	I don't know.
3084720	3085880	I'm trying to get a feel.
3085880	3088300	What is going through Jamie's mind?
3088300	3096040	Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective, so moving forward.
3096040	3098040	Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.
3098040	3100560	What the hell do they do with anything?
3100560	3103440	They do bad driving and good driving.
3103440	3105360	So how about smackdown, right?
3105360	3108800	There's going to be some smackdown in here pretty soon.
3108800	3118560	On new smackdown vs raw 2008 edition, to be on the PS3, we DS also a bunch of other shit.
3118560	3128460	So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system,
3128460	3135160	you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff, and some of the fan requested
3135160	3142680	updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience,
3142680	3149320	out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff, but I just think smackdown vs raw is
3149320	3156320	funny because wrestling is like soap opera for guys.
3156320	3163000	Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start
3163000	3167200	your own reality show that appears on VH1?
3167200	3170280	Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan though, he comes back a year later.
3170280	3174840	It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right, or whatever?
3174840	3181960	I'm so gay, obviously, I don't know what I'm talking about.
3181960	3185120	You like the last smackdown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up,
3185120	3186120	Darkseid?
3186120	3189200	Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.
3189200	3192840	Who puts the smackdown when you and Dan do battle in smackdown?
3192840	3195680	I just make characters and make him use them.
3195680	3198040	I usually make really kickass characters though.
3198040	3202600	Like the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was this really pretty boy in
3202600	3209680	D-Generation X, and then we just let him play on watch mode where you could just watch all
3209680	3213200	the matches and he won every single match, had all the belts.
3213200	3216160	We even put him in a women's match.
3216160	3220000	That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game, but still, he had all
3220000	3221000	the belts.
3221000	3222000	He was fucking awesome.
3222000	3225340	I just remember because he was pretty.
3225340	3227360	Pretty Boy, was that his wrestling name?
3227360	3228360	Pretty Boy?
3228360	3233120	No, he had some cool name, but he was just, I think his name was actually just Mr. X.
3233120	3234120	How original.
3234120	3235120	All right.
3235120	3237760	Maisie, what, you had something to say?
3237760	3239920	Maisie has a joke about wrestling, sure, why not?
3239920	3243420	We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with the joke.
3243420	3248120	The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.
3248120	3249760	How's that?
3249760	3253000	Just watch professional wrestling, and then watch some gay porn.
3253000	3256000	Not much of a difference.
3256000	3258160	Some advice from Maisie there.
3258160	3259160	All right.
3259160	3263840	Well, we are going to take a quick break here.
3263840	3267240	The lesbians saw boobies.
3267240	3269040	What are you looking at here?
3269040	3274520	I'm on Destructoid, scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore 69, Celebrity Boobs
3274520	3276040	and Nakedness, etc.
3276040	3282480	Then they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller
3282480	3284120	on there.
3284120	3285440	Is it like an April Fools joke or something?
3285440	3286440	I don't know.
3286440	3288080	I'm just scrolling down.
3288080	3291920	They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.
3291920	3292920	I do like that site.
3292920	3293920	It's a lot of fun.
3293920	3294920	All right.
3294920	3298760	I guess that's going to do it, though, for part A here of Orange Laundry.
3298760	3300680	I don't know if you're thinking, gosh, this is a little short.
3300680	3303860	Well, don't forget, we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was
3303860	3304860	a separate show.
3304860	3310400	But we will be back for your full part B right after a quick little segment here.
3310400	3313280	Coming up in part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite, because there's
3313280	3314280	a lot on that.
3314280	3318480	We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers,
3318480	3320040	Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.
3320040	3326520	Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.
3326520	3331040	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
