Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
The PlayStation is set to get an eye

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
There's Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Quizno is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And that's something else, because usually it's the same old prick of people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
So we have a brand new person visiting us tonight

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
And you may recognize his name from various OLR emails and I think maybe phone calls in the past

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
And now he's here live in studio, which just goes to prove that stalking works

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Say hello to Warrior Bob

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
It does work. Hi everybody. Everybody laugh at the noob

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
How you doing, noob?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh, not too bad, actually

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
So wait a minute, okay, we gotta figure out, how did you get from OLR listener to now being here in the OLR studio

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
So when did you first listen to Orange Lounge?

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay, so I started listening to Orange Lounge probably two or more years ago

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
It was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Right

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Let's look for all the good radio shows

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Right, cool

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
And I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Awesome. Sucker

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Alright

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
It's a good time

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
But now you're here, where were you living before?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
But I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
San Luis Obispo is like not that far from here, I'll think it's about a four or five hour drive, so

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Five, six, depending on how you drive

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
More for me

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
More conservative

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Okay, cool, okay, so but now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, very cool

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, thank you for having me

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
No problem, we like having new people, especially guests that bring their own mics

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, I know

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
So that's kind of nice

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Let's see how this one would work

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
This mic, this guy brought is like more expensive probably than the three mics we've been using

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
for the last four years, so

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
The secret is it was the cheapest mic I could find at the store I bought it from

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Where'd you buy it at?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, just a place in San Luis

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh, well

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Alright, well cool

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, WorryBob will be lending his thoughts and stuff on all the gaming news tonight

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But first, we're going to go around and see how everybody's gaming week was in the little bit we call

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
How was your gaming week, starting off with Dark Sakura?

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I like it because it's black

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Once you go black, you never go back

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Mm-hmm

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Anyway

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive, which is going to be loaded up with not porn

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Did you see that? She totally was saying porn

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
And you can't see that

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Not porn

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
You can't see it if you're not in studio, but that wasn't even an intentional mistake

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
At any rate

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Yowie is still porn, you do realize, right?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I'm not going to put Yowie on it

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm going to put lots of doujinshi, though

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Quick sidetrack, because we're talking about replacement hard drives and all that

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Loki, you're like a cracking type person

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Could she take a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Uh, no

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Do I want to?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Do I care?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Why not?

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
You can't see it because the drive has a special model number or serial number or something

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And it only works with one type of hard drive, I see

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
But you can save 100 bucks doing it that way

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Interesting

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over Microsoft

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
The key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
But forget it

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
If you want to be even better, 11 times better

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
How about my gaming week?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Porn downloads

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Porn downloads, what, your gaming week was porn downloads?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
No, Rob, I wasn't finished

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Alright, go ahead

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
What she got me is a paid account for Guild Wars

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I think she tricked you, because you know that at Guild Wars all you have to do is buy the game

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I know, but I only had a trial

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Ah, okay

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Like, I, because I never bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, that's cool

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yep

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
In ten years, yeah

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, okay

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Then again, I did spend, you know, the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
So

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Alright

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Is that it?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yes, Rob

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
You sure?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
You sure you're sure?

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
I thought Peter, you had a second

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
That was it

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
That's it?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
I finished normal and easy, working through hard, playing some of the infernal levels to get more weapons

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
Although that hasn't been going too well, and then, I don't know, pretty soon I'm going to start playing some more Crackdown

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Um, because we're going to land two systems at work and get another copy of that

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And then that'll be fun, so for some co-op

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
And hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And since Scenes of the Road just dropped in price, we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through light podcasts like you

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2 stored neatly on the hard drive

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
But that game actually looks better than this one

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Because I think this is just a remake of the first one

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Are those games, or is that game really good? I want to buy it, but I don't know

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay, well our chat room seems to think that it's a good game

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
We have SSJ100Matt says Earth Defense Force equals Next Gen Body Harvest

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Deakman says Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Dar Tetsuya says is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
D3? No. No, I'm not on their payroll

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple series in the US, hell yeah, I'll take them

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
They can thank you by translating more of them

07:49.000 --> 07:57.000
I mean seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I mean

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I want that game

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
What was that sound? Did somebody get a boner? What was that noise?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
You got a boner?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes, Rob

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
It was just a badly timed clink noise

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Shut up, I'm eating my chicken

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Better than eating your fish

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
I hope they do put out a sequel though, because if they remake the second one or even just do a new one that's got some better enemies in it and stuff

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Hell, you can just do the same damn storyline, doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's just blowing shit up, that's it

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
You can level the entire city and just come back the next level

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Or if you play the level over again

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
They have a gun in there called the genocide gun

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Isn't that that Hult game?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
What? No

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
No, that was Ultimate Destruction

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Press A button, blow shit up

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
That would sell trillions of copies

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
WarioWare genocide

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I mean, because that's all you're doing, your mission

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Okay, we need to destroy the ants

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
That's every level, it's no rescuing, no nothing

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It's just, we're in a different location, let's blow shit up

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
We're in a different location, let's blow shit up

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, there's a giant thing, blow it up

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh, we can't blow it up, run

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, that's it

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Like I said, you can level everything

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made though

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It's so boring

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
You know, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Because of the fact that you can play monsters and eat people and stuff

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
But seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous game play I've ever played

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
It's like SNK

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
I love Metal Slug, shut up

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Gotta love it

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I was playing the other day, and my card wasn't visible

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
That's pretty awesome, actually

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
It's ridiculous, there's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Or like fat air, where your car will just stop like it hit something, but there's nothing there

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Weird stuff

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
If I could write a book about this crap

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Alright, well I'm looking in the chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Remember, we do tape live on Sunday nights, and solicit your feedback here in chat

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
DDRDollarBill agrees with me, Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels, and after that, ZZZZZ, there's no ending

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
True, true that

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I played a game on Nintendo that was like that, it was only interesting for two levels

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Mag Max

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Mag Max?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Mag Max

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Oh, Mag Max, I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Mag Max

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Mag Max, I've never even heard of that

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
And I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
There were some pretty god-awful NES games, actually Mad Max

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Bible Stories

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Was one too

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
You guys are hardcore

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
We were trying to beat the level with this sheep, and we couldn't do it

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day, don't laugh, okay?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
It was a Color Dreams game, let's start with that, okay?

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
And the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
I remember one time when, I remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Not because it's good, not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That might be cool, I don't know

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
No, all that happened was it sucked really bad

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I don't even remember what game it was, some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Alright, anyway, sorry, back to the present

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and, like, stuff like that

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
And, like, all you would do is, like, put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And it'd glitch out different ways, it's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Like you were talking to the glitch

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Like, for example, like, one of our characters when we were playing two-player co-op

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Would be running under everything

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
It wouldn't actually be running on the lair above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But he was running under the world, almost

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
You know, what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And pick, um, game genie codes

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And then edit them until I came out with interesting results

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Like, I ran around with, um, I called him Frog Mario

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Cause he would screen

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Isn't that Luigi?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
No, he was green in the face

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Either that or he was, like, morning green in the face

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Hold your breath, Mario, keep holding it

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
No, don't let up

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
And, like, the pillar effect

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
That was really weird

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Alright

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki, back to the present?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Uh, no

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Alright, I'll go

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past, like, ten years

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Uh, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Cause my friend, you know, Miklotov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Uh, he has, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Rob, you wanna get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Don't you wanna get Pokemon Pearl? Come on!

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Come on! It's got voice chat, come on!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We can play over the internet, come on!

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Uh, and you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kinda cool, it actually works pretty well

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
Um, but here's the thing, is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Like, what, twelve years ago, whenever the first ones came out?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Those games have not changed at all!

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
And you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
But essentially, the battle system is the same freaking thing

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
EEE-EE-EE-EE

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
It's like the sounds they all make, right?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Like, they all make these, like, horrendous little blips and blops noise

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I guess so

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
No room for them

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
So you'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
EEE-EE-EE

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
That's like what some of the Pokemon make, they make these, like, god-awful noises

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Now fight for me

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Come on, you little bitch, what's wrong with you?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
He's sitting there, EEE-EE-EE-EE

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Shut up and fight

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
You don't fight, you go back in the ball

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
You want no ball, no ball

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Okay, follow me with this, okay? This is gonna go on a weird tangent

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know, evolving into Pokemon

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That attack you in the wild

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah, attack you in the wild

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Stick them in a cardboard box

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And get them to fight each other

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And then Nintendo could put it out and everybody would be, you know, accepting of it

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw you up

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, yeah

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS and it's, it's, it's fun

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm having a good time with it

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Like, for example, let's add voice over IP chat to Pokemon

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
Why? I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, I don't know, I'm gonna add GPS to Metroid

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I mean, it's just, why do we need that?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
That would actually be really cool

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, it's actually kind of cool because, like, now I kind of use it as a phone

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
But it's, excuse me, it's kind of a pain to set it up

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
Because, you know, you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on Instant Messenger

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now and then I go, you know, I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And all that, and that's how you set it up

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's gonna be on

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected, you know what I mean?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy, where's the fun in that?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I guess not, so

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
But the other interesting thing that Wi-Fi is doing is that now that you have this global trading network

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Is that, you know, you can trade these crap Pokémon for really good Pokémon

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
And, I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Like, it's cool to have English names, I guess

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
So, if you want my Pokémon, because I named my Pokémon really dumb stuff

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Like, I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokémon?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I think I named him Muffins

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And I named them all cute things

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And Fancy Pants is one that my friend has

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokémon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
So, that's something I've been playing

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Is it Epic Pinball?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
That was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
But, the physics and everything else with the game, I mean, is really good

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And they definitely build it to be expandable

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Like, they're going to have new tables for download later on

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Let's just see how much they're going to charge us for them

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Hopefully it's not too bad, but we shall see

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Because since I was gone pretty much all last week

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I had rest bar for like a level and a half

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so, you know, I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
My gaming week was pitiful

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Tried to play Frequency, but that's on a blue PS2 CD

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
And my drive is dying and can't play those

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphied, I'd like to play Sylphied

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, that's on a blue disc too

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Sylphied

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So I said, okay, screw this

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So I went over to my new Commodore

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission that was given to work

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
That doesn't work either

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
So I said screw it and went back to Guitar Hero

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So boring

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on a Commodore 64?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But you haven't gotten anything to work on it

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Well, I've gotten...

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Oh, what game did I get to work on that?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I got The Hobbit to work on it

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Which is, well, it's a text adventure

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And I didn't really have the time to put in for one

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I wanted an action game

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Although I did go on GameTap

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I took it back, I went on GameTap

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Which I downloaded on a whim recently

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And played that Commodore breakdancing game

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Break-in or whatever it's called

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Have you played that thing?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I did for a little bit

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
It's like Simon Says Play DDR

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
It meets Busta Crap

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That game was so terrible

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Busta Crap

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
So bad

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
But yeah, that was my gaming week

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Mostly Guitar Hero

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, Guitar Hero

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Alright, very cool

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Alright, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Jamie and I were on vacation

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And even before we went on vacation

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I was out of town for most of the week

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
So we were so behind on gaming news

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
And we didn't even

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We really actually didn't even get home from the trip

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
At Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Because Peter's been listening to the show

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
And give us the hookup and all that stuff

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So thanks, dude

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And hope to see you again

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And we'll hopefully, maybe in future weeks

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Give the OLR listeners a little more warning

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
When we're going to Disneyland next time

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And maybe do a little meet up there or something

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Because that'll be fun

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
We could all ride pirates together

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And sing along with it

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, exactly

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Because that won't annoy the other people in the boat to hell or anything

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
The drunken sorority girls were funny

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Oh yeah, the drunken sorority

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
In the boat ahead of us

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I kept expecting one to fall in

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Didn't the one girl go like, I love you

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
At me or something

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
How were the changes

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I was doing that to Barbossa

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
The changes on pirates?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, I still haven't seen it yet

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
It's, you know, they

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
YouTube

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
It's, they have Jack Sparrow in it

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Which of course gives everybody this big fan-gasm

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I think it changed for the better

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
There were two series of changes

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Before this, I think

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
They tried to make the ride all PC

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh, the politically correct version

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And then people bitched

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
So they tried to ease it through

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Like, I don't know

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Would sit down by the barrel

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And this girl would come out of it and say

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
You know, he wanted the girl too

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
When she was hiding in the barrel behind him

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And then they changed it to something else

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Like she had something

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
And then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
But I like at the end when he's there singing

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Oh yeah, I like that too

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
I don't call him Jack Sparrow

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I call him Johnny Depp

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Just because

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It was really cool

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh, you didn't get to see it when they had the

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
With the old bride's attic

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Rob had to be escorted off the ride

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Yes, when I was eight years old

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I had to be escorted off the ride

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Because I screamed my head off

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
There are no windows and no doors

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
And I'm like

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Ah ha ha ha!

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Ah ha ha ha!

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Yes, I seriously thought I was going to die

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
You do everything and you look up and there's the skeleton hanging from the noose

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
It was horrible for a kid

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You see all the pictures of the dead people

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Anyway, sorry, this isn't the Disneyland podcast

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I love the Disneyland podcast

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
We had a good time

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
But there are, you know, sometimes there's Disney games and stuff, right?

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Like I remember on the NES there was that horrible Adventures in the Magic Kingdom game

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Or Kingdom Hearts

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Well, there's that Meteos game

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
I found out also though that I can get like an Uber discount through work for Disney World

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Hmm

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Like seven days for the price of four at a discount

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Seven days

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
There are also some pretty cool Flash games you can play

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
In case you wanted to know what it's like to be a Disney employee

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
They have at the website sims.themagical.nl

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
And you can check out, they've got four different simulator rides on there

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
You can run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Which is your Disney version of the Haunted Mansion

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Which is actually cooler than ours

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And you can actually kind of run those

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I actually played the Phantom Manor one

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
And that was kind of fun

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It was, you know, looks very similar to like

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
You know, I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
By the way, all the rides go faster at night

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, I was going to say in this simulator do the rides go faster at night

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
That's what I want to know

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I don't think so

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
That actually is our end joke

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Loose

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
But it's really true on a lot of the rides

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
It's totally true

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
The rides do go faster at night

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Anyway

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
The teacups go really fast at night

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Alright, look, we've got to save this for another podcast

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So we need to get into some gaming news

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Since we did miss last week

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Since we didn't have a show

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Sorry kids

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Okay

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Anyways, real quick

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
There's a few things that were getting updated

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
A few systems

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Including some wonderful games being added to it

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Like Mercenaries

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Turn to Castle Wolfenstein I guess is pretty cool

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Soul Calibur 2

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
And let's see here

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
This is kind of neat

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Guilty Gear Iseka

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
So lots of fun stuff there

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And Jet Set Radio Future

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
How could I forget that?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
So Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
But the combo disc is not on the list

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Riddle me that one

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It might work though

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
No, it doesn't

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
People tried it

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, okay, well then that sucks

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Way to do your research, Loki

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
It was on our own forums

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Just kidding

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Anyways

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Another thing

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Or another system that was getting an update

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Actually the Playstation 3

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
And they went to firmware 1.7

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
And that allows you now to be able to play Playstation 1 games on the Playstation 3

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
Because there was all those Playstation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
But you had to have a PS3 to download them

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Which is retarded in itself

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
But now you can actually use that to play those games

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
So, hooray

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And according

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Originally they were thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
But right now it hasn't been determined yet

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
What will be available and when

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
But they are coming

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
So that's good

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And then of course

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
This was also interesting

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
Konami has decided to close its Redwood City office

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
And move everything to the LA offices

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
So no more Northern California Gamers Day unfortunately

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Which is kind of interesting

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Because Dark Soccer and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Last week on our way to Disneyland

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Which is the first time I've actually been there

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It's in a really nice area though

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
That business complex area

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's like the river going through and everything

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
They're probably having to move because rent is really big over there

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I wouldn't doubt it

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
It's the Bay Area

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Just real quick mentions

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yes

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Using the House of the Dead 3 engine

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
So that's kind of exciting

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
They're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
In which you'll be able to

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Be crowned against the Pac-Man World Champion

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And receive a custom

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Yippee

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Wait here's the prize

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
100,000 Microsoft points

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Guitar Hero 2 songs

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
And 26 years of one free Quizno subs a week

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Okay

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And then apparently

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Wait wait

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
26 years of a free Quizno sub a week

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Yes

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Jesus

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I guess

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
So the contest begins April 25th

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Runs through May 9th

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And the finalists will be chosen

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
And then they'll officially be on

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I guess there's some

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
It's being sponsored by Quiznos obviously

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But I'm going to be kind of interested

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Just like my dinner

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest to start soccer?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Probably not

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I suck at Pac-Man

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
If you're interested in joining

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Go to XboxLiveTournament.com

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
To register

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That's it

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Alright well thank you for the wrap up on last week's news

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It is very much appreciated

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Since we were too lazy to do a show last week

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
So thank you

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Alright now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Making things current

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
In this week's news I was awesome as usual

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
No really

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
April fools

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Hey Rob shut up

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It's almost May

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Seriously

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Well in response to the demand for the Wii

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Nintendo has promised to increase production

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
So that they can meet the demand that's out there for it

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
They said that they were producing 1 million units per month

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
And are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
So they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
So yeah

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Wii

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
So now you might actually be able to find one correct?

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
Well so far to date 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Dang

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
Which actually didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
I don't remember too many numbers with these sales things

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And then they always change

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Especially over at the Sony cap

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It was like we're going to have a million out by the end of the year

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
We're going to eat crayons

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Shipped

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Shipped

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah shipped

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
No no we meant shipped

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
Do we mean did we say by the end of the year we meant by the end of April

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
We meant 10 boxes put together in the shape of a ship

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
When we said year we meant fiscal year

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
When we said year we meant fiscal year

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
The new year doesn't start until we say it does

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
We used the lunar calendar

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
So I can't follow all this stupid you know goals and sales stuff

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need the ramp up production

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Seen as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And now there's Wiis available

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Hmm yeah

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I'm sure they're ramping up production

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Yep that's really what's going on

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Well one thing that's also conspiracy is where the hell are the games

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
I mean we had

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I ate them

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
We had Super Paper Mario came out recently

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
And um well

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Kororimpa I guess

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
No there was

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
No there's been

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
WarioWare and Wii Play

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Like four months ago but what's come out in like the past month

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Not a lot

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Wii Play I'm sure didn't take much so you know

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Work to get it finished since they were all the E3 tech demos

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Well anyway

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
So obviously a lot of folks are asking where's the games

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
And Satoru Iwata said you want games?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'll give you games

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
He said the company is developing 124 games for the Wii and the Nintendo DS

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Now out of those 124

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
45 of them are in development for the Wii

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
79 in development for the DS

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
So you might be going well you know why is the DS getting all the love

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Well because there's like what like 20 million DS's out there

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
So obviously you know it's a very big platform to be developing for

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
And of course 45 games just being developed not being released this year

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
Well who knows because here's a short list of some of the games being developed

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
The Legend of Zelda on the DS

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Phantom Hourglass

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
You know Metroid and all that fun stuff

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Project Hammer and all those other crappy games

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Orzic Sight Truck 2

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I mean how many other A-list titles are there?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I don't know

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I was going to say because Nintendo's known for only putting out

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
One, two really big name games a year

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
So yeah they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So that's 10 a year

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
But also that's them that they have in development too

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
All those games are what Nintendo has in house developing

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Mario Party 8 and so on and so on

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
But outside that's not counting what Konami's got in development

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
What Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Cooking Mama 2

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Revenge of the Horrible Translation

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Boo

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Stop porting DS games to the Wii

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
chat.orangelandrater.com reminds us of another story that came up this week

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I don't think it was on our show roll

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
But Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros. Brawl

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
And apparently it's nearly done according to I think some podcast

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Where there was an interview with Kojima

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
He's actually played it and it's just about done

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Because Mario's such a legend

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I've lost all respect for him

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I know seriously

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
It's a fighting game

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
He makes freaking Metal Gear games

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Shoot people in the face and then it's like

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Oh but I can't punch Mario

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I can't punch a fat plumber

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I can't do that

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And he says oh no I can't punch Mario

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Five seconds later

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
He's like yeah

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Because I loved Mario growing up

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
But then after I got past that

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It was fucking on

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I owned the crap out of the water

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
TheRobD says Cooking Mama 2

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Mama teaches You Poison

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And um

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Sakura Max says Cooking Mama 2

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Cooking Drugs

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Mama's crack house

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Don't worry

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Mama will fix it

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Mama will give you your fix

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Win

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Or even better

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Mama's son or whatever

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Accidentally kills one of his friends

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Don't worry Mama will fix it

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
We're going to chop the body up

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And put it in the food

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
We'll hide that

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
No one will notice

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Anywho

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Turkey surprise

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
So apparently Square Enix has said that

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
There will not be any of their games

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Coming to at least the Japanese

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Virtual console

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
At least that's what's kind of hinted

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Lies

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I think so too

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
They're saying that we feel the Japanese market

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Is a problem in the media

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Are played by a wide range of users

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
From children to adults

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
So limitations when you consider a problem

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That we would have with billing systems

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Okay

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
That's retarded

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
What game have I been bitching and bitching about

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That the Japanese have and Europe has

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But we still don't have

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
What game have I been bitching on this show

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Oonga Boonga

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Pop Quiz

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Actraiser

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Who made Actraiser

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Square

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Enix made Actraiser

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Square Enix

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
So what do you mean Square Enix

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Games aren't coming to Virtual Console

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Actraiser is already there

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
What do you mean it's not in the US

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I bought a cartridge of that not long ago

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Let me put it this way okay

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
To be honest this is coming from

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Originally from an IGN interview

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
With a Square Enix representative

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And it's actually from

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I guess a magazine Nintendo Dream

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Or something like that

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Here because I think what they're talking about

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Is digital downloads in Japan

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
That they aren't going to go to a strictly

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Digital download system or whatever

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And it might make sense

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
That they might not put like

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
On the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I was going to say that's what it is

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
They're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
They're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
And 3 and so on

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
On Virtual Console because you stupid Americans

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Will continue to pay $29.99

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
For the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Awesome they're so cool

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because of that I think that's the reason yeah

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
But I would say there is still hope

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
For Illusion of Gaia and

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Soul Blazers and all those other old school

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Enix games at least I don't know about Chrono Trigger

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Because they'll probably do

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
An advanced version of that at some point

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I will bet you money

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That there will be a PSP

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Version of Chrono Trigger in some time

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
In the near future because they love

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Releasing

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Re-releases and stuff

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Is this something in your database you're just afraid to say something about?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This is purely speculation because

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
They're doing Star Ocean

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
They're supposed to be a new Star Ocean

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Game which I do believe we did see

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
A little movie for it a couple

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Years ago at E3 I could have sworn

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It was just like that

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
There was like another game series

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
That they were teasing too that I haven't seen

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Anything on like

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The code something or whatever

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
The Square Enix movie room and you saw all the

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Movies literally every single

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Game and then like oh and Star Ocean

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Yeah it was something like that

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I know that there has been a trailer

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Because like I said there was

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Some other game series that they were doing

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
That were supposed to be mobile, Playstation 2

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And I think maybe PSP or something

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
That they haven't released yet

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
That's going to be coming out

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
DDRDollarBill says

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
If they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It better be that fucking good

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And damage it

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
He's letting his fucking thoughts be known there

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Such overuse of the F word there

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
What the fuck word?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
See it's because

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You know why it's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Like they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And if you ever try to

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Get in that whole Final Fantasy 6 is better

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
No it's not

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You have to wonder, he said fix

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
What exactly does fix mean?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy 7

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
That's what it was, Code Age

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Was the game that they were teasing and stuff

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Remember there was supposed to be three different games in that series

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
One of them, Code Age Commanders

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Was supposed to be on Playstation 2

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And I believe the cell phones had another one

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Code Age something

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I don't remember what the other

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
System it was on

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Code Age

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Where'd it go? I just saw it

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Who cares

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Alright well

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Regardless

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I think it's certainly possible we're going to see

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
At least some of the Enix games show up on Virtual Console

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Especially because in the case of

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Illusion of Gaia, Nintendo

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I think published it

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Even though Enix made it if I remember right

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Because there was a strategy guide and everything

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
So I think some of those games are still possible

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But as far as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Triggers of the world

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I want my goddamn

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Super Mario RPG

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You have to mod your Xbox

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Which I know you've done and play it on an emulator

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And then you paint your Xbox white

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And you call it a Wii

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Wii

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Wii

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So anyway

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Just a little bit of news

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
For the Tokyo Game Show

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Nintendo actually will be a big participant there

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This is actually the first time

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Since 1996 that

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Nintendo is having a booth there

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So it's a pretty big deal

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
But it's supposed to be

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
This massive, massive booth

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
So I think that's going to be pretty cool

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That actually is in relation to

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Dragon Quest 9

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Ah I see

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So Nintendo is always like

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Oh we're not going to go to the Tokyo Game Show

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
But now that they have Dragon Quest

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
They're like well we better fucking go

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Because Dragon Quest is

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Because Square Enix calls the shots

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Fuckers

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Get my goddamn Super Mario RPG

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Get over it

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Dragon Quest 9 on the DS

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Is probably the reason for that

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
So Loki since we suck

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
And we're not going to E3

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
That might be fun

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Oh come on you don't want to go to Tokyo?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Right

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Because E3 wasn't bad enough

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I have to go someplace where I don't understand anything

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And he can cosplay

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Look at me

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I'm stupid American foreigner

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Oh film him he crazy

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I mean seriously

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I'm just like

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
No

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Wow

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I can play DDR they'd love that

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I could be on a variety show or something

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
American guy play DDR

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
That white man playing DDR

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So funny

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
He uncoordinated

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You see what happens when we're gone for a week

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
It's just like

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Man somebody put some drugs in the food

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Anyhow

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
For it what about a keyboard

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The latest Game Informer

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Magazine has a little spiel on a Wii

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Keyboard it says quote

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Nintendo's development team says that it's considering

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
A keyboard peripheral to the system

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
In order to make online surfing easier

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But it has not officially announced

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Anything at this time

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Why would they want to make online surfing easier

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
They're not making online friend codes easier

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh wait no friend codes aren't easy so

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Well what if they put

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Super Mario RPG in like flash or something

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Then you could use your browser to play it on the Wii

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I bet you'd need a friend code to get to it

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Your friend codes faster

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Which is why we're not getting rid of them

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The internet faster on the Wii

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Go to your PC

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And surf it there

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Put your PC on your Wii

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
So you're technically surfing it on your Wii

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
There you go

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Science

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Yeah so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
But I don't see the point unless there's like

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Games that start supporting it

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Typing of the Dead

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Hey

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Typing of the Dead

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That would be great if you had a motion sensing keyboard

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And you could actually aim the keyboard

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And then press the enter key

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You know they could do I think though

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That would be rad

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
They could do the gun survivor series

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh yeah they could

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
On Wii

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
No I want a typing of the dead 2

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Where I literally have to pick up my keyboard

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And smack zombies with it

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
That's better

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
House of the Dead is a light gun game

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You just plug your keyboard in

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
The keyboard guy fills up the guy with the pointer with typing

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Because everything you have to plug into

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
The Wii remotes anyways

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
You have to plug in the classic controller

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Has to be threaded through your Wii remote and all the enhancements

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
So this keyboard is probably going to have to

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Plug into the Wii remote so you have this big thing

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Dangling there off your keyboard

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wii mote to the keyboard

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
So you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Beautiful

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The keyboard in your lap you're trying to shift your waist around

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
You just put it on your head

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Move your head around

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Do you remember that Rob?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I know

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
They had this Atari controller back in the day

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That you would

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
It was trying to be like the ESP controller

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
But really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
Trying to distract you when you were playing ET from how bad it was

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
What?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I'll try to find it

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Little do the listeners know

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
That Dark Sakura's Folgers Coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I thought that you with your gaming knowledge would know this Rob

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
You disappoint me

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Adventure

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
And there was no eye wiggling

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Or nose twitching

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I dream of genie motions

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Going on in that game

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Yellow block vs squiggly thing called the Dragon

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
The Atari Mind Link controller

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
That was it

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
It's Bewitched technology

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
No it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I found it

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Put it using the Wikipedia link now

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Along with your bad Wikipedia self

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Mix that thing with that Amiga lap board controllers

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
You had to do that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Do you know about that one?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
The Zen Guru Master game

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
So if you tilted too far to the left or right

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
You broke your concentration and the game failed you

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
You were a disappointed guru

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Some of these games sound really awful

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
We should have the most frustrating game challenge

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
Let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Break Dance game

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
I have a Sega Activator

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Yeah me too

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Or play anything with the Power Glove

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Anything

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
The Power Glove was a piece of shit

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Anyways

45:46.000 --> 45:56.000
Apparently Time magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people

45:56.000 --> 46:06.000
He's done a lot of things including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Zelda

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
The Wii

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
All that fun stuff

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I think they have to do this because it's a new game console

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
It's just a gamey

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
I actually looked at the results the other day and Miyamoto was number 2 on this little user poll

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
They have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I believe he was number 2

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
I think Perez Hilton was number 5

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
He's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
You should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Who's more influential?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Purple!

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Or Pink or whatever

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
No that was Perez Hilton

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I need to check the voting channel

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I haven't used that channel in a long time

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Last time I played it I remembered there was a question

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Who's going to win American Idol?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Melinda Sanjaya

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It's fascinating

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They still haven't used any of my submissions

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
This makes me very sad

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Clowns or rape?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I think I submitted a question that said which is funnier clowns or rape?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
No I'm just kidding

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I'm going to get so much hate mail

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I was drunk

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I'm going to get hate mail from clowns

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I hate clowns

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
I submitted a serious one that says which dessert is better?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Cake or pie?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
You know this is something that needs to be asked

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Of the American public

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
We need to settle this debate once and for all

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I swear to god pie is better

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
I should do one that says are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Is the glass half empty or half full?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Anyway

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Happy happy day

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Ken Kutaragi

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
He of the crayon eating

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Bicycle helmet wearing

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
You know

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Leash

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I want to make more further shots of that

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
He who sucks so bad

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Has retired from his position

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
With the Playstation

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
So

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Except

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Guess what happens when you cut off this head

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Another one has regrown in its place

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
In the form of Kazuo Hirai

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Kutaragi is a hydra

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Yes

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Giant enemy hydra

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Anyways

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
What's a Nubian

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Shut the fuck up

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I don't know I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I love that whole scene

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
What's a Nubian

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Bitch you almost made me laugh

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Anyways

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I love

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But fear not

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Because the craziness at Sony is still not over

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Ken may be gone

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
But their PR department is still there

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
To make a complete ass of themselves

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Including such things as

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
The Playstation 2 launch party

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
For God of War 2

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
In the UK

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
They've decided to celebrate this in the non offensive way

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
At all by offering

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
A decapitated goat

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Which

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Guests were invited to

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Reach in and eat offal

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
From the stomach of the goat

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Also there were naked chicks there as well

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
So

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Apparently people are a little pissed off at the fact

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That there was a decapitated goat there

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
That was still

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Warm you know

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
PETA

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Didn't you eat PETA

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Earlier

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
People eating tasty animals

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
But apparently

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
People were pissed off at this

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I'm pissed off because I wasn't invited

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Sounds like fun

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
They had topless girls

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
That were dripping

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Grapes into guests mouths

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Male model portraying Kratos

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
And

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
He was handing out garlands

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Apparently

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
The international fund for

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Animal welfare said

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
It was outrageous that the animals death

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Have to be used to sell a few computer games

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Dude

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I dare one of our listeners to email

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
PETA a link to one of these stories

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
What is their website?

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
PETA2.org or something

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I once

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Went out with someone who worked for PETA

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
And man they're nuts

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
So I want to see what happens when they get

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
A hold of this story

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I don't know I'm sick

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I have a problem

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
There's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
When PETA gets a hold of what's going on here

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Honestly I mean

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Other than the fact that it is kind of cool though

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
That they do have like you know

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Topless chicks there

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
But

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
What PR guy thought it was a great idea

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
To decapitate a goat at a party

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And have people eat from its entrails

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I mean

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Who proves this crap?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Like I mean seriously was some guy

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Like sitting there playing a game or something

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Yeah I need you to prove this

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
PR event info

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Back to playing God of War 2

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I could play the sex minigame

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Maybe it was an animatronic goat

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Not judging by the picture on that article

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
They blurred out

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
The decapitated goat

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Blurred out the decapitated head

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
That apparently was hanging on by a string

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Still

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Is that like some type of you know

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Ancient Roman custom?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
They seem to think so

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I want to say I was reading some thread about this

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
On the internet and someone came out and said

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Well actually you know I

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I live with a scholar on Greece

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
And no they didn't do this at all

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So they got it wrong

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I have no idea if this is true or not

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It says apparently

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Well dude

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I can hear the Sony meeting now

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
And the Angra PD letters start coming

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Whoa we read about it on Wikipedia

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
So it must be true

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I mean what do you mean

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
They didn't decapitate goats in Greece

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
It was on Wikipedia

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Yeah

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Speaking of things hanging on by a string

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Kudaraki may have some hope left

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
In where he can go next

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I mean true he's going to be on the board at you know Sony or whatever

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Very interesting

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Of course Iwata being the president of Nintendo

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Iwata stated quote

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
They would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Yeah

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Doesn't that prospect make you excited?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Kudaraki would be like

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
We will be producing 10 billion wii's

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Next week

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Rob it makes me so excited

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
That I feel irregular

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Now of course the likelihood of this actually happening

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Is slim to none

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Seeing as you know Kudaraki is still on the board

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Over at Sony Europe

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
And also you notice Iwata didn't say exactly

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
What Kudaraki would do at Nintendo

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You know

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I think the rest of the quote

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
The quote was would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
And then the rest of the quote was

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
In the available warehouse position

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
That we have

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Tailing out the wii's to best buys all over the world

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
They named him chief operating officer of crayons

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Of the janitorial department

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
You realize the acronym for which is kook

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Anyway

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So moving forward

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
How about some news that doesn't involve Kudaraki please

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Well kind of

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Alright

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
The Playstation store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
The demo is available

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Here in the US

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And also a demo

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
For Virtua Tennis

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
So that's pretty cool

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Also trailers for

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Gauntlet 2

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The Wheelman

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
John Woo's Stranglehold

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Is set for June

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
So basically you could sum this

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Whole story up by basically saying

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Playstation network actually

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Gets content

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
There was Tekken

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I guess that's true

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
There was Tekken

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
There was Xbox 360

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Hey to their credit

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Has upped it to two arcade titles a week

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Recently so you know

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
More than some of us can handle

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
So there you go

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Speaking of stuff coming out soon

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
We're going to take a look around the world

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
At some various release dates

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
What's coming up in the near future in some various countries

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Around the world

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
And during my portion of this segment

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I usually talk about what's going on in Japan

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
With the Japanese release dates

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Really not a lot

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And for the DS but honestly game wise

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
As far as Japanese release dates go

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
There's really only like one game

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Coming out

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Called Osawari Tantai

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Osawarina

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Also known as Good Prince

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
And it's an adventure game coming out from

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm not sure who actually

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Is putting this out

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Success is putting this out

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Based on an anime game

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Looks to be

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Well very boring actually

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Is what the game looks to be

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So if you are interested in boring games check that one out

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's it for Japanese release dates

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
There's really nothing coming out this week over there

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
We want more release dates

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
More

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
More

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Spelled with an A

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Okay

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
You can get really excited about

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
A face cover portable

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Coming out on the Sony PSP

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
In black, blue, pink, and white

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That's my favorite game already

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Face cover portable

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
You stick the PSP in front of your face

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And it puts like

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Different faces on your face

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I think it's great that they have a face cover

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
In black when the PSP is black

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Oh it's a system cover

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I get it

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Anyways for the US we actually do have some things

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Coming out

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
There's going to be Spiderman 3 the game

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Coming out on Friday to coincide with movies

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Basically on every system

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
In fact the Playstation 3 is getting

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
A special limited edition one as well

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
On the Wii

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
We are also getting Heat Seeker

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Which is also coming out on Playstation 2

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
As well

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Also Legend of the Dragon

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Which is based off some really crappy

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I guess TV animated series

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
On the Disney channel

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And it's coming out on the Wii

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And Playstation 2 as well

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Also this week though

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
We should be seeing

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
God

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I want to say

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
There's actually

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Not too much else coming out

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
There's the cube on

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
PSP which is like a puzzle game

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
The ultimate board game collection

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Which is coming out from

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Or it's being distributed through

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Capcom

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
The ultimate in board games

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It's a board game collection

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
We're going to fuck you up

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
With some sorry

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
You can't handle

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
All this clue we got up in here

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
But here's

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I think I'll leave it with the

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Some of the best stuff right here

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We've got

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
This part's cheesy

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
On the PC

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Fairy Godmother Tycoon

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Is coming out

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Once again proving that there are way too many

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Board game tycoon games

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Board game tycoon

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yeah

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I vote for

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Although I did find the coolest board game today

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
And apparently it's one that's been out for a while

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
And I just didn't know about it

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Anti-monopoly

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I've never heard of anti-monopoly

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
That's why when you win the game you lose

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Because the government breaks you up

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I think so

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Anyway how about some UK release dates

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
That point to owning Baltic Avenue

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And Mediterranean

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I think it's good PR

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Anyway

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
All these release dates are for the 4th

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
On PSP

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
We have Mindy Storm on DS

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
We have Tony Hawk's Project 8

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
On PSP

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Untold Legends Dark Kingdom on Playstation 3

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And Final Fantasy 3 for the DS

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Yay

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Final Fantasy 3 is a good one

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
There's a lot of good games in that

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Yeah, good stuff

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Man later on they're getting some other really good games

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Like Mario Strikers

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Ooh Spongebob

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Actually I heard that Strikers really sucks

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But you didn't hear that from me

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Hey how about Picross

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
There you go

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Alright anyhow

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Moving on to stuff coming out in the future

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Eternal Sonata

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Eternal Sonata of course known as what

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Trusty Bell over in Japan we're getting

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Eternal Sonata and what's interesting

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Is that the ESRB is showing that this game

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Is not just coming out on the Xbox 360

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
But it's also coming out on the Playstation 3

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Kind of interesting because

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
You've heard about all these you know exclusive

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Games going from the Playstation 3

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Over to the Xbox 360

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
But this is one you know I think a lot of people were looking forward to

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
That now seems to have gone the other way

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Of course if I recall right Eternal Sonata

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Was never promised as an exclusive title

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Either way so it's not like this is like

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Huge like OMG

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Microsoft got pwned type news

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
No it's just you know hey it might be coming

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Out for this other platform as well

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And of course this would be the one that's what it's based all

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Off what Chopin's music

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Or something

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I think that's right

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
It looks like an interesting title based on the

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Screenshots it looks very like Final Fantasy

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Ish and I like how the

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Characters names are like Polka

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And Allegretto and all that stuff that's cute

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
It's basically about

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
A magical land that

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
When you get terminally

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Ill you go to this magical land

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
That's what happens

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's like that cloud thing wait so this is

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Make-A-Wish the game? Basically yes

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Okay

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Anyways

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
The Playstation Network is also getting

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Some other interesting games coming out

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Including a game

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Called Snakeball which is supposedly

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
The

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The funkiest online sport

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Ever created

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The quotes IGN

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So no idea what exactly

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
That's gonna be but

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I don't know it looks cute I guess

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So that's kinda neat

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That's cute except the game is called

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Snakeball

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That's just asking for trouble in VR

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But anyways it says

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And I believe Snakeball could be a euphemism for

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Penis

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Because there's a snake and balls

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Snakeball you I guess

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Are donning your disco shoes

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And you glide across a dance floor

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
On a hover snake

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
While collecting colored balls to score

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Points and it says other players

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Can rapidly reduce your point

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tally by flicking you with their

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tails or blasting you with

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Their weapons and I guess

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's gonna support

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
An option to

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Import your face and map it on to stuff

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I don't know

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Looks okay it's kinda neat

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The other thing that they're gonna be getting

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Is a brand new game called

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Stardust HD

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Which I guess is a cross between asteroids

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And I guess

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Since everybody compares this

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Games to this

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Geometry Wars

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
So yet another game

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Where you blow up a lot of shit

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I think a game is like Geometry Wars

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
If you shoot stuff

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Hostile one in our chatroom

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com has a comment on the

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Snakeballs game he says

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Get these motherfucking snakeballs off

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
My motherfucking console

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Get it? Like snakes on

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah get it?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Movie sucked

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Dude I love snakes on the plane but I really liked it

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Just for the situation I saw it in

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Where me and Meg Z and Chris all had stuffed

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Snakes that we picked up at the uh

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I thought you were gonna say it was an in flight movie

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
That would've been great

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Can I touch you? Or will I

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Will I bleed from your awesomeness?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I don't know

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Wow

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I feel like death

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I got gay from Rob

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It's all over my foot

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Alright

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Dark Sakura the gay foot

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Rob

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Oh my god Dark Tetsuya said touch DS

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That was funny

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Anyway

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So guess what we have

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Wait a minute

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Wait a minute

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's fucking awesome I can't stop

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Dude

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I was like touching Dark Sakura's foot and I was like hee hee

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I saw Loki like drinking

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The sauce from McDonald's

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I was because it's so tasty

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Oh my god that's nasty

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Sweet and sour sauce

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I ran out of nuggets

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Anyway

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Are you one of those people that bitches at the drive through

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Because they're like okay

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
If you only get six nuggets

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You only get one sweet and sour sauce

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Pack and if you want more

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You gotta pay ten cents extra

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Apparently

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
No two's enough

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
For like a ten piece nuggets

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Or whatever but you know

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
They gave me three so what the fuck am I supposed to

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I can't just save it for next time

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Think about it Rob that's like a shot for ten cents

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Dude I mean

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I take syrup shots I mean come on

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Do you eat the jams

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
At like waffle country waffles

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Oh god

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I don't like jam

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Nasty nasty nasty

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
You took syrup shots with everybody Rob

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I'm gonna finish drinking this now

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I was drunk

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
At Roscoe's?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I don't know it's just my excuse for everything

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Fine so guess what Sony's giving us

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Food

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Crabs? Aids?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Hot shots tennis

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Oh I was gonna say shots

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You can dress up the little girls in different costumes

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
That's not very hot

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It's hot shots

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I guess it's supposed to be cute

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yummy

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So yeah hot shots tennis

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yay next

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I love your reporting DarkSakura

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You don't even bother to give us

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The details you just like

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah Sony's making a hot shots

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Tennis game and you can dress chicks up

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
But this game sucks

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I can do that in Dead or Alive and then this one I get bouncing

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Boobies so huh

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Alright

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Well of course

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
E3 is coming to town of course

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It's coming to Santa Monica

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Where exactly in town they haven't really said

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
From what I understand they've kind of like told people

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Okay be on the street corner

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh yeah the invitations at the house I could have looked there

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Well they're gonna tell you like be on the street corner

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And it's like going to a rave

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Apparently is what E3 is tuned into

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Like dude there's gonna be like this sweet party

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
At this like vacated airport hangar

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But like we can't tell you where it is on the flyer

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It's like an unmarked bus is gonna come pick you up

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And take you to the location

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's gonna be an all night party

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
One of the E's now stands for Ecstasy

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Apparently

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It was like E4

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
We're putting the E in E3

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Well anyhow the interesting thing about E3

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Is that last year there were 400 companies

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Debuting stuff at E3 and showing off their latest stuff

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
This year there are 32 companies

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Showing off at this year's E3

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Now granted Sony's on the list

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Microsoft's on the list

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And Nintendo's on the list

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Because all the companies that are debuting stuff

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Is a lot of the big big companies

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Uh it's basically

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Kenshi Hall was where you know

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Where those 400 companies were last year

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But it's still kind of surprising there

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I guess not

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So uh

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
The invitations are down by the way

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
To between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
60,000

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Is one of the companies that's gonna have a booth there

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
G4 because you know they always have a booth

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
No G4 is not on the exhibitors list

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
But they will probably still somehow have like

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
500 people

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
At E3

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
All in those ugly shirts

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Well anyway

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I realized Dark Sakura got an invite

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
To E3 but

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Have you even followed up on it?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I think you need to

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I've been reading Twitter

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I got my invite and I did my confirmation

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So I've got my physical thing in the mail

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Lucky you

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Have fun, take pictures

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Wait a minute

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Loki and I are sitting here going

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
God damn motherfucking E3

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And you're like

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Oh yeah I got an invite just kind of sitting at home

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I don't know I may not go

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I actually am putting my focus on my education

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
So maybe

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I don't know if people want to give me money I'll go

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Cause it's kind of expensive to stay down there

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I hope you're listening ESA

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Fuckers

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
This is when you're inviting people that don't want to go

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I didn't say I don't want to go

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I can't afford to go

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
My name is Dark Sakura

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
AKA Jamie Summers

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And I think you should let me into E3

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I'm really angry about things

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Let me play your game god damn it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
No no

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
If they would give me a place to stay

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Then I would be happy

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I just wear glasses do my hair

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And that little A style that Dark Sakura has hers

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And I can sneak in as her

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah but you have to

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I want to play your game does it have boobs

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Whatever

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Jamie could be a guys name

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Whatever

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Alright anyhow

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
This is California it's high me

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'm sorry

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Whatever

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Well anyway every time I hear about E3

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And how it's kind of going a little bit downhill

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And the fact that there's this big party going on

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And I'm not invited

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I get a little bit angsty

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I know what that means

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Dark Sakura would you care to start us off

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
With the FUs of the week

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Matthew of the week goes

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It's very simple

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Goes to stupid drama

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
On my birthday

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Hey dude the lines were short

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And the teacups were not being opened

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
That was sad

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And and and and and

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Fuckers

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And and and and and

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Yeah done

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Loki

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Fuck you to the dumbass that ran

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Our games at Qsar last night

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Because you are

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
A dumb fucking

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The job I mean because I've done the job

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's not that fucking hard

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And now you've failed at every aspect of it

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And like when I was playing in front of him

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
He was like mystified like I was doing magic

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Or something you know

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So how are you doing that

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Horrible

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The Qsar has really gone downhill in Vacaville

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
All packs are all fucked up

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So fuck them for screwing that up

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I would like to give an FU to Loki's wife Nellie

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
For shooting me fifty-eight times

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
In one game at said Qsar

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Because the

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The defense shields so she could just shoot me

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Over and over and over and over and over again

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Which is what she did she just basically held the gun up to my back

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And kept shooting because those

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I could not shoot the base like something was wrong

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
With those bases but I had a fun time

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
At laser tag FU to Loki for not opening up his own

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Laser tag arena for being too like

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh yeah

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Oh wait what's that

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Oh it's twenty or it's

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
You know two million dollars in my ass

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You know wow

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Look at that

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Get a loan or something I don't know

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Rescue us from horrible Qsars around the world

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Anyway what else do I have an FU too

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I don't know

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I guess that's it

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Just an FU to Nellie

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Warrior Bob any FUs you have to get off your chest

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I'm actually a fairly happy guy

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I don't have a whole lot of FUs

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So if anything it's to Sony for the drives

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Not reading blue discs

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Because that makes me angry

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And to Jobs for not being open for me

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Because I'm unemployed

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Unemployment sucks

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I'm working on it

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now it kind of sucks

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Honestly blue discs make me more angry

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You should say

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
An FU to the Rob D for sounding like you

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I don't know it's kind of weird

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
The Rob D sounds like me

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Yes I don't know if you've ever listened to this day in gaming podcasts

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But you guys have a very similar voice it's kind of interesting

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I'm going to have to go listen to that now

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
It's interesting it's not a bad thing

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
He's got a great radio voice

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Well thank you very much

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I sleep all night so I'm totally unconscious

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I have no idea what I'm running around doing

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Maybe we're the same guy

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Well he's in chat right now though

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I don't know if that's possible

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Unless you're like that chick on Heroes

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Who can use the internet with her brain

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
That would be so distracting

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
No I'm not like the chick on Heroes

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And yeah that stupid bitch on Heroes

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Fucking A

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I sign up for the damn viral websites

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And she spams me all this shit

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
All the time

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Had I known her secret power was spamming people

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
There's an F you

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
F you to freaking spam bots getting into my forums

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
F you to PHPBB

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
For making it really hard for me to fix that

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And F you to get into spam bots

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And the other thing I hate fucking spam

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That has to do with the stock market

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I don't play the stock market

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Why the fuck would I care what companies

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Want me to buy

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Amanda sent me the best title though from a spam email

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You exemplify carrot

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Whatever happened to Spamusement

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
That was like my favorite online

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Have there been updates?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
That was my favorite online comic

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Anywhere with Spamusement

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And they just kind of stopped doing updates

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I mean I realized

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Maybe the guy like you know real life

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Comes first and maybe had something else he wanted to do

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
That doesn't make me any less sad

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
He could just pass it off to somebody

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
No the last one was October 20th

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
That makes me sad

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Spamusement go look in the archives

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The older cartoons at Spamusement.com

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's great

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Anyways

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Oh god some of these are kind of gross

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
From Mr. Bishi

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's a new Docomo

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Sounds like Kokomo

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Anyways D9-04i

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And apparently

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's going to have a motion sensor built into it

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Or I believe

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
There was something about it using its camera

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
To detect motion

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Anyways

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
It's a fucking Wii phone type thing

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And you're going to be able to use it to play games

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Of course

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Katamari Portable

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
And You Are Gundam

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So I guess that's neat

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
But I hope they don't release them in the US

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Because

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
People have enough trouble driving

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Let alone playing TILTI games

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
On their cell phone

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Driving while side talking

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
How about just shut up and drive

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's what I vote for

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And further proof that Namco intends to just

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Poop all over the Katamari franchise

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
While the creator has gone off to greener pastures

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
But then you can roll it up into an even bigger ball

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And set it on fire

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
With your cell phone for god's sake

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Roll it up and light it

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
There we go

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
New Katamari game, Katamari Weed

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Katamari Weed

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Wow, well anyway

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
That's going to bring Segment A

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And we'll be back after a quick break

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Because as you know we tape in two

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well maybe you don't know because we were gone last week

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So maybe you need a little bit of a refresher

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
But Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Live on Sunday night

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And then the second half will follow sometime mid week

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So we're going to take a break here

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Thanks for watching and have a great week
