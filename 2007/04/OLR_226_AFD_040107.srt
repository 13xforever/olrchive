00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,320
Welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show, with your hosts, Chris and Megsy.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Man, she gotta be a lesbian.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,800
She is not a lesbian.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,920
All I know is that I can play.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,160
Gather up your pillows, make up, ice cream sundaes, and Xboxes, it's time for the show

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
to begin.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Hi, and welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Game Show.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,760
How is everybody out there in radio land tonight?

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm your host, the ever always lesbian Chris.

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,360
And with me forever, of course, is my beautiful, wonderful, lovey-dovey, little, wonderful

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,600
girlfriend, Megsy, with the size C cup.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
Say hi, baby.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Hi, everyone.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,940
And of course, always with me is my cream-filled Jamie, how is my sweetheart?

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm an angst cookie, as usual.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Anx cookie?

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Not any good clit-loving, honey?

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
No, just a stupid man.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Boys are bad.

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Sad face.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Sad face.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,880
And of course, always we have to introduce our special guest, Roberta Roberts.

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Sweetheart, give me a kiss.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Hi, baby.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
How are you doing?

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,880
My gosh, did your breasts get bigger?

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
You are so hot, honey.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I love you.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
They have gotten a little bit bigger.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,880
I've been using this cream on them, but I digress.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Are you okay?

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
Gosh, Roberta.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Dead or alive.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Dead or alive.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Dead or alive.

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
I know.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Boobies.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Boobies.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,880
But first, we have to talk about our gaming week, sweetheart.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,880
So first of all, I'll go first.

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,880
My gaming week was, of course, I had to be playing WoW, and I only play my Blood Elf because

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
she does the sexy dance when I do this thing with her.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
You do the dance thing.

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I played a guy Blood Elf.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Those guys are so gay.

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
I mean, really.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
If you're playing a guy Blood Elf, of course you're doing it for the make out.

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Not that there's anything wrong with being gay.

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Of course not.

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Of course not.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,880
It's only wrong when you're a man.

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Of course.

54
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Because penises are gross.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh, no.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Roberta, be nice.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
You've got some gay listeners.

58
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Gosh.

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm sorry about that.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
The penis is okay if you're a boy.

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
So honey, sweetheart, baby.

64
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Honey, how was your gaming week?

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
My gaming week was fantastic.

66
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I played Dead or Alive 4, and it was amazing.

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,880
It has really good graphics.

68
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Please.

69
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Please.

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Jamie, Creamy, how was your baby?

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I was playing some Marvel Ultimate Alliance because it's all about Ms. Marvel.

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Ms. Marvel.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Wonder Woman.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Wonder Woman.

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
That's DC, you bitch.

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
And Spider Woman because of her...

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
It's okay, Roberta.

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
It's okay, baby.

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Jamie makes me cry.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
She is okay.

82
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Touch my booby.

83
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,880
You need to wait until after the radio show.

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Jamie, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
That's it.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm...

87
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Come on, now.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Come on.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Jamie, I love you.

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Let's go bake a pie and make it better.

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Doesn't that sound like fun?

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,880
You're a whore.

93
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Just because I slept with your ex-girlfriend doesn't make me a whore.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
I can't make you a slut.

95
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
My God.

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Roberta, you sound like Kersey Alley.

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
And all this talk with pies and stuff.

99
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
What the hell am I doing here anyways, by the way?

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Look, I had to bring my ex-girlfriend Matilda on tonight and I realized she sounds like

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,880
a scary bull dyke man, but she eats really good pussy.

102
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
I don't know that, Jamie.

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Not as good as me.

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Not as good as my girlfriend.

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,880
And we must say that butch dykes are always welcome on this show.

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,880
By the way, how was your gaming week, Roberta?

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Well, my gaming week was a lot of fun.

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:58,880
I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live because I wanted to play a game with

109
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
a character whose month it is.

110
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
It's April.

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
It's April.

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Get it?

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Get it?

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
It was fun.

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
It was a lot of fun.

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,880
I played on Xbox Live, but some stupid boy called me a fag.

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't like Xbox Live.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
They're mean on Xbox Live, aren't they?

119
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
They just don't understand girls.

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm going to go join PMS Clan.

121
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm so upset.

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
They do do a lot of good work, that PMS Clan.

123
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,880
And April looked hot in that jumpsuit.

124
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Ex-girlfriend, how was your gaming week?

125
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Yes, when I'm totally not riding motorcycles or wearing flannel, I was playing lots of

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is fucking awesome.

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Yeah, that's pretty much all I was playing this week because I was too busy lezzing out.

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
That was great.

129
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Does anyone else have anything to contribute to their gaming week?

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
No.

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Okay.

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:15,880
So we have to get to our first story, and the first story is Uno has sold one million

133
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
copies on Xbox Live Arcade.

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Yay!

135
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
A million is a lot.

136
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,880
A million is really a lot, isn't it?

137
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
It's a bit a lot.

138
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
It's just below a trillion.

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I didn't even know that there were a million people on Xbox Live because when I tried to

140
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,880
play Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live, I had to wait five minutes for that stupid boy to join.

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Boys are so gross.

142
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Boys are gross.

143
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Boys are gross.

144
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Stupid boys.

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
But yes, Uno has sold one million copies.

146
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Now, I personally am not an Uno player, but I know some people are out there, and I just

147
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
don't work well with cards really.

148
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Does anybody have an opinion about this?

149
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,880
I think that this is a travesty because Ms. Pac-Man, bless her heart, the ultimate diva

150
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,880
in gaming, is also available on Xbox Live, and why hasn't she sold a million copies?

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I think all of us lesbians need to band together and make sure that we support Ms. Thing, Ms.

152
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Pac-Man herself, and purchase it because she deserves to sell one billion copies.

153
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Isn't that right, Matilda?

154
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
That is completely wrong.

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I mean, after all, Ms. Pac-Man is horrible for, you know, cam-whoring yourself out.

156
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
What is wrong with you?

157
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Why do you have to take out our relationship on this show?

158
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
We had something beautiful, Matilda.

159
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Now, girls.

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
You're breaking my heart.

161
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Girls, girls, let's stay on topic.

162
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Stay on topic.

163
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,880
We all know what happens when you move in together.

164
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
It's gone in five seconds.

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Well, it's not my fault.

166
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:14,880
The bitch brought a U-Haul on her second date like a typical lesbian.

167
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,880
You girls, if you're going to get this bad about it, you need to take it outside because

168
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
we're supposed to be talking about games.

169
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Games for the rublies.

170
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Yes, you should be sorry.

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
All right.

173
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Now it's time for our favorite party.

174
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Slumber party discussion.

175
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Who do you think is the hottest chick in gaming?

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm going to ask my girlfriend.

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
It's got to be Helena from Dead or Alive.

178
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
That's a tough choice.

179
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Jamie, Cookie.

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm going to go old school and say Samus Aran running around in the bikini.

181
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Justin Bailey, Justin Bailey.

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Really?

183
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Okay.

184
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Your ex-girlfriend?

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,880
You do realize that Samus' name is not Justin Bailey, by the way.

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880
No, but see, this is why I know more about gaming than you because if you put in the

187
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,880
code, Justin Bailey in Metroid, then you get to see her in her hot little bra and panties,

188
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,880
the original 8-bit pinup doll.

189
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Ooh.

190
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I see.

191
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Well, me personally.

192
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm a little bit new, so I'll have to go with Aerith.

193
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
I just like that whole innocent-

194
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
You would.

195
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I would.

196
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
She's so innocent.

197
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Tifa could kick ass, though.

198
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Tifa and Aerith were having sex, Jamie.

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
You know this from that.

200
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,880
No, no, no, no, because Tifa was having the relationship with Scarlet, hence the bitch

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,880
fight when they broke up.

202
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,880
This is going to be a long drawn-out conversation, and I don't want to have with you on the radio,

203
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
okay?

204
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Fine, we'll take this outside.

205
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Fine, we will take this outside, but first we have to go to another-

206
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Okay.

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait, wait.

208
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
My girl, I didn't say mine.

209
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,880
My favorite is Ivy from Soul Calibur.

210
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
She can wit me any time.

211
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
That girl is a slut.

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Hey, so's Mack's girlfriend.

213
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
We don't talk about that.

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Okay.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Next, there's an announcement that it is now 19 weeks since the release of Dead or Alive

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Extreme 2, and there's still been no announcement of a sequel.

217
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Boo.

218
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Boo.

219
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Calm's still run by boys.

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Stupid boys.

221
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Stupid boys.

222
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Let's kill them.

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Let's fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.

224
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Anyway, next story.

225
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
You know what, though, though?

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,880
From our chat room, SSJ100Matt, we forgive you for certain things, but I have to say

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
did make a good point, but that's Mai from King of Fighters, the goddess of boobs.

228
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Ooh.

229
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Ooh, please.

230
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Yeah.

231
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
That is a good point.

232
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
All right.

233
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Touché.

234
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
All right.

235
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Our next story, it's our final story.

236
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,880
I'm going to hand this over to my girlfriend because she's such a Kingdom Hearts fan.

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Honey, baby, it's your turn.

238
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Okay.

239
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
The extended ending and trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been released with the final

240
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
mix video game.

241
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I saw this, and there were no hot chicks in it.

242
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
It was sad.

243
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I think that was supposed to be, though, wasn't that... It was the third person in the armor.

244
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Wasn't it supposed to be, like-

245
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
That's me, baby.

246
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Wasn't it supposed to be Kairi?

247
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I hope not.

248
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Kairi was a flex.

249
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Maybe.

250
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I hope it's Tyra Banks.

251
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
No, no, no, no.

252
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
I've got biz on me.

253
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Not hot.

254
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
I think that's it.

255
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:16,880
And that's pretty much it for the Kingdom Hearts thing.

256
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Anyway, does anybody have anything else to contribute to that?

257
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
No?

258
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Well, I'm looking at our chat room, and the sexy stalker says something about a blue-haired

259
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
girl in it, but I don't know.

260
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
I couldn't really see the boobies.

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Yeah, she wasn't very hot because I'm a breast kind of girl, and she didn't really have a

262
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,880
lot of boobage, so I'm really hoping that maybe if there's another trailer later on,

263
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
we might see a little bit more of that.

264
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Maybe, maybe.

265
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,880
As a lesbian, I have to say I'm a little bit upset that Minnie hasn't gotten a lot more

266
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
press within the Kingdom Hearts, and I'm just upset.

267
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
She's oppressed by the man.

268
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Exactly.

269
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Mickey was holding that phallic keyblade, and I just think it's sad.

270
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Anyway, that's my opinion on it.

271
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Does anyone else have any things to contribute to that, ex-girlfriend?

272
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Anything?

273
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
I have nothing.

274
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
All right, then.

275
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Well, that was our last story, which means the show's over.

276
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Oh, wait, wait.

277
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
We have an announcement.

278
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Well, we hope you've enjoyed tonight's program.

279
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,880
If you haven't already figured out, we haven't really replaced Orange Lounge Radio or anything.

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
We're just having a little fun like lesbians do.

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I mean, look at today's date.

282
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Hello.

283
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
It's April 1st, 2007.

284
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I know what that means.

285
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Everybody say it with me.

286
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
April Fools!

287
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I do not sound like this in normal life.

288
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Me neither.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Yeah, in case any real lesbians are listening tonight, we hope you didn't get offended.

290
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,880
But the whole idea was inspired from a review I saw in our podcast once that said we were

291
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
nothing but a bunch of giggling lesbians lately.

292
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
So I thought, hey, let's give the people what they want.

293
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,880
And so Chris and Megsy were so kind to come here and be very stereotypical forms of their

294
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
usual selves and play along in tonight's April Fools!

295
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
joke.

296
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
So we hope you guys enjoyed it.

297
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Except for Matt.

298
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
You sound like Chris Yalley.

299
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I know.

300
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
What's up with that?

301
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Well, I have no voice.

302
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
So.

303
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
All right.

304
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Well, anyway, we're actually going to put this up as a special edition of our podcast,

305
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
just a quick little show.

306
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
So that way, if people don't really want to listen to the April Fools!

307
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
joke, they can skip right past it because it is a little silly, although we did do the

308
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
stories we talked about were legitimate.

309
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
There really was a Kingdom Hearts 3 thing at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 and the whole

310
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Uno thing.

311
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Kingdom Hearts 3rd Strike or whatever they're going to call it.

312
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Anyway, we're going to take a real quick musical break for those folks listening live, for

313
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
those on the podcast.

314
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,880
If you just downloaded this on April 1st in just a few hours, the real show will hit the

315
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
podcast feed.

316
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
And for those of you guys listening live, we're going to take a quick break and come

317
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
back with tonight's real show.

318
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
So thank you guys for putting up with us.

319
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Hope we didn't drag it out too long.

320
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Chris, you did a great job.

321
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Especially like five minutes notice.

322
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm so freaking scared.

323
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
All right.

324
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
But the good news is Chris and Megsy are going to join us for our regular show.

325
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,880
And give us a real down to earth, not the Playboy lesbian, you know, that's all fake

326
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
airbrush.

327
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
So we're going to see.

328
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm going to hit you with a pillow.

329
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
All right.

330
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
So we'll be back after this.

331
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
What, with your dirty pillows?

332
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,880
We'll be back after a quick music break with the real Orange Lounge Radio.

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

334
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
a week.

335
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
