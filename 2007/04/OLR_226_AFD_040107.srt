00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:18,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show with your hosts, Chris and Maisie.

2
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:21,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, she gotta be a lesbian.

3
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,683
[SPEAKER_06]: She is not a lesbian.

4
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,725
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is that I can play.

5
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Gather up your pillows.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Makeup, Ice Cream Sundaes, and Xboxes, it's time for the show to begin.

7
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:42,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, and welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Game Show.

8
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:47,188
[SPEAKER_09]: How is everybody out there in Radioland tonight?

9
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm your host, the ever-always Lesbian Kris.

10
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

11
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:52,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

12
00:00:53,627 --> 00:01:03,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And with me forever, of course, is my beautiful, wonderful, lovey-dovey, little, wonderful girlfriend, Meg Z, with the size C cup.

13
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:05,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hi, baby.

14
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.

15
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, always with me is my cream-filled Jamie.

16
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,483
[SPEAKER_09]: How is my sweetheart?

17
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:17,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an angst cookie, as usual.

18
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Angst cookie?

19
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Not any good clit-loving, honey?

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,551
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just a stupid man.

21
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, boys are bad.

22
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:25,213
Sad face.

23
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad face.

24
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:33,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, always we have to introduce our special guest, Roberta Roberts.

25
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:34,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweetheart, give me a kiss.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, baby.

27
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,681
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

28
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,303
[SPEAKER_04]: My gosh, did your breasts get bigger?

29
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so hot, honey.

30
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:44,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.

31
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:47,846
[SPEAKER_09]: They have gotten a little bit bigger.

32
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been using this cream on them.

33
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:50,188
[SPEAKER_09]: But I digress.

34
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about video games.

35
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Get her alive!

36
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:54,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Get her alive!

37
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:55,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Get her alive!

38
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I know!

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies!

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Boobies!

41
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, first, we have to talk about our gaming week, sweetheart.

42
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So, first of all, I'll go first.

43
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:17,349
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week was, of course, I had to be playing WoW, and I only play my Blood Elf because she does the sexy dance when I do this thing with her.

44
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,470
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you do the dance thing, so...

45
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:21,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a guy blood elf.

46
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys are so gay.

47
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:24,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really.

48
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,568
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're playing a guy blood elf, of course you're doing it for the make out.

49
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:32,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with being gay.

50
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course not.

51
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:34,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course not.

52
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only wrong when you're a man.

53
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:38,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

54
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Because penises are gross.

55
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:42,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

56
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, be nice.

57
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,460
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some gay listeners.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

59
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

60
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about that.

61
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,655
[SPEAKER_09]: The penis is okay if you're a boy.

62
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So, honey, sweetheart, baby, honey, how was your gaming week?

63
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,698
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was fantastic.

64
00:02:58,858 --> 00:02:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Dead or Alive 4.

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was amazing.

66
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:07,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It has really good graphics.

67
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, Creamy, how was your baby?

68
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:18,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing some Marvel Ultimate Alliance because it's all about Ms.

69
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:18,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Marvel.

70
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:46,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Marvel, Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman, that's DC, bitch, oh, I'm sorry, and Spider Woman, because of her, it's okay, reverse, that's my baby, Jamie makes me cry, she's okay, touch my boobie, you need to wait until after the radio show, Jamie, I'm sorry, keep going, that's it, I'm,

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I love you.

72
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go bake a pie and make it better.

73
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that sound like fun?

74
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:01,675
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a whore.

75
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:07,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I slept with your ex-girlfriend doesn't make me a whore.

76
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,060
Okay, then she was slut.

77
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,384
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, Roberta, you sound like Kirstie Alley.

78
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:14,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

79
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this talk with pies and stuff.

80
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,029
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell am I doing here anyways, by the way?

81
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:31,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I had to bring my ex-girlfriend Matilda on tonight, and I realized she sounds like a scary bulldike man, but she eats really good pussy.

82
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, Jamie.

83
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,021
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time.

84
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Not as good as my girlfriend.

85
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:40,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And we must say that Butch Dykes are always welcome on this show.

86
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we need to... Oh, by the way, how was your gaming week, Roberta?

87
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my gaming week was a lot of fun.

88
00:04:49,439 --> 00:05:01,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live because I wanted to play a game with a character whose month it is.

89
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's April!

90
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's April!

91
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

92
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:07,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

93
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:07,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

94
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

95
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I played on Xbox Live, but some stupid boy called me a fag.

96
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like Xbox Live.

97
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,796
[SPEAKER_04]: They're mean on Xbox Live, aren't they?

98
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:21,176
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't understand girls.

99
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go join PMS Clan.

100
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so upset.

101
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: They do do a lot of good work, that PMS Clan.

102
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:30,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And April looked hot in that jumpsuit.

103
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:33,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Girlfriend, how was your gaming week?

104
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:45,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, when I'm totally not riding motorcycles or wearing flannel, I was playing lots of Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is fucking awesome.

105
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:55,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's pretty much all I was playing this week because I was too busy lezzing out.

106
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: That was great.

107
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone else have anything to contribute to their gaming week?

108
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:04,659
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

109
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:18,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, at least, so we have to get to our first story, and the first story is Uno has reached, I'm sorry, has sold 1 million copies on Xbox Live Arcade!

110
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

111
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:21,987
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to take over?

112
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,408
[SPEAKER_04]: A million is a lot.

113
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,509
[SPEAKER_04]: A million is really a lot, isn't it?

114
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,470
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bit a lot.

115
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just below a trillion.

116
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:34,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know that there were a million people on Xbox Live.

117
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:43,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I tried to play Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live, I had to wait five minutes for that stupid boy to join.

118
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys are so gross.

119
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:45,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Boys are gross.

120
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:47,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Boys are gross.

121
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:48,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid boys.

122
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:52,599
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, Uno has sold one million copies.

123
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:58,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I personally am not an Uno player, but I know some people are out there.

124
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,929
[SPEAKER_09]: and I just don't work well with cards, really.

125
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:03,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have an opinion about this?

126
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a travesty because Ms.

127
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:15,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man, bless her heart, the ultimate diva in gaming, is also available on Xbox Live.

128
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:19,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And why hasn't she sold a million copies?

129
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all of us lesbians need to band together and make sure that we support

130
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:32,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss Pac-Man herself and purchase it because she deserves to sell one billion copies.

131
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:34,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that right, Matilda?

132
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,099
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely wrong.

133
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:41,802
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, after all, Miss Pac-Man is horrible for, you know, cam-whoring yourself out.

134
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,603
[SPEAKER_01]: What is wrong with you?

135
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:48,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you have to take out our relationship on this show?

136
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,786
[SPEAKER_01]: We had something beautiful, Matilda.

137
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,027
[SPEAKER_09]: You're breaking my heart.

138
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Girls, girls, let's stay on topic.

139
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:01,590
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know what happens when you move in together.

140
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone in five seconds.

141
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:06,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not my fault.

142
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:10,376
[SPEAKER_04]: The bitch brought a U-Haul on her second date like a typical lesbian.

143
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,302
[SPEAKER_09]: You girls, if you're going to get this bad about it, you need to take it outside because we're supposed to be talking about games.

144
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:23,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

145
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:24,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you should be sorry.

146
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:33,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now it's time for our favorite part, Slumber Party Discussion!

147
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:38,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do you think is the hottest chick in gaming?

148
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask my girlfriend.

149
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:44,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be Helena from Dead or Alive.

150
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a tough choice.

151
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:50,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, Cookie?

152
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go old school and say Sama Saran running around in a bikini.

153
00:08:55,907 --> 00:09:00,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin Bailey, Justin Bailey Really?

154
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:24,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay Good ex-girlfriend You do realize that Samus' name is not Justin Bailey, by the way No, but see, this is why I know more about gaming than you Because if you put in the code Justin Bailey in Metroid Then you get to see her in her hot little bra and panties The original 8-bit pin-up doll

155
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:29,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

156
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, me personally.

157
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:37,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little bit new, so I'll have to go with Aerith.

158
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I just like that whole innocent than thou.

159
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:41,448
[SPEAKER_09]: You would.

160
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:42,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I would.

161
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,550
[SPEAKER_09]: She's so innocent.

162
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Tifa could kick ass, though.

163
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Tifa and Aerith were having sex, Jamie.

164
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:56,808
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, because Tifa was having the relationship with Scarlet, hence the bitch fight when they broke up.

165
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,771
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a long, drawn-out conversation.

166
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to help with you on the radio, okay?

167
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, we'll take this outside.

168
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, we will take this outside, but first we have to go to another... Okay.

169
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, my girl.

170
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:09,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say mine.

171
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,341
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite is Ivy from Soul Calibur.

172
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,463
[SPEAKER_04]: She can whip me any time.

173
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,924
[SPEAKER_09]: That girl is a slut.

174
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

175
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So is Mac's girlfriend.

176
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:21,487
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't talk about that.

177
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:28,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, next.

178
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Next, there's an announcement that it is now 19 weeks since the release of Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

179
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:41,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still been no announcement of a sequel.

180
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo!

181
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:46,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Coms still run by boys.

182
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:48,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid boys.

183
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:50,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's kill them.

184
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.

185
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:57,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, next story.

186
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:58,494
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

187
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:07,596
[SPEAKER_08]: From our chat room, SSJ100Matt, even, you know, we forgive you for certain things, but I have to say, did make a good point, but that's my from King of Fighters.

188
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,438
[SPEAKER_09]: The goddess of boobs.

189
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:14,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

190
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:16,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a good point.

191
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,018
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

192
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Touche.

193
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:20,599
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

194
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next story, it's our final story.

195
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:28,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to hand this over to my girlfriend because she's such a Kingdom Hearts fan.

196
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Honey, baby, it's your turn.

197
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:39,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the extended ending and trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been released with the final mix video game.

198
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:43,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw this and there were no hot chicks in it.

199
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It was sad.

200
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was supposed to be the third person in the armor.

201
00:11:55,513 --> 00:12:02,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's Tyra Banks.

202
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,078
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

203
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:06,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Not hot.

204
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's pretty much it for the Kingdom Hearts thing.

205
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, does anybody have anything else to contribute to that?

206
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:22,386
Nope.

207
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm looking at our chat room and the sexy stalker says something about a blue haired girl in it.

208
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,364
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

209
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't really see the boobies.

210
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:39,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she wasn't very hot because I'm a breast kind of girl and she didn't really have a lot of boobage.

211
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:44,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really hoping that maybe if there's another trailer later on, we might see a little bit more of that.

212
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, maybe, maybe so.

213
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:55,469
[SPEAKER_09]: As a lesbian, I have to say, I'm a little bit upset that Minnie hasn't gotten a lot more press within the Kingdom Hearts.

214
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:56,809
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just upset.

215
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,049
[SPEAKER_08]: She's oppressed by the man.

216
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly!

217
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Mickey was holding that phallic Keyblade, and I just think it's sad.

218
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that's my opinion on it.

219
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone else have any things to contribute to that?

220
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:09,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Ex-girlfriend?

221
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:09,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything?

222
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:12,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing.

223
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:18,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright then, well, that was our last story, which means the show is over.

224
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, wait, we have an announcement!

225
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:25,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we hope you've enjoyed tonight's program.

226
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:32,924
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't already figured out, we haven't really replaced Orange Lingerie or anything, we're just having a little fun like lesbians do.

227
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at today's date.

228
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, it's April 1st, 2007.

229
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:40,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what that means.

230
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody say it with me.

231
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,875
[SPEAKER_05]: April Fools!

232
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not sound like this in normal life.

233
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:52,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in case any real lesbians are listening tonight, we hope you didn't get offended.

234
00:13:52,517 --> 00:14:00,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole idea was inspired from a review I saw on our podcast once that said we were nothing but a bunch of giggling lesbians lately.

235
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, hey.

236
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give the people what they want!

237
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:56,325
[SPEAKER_03]: so that way if people don't really want to listen to the April Fool's joke they can skip right past it because it is a little silly although we did do the stories we talked about were legitimate there really was a Kingdom Hearts 3 thing at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 and the whole Uno thing Kingdom Hearts 3rd Strike or whatever they're going to call it so anyway we're going to take a real quick musical break for those folks listening live for those on the podcast if you just downloaded this on April 1st in just a few hours the real show will hit the podcast feed and for those of you guys listening live we're going to take a quick break

238
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: and come back with tonight's real show.

239
00:14:58,611 --> 00:14:59,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys for putting up with us.

240
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope we didn't drag it out too long.

241
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, you did a great job, especially with like five minutes notice.

242
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:04,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I was freaking scared.

243
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:14,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, but the good news is Chris and Maisie are going to join us for our regular show and give us a real down-to-earth, not the playboy lesbian, you know, that's all fake airbrush.

244
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:15,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to see.

245
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:19,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit you with a pillow.

246
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,779
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we'll be back after this quick.

247
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,840
[SPEAKER_03]: With your dirty pillows.

248
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after a quick music break with the real Orange Lounge Radio.
