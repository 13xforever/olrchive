00:00.000 --> 00:19.320
Welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show, with your hosts, Chris and Megsy.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.320
Man, she gotta be a lesbian.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.800
She is not a lesbian.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.920
All I know is that I can play.

00:25.920 --> 00:34.160
Gather up your pillows, make up, ice cream sundaes, and Xboxes, it's time for the show

00:34.160 --> 00:35.160
to begin.

00:35.160 --> 00:42.160
Hi, and welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Game Show.

00:42.160 --> 00:47.760
How is everybody out there in radio land tonight?

00:47.760 --> 00:53.680
I'm your host, the ever always lesbian Chris.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.360
And with me forever, of course, is my beautiful, wonderful, lovey-dovey, little, wonderful

00:59.360 --> 01:03.600
girlfriend, Megsy, with the size C cup.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.640
Say hi, baby.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.640
Hi, everyone.

01:06.640 --> 01:15.940
And of course, always with me is my cream-filled Jamie, how is my sweetheart?

01:15.940 --> 01:17.880
I'm an angst cookie, as usual.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
Anx cookie?

01:18.880 --> 01:20.880
Not any good clit-loving, honey?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.880
No, just a stupid man.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
I'm sorry.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
Boys are bad.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Sad face.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
Sad face.

01:26.880 --> 01:33.880
And of course, always we have to introduce our special guest, Roberta Roberts.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
Sweetheart, give me a kiss.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.880
Hi, baby.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.880
How are you doing?

01:38.880 --> 01:41.880
My gosh, did your breasts get bigger?

01:41.880 --> 01:43.880
You are so hot, honey.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.880
I love you.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.880
They have gotten a little bit bigger.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.880
I've been using this cream on them, but I digress.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.880
Are you okay?

01:52.880 --> 01:53.880
Gosh, Roberta.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
Dead or alive.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
Dead or alive.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Dead or alive.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
I know.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
Boobies.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
Boobies.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.880
But first, we have to talk about our gaming week, sweetheart.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.880
So first of all, I'll go first.

02:08.880 --> 02:14.880
My gaming week was, of course, I had to be playing WoW, and I only play my Blood Elf because

02:14.880 --> 02:17.880
she does the sexy dance when I do this thing with her.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.880
You do the dance thing.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.880
I played a guy Blood Elf.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.880
Those guys are so gay.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
I mean, really.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.880
If you're playing a guy Blood Elf, of course you're doing it for the make out.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.880
Not that there's anything wrong with being gay.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.880
Of course not.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
Of course not.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.880
It's only wrong when you're a man.

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
Of course.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.880
Because penises are gross.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
Oh, no.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.880
Roberta, be nice.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.880
You've got some gay listeners.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
I'm sorry.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.880
I'm sorry.

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
Gosh.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.880
I'm sorry about that.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.880
The penis is okay if you're a boy.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.880
So honey, sweetheart, baby.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.880
Honey, how was your gaming week?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.880
My gaming week was fantastic.

02:58.880 --> 03:04.880
I played Dead or Alive 4, and it was amazing.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.880
It has really good graphics.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
Please.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
Please.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.880
Jamie, Creamy, how was your baby?

03:14.880 --> 03:18.880
I was playing some Marvel Ultimate Alliance because it's all about Ms. Marvel.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.880
Ms. Marvel.

03:19.880 --> 03:20.880
Wonder Woman.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.880
Wonder Woman.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.880
That's DC, you bitch.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.880
And Spider Woman because of her...

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
It's okay, Roberta.

03:29.880 --> 03:30.880
It's okay, baby.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.880
Jamie makes me cry.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
She is okay.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.880
Touch my booby.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.880
You need to wait until after the radio show.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.880
Jamie, I'm sorry.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.880
That's it.

03:45.880 --> 03:46.880
I'm...

03:46.880 --> 03:47.880
Come on, now.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.880
Come on.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.880
Jamie, I love you.

03:51.880 --> 03:57.880
Let's go bake a pie and make it better.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.880
Doesn't that sound like fun?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.880
You're a whore.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.880
Just because I slept with your ex-girlfriend doesn't make me a whore.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.880
I can't make you a slut.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.880
My God.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
Roberta, you sound like Kersey Alley.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.880
I'm sorry.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.880
And all this talk with pies and stuff.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.880
What the hell am I doing here anyways, by the way?

04:18.880 --> 04:25.880
Look, I had to bring my ex-girlfriend Matilda on tonight and I realized she sounds like

04:25.880 --> 04:31.880
a scary bull dyke man, but she eats really good pussy.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.880
I don't know that, Jamie.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
Not as good as me.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.880
Not as good as my girlfriend.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.880
And we must say that butch dykes are always welcome on this show.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.880
By the way, how was your gaming week, Roberta?

04:44.880 --> 04:48.880
Well, my gaming week was a lot of fun.

04:48.880 --> 04:58.880
I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live because I wanted to play a game with

04:58.880 --> 05:01.880
a character whose month it is.

05:01.880 --> 05:02.880
It's April.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
It's April.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
Get it?

05:04.880 --> 05:05.880
Get it?

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
It was fun.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.880
It was a lot of fun.

05:08.880 --> 05:14.880
I played on Xbox Live, but some stupid boy called me a fag.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.880
I don't like Xbox Live.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.880
They're mean on Xbox Live, aren't they?

05:18.880 --> 05:20.880
They just don't understand girls.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.880
I'm going to go join PMS Clan.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
I'm so upset.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.880
They do do a lot of good work, that PMS Clan.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.880
And April looked hot in that jumpsuit.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.880
Ex-girlfriend, how was your gaming week?

05:34.880 --> 05:41.880
Yes, when I'm totally not riding motorcycles or wearing flannel, I was playing lots of

05:41.880 --> 05:46.880
Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is fucking awesome.

05:46.880 --> 05:55.880
Yeah, that's pretty much all I was playing this week because I was too busy lezzing out.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.880
That was great.

05:57.880 --> 06:04.880
Does anyone else have anything to contribute to their gaming week?

06:04.880 --> 06:05.880
No.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Okay.

06:06.880 --> 06:15.880
So we have to get to our first story, and the first story is Uno has sold one million

06:15.880 --> 06:17.880
copies on Xbox Live Arcade.

06:17.880 --> 06:18.880
Yay!

06:18.880 --> 06:21.880
A million is a lot.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.880
A million is really a lot, isn't it?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.880
It's a bit a lot.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.880
It's just below a trillion.

06:29.880 --> 06:35.880
I didn't even know that there were a million people on Xbox Live because when I tried to

06:35.880 --> 06:42.880
play Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live, I had to wait five minutes for that stupid boy to join.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.880
Boys are so gross.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
Boys are gross.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.880
Boys are gross.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.880
Stupid boys.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.880
But yes, Uno has sold one million copies.

06:51.880 --> 06:59.880
Now, I personally am not an Uno player, but I know some people are out there, and I just

06:59.880 --> 07:01.880
don't work well with cards really.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
Does anybody have an opinion about this?

07:03.880 --> 07:10.880
I think that this is a travesty because Ms. Pac-Man, bless her heart, the ultimate diva

07:10.880 --> 07:19.880
in gaming, is also available on Xbox Live, and why hasn't she sold a million copies?

07:19.880 --> 07:26.880
I think all of us lesbians need to band together and make sure that we support Ms. Thing, Ms.

07:26.880 --> 07:32.880
Pac-Man herself, and purchase it because she deserves to sell one billion copies.

07:32.880 --> 07:33.880
Isn't that right, Matilda?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.880
That is completely wrong.

07:35.880 --> 07:41.880
I mean, after all, Ms. Pac-Man is horrible for, you know, cam-whoring yourself out.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.880
What is wrong with you?

07:43.880 --> 07:47.880
Why do you have to take out our relationship on this show?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.880
We had something beautiful, Matilda.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.880
Now, girls.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.880
You're breaking my heart.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.880
Girls, girls, let's stay on topic.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.880
Stay on topic.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.880
We all know what happens when you move in together.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.880
It's gone in five seconds.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.880
Well, it's not my fault.

08:05.880 --> 08:14.880
The bitch brought a U-Haul on her second date like a typical lesbian.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.880
You girls, if you're going to get this bad about it, you need to take it outside because

08:18.880 --> 08:20.880
we're supposed to be talking about games.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.880
Games for the rublies.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
I'm sorry.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.880
Yes, you should be sorry.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
All right.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.880
Now it's time for our favorite party.

08:28.880 --> 08:34.880
Slumber party discussion.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.880
Who do you think is the hottest chick in gaming?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.880
I'm going to ask my girlfriend.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.880
It's got to be Helena from Dead or Alive.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
That's a tough choice.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.880
Jamie, Cookie.

08:49.880 --> 08:55.880
I'm going to go old school and say Samus Aran running around in the bikini.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.880
Justin Bailey, Justin Bailey.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.880
Really?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.880
Okay.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
Your ex-girlfriend?

09:05.880 --> 09:11.880
You do realize that Samus' name is not Justin Bailey, by the way.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.880
No, but see, this is why I know more about gaming than you because if you put in the

09:15.880 --> 09:21.880
code, Justin Bailey in Metroid, then you get to see her in her hot little bra and panties,

09:21.880 --> 09:25.880
the original 8-bit pinup doll.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.880
Ooh.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.880
I see.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.880
Well, me personally.

09:31.880 --> 09:37.880
I'm a little bit new, so I'll have to go with Aerith.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.880
I just like that whole innocent-

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
You would.

09:41.880 --> 09:42.880
I would.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.880
She's so innocent.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.880
Tifa could kick ass, though.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.880
Tifa and Aerith were having sex, Jamie.

09:50.880 --> 09:51.880
You know this from that.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.880
No, no, no, no, because Tifa was having the relationship with Scarlet, hence the bitch

09:55.880 --> 09:58.880
fight when they broke up.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.880
This is going to be a long drawn-out conversation, and I don't want to have with you on the radio,

10:01.880 --> 10:02.880
okay?

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
Fine, we'll take this outside.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.880
Fine, we will take this outside, but first we have to go to another-

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
Okay.

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
Wait, wait.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.880
My girl, I didn't say mine.

10:09.880 --> 10:14.880
My favorite is Ivy from Soul Calibur.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.880
She can wit me any time.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.880
That girl is a slut.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.880
Hey, so's Mack's girlfriend.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.880
We don't talk about that.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
Okay.

10:25.880 --> 10:35.880
Next, there's an announcement that it is now 19 weeks since the release of Dead or Alive

10:35.880 --> 10:41.880
Extreme 2, and there's still been no announcement of a sequel.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
Boo.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
Boo.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.880
Calm's still run by boys.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
Stupid boys.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
Stupid boys.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.880
Let's kill them.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.880
Let's fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.880
Anyway, next story.

10:57.880 --> 10:58.880
You know what, though, though?

10:58.880 --> 11:04.880
From our chat room, SSJ100Matt, we forgive you for certain things, but I have to say

11:04.880 --> 11:10.880
did make a good point, but that's Mai from King of Fighters, the goddess of boobs.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.880
Ooh.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.880
Ooh, please.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.880
Yeah.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.880
That is a good point.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.880
All right.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.880
Touché.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.880
All right.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.880
Our next story, it's our final story.

11:22.880 --> 11:28.880
I'm going to hand this over to my girlfriend because she's such a Kingdom Hearts fan.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.880
Honey, baby, it's your turn.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.880
Okay.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.880
The extended ending and trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been released with the final

11:37.880 --> 11:40.880
mix video game.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.880
I saw this, and there were no hot chicks in it.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.880
It was sad.

11:45.880 --> 11:51.880
I think that was supposed to be, though, wasn't that... It was the third person in the armor.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.880
Wasn't it supposed to be, like-

11:53.880 --> 11:54.880
That's me, baby.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.880
Wasn't it supposed to be Kairi?

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
I hope not.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.880
Kairi was a flex.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.880
Maybe.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.880
I hope it's Tyra Banks.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.880
No, no, no, no.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
I've got biz on me.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
Not hot.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.880
I think that's it.

12:07.880 --> 12:16.880
And that's pretty much it for the Kingdom Hearts thing.

12:16.880 --> 12:21.880
Anyway, does anybody have anything else to contribute to that?

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
No?

12:22.880 --> 12:28.880
Well, I'm looking at our chat room, and the sexy stalker says something about a blue-haired

12:28.880 --> 12:30.880
girl in it, but I don't know.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.880
I couldn't really see the boobies.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.880
Yeah, she wasn't very hot because I'm a breast kind of girl, and she didn't really have a

12:37.880 --> 12:42.880
lot of boobage, so I'm really hoping that maybe if there's another trailer later on,

12:42.880 --> 12:45.880
we might see a little bit more of that.

12:45.880 --> 12:46.880
Maybe, maybe.

12:46.880 --> 12:53.880
As a lesbian, I have to say I'm a little bit upset that Minnie hasn't gotten a lot more

12:53.880 --> 12:56.880
press within the Kingdom Hearts, and I'm just upset.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.880
She's oppressed by the man.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Exactly.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.880
Mickey was holding that phallic keyblade, and I just think it's sad.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.880
Anyway, that's my opinion on it.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.880
Does anyone else have any things to contribute to that, ex-girlfriend?

13:10.880 --> 13:11.880
Anything?

13:11.880 --> 13:12.880
I have nothing.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.880
All right, then.

13:13.880 --> 13:18.880
Well, that was our last story, which means the show's over.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
Oh, wait, wait.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.880
We have an announcement.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.880
Well, we hope you've enjoyed tonight's program.

13:24.880 --> 13:29.880
If you haven't already figured out, we haven't really replaced Orange Lounge Radio or anything.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.880
We're just having a little fun like lesbians do.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.880
I mean, look at today's date.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.880
Hello.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
It's April 1st, 2007.

13:38.880 --> 13:39.880
I know what that means.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.880
Everybody say it with me.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.880
April Fools!

13:43.880 --> 13:46.880
I do not sound like this in normal life.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.880
Me neither.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.880
Yeah, in case any real lesbians are listening tonight, we hope you didn't get offended.

13:51.880 --> 13:57.880
But the whole idea was inspired from a review I saw in our podcast once that said we were

13:57.880 --> 13:59.880
nothing but a bunch of giggling lesbians lately.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.880
So I thought, hey, let's give the people what they want.

14:03.880 --> 14:09.880
And so Chris and Megsy were so kind to come here and be very stereotypical forms of their

14:09.880 --> 14:11.880
usual selves and play along in tonight's April Fools!

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
joke.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.880
So we hope you guys enjoyed it.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
Except for Matt.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
You sound like Chris Yalley.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
I know.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
What's up with that?

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
Well, I have no voice.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
So.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
All right.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.880
Well, anyway, we're actually going to put this up as a special edition of our podcast,

14:25.880 --> 14:26.880
just a quick little show.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.880
So that way, if people don't really want to listen to the April Fools!

14:29.880 --> 14:32.880
joke, they can skip right past it because it is a little silly, although we did do the

14:32.880 --> 14:34.880
stories we talked about were legitimate.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.880
There really was a Kingdom Hearts 3 thing at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 and the whole

14:37.880 --> 14:38.880
Uno thing.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.880
Kingdom Hearts 3rd Strike or whatever they're going to call it.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.880
Anyway, we're going to take a real quick musical break for those folks listening live, for

14:45.880 --> 14:47.880
those on the podcast.

14:47.880 --> 14:52.880
If you just downloaded this on April 1st in just a few hours, the real show will hit the

14:52.880 --> 14:53.880
podcast feed.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.880
And for those of you guys listening live, we're going to take a quick break and come

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
back with tonight's real show.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.880
So thank you guys for putting up with us.

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
Hope we didn't drag it out too long.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
Chris, you did a great job.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.880
Especially like five minutes notice.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.880
I'm so freaking scared.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.880
All right.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.880
But the good news is Chris and Megsy are going to join us for our regular show.

15:07.880 --> 15:13.880
And give us a real down to earth, not the Playboy lesbian, you know, that's all fake

15:13.880 --> 15:14.880
airbrush.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.880
So we're going to see.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.880
I'm going to hit you with a pillow.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.880
All right.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.880
So we'll be back after this.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.880
What, with your dirty pillows?

15:23.880 --> 15:28.880
We'll be back after a quick music break with the real Orange Lounge Radio.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

15:32.880 --> 15:33.880
a week.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.880
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
