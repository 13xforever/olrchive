Orange Lounge Radio
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey
Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive
The PlayStation is set to get an eye
There's Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade
Orange Lounge Radio
Quizno is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi
Also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before
And that's something else, because usually it's the same old prick of people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station
So we have a brand new person visiting us tonight
And you may recognize his name from various OLR emails and I think maybe phone calls in the past
And now he's here live in studio, which just goes to prove that stalking works
Say hello to Warrior Bob
It does work. Hi everybody. Everybody laugh at the noob
How you doing, noob?
Oh, not too bad, actually
So wait a minute, okay, we gotta figure out, how did you get from OLR listener to now being here in the OLR studio
So when did you first listen to Orange Lounge?
Okay, so I started listening to Orange Lounge probably two or more years ago
It was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts
Right
I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio
Let's look for all the good radio shows
Right, cool
And I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one
Awesome. Sucker
Yeah
Alright
It's a good time
But now you're here, where were you living before?
So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college
Okay
But I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here
San Luis Obispo is like not that far from here, I'll think it's about a four or five hour drive, so
Five, six, depending on how you drive
More for me
More conservative
Okay, cool, okay, so but now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool
Well, very cool
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, thank you for having me
No problem, we like having new people, especially guests that bring their own mics
Yeah, I know
So that's kind of nice
Let's see how this one would work
This mic, this guy brought is like more expensive probably than the three mics we've been using
for the last four years, so
The secret is it was the cheapest mic I could find at the store I bought it from
Where'd you buy it at?
Oh, just a place in San Luis
Oh, well
Alright, well cool
Well, WorryBob will be lending his thoughts and stuff on all the gaming news tonight
But first, we're going to go around and see how everybody's gaming week was in the little bit we call
How was your gaming week, starting off with Dark Sakura?
Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet
Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system
I like it because it's black
And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace
Once you go black, you never go back
Mm-hmm
Anyway
Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white
My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive, which is going to be loaded up with not porn
Did you see that? She totally was saying porn
And you can't see that
Not porn
You can't see it if you're not in studio, but that wasn't even an intentional mistake
At any rate
Yowie is still porn, you do realize, right?
I'm not going to put Yowie on it
Alright
I'm going to put lots of doujinshi, though
Quick sidetrack, because we're talking about replacement hard drives and all that
Loki, you're like a cracking type person
Could she take a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?
Uh, no
Do I want to?
Do I care?
Why not?
You can't see it because the drive has a special model number or serial number or something
They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120
And it only works with one type of hard drive, I see
But you can save 100 bucks doing it that way
Interesting
I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over Microsoft
The key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace
Even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console
But forget it
If you want to be even better, 11 times better
How about my gaming week?
Porn downloads
Porn downloads, what, your gaming week was porn downloads?
No, Rob, I wasn't finished
Alright, go ahead
I found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents
What she got me is a paid account for Guild Wars
So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars
I think she tricked you, because you know that at Guild Wars all you have to do is buy the game
I know, but I only had a trial
Ah, okay
Like, I, because I never bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it
Well, that's cool
Yep
So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?
In ten years, yeah
Oh, okay
Then again, I did spend, you know, the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online
So
Alright
Yeah
Is that it?
Yes, Rob
You sure?
You sure you're sure?
I thought Peter, you had a second
Loki, how was your gaming week?
All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017
That was it
That's it?
But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017
I finished normal and easy, working through hard, playing some of the infernal levels to get more weapons
Although that hasn't been going too well, and then, I don't know, pretty soon I'm going to start playing some more Crackdown
Um, because we're going to land two systems at work and get another copy of that
And then that'll be fun, so for some co-op
And hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out
And since Scenes of the Road just dropped in price, we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe
I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through light podcasts like you
I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing
I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2 stored neatly on the hard drive
But that game actually looks better than this one
Because I think this is just a remake of the first one
Are those games, or is that game really good? I want to buy it, but I don't know
It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun
Okay, well our chat room seems to think that it's a good game
We have SSJ100Matt says Earth Defense Force equals Next Gen Body Harvest
Deakman says Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome
Dar Tetsuya says is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?
D3? No. No, I'm not on their payroll
If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple series in the US, hell yeah, I'll take them
They can thank you by translating more of them
I mean seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword
I mean
I want that game
What was that sound? Did somebody get a boner? What was that noise?
No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner
You got a boner?
Yes, Rob
She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap
It was just a badly timed clink noise
Shut up, I'm eating my chicken
Better than eating your fish
I hope they do put out a sequel though, because if they remake the second one or even just do a new one that's got some better enemies in it and stuff
Hell, you can just do the same damn storyline, doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline
It's just blowing shit up, that's it
You can level the entire city and just come back the next level
Or if you play the level over again
Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?
They have a gun in there called the genocide gun
Isn't that that Hult game?
What? No
No, that was Ultimate Destruction
They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game
Press A button, blow shit up
That would sell trillions of copies
WarioWare genocide
Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force
I mean, because that's all you're doing, your mission
Okay, we need to destroy the ants
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants
That's every level, it's no rescuing, no nothing
It's just, we're in a different location, let's blow shit up
We're in a different location, let's blow shit up
Oh, there's a giant thing, blow it up
Oh, we can't blow it up, run
I mean, that's it
Like I said, you can level everything
Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob
Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made though
It's so boring
You know, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series
Because of the fact that you can play monsters and eat people and stuff
But seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous game play I've ever played
And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested
It's like SNK
I love Metal Slug, shut up
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?
Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer
Gotta love it
They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories
Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy
I was playing the other day, and my card wasn't visible
It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air
That's pretty awesome, actually
It's ridiculous, there's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome
Where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle
Or like fat air, where your car will just stop like it hit something, but there's nothing there
Weird stuff
If I could write a book about this crap
Alright, well I'm looking in the chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com
Remember, we do tape live on Sunday nights, and solicit your feedback here in chat
DDRDollarBill agrees with me, Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels, and after that, ZZZZZ, there's no ending
True, true that
I played a game on Nintendo that was like that, it was only interesting for two levels
Mag Max
Mag Max?
Mag Max
Oh, Mag Max, I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia
Mag Max
Mag Max, I've never even heard of that
It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it
And I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks
There were some pretty god-awful NES games, actually Mad Max
Bible Stories
Was one too
Oh man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories
You guys are hardcore
We were trying to beat the level with this sheep, and we couldn't do it
There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day, don't laugh, okay?
It was a Color Dreams game, let's start with that, okay?
And the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who
And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life
I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?
I remember one time when, I remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games
And I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue
Not because it's good, not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge
That might be cool, I don't know
Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like
Unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge
No, all that happened was it sucked really bad
I don't even remember what game it was, some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap
Alright, anyway, sorry, back to the present
But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and, like, stuff like that
And how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out
And, like, all you would do is, like, put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there
And it'd glitch out different ways, it's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out
Like you were talking to the glitch
Like, for example, like, one of our characters when we were playing two-player co-op
Would be running under everything
It wouldn't actually be running on the lair above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot
But he was running under the world, almost
You know, what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night
And pick, um, game genie codes
And then edit them until I came out with interesting results
Like, I ran around with, um, I called him Frog Mario
Cause he would screen
Isn't that Luigi?
No, he was green in the face
Okay
Either that or he was, like, morning green in the face
Hold your breath, Mario, keep holding it
No, don't let up
And, like, the pillar effect
Where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen
That was really weird
Alright
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki, back to the present?
Uh, no
Alright, I'll go
Speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past, like, ten years
Uh, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS
Cause my friend, you know, Miklotov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is
Uh, he has, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like
Rob, you wanna get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?
Don't you wanna get Pokemon Pearl? Come on!
Come on! It's got voice chat, come on!
We can play over the internet, come on!
So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl
Uh, and you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kinda cool, it actually works pretty well
Um, but here's the thing, is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it
Like, what, twelve years ago, whenever the first ones came out?
Those games have not changed at all!
Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom
And you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever
But essentially, the battle system is the same freaking thing
And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like
Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes
EEE-EE-EE-EE
It's like the sounds they all make, right?
Like, they all make these, like, horrendous little blips and blops noise
Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there
I guess so
No room for them
So you'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system
EEE-EE-EE
That's like what some of the Pokemon make, they make these, like, god-awful noises
They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls
They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water
Now fight for me
Come on, you little bitch, what's wrong with you?
He's sitting there, EEE-EE-EE-EE
Shut up and fight
You don't fight, you go back in the ball
You want no ball, no ball
Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die
Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint
Okay, follow me with this, okay? This is gonna go on a weird tangent
But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know, evolving into Pokemon
Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball
That attack you in the wild
Yeah, attack you in the wild
Stick them in a cardboard box
All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all
And get them to fight each other
And then Nintendo could put it out and everybody would be, you know, accepting of it
Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw you up
Oh, yeah
Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years
I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS and it's, it's, it's fun
I'm having a good time with it
Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff
Like, for example, let's add voice over IP chat to Pokemon
Why? I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, I don't know, I'm gonna add GPS to Metroid
I mean, it's just, why do we need that?
That would actually be really cool
Well, it's actually kind of cool because, like, now I kind of use it as a phone
But it's, excuse me, it's kind of a pain to set it up
Because, you know, you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on Instant Messenger
Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now and then I go, you know, I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well
And all that, and that's how you set it up
I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's gonna be on
I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected, you know what I mean?
Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy, where's the fun in that?
I guess not, so
But the other interesting thing that Wi-Fi is doing is that now that you have this global trading network
Is that, you know, you can trade these crap Pokémon for really good Pokémon
Because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care
And, I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names
Like, it's cool to have English names, I guess
So, if you want my Pokémon, because I named my Pokémon really dumb stuff
Like, I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokémon?
I think I named him Muffins
And I named them all cute things
Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles
And Fancy Pants is one that my friend has
So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokémon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess
So, that's something I've been playing
I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download
I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live
Is it Epic Pinball?
No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables
That was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables
But, the physics and everything else with the game, I mean, is really good
And, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views
And it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer
And they definitely build it to be expandable
Like, they're going to have new tables for download later on
Let's just see how much they're going to charge us for them
Hopefully it's not too bad, but we shall see
I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks
Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot
Because since I was gone pretty much all last week
I had rest bar for like a level and a half
And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so, you know, I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin
Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd
Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pitiful
I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could
Tried to play Frequency, but that's on a blue PS2 CD
And my drive is dying and can't play those
And I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphied, I'd like to play Sylphied
Oh, that's on a blue disc too
Sylphied
So I said, okay, screw this
So I went over to my new Commodore
And I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission that was given to work
That doesn't work either
So I said screw it and went back to Guitar Hero
So boring
Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on a Commodore 64?
Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago
That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing
But you haven't gotten anything to work on it
Well, I've gotten...
Oh, what game did I get to work on that?
I got The Hobbit to work on it
Which is, well, it's a text adventure
And I didn't really have the time to put in for one
I wanted an action game
Although I did go on GameTap
I took it back, I went on GameTap
Which I downloaded on a whim recently
And played that Commodore breakdancing game
Break-in or whatever it's called
Have you played that thing?
I did for a little bit
It's like Simon Says Play DDR
Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64
It meets Busta Crap
That game was so terrible
Busta Crap
So bad
But yeah, that was my gaming week
Mostly Guitar Hero
Yeah, Guitar Hero
Alright, very cool
Alright, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news
Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week
Jamie and I were on vacation
And even before we went on vacation
I was out of town for most of the week
So we were so behind on gaming news
That it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show
And we didn't even
We really actually didn't even get home from the trip
Until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night
I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back
But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter
At Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there
Because Peter's been listening to the show
And knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks
Yeah
Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there
And give us the hookup and all that stuff
So thanks, dude
And hope to see you again
And we'll hopefully, maybe in future weeks
Give the OLR listeners a little more warning
When we're going to Disneyland next time
And maybe do a little meet up there or something
Because that'll be fun
We could all ride pirates together
And sing along with it
Yeah, exactly
Because that won't annoy the other people in the boat to hell or anything
The drunken sorority girls were funny
Oh yeah, the drunken sorority
In the boat ahead of us
I kept expecting one to fall in
Didn't the one girl go like, I love you
At me or something
How were the changes
I was doing that to Barbossa
The changes on pirates?
Yeah, I still haven't seen it yet
It's, you know, they
YouTube
It's, they have Jack Sparrow in it
Which of course gives everybody this big fan-gasm
I think it changed for the better
There were two series of changes
Before this, I think
They tried to make the ride all PC
Oh, the politically correct version
And then people bitched
So they tried to ease it through
Like, I don't know
Okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate
Would sit down by the barrel
And this girl would come out of it and say
You know, he wanted the girl too
When she was hiding in the barrel behind him
And then they changed it to something else
Like she had something
And then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel
But I like at the end when he's there singing
Oh yeah, I like that too
Where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever
I don't call him Jack Sparrow
I call him Johnny Depp
Just because
Well
It was really cool
And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion
Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years
Oh, you didn't get to see it when they had the
With the old bride's attic
No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight
Rob had to be escorted off the ride
Yes, when I was eight years old
I had to be escorted off the ride
Because I screamed my head off
Because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride
There are no windows and no doors
And I'm like
Ah ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha!
Yes, I seriously thought I was going to die
You do everything and you look up and there's the skeleton hanging from the noose
It was horrible for a kid
You see all the pictures of the dead people
Anyway, sorry, this isn't the Disneyland podcast
I love the Disneyland podcast
We had a good time
But there are, you know, sometimes there's Disney games and stuff, right?
Like I remember on the NES there was that horrible Adventures in the Magic Kingdom game
Or Kingdom Hearts
Well, there's that Meteos game
I found out also though that I can get like an Uber discount through work for Disney World
Hmm
Like seven days for the price of four at a discount
Seven days
There are also some pretty cool Flash games you can play
In case you wanted to know what it's like to be a Disney employee
They have at the website sims.themagical.nl
And you can check out, they've got four different simulator rides on there
You can run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor
Which is your Disney version of the Haunted Mansion
Which is actually cooler than ours
And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad
And you can actually kind of run those
I actually played the Phantom Manor one
And that was kind of fun
It was, you know, looks very similar to like
You know, I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride
By the way, all the rides go faster at night
Yeah, I was going to say in this simulator do the rides go faster at night
That's what I want to know
I don't think so
That actually is our end joke
Loose
But it's really true on a lot of the rides
It's totally true
The rides do go faster at night
Anyway
The teacups go really fast at night
Alright, look, we've got to save this for another podcast
So we need to get into some gaming news
Since we did miss last week
Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week
Since we didn't have a show
Sorry kids
Okay
Anyways, real quick
There's a few things that were getting updated
A few systems
For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update
Including some wonderful games being added to it
Like Mercenaries
Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there
Turn to Castle Wolfenstein I guess is pretty cool
And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection
Soul Calibur 2
And let's see here
This is kind of neat
Guilty Gear Iseka
So lots of fun stuff there
And Jet Set Radio Future
How could I forget that?
So Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list
But the combo disc is not on the list
Riddle me that one
It might work though
No, it doesn't
People tried it
Oh, okay, well then that sucks
Yeah
Way to do your research, Loki
It was on our own forums
Just kidding
Anyways
Another thing
Or another system that was getting an update
Actually the Playstation 3
And they went to firmware 1.7
And that allows you now to be able to play Playstation 1 games on the Playstation 3
Because there was all those Playstation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP
But you had to have a PS3 to download them
Which is retarded in itself
But now you can actually use that to play those games
So, hooray
Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here
Is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console
And according
Originally they were thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters
But right now it hasn't been determined yet
What will be available and when
But they are coming
So that's good
And then of course
This was also interesting
Konami has decided to close its Redwood City office
And move everything to the LA offices
So no more Northern California Gamers Day unfortunately
Which is kind of interesting
Because Dark Soccer and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit
Last week on our way to Disneyland
Which is the first time I've actually been there
It's in a really nice area though
That business complex area
It's like the river going through and everything
They're probably having to move because rent is really big over there
I wouldn't doubt it
It's the Bay Area
And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick
Just real quick mentions
Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced
Yes
Using the House of the Dead 3 engine
So that's kind of exciting
And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man
They're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships
In which you'll be able to
Be crowned against the Pac-Man World Champion
And receive a custom
Yippee
Wait here's the prize
You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360
100,000 Microsoft points
Which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple
Guitar Hero 2 songs
And 26 years of one free Quizno subs a week
Okay
And then apparently
Wait wait
26 years of a free Quizno sub a week
Yes
Jesus
Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?
I guess
So the contest begins April 25th
Runs through May 9th
And the finalists will be chosen
And then they'll officially be on
I guess there's some
It's being sponsored by Quiznos obviously
But I'm going to be kind of interested
Just like my dinner
Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest to start soccer?
Probably not
I suck at Pac-Man

Alright well thank you for the wrap up on last week's news
It is very much appreciated
Since we were too lazy to do a show last week
So thank you
Alright now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week
Making things current
In this week's news I was awesome as usual
No really
April fools
Hey Rob shut up
It's almost May
Seriously
Well in response to the demand for the Wii
Nintendo has promised to increase production
So that they can meet the demand that's out there for it
They said that they were producing 1 million units per month
And are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity
So they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year
So yeah
Wii
So now you might actually be able to find one correct?
Well so far to date 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far
Dang
Which actually didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?
I don't remember too many numbers with these sales things
And then they always change
Especially over at the Sony cap
It was like we're going to have a million out by the end of the year
We're going to eat crayons
Shipped
Shipped
Yeah shipped
No no we meant shipped
Do we mean did we say by the end of the year we meant by the end of April
We meant 10 boxes put together in the shape of a ship
When we said year we meant fiscal year
When we said year we meant fiscal year
The new year doesn't start until we say it does
We used the lunar calendar
So I can't follow all this stupid you know goals and sales stuff
I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need the ramp up production
Seen as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now
And it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff
And now there's Wiis available
Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything
Hmm yeah
I'm sure they're ramping up production
Yep that's really what's going on
Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio
Well one thing that's also conspiracy is where the hell are the games
I mean we had
I ate them
We had Super Paper Mario came out recently
And um well
Kororimpa I guess
No there was
No there's been
WarioWare and Wii Play
Like four months ago but what's come out in like the past month
Not a lot
Wii Play I'm sure didn't take much so you know
Work to get it finished since they were all the E3 tech demos
Well anyway
So obviously a lot of folks are asking where's the games
And Satoru Iwata said you want games?
I'll give you games
He said the company is developing 124 games for the Wii and the Nintendo DS
Now out of those 124
45 of them are in development for the Wii
79 in development for the DS
So you might be going well you know why is the DS getting all the love
Well because there's like what like 20 million DS's out there
So obviously you know it's a very big platform to be developing for
And of course 45 games just being developed not being released this year
Well who knows because here's a short list of some of the games being developed
Super Smash Brothers Brawl
The Legend of Zelda on the DS
Phantom Hourglass
Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS
Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii
You know Metroid and all that fun stuff
Project Hammer and all those other crappy games
Orzic Sight Truck 2
All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles
I mean how many other A-list titles are there?
I don't know
I was going to say because Nintendo's known for only putting out
One, two really big name games a year
So yeah they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years
So that's 10 a year
But also that's them that they have in development too
All those games are what Nintendo has in house developing
Mario Party 8 and so on and so on
But outside that's not counting what Konami's got in development
What Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff
So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too
Yeah
Cooking Mama 2
Revenge of the Horrible Translation
Boo
Stop porting DS games to the Wii
It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS
Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii
Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom
chat.orangelandrater.com reminds us of another story that came up this week
I don't think it was on our show roll
But Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros. Brawl
And apparently it's nearly done according to I think some podcast
Where there was an interview with Kojima
He's actually played it and it's just about done
I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario
Because Mario's such a legend
I've lost all respect for him
I know seriously
It's a fighting game
He makes freaking Metal Gear games
Shoot people in the face and then it's like
Oh but I can't punch Mario
I can't punch a fat plumber
I can't do that
I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute
And he says oh no I can't punch Mario
Five seconds later
I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit
He's like yeah
Oh I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him
Because I loved Mario growing up
But then after I got past that
It was fucking on
I owned the crap out of the water
Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels
TheRobD says Cooking Mama 2
Mama teaches You Poison
And um
Sakura Max says Cooking Mama 2
Cooking Drugs
Mama's crack house
Don't worry
Mama will fix it
Mama will give you your fix
Win
Or even better
Mama's son or whatever
Accidentally kills one of his friends
Don't worry Mama will fix it
We're going to chop the body up
And put it in the food
We'll hide that
No one will notice
Anywho
Turkey surprise
So apparently Square Enix has said that
There will not be any of their games
Coming to at least the Japanese
Virtual console
At least that's what's kind of hinted
Lies
I think so too
They're saying that we feel the Japanese market
Is a problem in the media
Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest
Are played by a wide range of users
From children to adults
So limitations when you consider a problem
That we would have with billing systems
Okay
That's retarded
What game have I been bitching and bitching about
That the Japanese have and Europe has
But we still don't have
What game have I been bitching on this show
Oonga Boonga
Pop Quiz
Actraiser
Who made Actraiser
Square
Enix made Actraiser
Square Enix
So what do you mean Square Enix
Games aren't coming to Virtual Console
Actraiser is already there
What do you mean it's not in the US
I bought a cartridge of that not long ago
Let me put it this way okay
To be honest this is coming from
Originally from an IGN interview
With a Square Enix representative
And it's actually from
I guess a magazine Nintendo Dream
Or something like that
I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation
Here because I think what they're talking about
Is digital downloads in Japan
That they aren't going to go to a strictly
Digital download system or whatever
And it might make sense
That they might not put like
Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever
On the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them
I was going to say that's what it is
They're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console
They're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2
And 3 and so on
On Virtual Console because you stupid Americans
Will continue to pay $29.99
For the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so
Awesome they're so cool
But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console
Because of that I think that's the reason yeah
But I would say there is still hope
For Illusion of Gaia and
Soul Blazers and all those other old school
Enix games at least I don't know about Chrono Trigger
Because they'll probably do
An advanced version of that at some point
I will bet you money
That there will be a PSP
Version of Chrono Trigger in some time
In the near future because they love
Releasing
Re-releases and stuff
Is this something in your database you're just afraid to say something about?
This is purely speculation because
They're doing Star Ocean
They're supposed to be a new Star Ocean
Game which I do believe we did see
A little movie for it a couple
Years ago at E3 I could have sworn
It was just like that
There was like another game series
That they were teasing too that I haven't seen
Anything on like
The code something or whatever
Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into
The Square Enix movie room and you saw all the
Movies literally every single
Freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy
Game and then like oh and Star Ocean
Yeah it was something like that
I know that there has been a trailer
Because like I said there was
Some other game series that they were doing
That were supposed to be mobile, Playstation 2
And I think maybe PSP or something
That they haven't released yet
That's going to be coming out
DDRDollarBill says
If they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger
It better be that fucking good
I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it
And damage it
He's letting his fucking thoughts be known there
Such overuse of the F word there
What the fuck word?
See it's because
You know why it's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy
Like they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger
And if you ever try to
Get in that whole Final Fantasy 6 is better
Than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like
No it's not
You have to wonder, he said fix
What exactly does fix mean?
Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy 7
That's what it was, Code Age
Was the game that they were teasing and stuff
Remember there was supposed to be three different games in that series
One of them, Code Age Commanders
Was supposed to be on Playstation 2
And I believe the cell phones had another one
Code Age something
I don't remember what the other
System it was on
Code Age
Where'd it go? I just saw it
Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one
Who cares
Alright well
Regardless
I think it's certainly possible we're going to see
At least some of the Enix games show up on Virtual Console
Especially because in the case of
Illusion of Gaia, Nintendo
I think published it
Even though Enix made it if I remember right
Because there was a strategy guide and everything
So I think some of those games are still possible
But as far as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Triggers of the world
I want my goddamn
Super Mario RPG
What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?
You have to mod your Xbox
Which I know you've done and play it on an emulator
And then you paint your Xbox white
And you call it a Wii
Wii
Wii
So anyway
Just a little bit of news
For the Tokyo Game Show
Nintendo actually will be a big participant there
This is actually the first time
Since 1996 that
Nintendo is having a booth there
So it's a pretty big deal
But it's supposed to be
This massive, massive booth
So I think that's going to be pretty cool
That actually is in relation to
Dragon Quest 9
Ah I see
So Nintendo is always like
Oh we're not going to go to the Tokyo Game Show
But now that they have Dragon Quest
They're like well we better fucking go
Because Dragon Quest is
Because Square Enix calls the shots
Fuckers
Get my goddamn Super Mario RPG
Get over it
Dragon Quest 9 on the DS
Is probably the reason for that
So Loki since we suck
And we're not going to E3
I think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show
That might be fun
Oh come on you don't want to go to Tokyo?
Right
Because E3 wasn't bad enough
I have to go someplace where I don't understand anything
And he can cosplay
Look at me
I'm stupid American foreigner
Oh film him he crazy
I mean seriously
I'm just like
No
Wow
I can play DDR they'd love that
I could be on a variety show or something
American guy play DDR
That white man playing DDR
So funny
He uncoordinated
You see what happens when we're gone for a week
It's just like
Man somebody put some drugs in the food
Anyhow
Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development
For it what about a keyboard
The latest Game Informer
Magazine has a little spiel on a Wii
Keyboard it says quote
Nintendo's development team says that it's considering
A keyboard peripheral to the system
In order to make online surfing easier
But it has not officially announced
Anything at this time
Why would they want to make online surfing easier
They're not making online friend codes easier
Oh wait no friend codes aren't easy so
Well what if they put
Super Mario RPG in like flash or something
Then you could use your browser to play it on the Wii
I bet you'd need a friend code to get to it
Yeah you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard
So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in
Your friend codes faster
Which is why we're not getting rid of them
Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf
The internet faster on the Wii
Go to your PC
And surf it there
Put your PC on your Wii
So you're technically surfing it on your Wii
There you go
Science
Yeah so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard
But I don't see the point unless there's like
Games that start supporting it
Typing of the Dead
Hey
Typing of the Dead
That would be great if you had a motion sensing keyboard
And you could actually aim the keyboard
And then press the enter key
You know they could do I think though
That would be rad
They could do the gun survivor series
Oh yeah they could
On Wii
No I want a typing of the dead 2
Where I literally have to pick up my keyboard
And smack zombies with it
That's better
House of the Dead is a light gun game
You just plug your keyboard in
The keyboard guy fills up the guy with the pointer with typing
Energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with
Because everything you have to plug into
The Wii remotes anyways
You have to plug in the classic controller
Has to be threaded through your Wii remote and all the enhancements
So this keyboard is probably going to have to
Plug into the Wii remote so you have this big thing
Dangling there off your keyboard
There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wii mote to the keyboard
So you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing
Beautiful
The keyboard in your lap you're trying to shift your waist around
You just put it on your head
Move your head around
What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?
Do you remember that Rob?
I know
They had this Atari controller back in the day
That you would
It was trying to be like the ESP controller
But really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way
Trying to distract you when you were playing ET from how bad it was
What?
I'll try to find it
Little do the listeners know
That Dark Sakura's Folgers Coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD
It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway
I thought that you with your gaming knowledge would know this Rob
You disappoint me
You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?
Adventure
And there was no eye wiggling
Or nose twitching
I dream of genie motions
Going on in that game
Yellow block vs squiggly thing called the Dragon
The Atari Mind Link controller
That was it
Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out
It's Bewitched technology
No it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one
I found it
Put it using the Wikipedia link now
Along with your bad Wikipedia self
Mix that thing with that Amiga lap board controllers
You had to do that
Do you know about that one?
The Zen Guru Master game
It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch
So if you tilted too far to the left or right
You broke your concentration and the game failed you
You were a disappointed guru
We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night
Some of these games sound really awful
We should have the most frustrating game challenge
Let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Break Dance game
I have a Sega Activator
Yeah me too
Or play anything with the Power Glove
Anything
The Power Glove was a piece of shit
Anyways
Apparently Time magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people
He's done a lot of things including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong
Zelda
The Wii
All that fun stuff
I think they have to do this because it's a new game console
It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that
It's just a gamey
I actually looked at the results the other day and Miyamoto was number 2 on this little user poll
They have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential
I believe he was number 2
I think Perez Hilton was number 5
He's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that
You should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel
Who's more influential?
Purple!
Or Pink or whatever
No that was Perez Hilton
I need to check the voting channel
I haven't used that channel in a long time
Last time I played it I remembered there was a question
Who's going to win American Idol?
Melinda Sanjaya
That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel
It's fascinating
They still haven't used any of my submissions
This makes me very sad
Clowns or rape?
I think I submitted a question that said which is funnier clowns or rape?
No I'm just kidding
I'm going to get so much hate mail
I was drunk
I'm going to get hate mail from clowns
I hate clowns
I submitted a serious one that says which dessert is better?
Cake or pie?
You know this is something that needs to be asked
Of the American public
We need to settle this debate once and for all
I swear to god pie is better
I should do one that says are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?
Is the glass half empty or half full?
Anyway
Happy happy day
Ken Kutaragi
He of the crayon eating
Bicycle helmet wearing
You know
Leash
I want to make more further shots of that
He who sucks so bad
Has retired from his position
With the Playstation
But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI
So
Everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief
Except
Guess what happens when you cut off this head
Another one has regrown in its place
In the form of Kazuo Hirai
Kutaragi is a hydra
Yes
Giant enemy hydra
Anyways
What's a Nubian
Shut the fuck up
I don't know I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason
I love that whole scene
What's a Nubian
Bitch you almost made me laugh
Anyways
I love
But fear not
Because the craziness at Sony is still not over
Ken may be gone
But their PR department is still there
To make a complete ass of themselves
Including such things as
The Playstation 2 launch party
For God of War 2
In the UK
They've decided to celebrate this in the non offensive way
At all by offering
A decapitated goat
Which
Guests were invited to
Reach in and eat offal
From the stomach of the goat
Also there were naked chicks there as well
So
Apparently people are a little pissed off at the fact
That there was a decapitated goat there
That was still
Warm you know
PETA
Didn't you eat PETA
Earlier
People eating tasty animals
But apparently
People were pissed off at this
I'm pissed off because I wasn't invited
Sounds like fun
They had topless girls
That were dripping
Grapes into guests mouths
Male model portraying Kratos
And
He was handing out garlands
Apparently
The international fund for
Animal welfare said
It was outrageous that the animals death
Have to be used to sell a few computer games
Dude
I dare one of our listeners to email
PETA a link to one of these stories
What is their website?
PETA2.org or something
I once
Went out with someone who worked for PETA
And man they're nuts
So I want to see what happens when they get
A hold of this story
I don't know I'm sick
I have a problem
There's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen
When PETA gets a hold of what's going on here
Honestly I mean
Other than the fact that it is kind of cool though
That they do have like you know
Topless chicks there
But
What PR guy thought it was a great idea
To decapitate a goat at a party
And have people eat from its entrails
I mean
Who proves this crap?
Like I mean seriously was some guy
Like sitting there playing a game or something
Yeah I need you to prove this
PR event info
Back to playing God of War 2
I could play the sex minigame
Maybe it was an animatronic goat
Not judging by the picture on that article
They blurred out
The decapitated goat
Blurred out the decapitated head
That apparently was hanging on by a string
Still
Is that like some type of you know
Ancient Roman custom?
They seem to think so
I want to say I was reading some thread about this
On the internet and someone came out and said
Well actually you know I
I live with a scholar on Greece
And no they didn't do this at all
So they got it wrong
I have no idea if this is true or not
It says apparently
Well dude
I can hear the Sony meeting now
And the Angra PD letters start coming
Whoa we read about it on Wikipedia
So it must be true
I mean what do you mean
They didn't decapitate goats in Greece
It was on Wikipedia
Yeah
Speaking of things hanging on by a string
Kudaraki may have some hope left
In where he can go next
I mean true he's going to be on the board at you know Sony or whatever
But
Very interesting
Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment
Of course Iwata being the president of Nintendo
Iwata stated quote
They would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo
Yeah
Doesn't that prospect make you excited?
Kudaraki would be like
We will be producing 10 billion wii's
Next week
Rob it makes me so excited
That I feel irregular
Now of course the likelihood of this actually happening
Is slim to none
Seeing as you know Kudaraki is still on the board
Over at Sony Europe
And also you notice Iwata didn't say exactly
What Kudaraki would do at Nintendo
You know
I think the rest of the quote
The quote was would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo
And then the rest of the quote was
In the available warehouse position
That we have
Tailing out the wii's to best buys all over the world
They named him chief operating officer of crayons
Of the janitorial department
You realize the acronym for which is kook
Anyway
So moving forward
How about some news that doesn't involve Kudaraki please
Well kind of
Alright
The Playstation store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma
The demo is available
Here in the US
And also a demo
For Virtua Tennis
So that's pretty cool
Also trailers for
Gauntlet 2
The Wheelman
John Woo's Stranglehold
And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma
Is set for June
So basically you could sum this
Whole story up by basically saying
Playstation network actually
Gets content
There was Tekken
I guess that's true
There was Tekken
There was Xbox 360
Hey to their credit
Has upped it to two arcade titles a week
Recently so you know
More than some of us can handle
So there you go
Speaking of stuff coming out soon
We're going to take a look around the world
At some various release dates
What's coming up in the near future in some various countries
Around the world
And during my portion of this segment
I usually talk about what's going on in Japan
With the Japanese release dates
Really not a lot
There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii
And for the DS but honestly game wise
As far as Japanese release dates go
There's really only like one game
Coming out
And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS
Called Osawari Tantai
Osawarina
Also known as Good Prince
And it's an adventure game coming out from
I'm not sure who actually
Is putting this out
Success is putting this out
Based on an anime game
I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here
Looks to be
Well very boring actually
Is what the game looks to be
So if you are interested in boring games check that one out
That's it for Japanese release dates
There's really nothing coming out this week over there
We want more release dates
More
More
Spelled with an A
Okay
You can get really excited about
A face cover portable
Coming out on the Sony PSP
In black, blue, pink, and white
That's my favorite game already
Face cover portable
You stick the PSP in front of your face
And it puts like
Different faces on your face
I think it's great that they have a face cover
In black when the PSP is black
Oh it's a system cover
I get it
Anyways for the US we actually do have some things
Coming out
There's going to be Spiderman 3 the game
Coming out on Friday to coincide with movies
Basically on every system
In fact the Playstation 3 is getting
A special limited edition one as well
On the Wii
We are also getting Heat Seeker
Which is also coming out on Playstation 2
As well
Also Legend of the Dragon
Which is based off some really crappy
I guess TV animated series
On the Disney channel
And it's coming out on the Wii
And Playstation 2 as well
Also this week though
We should be seeing
God
I want to say
There's actually
Not too much else coming out
There's the cube on
PSP which is like a puzzle game
The ultimate board game collection
Which is coming out from
Or it's being distributed through
Capcom
The ultimate in board games
It's a board game collection
We're going to fuck you up
With some sorry
You can't handle
All this clue we got up in here
But here's
I think I'll leave it with the
Some of the best stuff right here
We've got
This part's cheesy
On the PC
Fairy Godmother Tycoon
Is coming out
Once again proving that there are way too many
Board game tycoon games
Board game tycoon
Yeah
I vote for
Although I did find the coolest board game today
And apparently it's one that's been out for a while
And I just didn't know about it
Anti-monopoly
I've never heard of anti-monopoly
That's why when you win the game you lose
Because the government breaks you up
I think so
Anyway how about some UK release dates
That point to owning Baltic Avenue
And Mediterranean
I think it's good PR
Anyway
All these release dates are for the 4th
We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops
On PSP
We have Mindy Storm on DS
We have Tony Hawk's Project 8
On PSP
Untold Legends Dark Kingdom on Playstation 3
And Final Fantasy 3 for the DS
Yay
Final Fantasy 3 is a good one
There's a lot of good games in that
It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good
Yeah, good stuff
Man later on they're getting some other really good games
Like Mario Strikers
Ooh Spongebob
Actually I heard that Strikers really sucks
But you didn't hear that from me
Hey how about Picross
There you go
Alright anyhow
Moving on to stuff coming out in the future
Eternal Sonata
Eternal Sonata of course known as what
Trusty Bell over in Japan we're getting
Eternal Sonata and what's interesting
Is that the ESRB is showing that this game
Is not just coming out on the Xbox 360
But it's also coming out on the Playstation 3
Kind of interesting because
You've heard about all these you know exclusive
Games going from the Playstation 3
Over to the Xbox 360
But this is one you know I think a lot of people were looking forward to
That now seems to have gone the other way
Of course if I recall right Eternal Sonata
Was never promised as an exclusive title
Either way so it's not like this is like
Huge like OMG
Microsoft got pwned type news
No it's just you know hey it might be coming
Out for this other platform as well
And of course this would be the one that's what it's based all
Off what Chopin's music
Or something
I think that's right
It looks like an interesting title based on the
Screenshots it looks very like Final Fantasy
Ish and I like how the
Characters names are like Polka
And Allegretto and all that stuff that's cute
It's basically about
A magical land that
When you get terminally
Ill you go to this magical land
That's what happens
It's like that cloud thing wait so this is
Make-A-Wish the game? Basically yes
Okay
Anyways
The Playstation Network is also getting
Some other interesting games coming out
Including a game
Called Snakeball which is supposedly
The
The funkiest online sport
Ever created
The quotes IGN
So no idea what exactly
That's gonna be but
I don't know it looks cute I guess
It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there
So that's kinda neat
That's cute except the game is called
Snakeball
That's just asking for trouble in VR
But anyways it says
And I believe Snakeball could be a euphemism for
Penis
Because there's a snake and balls
Snakeball you I guess
Are donning your disco shoes
And you glide across a dance floor
On a hover snake
While collecting colored balls to score
Points and it says other players
Can rapidly reduce your point
Tally by flicking you with their
Tails or blasting you with
Their weapons and I guess
It's gonna support
An option to
Import your face and map it on to stuff
I don't know
Looks okay it's kinda neat
The other thing that they're gonna be getting
Is a brand new game called
Stardust HD
Which I guess is a cross between asteroids
And I guess
Since everybody compares this
Games to this
Geometry Wars
So yet another game
Where you blow up a lot of shit
I think a game is like Geometry Wars
If you shoot stuff
Hostile one in our chatroom
Chat.orangelandtrader.com has a comment on the
Snakeballs game he says
Get these motherfucking snakeballs off
My motherfucking console
Get it? Like snakes on
Yeah get it?
Movie sucked
Dude I love snakes on the plane but I really liked it
Just for the situation I saw it in
Where me and Meg Z and Chris all had stuffed
Snakes that we picked up at the uh
The Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater
I thought you were gonna say it was an in flight movie
That would've been great
Can I touch you? Or will I
Will I bleed from your awesomeness?
I don't know
Wow
I feel like death
I got gay from Rob
It's all over my foot
Alright
Dark Sakura the gay foot
Rob
Oh my god Dark Tetsuya said touch DS
That was funny
Anyway
So guess what we have
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?
It's fucking awesome I can't stop
Dude
I was like touching Dark Sakura's foot and I was like hee hee
And I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear
I saw Loki like drinking
The sauce from McDonald's
I was because it's so tasty
Oh my god that's nasty
Sweet and sour sauce
I ran out of nuggets
Anyway
Are you one of those people that bitches at the drive through
Because they're like okay
If you only get six nuggets
You only get one sweet and sour sauce
Pack and if you want more
You gotta pay ten cents extra
Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them
Apparently
No two's enough
For like a ten piece nuggets
Or whatever but you know
They gave me three so what the fuck am I supposed to
I can't just save it for next time
Think about it Rob that's like a shot for ten cents
Dude I mean
I take syrup shots I mean come on
Do you eat the jams
At like waffle country waffles
Oh god
I don't like jam
Nasty nasty nasty
You took syrup shots with everybody Rob
I'm gonna finish drinking this now
I was drunk
At Roscoe's?
I don't know it's just my excuse for everything
Fine so guess what Sony's giving us
Food
Crabs? Aids?
Hot shots tennis
Oh I was gonna say shots
You can dress up the little girls in different costumes
That's not very hot
It's hot shots
I guess it's supposed to be cute
Yummy
So yeah hot shots tennis
Yay next
I love your reporting DarkSakura
You don't even bother to give us
The details you just like
Yeah Sony's making a hot shots
Tennis game and you can dress chicks up
But this game sucks
I can do that in Dead or Alive and then this one I get bouncing
Boobies so huh
Alright
Well of course
E3 is coming to town of course
It's coming to Santa Monica
Where exactly in town they haven't really said
From what I understand they've kind of like told people
Okay be on the street corner
Oh yeah the invitations at the house I could have looked there
Well they're gonna tell you like be on the street corner
And then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up
And it's like going to a rave
Apparently is what E3 is tuned into
Like dude there's gonna be like this sweet party
At this like vacated airport hangar
But like we can't tell you where it is on the flyer
It's like an unmarked bus is gonna come pick you up
And take you to the location
It's gonna be an all night party
One of the E's now stands for Ecstasy
Apparently
It was like E4
We're putting the E in E3
Well anyhow the interesting thing about E3
Is that last year there were 400 companies
Debuting stuff at E3 and showing off their latest stuff
This year there are 32 companies
Showing off at this year's E3
Now granted Sony's on the list
Microsoft's on the list
And Nintendo's on the list
Because all the companies that are debuting stuff
Is a lot of the big big companies
Uh it's basically
Kenshi Hall was where you know
Where those 400 companies were last year
But it's still kind of surprising there
You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus
I guess not
So uh
The invitations are down by the way
To between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year
60,000
Is one of the companies that's gonna have a booth there
G4 because you know they always have a booth
No G4 is not on the exhibitors list
But they will probably still somehow have like
500 people
At E3
All in those ugly shirts
Well anyway
I realized Dark Sakura got an invite
To E3 but
Have you even followed up on it?
I think you need to
I've been reading Twitter
I got my invite and I did my confirmation
So I've got my physical thing in the mail
Lucky you
Have fun, take pictures
Wait a minute
Loki and I are sitting here going
God damn motherfucking E3
And you're like
Oh yeah I got an invite just kind of sitting at home
I don't know I may not go
I actually am putting my focus on my education
So maybe
I don't know if people want to give me money I'll go
Cause it's kind of expensive to stay down there
I hope you're listening ESA
Fuckers
This is when you're inviting people that don't want to go
I didn't say I don't want to go
I can't afford to go
My name is Dark Sakura
AKA Jamie Summers
And I think you should let me into E3
I'm really angry about things
Let me play your game god damn it
No no
If they would give me a place to stay
Then I would be happy
I just wear glasses do my hair
And that little A style that Dark Sakura has hers
And I can sneak in as her
Yeah but you have to
I want to play your game does it have boobs
Whatever
Jamie could be a guys name
Whatever
Alright anyhow
This is California it's high me
I'm sorry
Whatever
Well anyway every time I hear about E3
And how it's kind of going a little bit downhill
And the fact that there's this big party going on
And I'm not invited
I get a little bit angsty
I know what that means
Dark Sakura would you care to start us off
With the FUs of the week
Matthew of the week goes
It's very simple
Goes to stupid drama
And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland
On my birthday
Hey dude the lines were short
And the teacups were not being opened
That was sad
And and and and and
The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain
Fuckers
And and and and and
Yeah done
Loki
Fuck you to the dumbass that ran
Our games at Qsar last night
Because you are
A dumb fucking
The job I mean because I've done the job
It's not that fucking hard
And now you've failed at every aspect of it
And like when I was playing in front of him
He was like mystified like I was doing magic
Or something you know
So how are you doing that
Horrible
The Qsar has really gone downhill in Vacaville
All packs are all fucked up
So fuck them for screwing that up
I would like to give an FU to Loki's wife Nellie
For shooting me fifty-eight times
In one game at said Qsar
Because the
Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on
The defense shields so she could just shoot me
Over and over and over and over and over again
Which is what she did she just basically held the gun up to my back
And kept shooting because those
I could not shoot the base like something was wrong
With those bases but I had a fun time
At laser tag FU to Loki for not opening up his own
Laser tag arena for being too like
Oh yeah
Oh wait what's that
Oh it's twenty or it's
You know two million dollars in my ass
You know wow
Look at that
Get a loan or something I don't know
Rescue us from horrible Qsars around the world
Anyway what else do I have an FU too
I don't know
I guess that's it
Just an FU to Nellie
Warrior Bob any FUs you have to get off your chest
I'm actually a fairly happy guy
I don't have a whole lot of FUs
So if anything it's to Sony for the drives
Not reading blue discs
Because that makes me angry
And to Jobs for not being open for me
Because I'm unemployed
Unemployment sucks
I'm working on it
I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now it kind of sucks
Honestly blue discs make me more angry
You should say
An FU to the Rob D for sounding like you
I don't know it's kind of weird
The Rob D sounds like me
Yes I don't know if you've ever listened to this day in gaming podcasts
But you guys have a very similar voice it's kind of interesting
I'm going to have to go listen to that now
It's interesting it's not a bad thing
He's got a great radio voice
Well thank you very much
I sleep all night so I'm totally unconscious
I have no idea what I'm running around doing
Maybe we're the same guy
Well he's in chat right now though
I don't know if that's possible
Unless you're like that chick on Heroes
Who can use the internet with her brain
That would be so distracting
No I'm not like the chick on Heroes
And yeah that stupid bitch on Heroes
Fucking A
I sign up for the damn viral websites
And she spams me all this shit
All the time
Had I known her secret power was spamming people
I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site
There's an F you
F you to freaking spam bots getting into my forums
F you to PHPBB
For making it really hard for me to fix that
And F you to get into spam bots
And the other thing I hate fucking spam
That has to do with the stock market
I don't play the stock market
Why the fuck would I care what companies
Want me to buy
Amanda sent me the best title though from a spam email
You exemplify carrot
Whatever happened to Spamusement
That was like my favorite online
Have there been updates?
That was my favorite online comic
Anywhere with Spamusement
And they just kind of stopped doing updates
I mean I realized
Maybe the guy like you know real life
Comes first and maybe had something else he wanted to do
That doesn't make me any less sad
He could just pass it off to somebody
No the last one was October 20th
That makes me sad
Spamusement go look in the archives
The older cartoons at Spamusement.com
It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life
It's great
Anyways
Oh god some of these are kind of gross
So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out
From Mr. Bishi
It's a new Docomo
Sounds like Kokomo
Anyways D9-04i
And apparently
It's going to have a motion sensor built into it
Or I believe
There was something about it using its camera
To detect motion
Anyways
It's a fucking Wii phone type thing
And you're going to be able to use it to play games
And a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it
Of course
Katamari Portable
And You Are Gundam
So I guess that's neat
But I hope they don't release them in the US
Because
People have enough trouble driving
Let alone playing TILTI games
On their cell phone
Driving while side talking
How about just shut up and drive
That's what I vote for
And further proof that Namco intends to just
Poop all over the Katamari franchise
While the creator has gone off to greener pastures
But then you can roll it up into an even bigger ball
And set it on fire
With your cell phone for god's sake
Roll it up and light it
There we go
New Katamari game, Katamari Weed
Katamari Weed
Wow, well anyway
That's going to bring Segment A
Of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here
And we'll be back after a quick break
With more of Orange Lounge Radio
Because as you know we tape in two
Well maybe you don't know because we were gone last week

But Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves
Live on Sunday night
And this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately
And then the second half will follow sometime mid week
So we're going to take a break here
And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
