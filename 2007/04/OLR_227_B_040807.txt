Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
For match game, he will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later on in the program.
We'll tell you when to call.
But, in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.
Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday, and everyone is all excited about it.
It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.
And this is the brand new EA Harmonix kind of co-game there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Was there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies of it?
Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals involved with it, according to some rumors.
But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.
And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.
This is so innovative.
So innovative.
It's not innovative at all.
Well, to an extent, though.
If they do make it playable over the internet and you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked ass.
The keyboard was pretty good.
I have to say that.
If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.
But the drum controller for home, not that hot.
Guitar controller for home, not that hot.
The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.
Session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania
Now, for those people that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing, I don't want to sing.
It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.
I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing, is fucking, Konami, wake up, where the fuck have you been?
You've missed a train, and the next train, and the next train, as far as music games go.
You're letting these people, I mean, you had the whole market cornered for this stuff, and now you're just kind of letting it slip away.
I don't know what they're thinking.
What's the big deal?
I mean, they really should have
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's not original.
I don't care.
If they want to improve on it, great, that's awesome.
But it's not fucking original.
If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.
GS68 says Konami wailed on In The Groove and pump it up, but his pretending Guitar Hero doesn't exist.
That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In The Groove should have done to DDR, and that is, you know, completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone of Guitar Freaks.
They, you know, the only similarities between the game is they both have guitar controllers in their rhythm games.
You know, otherwise, you know, they gave it the more amplitude look,
Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero
Yes, it is going to turn into this.
But I like the harmonics now.
This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, Neversoft, you can have Guitar Hero.
We're going to go work on something bigger and better.
That's smart harmonics to me.
I think so.
And I'm curious to see what it's going to become.
But here's my thing is people bitch about having to buy like $600 systems and stuff.
Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got leaked out there from GameStop
They were saying that they were starting to do pre-orders on stuff because they'll pre-order games that don't exist yet.
But let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something like that.
You're spending $200 on a fucking game.
I mean, that's a little much for me, I would think.
Well, people are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.
Why not?
Yeah, but still, they drop another just for one game.
You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.
I'm just going to get them all anyway.
Because you're a peripheral whore.
But I want to ask you.
I am.
You know, this is very interesting, and I think this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue.
Because you guys have to realize, six years ago, flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks.
I mean, literally, the three of us were playing this band thing.
And insert random other person on another guitar.
Well, you know, but still, we were kind of doing this a long time ago.
We have a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.
Now, nobody look at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us on the machine.
So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?
Because, you know, he doesn't seem to care for it because it's not original.
I'm a little disappointed, though, that they just didn't fully rip it off and do, like, a keyboard as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.
and I generally kind of like the idea because, you know, well, it's a guitar, freaks, drum, music.
What do you think, DarkSakura?
I honestly, I think it's going to be fun because it's the closest we're going to get in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind of, you know, bullshit.
But it's the closest we're going to get over here.
It'll make it, you know, I think it'll really catch on.
I think that it's going to be a big thing.
You know, I am a little disappointed, though, in Konami.
Just a little bit, because they used to be so edgy with, like, you know, DDR and then Karaoke Revolution.
No one had even thought about doing something like that.
Or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.
And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh!
games.
I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom!
Just, like, totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside.
You know, come out with the next big thing, you know.
I think the other killer about this, though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DER, well, some DER, some Carrier Revolution.
I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty good.
They're solid.
I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and
I just hope it's diverse.
I don't want to play all these emo bands.
One emo song once in a while is kind of fun.
I wouldn't mind a little bit of that, but I don't want a whole game full of that.
I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some new classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today.
I kind of hope they find a balance.
We'll see, though.
And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it.
There should be a keyboard, though.
I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but I understand why it's not there, but it doesn't make me any less sad.
Do you know what I want to know?
What?
This is kind of stupid, but you're going to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going to be USB on the 360.
They're lacking one USB port for that.
That's going to be a problem.
They need a wireless mic?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Well, I think this is kind of cool.
During the conference for Rock Band, the Harmonix CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.
It was actually specified he said it without hesitation.
He's quoted saying, we will at some time bring Rock Band to every important platform, and Harmonix would be...
tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms.
And he likes the Wiimote.
Well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that platform, except playing online is going to suck because Nintendo will make you put in friend codes.
And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks or something like that.
It will never work.
Just make new peripherals.
They could do a Taiko no Tatsujin on...
Beatmania 2DX trying to relaunch that off the ground in arcades in the U.S.
Beatmania 2DX Gold
Well, according to this user on BomaniStyle.com, Brazoliange, I probably mispronounced that horribly, sorry.
This guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there.
And she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it.
And that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations.
But they're having problems finding a distributor right now in the U.S.
and has not seen an easy way to import them.
They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.
Konami or Betsen is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September and this lady I guess is looking into that so Dave and Busters they want to buy 2DX Gold they're glad to see there's a client base and they're looking into purchasing machines if you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support all the information is over there at BomaniStyle.com but pretty interesting it'll be interesting if that game finally took off here but I don't know it's a bit of a novelty I love Beatmania 2DX but
I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.
Put in anything Timbaland produced in there or mix it with some new techno like Faster Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff and trance and dance and it'll be huge.
They don't know.
That would never work.
And what they need to do is they need to reinvent the whole damn franchise for the U.S.
if they're going to do that.
They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing instead of just having keys and stuff.
Actually, just have turntables and mixer and stuff like that.
More like Kraken DJ or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.
Easy to DJ, though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with...
Beatmania, 2DX, or something like that.
They just need to make it... Because right now, people, when they see that, they're all, well, that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.
Kraken DJ.
Kraken DJ is a good example.
But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast.
Maybe it was just because the songs in there were not recognizable at all.
But I don't know.
Something about 2DX kept me on.
They had a great... Even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,
My birthday is in two weeks.
Really?
And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.
Yes, we are.
Yay!
Rockin' Space Mountain.
Hell yeah!
But we'll be back in time for the show.
Hopefully.
Otherwise, we're doing it live from I-5.
Uh, hi!
This is me, and I'm driving.
Goddammit!
Fucking SUV!
Goddammit!
Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.
Goddammit, motherfuckers!
That will be me, won't it?
So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the PlayStation 3 20 gigabyte system, that's skew at least.
Well, Sony style is no longer carrying the 20 gig system, and that's kind of interesting, and that kind of further backs up with everybody else.
Either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done with it, or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling anymore.
um the 20 gig at least is not selling and i know for a lot of um retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore so i don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20 gig system probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there but i think they're done 20 gig system it's my opinion and uh actually i think what i was trying to read here um
Joystick, I believe, contacted SonyStyle and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month.
And they said they're not getting any more.
You could go out and find one, though.
Has anyone checked the Metreon store?
I don't know.
But I know my 20 gig's awesome.
You don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit.
Just plug it in.
Plug the damn thing in.
Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play.
And then I'll talk hardware.
Exactly.
Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they actually are both not coming out in May, as we have been told.
They still have a 2007 release, but Sony isn't really saying much about it, so we'll just
I guess keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.
Probably Summer.
I don't think they have anything else coming out.
I mean, Lair, Heavenly Sword.
I don't think they have anything really.
Well, I guess Warhawk.
Ooh, Warhawk.
Oh, joyandrapture.com.
Let's see.
Let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking waited until 2008 to launch the system.
Write that up there on the board.
All right, there we go.
Yeah, now we have, you know, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.
But, you know, one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam.
You know, sometimes a lot of people give this system a lot of crap.
But the PSP is still chugging along, and now it's chugging along at a lower price.
That's been people's number one bitch about the system.
Well, now the core system is only $169.99.
That is a drop from the $199.99.
and DarkSakura.com.
Touche.
and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking with phones and stuff like that.
Not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.
Unfortunately, there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.
So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?
I don't know, probably a while.
But yeah, there's a YouTube video up out there, so if you want to see it in action.
You can do that, but of course, if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.
Alright.
You know what?
What?
I think we should all just move anyway.
Just move?
Yeah, why not?
Make our own country.
What brought that on?
And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any games.
Yay!
Games more expensive!
Awesome!
Anyway.
There's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final Fantasy XIII available on the PlayStation 3 Network.
Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this spring, thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year, the honor will go to the PlayStation Network.
As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.
That'd be funny.
Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing, though.
Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?
Right.
That would be something else.
It might hit Japan's store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.
Not necessarily.
Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the U.S., right?
Well, there's ways.
There's... Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.
Yeah, but then all the text isn't Japanese.
Who cares?
It doesn't matter.
All right.
Well, another who cares for me.
You know, we've been talking a lot this episode about Guitar Hero, and Hands-On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.
You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar Hero on the cell phone?
Because you know it's going to suck.
I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, rhythm games, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks.
So why would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?
People should stop gaming on cell phones.
Hey, I play Luminous.
Yeah, Luminous is okay.
Tell that to fucking NVIDIA, or not NVIDIA, Nokia.
Nokia.
Yeah, Nokia.
The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.
That's it.
We don't need anything else.
You know what?
Cell phone game is pretty awesome.
It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive.
Instead of trying to play your stupid mobile games at red lights.
Anyways.
Apply Makeup, the game.
That's horrible.
Actually, I think they do have a game like that, too.
Do they really?
Like Barbie?
Scary enough.
Barbie cell phone game?
Have you seen women driving down the road and they're putting makeup on?
I've totally seen this in traffic.
Lipstick on the rear view mirror.
It's like, DRIVE!
Yeah, anyways.
Yeah, a little bit of makeup is not going to transform you from, you know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen.
So, anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little bit.
There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, John Tam...
who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.
I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy that you got?
I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Launch YouTube.
If you look at our account, you can see this guy that got the smackdown here.
Anyway, so the, yeah, settlement has been reached.
They are no longer able to, there's some interesting stuff I read on this because it didn't make any sense at all.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Another part of the injunction, I guess, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer based games for the next year.
Nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero 2 until six months after the game's release.
And some other stuff like that.
That kind of sucks.
Oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos for a while.
This is what
DarkSakura, who sent us anthrax this week?
My mother.
How evil of her.
Okay.
First email, hi, it's Zayd from London again.
I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition.
I was reading about it on the net and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.
Also, I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any idea if us Brits will get that too?
Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?
Always have a good one, Zayd Mohamed.
Oh, and last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.
I hope this one is better.
Yeah, I'm a bitch.
Don't even bother.
Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where DarkSakura's admitting she's a bitch?
No, I'm proud.
Heart.
Hey, Rob.
What?
Broken heart!
Bitch.
Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, yes, it's happening.
We don't know much, but we talked about it in Part A, right?
So go download Part A.
Um, as far as DVD playback on the Wii, um, well, I think that's been announced previously.
How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?
Hooray!
That could be the tenth DVD player in my house.
But, you know, for the little kid with the Wii in his bedroom, you know, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.
Yes, Loki.
Gateway to Porn!
That's what it is!
Gateway to Porn!
Now that can play all the porn DVDs, so it's Gateway to Porn.
Hooray!
Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?
Eventually, I'm sure.
Yes, but six months later than us.
Because Nintendo hates you.
Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.
Anyway.
Next email, please, Rob.
I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.
I feel sorry for you guys.
Something to do with the Revolutionary War.
We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.
We'll figure something out.
We got an email from Ron Says Don't Call Him Cute.
We call Ron... He was the young one.
Aww, the cute little kid that emailed us a Pokemon.
Next email from AZHP.
Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast waiting for my vector calculus class to start, and Rob started playing Blow My Whistle, I inadvertently began bobbing my head, and before I knew it, I was breakdancing outside the classroom.
And then the music stopped.
I was sad.
Sad face.
But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2, and for that I wanted to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.
We lived confused.
That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little bit of it and makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.
Oh, but I do, I do, I do.
That song was horrible.
Next email!
Alright, yes.
Dear LLR crew,
First of all, congratulations to DarkSakura for graduating and getting certified.
You rock.
I know, thank you.
Finally, someone else says it.
Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program is produced.
Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.
I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.
Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?
Yeah.
Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner, but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland.
Yeah, it was.
It seems that I have recently begun to crave pinball mightily, and while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate a proper table with flippers and steel balls, and lanes and bumpers in popular culture tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.
It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate, and so I put the question to you, where might I find good local pinball?
Not at RBGL, shit.
Oh, there's a PS on here.
My profound thanks, WarriorBob.
PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's house.
But I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking creepy.
PPS, Byright promised me pinball once that they were liars.
Because Byright's a piece of crap!
Um, Scandia had a bunch of machines.
I haven't been there in a long time, though.
Uh, off Madison and I-80.
Have you seen the weird thing that they've got up there now?
Their new little, like, we're gonna throw you up in the air thing?
That ride they have?
That thing is scary looking.
As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.
What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.
Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my god, Scandia has got this new ride called...
The motherfucking eyesore.
Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.
It's called the pooflinger.
Hey, email, right?
Yes, but I want to say real quick.
The last time I went to Scandia, which granted was a couple years ago, they have like seven pinball machines there.
RVGL's machines are shit.
They don't have anything now.
They have like two machines.
Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.
And I'm not even joking.
I sadly wouldn't doubt that.
Honestly, it really, she has like at least six or seven operational machines and they're free.
At present, I have, and not all of them are mine because unfortunately Dan's friend Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.
So we have a Bride of Pinbot.
We've got, what else do I have?
I have Bride of Pinbot, Judge Dredd, Whodunit, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Guns and Roses, Star Trek The Next Generation.
What the fuck?
What is that?
Xtifer and Nelly are in here because they're waiting for Match Game.
And since we haven't acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.
They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher.
And apparently Xtifer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.
That was Nelly.
Oh, it was Nelly.
But then Xtifer drew this little... It looks like a bone.
But then it drew I heart bunny.
And there's this picture of a bunny there.
I think it's supposed to be a cat.
With a teeny tiny penis.
With a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.
What?
Only X can bring this show to a screeching halt.
Next email!
I was still answering his question.
I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch.
Johnny Mnemonic and Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.
If you want to play, you've got my number.
It won't be creepy if you call.
I have friends at my house.
It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.
DarkSakura owns a gun anyway, so she'll... I own several.
And knives.
And I know how to use them.
And if you think I'm joking, no.
I actually... Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?
Knife-wielding snakes.
No, I asked for a Beretta.
They should have a gun spork.
Any more emails?
Yes!
There's three more.
Um...
Okay.
Hey, OLR.
First, I want to say that I love the podcast.
I hope you guys continue it for a long time.
Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.
I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there that, A, appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower, but not something that would bore them like Roller Coaster Tycoon, B, do not have a frustrating learning curve, C, are $25 American or less.
and Dee do not have a monthly fee such as World of Warcraft.
That about covers it.
Thanks, GamerDad.
I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.
It is over $25.
However, you will not have a registration fee.
Aren't there parental controls available for Guild Wars?
You can censor the dirty language and stuff.
You can censor it out.
Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment.
Considering that I pay $14 a month for World of Warcraft, after four months you've paid for the game, pretty much.
Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.
I would assume that you don't have a Mac.
So I would recommend that you play, I don't know, actually Star Wars Battlefront 2 maybe.
It's a bit old and it might be cheap now.
Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.
That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.
If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, Tetranet.
Tetranet.
Isn't that kind of a violent game?
I know you said the Rollercoaster Tycoon would bore them, but Civilization is a heck of a lot of fun.
I played it when I was 12, the original one.
and use that as your criteria.
Mandarin, you have any suggestions?
I saw one.
Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though that the first episode is $32, each of the following are only $9.
And they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts, which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kids' time on the computer to like, you know, an hour or so.
It'll give them a little bit more play time throughout the whole thing versus other games where it's, you know, takes...
Don't kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, even for kids, boy or girl.
And they do really well.
Shut up.
I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad.
That you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie.
But apparently Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad.
Not bad.
Oh.
Sorry.
I was incorrect about the price, and I'm getting corrected here.
The season is $32, and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying the season.
But again, I said it's still a really good game, and it's kid-friendly.
Or you get GameTap.
You know, also, keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.
You know, I would say, you know, really...
Take those interests and look for things that associate with those interests that are within your price frame and have the criteria.
I mean, now, one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere... Okay, Rob.
Hero, I heart, pussy, Hitler.
There's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this page.
I'm going to pretend I never saw that.
Would you like to confiscate this note?
Frame it.
Hang it on your fridge.
Oh, Amanda needs to see Pussy Hitler.
I'll let Amanda guard it for me.
I'm sorry, Gamer Dad.
I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of thought.
Sorry, Gamer Dad.
Blame Rob.
You and your 13-year-old kids sound pretty cool, but we got Pussy Hitler in studio.
He said both of his sons were 13.
I wonder if they're twins.
Maybe.
So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together, too.
So, from the Rob D.,
I just listened to your April Fool's Day joke, and I gotta say, I'm cracking up like crazy.
I really shouldn't be laughing at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta and Matilda sent me over the edge.
Good idea, and it was pretty funny.
That said, Ms.
Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming, besides Ms.
Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.
She's just an independent woman in an open relationship.
She and Pac-Man have a kid.
Don't you remember the old cartoons?
Well, yeah, they did suck.
I think Goki was a better name.
Ermac.
Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show.
OLR has become a weekly fixture on my iPod, and its space on there is well-deserved.
Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do, and I'll keep on listening.
Smile face.
The rubdy.
Roberta's really glad to hear that you're a big fan.
You sound like Christy Alley.
And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.
I think Loki said it best.
You sounded like Christy Alley.
Let's see.
I didn't have to do a damn thing.
Not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most of the Internet's April Fool's joke this year.
I think we seriously have one of the better ones.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.
We had a great joke.
I think that mine were great.
We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.
So visit dig.com and dig our episode.
By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.
I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.
Right now.
While you're digging in there, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's because they poked fun at MySpace, which was kind of amusing.
Who wants to touch it?
Oh.
This is not a joke.
Who wants to touch it?
Ah, it's the Christmas check finally making its way.
It got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally.
Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account filled up.
Fun, fun, fun.
So...
I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to Kristen for being, like, freaking rad.
Okay, now I'm done.
Being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.
Alright, what?
Alright, yeah, the 8-bit tie was awesome.
I know, I heard they're going to make it for real.
That's awesome.
I want one.
Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?
Alright, chat.orangelonsradio.com if you want to join our chat room.
I gave you the link there to dig where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.
Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.
They didn't have one this year.
Yeah, whatever happened to that?
They did have one.
Rob found the joke, so Rob wins a no prize.
for anyone who is an old... Okay, I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.
Stop, okay.
Extrovert Drew.
We have extrovert Nelly in the room.
Now they can talk and not pass giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.
No, but it says, I heart mangina.
It looks like goat say that he drew on there.
Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and you fools can leave?
All right.
Heart.
All right.
Quick, more video game stories.
This one's about violence.
Everybody likes violence.
Well, let's see.
There was a study recently that was done that looked at 120 children before and after a 20-minute Quake 2 session.
The study was done by Swineburn University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.
And it said that while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending on their emotional state before playing,
The majority of kids were not affected by the game violence at all.
So in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they won't act out on it after they play a video game.
Who would have thought?
Who would have thunk it?
Anyways, well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.
Well, I like violent games, I don't know who wouldn't.
But apparently the Parappa the Rapper creator, he wants less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.
I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but... Anyways, apparently Masaya Matsuura, creator of Parappa the Rapper...
That's all I've got.
That's all I've got.
He was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers and also basically said at the recent Australian GO3 conference, making good games that everybody can play is a very high priority.
I don't know.
It's interesting.
He was saying also that he wants faster TVs because I guess he's talking about the delay between, you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.
More rhythm games.
Who would have thought it?
How about we just get another Parappa sequel?
Oh, I hit myself in the chin.
I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.
More Parappa!
Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.
Well, guess what?
What?
Chicken butt.
Anyway, they have signed up, though, and honestly, I don't really give two shits about the game, because I really don't give two shits about the movie either.
Peter Cullen and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers game.
Now, now, now.
The new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.
Really?
Why all the hate for Transformers?
Because seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.
maybe I'm gonna see it I haven't said I'm not gonna see it I will and I'll reserve my judgment my final judgment for when I see it but right now it doesn't seem right so I don't know but if Starscream is fucking awesome as usual because I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream when I was little so it better if it's cool then I'll go see it it's awesome and they have it I think it's on the internet
Too bad his voice actor's dead.
He was Cobra Commander.
COBRA!
I just want to have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.
I think that would be awesome.
Sorry.
Drink like some Drano and then you'll sound like him.
Alright kids, do you know what time it is?
Ice cream!
No, but almost as good.
It's time to play the match game!
Video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
GS68 Game OLR Orange Lounge Radio
and we'll just take the first person on the line tonight to play match game.
Remember the way match, wouldn't that be funny if no one called?
Remember the way, oh good, we already got a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
It's Zappy.
Zappy, what's on your mind, buddy?
I'm just hoping I don't lose at the match game.
Alright, well you got in first, congratulations, you're going to play a match game with us tonight.
I know I'm not going to get any matches at all.
That's alright, people usually don't here on the match game, but that's alright.
Zappy vs. GS68
Alright, celebrity number one is somebody you haven't really seen on this show a whole lot, but she's back tonight here to match some questions with you.
Say hello to Mandarin!
Hi!
Alright, that was a very somewhat non-sexy hi.
How are you guys doing?
Do you have any clubs or organizations you'd like to plug while you're here?
Charity you're playing for.
Charity, um, get Rob Lane more?
Uh, yeah.
Anyway, also joining us tonight is celebrity number two.
You know him for such films as, what did Orko in chat say?
That was like the best thing ever.
By the way, that's one of my favorite nicknames ever.
He's been in such films as Pussy Hitler and Penis Stalin vs. Mangina.
Say hello to Extifer!
Hello everybody.
And the microphone has been placed in guest number three's boobies!
Wait, wait, what?
Oh, what charity are you playing for, Extifer?
The Boobies of America.
We can't hear, you gotta get... The Boobies of America!
Alright, the Boobies of America.
Alright, um, guest number three tonight is known for her massive cleavage that stores microphones in them.
and also known on this program as The Wife.
Say hello to Nellie.
Hello.
What charity are you playing for tonight, Nellie?
Battered Wives of America.
All right.
Celebrity number four is the often outspoken guest of Orange Lounge Radio.
Say hello to Loki.
Beer batter.
Beer batter.
What the hell?
Show, Loki.
Yeah.
What charity are you playing for tonight?
I guess the Beer Battered Wives of America.
and Deep Fry them.
Celebrity number five is here tonight and celebrity number five is known for... Satan!
Worshipping Satan.
Say hello to DarkSakura.
Souls!
And what charity are you playing for tonight?
Myself.
And celebrity number six needs no introduction.
It's me.
And I'm playing for the...
Oh, do you want me to do it as Roberta?
No, no, no.
Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?
Because we don't like Christy Alley.
All right.
Well, I'm playing... Christy Alley, whatever.
Well, my charity is the Save Fat Actress TV Show Foundation.
That's my charity.
All right, so... Oh, we had a guy on the phone.
Zappy, are you still there, or did you hang up?
Nope, I'm still here.
Hi, Zappy.
So, do you know how the game works?
Yeah.
All right, we're going to be asking you some questions, and you've got to tell us what goes in the blank...
and everybody here in studio.
Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer?
I will try to remember.
Right.
If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.
You ready for your first clue?
Mm-hmm.
All right, here we go.
Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.
You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.
All right, here is question number one.
There's four questions tonight.
Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2 but got a defective controller.
Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.
Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know, I'll make this game more exciting.
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know,
I'll make this game more exciting.
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.
Celebrities are thinking.
And I'm gonna say, ding.
Alright.
Mandarin's thinking.
Mandarin's doing research on Wikipedia.
Alright, Mandarin's...
X4, you good?
I'm good.
Loki, you good?
I'm good.
DarkSakura?
All right, here it is.
I have to make sure our chatter got it, too.
Okay, there we go.
All right, here we go.
Do you have an answer, Zappy, yet?
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
I know.
I'll make this game more exciting.
I'll install five fret buttons on a... Dildo.
Dildo, says Zappy.
I just hope the chatroom doesn't fail me.
Good answer.
All right, there we go.
And GS68 said, Weemote.
So we have Dildo and Weemote.
Let's go around and see who's a match.
Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?
It was a very close.
I said a gigantic horse dildo.
Gigantic horse dildo.
Judges.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
All right, good job.
Zappy, off to a great start.
You matched on the very first one.
All right.
Extifer.
Extifer.
Five fret buttons on A?
I said strand of asshole hair.
Strand of asshole hair.
Wow, okay.
Dirty asshole hair.
I don't know how I got that one.
Do I get that one, judges?
No, unfortunately no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.
All right.
Nelly, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.
The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.
Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.
All right, Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A. You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.
and Dildo, another match for Zappy.
Good job, Zappy.
Two to nothing.
Sorry, GS68.
That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.
DarkSakura.
I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.
There you go.
Dildo, three to nothing.
Ding, ding, ding.
All right.
Wow, Zappy.
You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.
All right.
My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say Dildo because this is my thing.
I said a Pringles can because I like food.
What?
5 red buttons on a Pringles can.
I like that I expanded for this.
Alright.
Did expanded give you that answer?
Yeah.
Alright.
Well, Pringles cans, you know, Pringles suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth some.
Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.
You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.
You ready?
Alright, here we go.
Question number two.
Loki...
Thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this year's E3 event.
When Loki walked through the door, though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when he exclaimed, Wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.
Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3 event.
But when he walked through the door, he realized that Namco had the last laugh.
He exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.
This isn't E3, this is a blank.
The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question.
I'll just have to, like, do charades or something.
I did straight.
All right.
This is an E3.
This is a blank.
DarkSakura needs clarification.
Oh.
Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?
All right.
Yes.
All right.
Do you understand the question, Zappy?
Am I crazy?
No, I completely understand.
All right.
Thank you.
I'm not crazy.
All right.
Ding.
Ding.
Nelly, ding.
Extrovert, ding.
Mandarin, ding.
DarkSakura, ding.
Loki, ding.
All right.
Here we go.
Zappy.
Loki exclaimed, this is an E3, this is a... Porno convention.
A porno convention.
All right, and GS68 said, a gay bar.
All right, so we have porno convention and gay bar.
Mandarin, what did you say?
This is an E3, this is a... I think they both might actually get it, because mine's a combination, a gay orgy.
A gay orgy, not going to work.
I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.
Xtifer, this is an E3, this is... A Frankie Muniz convention.
A Frankie Muniz convention.
Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.
It's almost like a gay bar, but no, it doesn't work.
Nelly, this is an E3, this is a... The funny thing is, is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all-naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife.
DarkSakura,
Orgy of Suck.
An orgy of suck that's almost like a gay bar, but no.
All right.
And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something?
It's like, damn, why is there all these women here?
This sucks.
Where are the games?
All right.
Although maybe I would say that.
My answer, this is an E3.
This is a gay bathhouse.
I don't know.
Is that a match with gay bar?
No.
I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.
Why would they have a Frankie Muniz convention?
Nelly says yes, I say yes.
DarkSakura says no, Loki says no.
Sorry, GS68.
No, Loki said yes.
Gay bathhouse and gay bar, are they the same thing, DarkSakura?
DarkSakura.com
That's true, they do have a pool.
Because with the match game, the person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people choosing for him again.
Only in certain years they did that, and then they didn't do that in a few years.
That's cheating, then.
No, it's not.
You're cheating.
Shut up, Nellie.
Hey, look.
If I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her until she did it.
Rob!
What?
Get in your place.
Answer the thing.
Sorry, Miss Jamie.
Alright, question.
Right.
Watch it all break out the paddle again.
Question number three.
The Robby Goodstick.
Oh, this is a question about Jamie.
This should be good.
Yay!
You ready, Zappy?
Yep.
Three to one.
You feeling the heat a little bit?
I'm not ready.
All right.
Here we go.
While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pinbot machine for sale.
The machine costs $1,000, though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.
Being the ever-clever game collector and negotiator, though, Jamie told the salesman, I really want that pinbot machine.
I would trade you my blank for it.
Where's my music?
I really want that pinbot machine.
I would trade you my blank for it.
All right.
Dang, this one's easy for me.
Uh-oh, did I copy-paste that to GS68?
Oh, never mind, he got it anyway.
I would trade you my blank for it.
Ding.
X-Force said ding.
Ding.
DarkSakura?
All right.
That was quick.
When the question's about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.
All right, I would trade you my blank for it.
Zappy, I would trade you my... Massage table.
Massage Table.
Okay, Massage Table.
That is something very precious to her.
All right, GS68 said... I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.
GS68 said, I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.
Which is great because it'll got me.
Ha ha.
It could be... Well, what about your behind virginity?
Ew, we're not going there, Rob.
How about your behind virginity?
Rob, you just ruined my answer.
Alright, shut up.
Mandarin.
We have virginity and massage table.
I want that pinball machine.
I would trade you my... Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.
Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.
Is that a match with massage table?
That goes with massage services.
I say no.
That's a half a point.
Half a point!
I say no.
The table is what you do it with.
Fine.
Half a point for Zappy.
I'm outvoted.
Half a point.
See, now I have to write half.
Alright, there we go.
Extra fur.
I want that pin on me.
I went for the most obvious.
I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.
It's amazing that DarkSakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.
Frankie Munoz's ass... She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.
A strand of Frankie Munoz's asshole hair in a Pringles can.
You know, that's actually one of my prized treasures.
All right, Nellie, I would trade you a... I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.
B-Imon, all right.
Loki, well, see, I would have matched.
I would have got a point.
Loki, I would trade you my... Well, where would, you know, one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Babies?
Iraqi Suicide Baby, which DarkSakura also happens to own one.
DarkSakura, I would trade you my husband for it.
And my answer was, I really want that pinball machine.
I would trade you my husband for it.
I also said husband, so there it is.
Husband was the answer to go with in that round.
All right.
One more question.
You ready, Zappy?
Yep.
All right.
Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.
Xtifer played the Lord of the Rings online MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?
I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank messages.
Lord of the Rings.
I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
All right, GS68 has an answer.
I'm ding.
How about the other celebrities?
All right, let me read the question again, see if it inspires some folks.
Extover played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?
I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.
This is the best song ever.
Okay, Nelly finally dinged.
Extover?
Sure, ding.
Mandarin, eh, ding.
All right.
We have some very apathetic celebrities.
Last question, though.
Here we go.
Before this segment gets drawn on way too long, as if it hasn't already.
Zappy.
Lord of the Rings.
I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... A slut.
A slut.
Okay.
A slut.
There you go.
GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.
Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.
All right.
Let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.
Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game again unless a creator sent me... Pussy.
Pussy!
Is that a match for slut?
I don't know where you're coming from.
No, because the slut could be male or female.
Alright, Extifer, true story though, you did play the game, right?
Yeah.
And it sucked?
It sucked balls.
What was so bad about it?
Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.
I don't know, I don't like purple balls.
Like, if you're going to suck my balls, be gentle.
Alright, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me my butt virginity back.
Because I'm pretty loose down there.
I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.
Oh, this show sucks.
Shit just falls right out of me.
It's horrible.
I should get a colostomy bag.
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless your creator's chatroom is just exploding with, oh my god, oh god, oh.
That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.
Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.
His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.
A very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly, but unfortunately not a match.
Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creator sent me... I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie Muna's butt hair in a Pringles can.
In a Pringles can, all right.
DarkSakura.
And NakedSweatyManslut.
And NakedSweatyManslut.
I think that's a match with slut.
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
So Zappy, you got another point.
I think Mandarin should get it because pussy is a slut.
No, that doesn't count.
DarkSakura actually used the word slut.
It doesn't matter.
Zappy's still going to win anyway because GS68 would somehow have to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't see happening.
But my answer, just so you know, was...
Frankie Munez as B. Hyman, which was not a match, but probably almost matched Loki's answer.
So Zappy, by a score of 4.5 to 1, you win!
Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.
Yeah, you did pretty good.
That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.
Congratulations.
It's all thanks to the chat room.
Yes, and just think, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.
I feel so special.
Alright, well congratulations.
Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?
Alright.
In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?
Good.
Any other comments you want to give?
Not really.
Alright, well have a good week, Zappy.
Alright, thanks.
And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.
A nice effort from GS68.
And Extifer and Nelly have left.
Thank God.
Normality can come back and resume with the program.
Wow.
Let's get back to some game news.
If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.
They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.
So let's see, I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.
They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original console back from Microsoft.
Faster service, you get it back within five business days, and other enhanced customer care operations.
A new pledge from Xbox to you for your three rings of death.
That's all I have.
Anyways, some other fun stuff.
Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't downloaded it in another territory like I did.
But you get to play three single-player missions and get to check that out.
It's an okay average game.
But hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that anyway, so kind of worth checking out.
It's definitely a lot better than Chromehounds, that is for sure.
So if you're looking for a mech combat game,
There you go.
Why?
Why is it better than Chromehounds?
It's a lot faster.
I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for God's sakes.
Plus, you know, overall it looks good.
Just Chromehounds is very slow.
Just slow in everything.
Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words for snow in Inuit?
No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which makes you go really fast, and then like a quick boost.
Quick Boost.
Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.
The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets.
And then the super boost is just, you know, your typical anime, you know, robot flying over the ocean type thing.
Can you put two explicit tags on a show?
I was just wondering.
What?
You know, rated C for Christopher and N for Nelly.
Yeah, NC-17.
Somebody in chat already made that joke.
Nelly, Christopher, 17.
There you go.
All right.
Skyplane will be open very soon, kids.
Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack.
That's the Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn up mountain, and Trial Point, which is a modern day office complex.
with a background of a busy day, you know, behind a busy city behind it.
You can download it on Live Marketplace.
Actually, it's already up.
It was up there on the 6th.
It's 400 Microsoft points.
So, I'd say give it a try.
Lost Planet's pretty cool.
That is all.
Hey, Rob.
Sorry, I'm just checking the ratings right now.
And we really did lose five listeners during the Match Game segment live.
Yeah.
That was great.
All right.
The Skype line is open.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Now, in seriousness, we usually start to lose a handful of people this late in the show.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Or you can always call us on the Skype line as well.
The username is Orange Lounge Radio.
I want to play something for you guys real, real quick, though, because DMN left us a message, because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play for you guys, because you can leave us voicemails during the week.
Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.
This is DMN.
I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.
I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't, because I got forced to run a Soul Calibur III tournament.
So I killed the guy who didn't do it, and yeah, we're all good.
But I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here.
Hopefully one more from Closing Ceremonies.
Which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.
I want you guys to know how much people love Orange Lounge Radio, even if I force them to be crazy about it.
But yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.
Bye.
So live from SoccerCon, there's DMN.
Apparently there's fans of Orange Launch Radio at Sakuracom.
Sorry we couldn't come.
I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to Sakuracom.
Something happened.
We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out.
So maybe next year.
Let's go to Skyblind in the meanwhile.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Legend of Zaku.
Hi, Legend of Zaku.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Can you put two explicit tags on a podcast, do you think?
Um...
I'm not sure if that would... I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.
Anyways... Right, what's on your mind?
You heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonix is basically trying to give Konami a run for its money.
Right.
Also for the fact that Konami is lazy.
They haven't even shown any real initiative as trying to...
and many more.
Just for the fact that they're announcing that game after Rockman.
So it's like, they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries to release.
Just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.
To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?
I don't think it is.
I mean, at least Konami still has the Japanese market, if not now.
Right, of course.
Of course, they have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that
The way Harmonix managed to get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.
They have commercials for it.
And that and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in right now.
Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.
It was a huge, huge risk.
When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it was.
I know it was, but I mean, as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
So, you have, I mean, that was a damn good risk at best, but it's like, they need a lot more marketing if they want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, just to catch up to Harmonix's, you know...
So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides Karaoke Revolution, which they may not be known for much longer, If they want to push something like Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, they have to get a lot of marketing and a lot of American...
I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.
How could Konami make Beatmania a success in this country?
well they really have to focus on on basically licenses you know pick up like really good licenses you know like you know stuff like you know really good trance and techno and stuff like that and maybe like you know some decent hip-hop or something but yes you have to definitely push you know they have to do some more marketing they have to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost just like they did with DDR
All right.
Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.
We appreciate it.
All right.
Later, buddy.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
Blackboy makes an interesting statement in chat.
He says, I love that because this is a Bomani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because another company improved on something that Bomani pioneered.
I wouldn't say I'm mad.
I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.
It made a great formula even better.
I mean, I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing to take, and it paid off.
So I can't be mad at that.
Hey, it's Ron, what's up everyone?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
An arcade machine right in front of people and people demonstrating it.
Seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks more easy, more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to me one of the reasons why they brought it over.
Yes, the other machines, the other franchises are risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is just like, you know what, hey, we did our thing.
Let's just call it a night.
Let's work on other stuff.
So you're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off
trying to Americanize guitar freaks in Germany.
I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods, the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming out with.
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.
I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?
I mean...
They probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX or maybe Guitar Freaks or something like that.
By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple sources and contacts that I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as far as the home version went.
So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem to be, like, that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Ranma, that, you know, even though they could go for it, they're not choosing to.
I don't know.
Exactly.
I mean, with the much money they've made off the B-Mani games, for them to bring over B-Mani, it wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?
FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.
Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis' problem, is to think that arcades are relevant enough to give a fuck.
Arcades are dead in the US, that's why they don't give a fuck.
Interesting point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar Hero and this Rock Band game would be made for a console on the outset.
Kind of interesting.
Yeah, exactly, because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men.
It was a Konami game, and now, nowadays, the only place you can find a half-decent arcade if you're in a big town where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little podunk corner place, you know?
It's sad.
I really hope arcades have a resurgence.
I really do.
I miss them.
Exactly.
I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.
Any other thoughts, Ranma?
That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.
Sure, why not?
Okay, this is really dirty.
Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.
How much worse can we get?
Go for it.
Okay, what does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?
What?
A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.
Bye Ranma, thanks for the call.
Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hey guys, how you doing?
This is Bandit.
Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?
Hey, what you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever be popular in this country.
Why is that?
I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, I mean, if you look at that game...
What the other couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now.
I mean, that game takes too much time to learn and things like that.
I mean, way too much dedication.
The casual gamer is not going to just walk into a place throwing 50 cents and just
Be great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?
But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard, too?
I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of dumbed-down modes, which Beatmania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place, because when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing Beatmania down.
But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?
Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.
I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.
I mean, you can see, I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.
Damn, I played, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?
Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.
That sounds hard.
I'm trying to think if Buckethead does that one.
Huh.
Well, anything else?
No, that's it for now.
And anything non-music?
Because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.
Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?
Right now, I mean, I picked up a... I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.
I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but I just haven't made that leap.
So I picked up God of War about a month ago.
I picked up God of War 2 when it came out.
Played through both of them.
They're really good.
I would definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet.
I mean, it's been maybe a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.
I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.
Well, there's that and Devil May Cry Collection.
It's like all three games for like $29.
Nice.
Definitely get that too.
Just might.
All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.
All right, bye guys.
All right, take care.
One more call.
What do you say?
One more.
You guys okay?
You guys doing all right?
Yes!
Sorry, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.
Alright, let's do one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio, who's this?
Hey guys, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?
Uh, this whole damn argument is, like, pissing me off now.
Why?
Alright, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different things at the same time, they're the same thing.
First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level.
And I've done this, I've proven this by actually trying the game the other day.
Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four.
Guitar Hero actually passed me by missing half the damn song.
That's the first thing I've seen the difference.
Well, hold on, though, because doesn't the arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?
Stop breathing into the mic, please.
Yeah, careful.
You're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.
Sorry.
That's all right.
But, yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the arcade difficulty setting?
Yes, but most arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.
I don't really know too many arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right there, you know?
That's my first thought.
And then the second thought is also the song list.
And people keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freak's song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and very few American stuff that people recognize.
While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada yada yada, I can play this.
True, very true.
Something I've said kind of distinguishes the games that make Guitar Hero more successful here, yeah?
Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that both the difficulty level and the song list.
You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games.
I mean, you have DDR in your nickname.
What do you think of Rock Band?
Is it something you're going to check out?
I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't have much of an idea what it was about.
Real quickly, imagine, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?
Well, imagine doing that online.
Take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.
So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
But on the internet.
Hmm.
and Guitar Hero type songs.
That wouldn't be so bad, actually, because one thing people keep forgetting is that no game has actually included a karaoke type thing.
So that would actually make it different at the same time.
That's true.
Because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time.
Okay, now we have drums, guitars, and singers.
That's
It could be interesting.
We'll see.
Well, I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Thanks for the perspective.
Hey, thanks, man.
No problem.
Later.
Later.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
Thanks to those that called in.
If you didn't get through, though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every week?
GameSpot
about a keyboard controller attachment that they're going to be coming out.
And it looks very legit coming from them.
And I do remember seeing like a patent or some sort of picture a while back.
And I believe Gamers Reports were also saying that they ran a story months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.
So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely.
Okay.
And that would kind of tie into that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.
Let's see, other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit, that Drawn to Life.
It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet.
And it looks a little bit like, what was it, that...
Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that.
But you actually doodle stuff onto your DS and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.
So that's kind of neat.
I'm looking forward to that.
And they're also making a Worms 2 apparently.
Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP.
And apparently it's Triple Triad, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.
I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy IX.
But interesting nonetheless, I guess.
Then there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison trying to auction off PS3 at a rock concert.
Apparently he failed, and it was funny.
One dollar!
Area 51 is being made into a Hollywood movie.
Don't care.
The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be kind of an on-rails shooter game, or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.
So that's kind of neat.
Hopefully that'll come out soon.
Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.
Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there in the market, though, so it should be interesting.
And that's it.
All right.
I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat, and I cannot pronounce.
Is this supposed to be like lead speak for Havoc 1792?
I think that's what it is, H4V0C.
I think it's Havoc.
Havoc1792, EliteSpeak, sent me this article on Achieve360Points.com that shows the Halo 2 achievements because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite so it has achievements there.
And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well if you were playing the backwards compatibility eventually.
Well, it looks like, you know, the basics are
You get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of the single player game you go through.
Then you get some other achievement points if you, you know, actually beat the game.
And then, of course, there's your various multiplayer points.
Steal an occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running riot, all that stuff.
But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.
There's a Ninja achievement.
And then there's also a legend achievement, and that's what you get when you complete the game on legendary difficulty.
But here's the thing that I think is cool.
Not those achievements, but the fact that then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.
One is called Flaming Ninja.
Kill somebody that has the ninja achievement.
And then the other one is Hired Gun.
Kill someone who has the legend achievement, because you know those types of players are going to be really good.
So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements.
That's kind of neat.
Yeah.
That's better than those viral ones.
What was that one?
I want to say it was a game I just recently played.
Not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.
Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the virus achievement.
It's even called a viral achievement or something.
It's not worth any points, but that's the only way you can get it is by playing with somebody who has the achievement.
It's kind of weird.
I think that's kind of neat.
Good job to whoever thought up those achievements on Halo 2.
Anything for you, Jamie?
For me?
I don't play the... My last minute news in general.
Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.
No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.
No.
I don't have anything.
We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.
I think that would be fun.
Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck, I suck.
So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship.
I'm actually decent with a lot of games.
In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle.
The sniper rifles in Grand Theft Auto suck balls.
I don't know.
It'd be pretty fun.
I suck at Halo 2.
In fact, I think I've only played it once.
No, I haven't played Halo 2.
I've only played Halo 1 once.
That'd be fun.
DDRDollarBill says, I suck at Halo.
I can't even get one kill.
Actdeft says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.
We'll see.
I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest.
That would be fun.
We should make a clan.
Suck at Halo clan.
There is an OL Army Halo clan, supposedly.
I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually play Halo.
So, there you go.
Alright, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program.
So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Mandarin, thank you so much for being here.
I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing match game with us and bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.
Oh, you're welcome.
I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.
So you will come back?
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
Sounds like fun.
After he moves up here and gets settled in, we'll have to take a day off and he'll have to come up and... Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.
If he can get out of work.
Hmm.
Take a day off.
We're worth it.
No, I'm kidding.
All right.
Oh, your final thought.
It was fun.
I know I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but it was still a lot of fun.
That's all right.
We get a lot of guests that do that.
Christopher was kind of... Mika's been on the show like 40 times.
He never says a damn thing when he's here.
All right.
It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing.
Yeah, but you like it.
You like the kink.
You know it.
Eh.
All right.
You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Loki, your final thought.
I want to play Earth... Why is it... Explain this to me.
Why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation 2 looks more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?
That's what I want to know.
Because it looks like they have a lot more complex enemies in there, some stuff that could have been from War of the Worlds or something.
Why...
What's up with that?
Exactly, what's up with that shit?
I need to get my PS2 back from my sister because I think they've played Driver 3 long enough.
Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?
Deadpool.
Alright, and my final thought tonight?
That was my final thought for tonight.
Did you enjoy that final thought, DarkSakura?
and even Orgy now.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
