6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,920
This is episode number 227 for April the 8th of 2007.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,820
We tape live every Sunday night over on orangeloungeradio.com.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,120
We have a chat room full of people listening to us right now.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,440
Hi chat room!

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,160
And we'll invite some phone calls later on during the show.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
1-877-GAME-OLR.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,480
We'll open the Skype line a little later.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,800
Also in part A, we tease that we're going to be playing match game tonight and we want

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
to congratulate GS68 for being one of our two contestants for match game.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,240
He will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
on in the program.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,620
We'll tell you when to call.

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,720
But in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,640
Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
And everyone is all excited about it.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,140
It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:20,000
And this is the brand new EA harmonics kind of co-game there.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Basically this thing is going to be kind of you get drums as well as bass and lead guitars

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,080
and you're also going to have singing.

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:35,080
So think Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero mixed with Drummania mixed with Karaoke Revolution.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,960
And that's basically the game.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,080
And apparently they're going to be using this not only to have some fun games and stuff,

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,860
but they're also going to make it almost like the next MTV, whereas they're going to launch

30
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,040
music this way.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,440
And I don't know, it just seems like it's a big bunch of nothing to be honest.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,000
I think that this is going to, it's just going to be the next fad.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's just like...

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Wow, Debbie Downer, what's your problem with this game?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
Well, I think it's going to be the next big fad.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,960
I mean, it's just like Guitar Hero is big right now.

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,280
I mean, Dance Dance Revolution was big a few years ago.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,840
And once this comes out, everyone's going to be all, oh, it's awesome.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
But you know what?

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,860
Is there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
of it?

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,760
Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,140
involved with it, according to some rumors.

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,900
But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,680
is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,800
And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,920
This is so innovative.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,800
So innovative.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,920
It's not innovative at all.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,760
Well, to an extent though, if they do make it playable over the internet, and you know,

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,120
you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,720
Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
ass.

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
The keyboard was pretty good.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
I have to say that.

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,160
But the drum controller for home?

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Not that hot.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Guitar controller for home?

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Not that hot.

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,680
The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,720
But you can never really have that experience at home.

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,120
From what I understand, you can session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, but again, the song

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,440
list is not that great for those games.

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
It's no Sweet Child of Mine by Guns N' Roses.

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,840
So you know, adding this whole karaoke thing into it seems like a natural progression,

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,480
especially for harmonics.

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,080
I think to some extent it could be.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,160
I mean, I do agree it's just going to be a fad, but I think it kind of takes it one step

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,320
up from the Sing Stars and the Guitar Heroes of the world because now, for those people

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,160
that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
I don't want to sing.

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,320
I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing is fucking Konami

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
wake up.

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Where the fuck have you been?

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,360
You've missed a train and the next train and the next train as far as music games go.

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,920
You're letting these people, I mean, you have the whole market cornered for this stuff and

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,680
now you're just kind of letting it slip away.

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't know what they're thinking.

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
What's the big deal?

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
I mean, they really should have, when Guitar Freaks or Guitar Heroes-

83
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that where your bitterness comes from, that you're just more mad that Konami didn't take

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
the opportunity with this?

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm mad that they're going to call this original.

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,200
That's what I'm mad about because, and I blame a lot of bad press about it because there's

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,760
stupid press outlets that will not know of the Japanese games and they're just going

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
to pretend this is the first-

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,720
Maybe it's because the Japanese games didn't resonate here like these games do and it's

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
all about the song list.

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
I mean, as much as you and I and her and her might like the Japanese songs-

92
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
It doesn't matter if it's a song list though.

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
I mean, you can take a game that has a crappy ass song list, like one of the DDRs or something

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,760
like that, and still when In the Groove comes out, you can't say that that's original.

95
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
So it doesn't matter.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,460
If it's been done before, it's not original.

97
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
I don't care.

98
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,040
If they want to improve on it, great.

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
That's awesome if they want to improve on it.

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
But it's not fucking original.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,440
If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,440
to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,920
GS68 says Konami wailed on In the Groove and pump it up but is pretending Guitar Hero doesn't

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
exist.

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,880
That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In the Groove should have done to DDR

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,760
and that is completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,640
of Guitar Freaks.

108
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,600
The only similarities between the games is they both have guitar controllers in their

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
rhythm games.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,680
Otherwise they gave it the more amplitude look.

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,360
They gave it characters and charisma and songs that we all knew.

112
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,840
Guitar Hero, for me, hella improved on Guitar Freaks.

113
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,640
I still have a soft spot in my heart for Guitar Freaks once in a while.

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,320
How many fucking versions of Guitar Freaks are out there?

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Over twelve now.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Eleventy billion.

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,480
Fourteen I think is what they're up to now.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,920
It's the same fucking game.

119
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
The tracks aren't that great.

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,280
Which is what Guitar Hero is going to turn into.

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes, it is going to turn into this.

122
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,620
I like the harmonics now.

123
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,560
This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, never soft.

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
You can have Guitar Hero.

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye.

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
We're going to go work on something bigger and better.

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
That's smart harmonics to me.

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I think so.

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,180
I'm curious to see what it's going to become, but here's my thing.

130
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,120
People bitch about having to buy $600 systems and stuff.

131
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,160
Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,400
leaked out there from GameStop, they were saying that they were starting to do preorders

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,480
on stuff because they'll preorder games that don't exist yet.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
like that.

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,960
You're spending $200 on a fucking game.

137
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,320
That's a little much for me, I would think.

138
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,680
People are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.

139
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Why not?

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah, but still though, they drop another just for one game.

141
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
I guess she's going to get them all anyway.

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
You're a peripheral whore, but I want to ask you, this is very interesting, and I think

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue, because you guys have to realize, six

145
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,400
years ago, Flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,040
on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks, literally the three of us were playing this

147
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
band thing.

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Insert random other person on the guitar.

149
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
We were kind of doing this a long time ago.

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
We had a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,480
Now, nobody looked at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us

152
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
on the machine.

153
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,560
He doesn't seem to care for it, because it's not original.

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm a little disappointed though, that he just didn't fully rip it off and do a keyboard

156
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.

157
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,680
And I generally kind of like the idea, because, you know, well, Guitar Freaks, what do you

158
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
think, Dark Soccer?

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,320
Um, I honestly, I think it's going to be fun, because it's the closest we're going to get

160
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,000
in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
of, you know, bullshit.

162
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,600
But it's the closest we're going to get over here, it'll make it, you know, I think it'll

163
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
really catch on.

164
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,760
I think that it's going to be a big thing.

165
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,000
You know, I am a little disappointed though, in Konami, just a little bit, because they

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,440
used to be so edgy with like, you know, DDR, and then karaoke revolution, no one had even

167
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,040
thought about doing something like that, or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out

168
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,240
there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,360
And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh games.

170
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,240
I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom, just like

171
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside, you know, come out with the next

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,560
big thing, you know.

173
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,040
I think the other killer about this though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that

174
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,560
money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the

175
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,960
original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DDR, well, some

176
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,280
DDR, some karaoke revolution.

177
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,080
I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
good.

179
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
They're solid.

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and despite the fact that I may

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,040
not like most of their sports games, but, you know, I'm not a sports game fan.

182
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,080
But still though, you've got, you know, they have the money to make this game good, and

183
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,040
you know, you've got Harmonix, they know how to make music games, and then back that with

184
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,480
MTV, now that, since they own Harmonix, it's going to be, it's going to be huge.

185
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,320
That's, you know, no doubt about it.

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
I just hope it's diverse.

187
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Yeah.

188
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,520
You know, I don't want to play all these emo bands, you know, one emo song once in a while

189
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,380
is kind of fun, you know, I wouldn't mind doing, hey, me today, and I wouldn't mind a little

190
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,320
bit of that emo, but, you know, I don't want a whole game full of that.

191
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,520
I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some, you know, new

192
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,600
classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today, you know, I kind of hope they find a balance, and we'll

193
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
see them.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it, because that was...

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
There should be a keyboard, though.

196
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,480
I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but, you know, I understand why it's not there,

197
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,280
but it doesn't make me any less sad.

198
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Well...

199
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,400
You know what I want to know, this is real, you know, kind of stupid, but, you're going

200
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,600
to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going

201
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,320
to be USB on, like, the 360, they're lacking one USB port for that, that's gonna be a problem.

202
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
They need a...

203
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Wireless mic?

204
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't know.

205
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Nothing...

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,200
All right, I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Ah, whatever.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,640
Well, I think this is kind of cool.

209
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:54,320
During the conference for Rock Band, the harmonic CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,660
that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.

211
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,080
It was actually specified, he said it without hesitation.

212
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,780
He's quoted saying, we will, at some time, bring Rock Band to every important platform,

213
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,640
and harmonics would be tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms,

214
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,320
and he likes the Wiimote.

215
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,000
Hmm, well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,440
platform, except playing online is going to suck, because Nintendo will make you put in

217
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Franco's little crap.

218
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,880
And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks

219
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,640
or something like that, it will never work.

220
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,280
Just make new peripherals.

221
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,720
They could do a Taiko no Tatujin on Wii.

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
Or it would be better, is if they made the peripherals universal, where they'll work

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,840
for the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

224
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
That would be pretty cool.

225
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
You know they're not.

226
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
They could.

227
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,240
If it's USB, that would be no problem.

228
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I don't know.

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,880
All right, well, moving on, going back to Konami for a little bit, maybe this is where

230
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,680
their music game franchise is headed, is BeatMania 2DX, trying to relaunch that, I guess, well,

231
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,320
I don't know, so much relaunch, but trying to get that off the ground in arcades in the

232
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
US.

233
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,560
You might remember there was a home version of BeatMania that came out a couple years

234
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
ago.

235
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,680
And of course, everybody compared it to Guitar Hero, which is so wrong, because BeatMania

236
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,840
was out many years before, and that's why Loki's so mad.

237
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,960
But what should be interesting to note is that, remember there were location tests recently

238
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,280
for 2DX Gold in America?

239
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,960
Well, according to this user on bamanistyle.com, Brazzoliange, I probably mispronounced that

240
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,720
horribly, sorry, this guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there,

241
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,840
and she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it, and

242
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,960
that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations, but they're

243
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,940
having problems finding a distributor right now in the US and has not seen an easy way

244
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,880
to import them.

245
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,280
They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.

246
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,520
Autonomy or Betson is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September,

247
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,080
and this lady, I guess, is looking into that.

248
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,160
So Dave & Buster's, they want to buy 2DX Gold, they're glad to see there is a client base,

249
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,440
and they're looking into purchasing machines.

250
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,840
If you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support, all the information

251
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,280
is over there at bamanistyle.com.

252
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
But pretty interesting.

253
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,460
It'll be interesting if that game finally took off here, but I don't know, it's a bit

254
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,520
of a novelty.

255
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,800
I love B-Mania 2DX, but I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has

256
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,480
unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.

257
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,900
Put in anything Timbaland produced in there, or mix it with some new techno, like Faster

258
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,360
Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff, and trance

259
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,940
and dance, and it'll be huge!

260
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,720
They don't know, that would never work, and what they need to do is they need to reinvent

261
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
the whole damn franchise for the US, if they're going to do that.

262
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,400
They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing, instead of just having

263
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
keys and stuff.

264
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,320
Actually, you just have turntables, a mixer, and stuff like that, more like Kraken DJ,

265
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,120
or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.

266
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Easy to DJ though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot

267
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,480
of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with Beatmania 2DX or something

268
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
like that.

269
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,320
They just need to make it, because right now people, when they see that, they're all,

270
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,680
well that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer

271
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,080
to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.

272
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Kraken DJ!

273
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Kraken DJ is a good example.

274
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,640
But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast, maybe it was just because the songs in there were

275
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,440
not recognizable at all, but I don't know, something about 2DX kept me on.

276
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,640
They had a great, even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,

277
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,540
at least the Konami produced originals have been very good, although I do think the quality

278
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,520
has been slipping ever since like 10th.

279
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,480
But I don't know, that's just me.

280
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm a jaded old man, Bimani player, what do I know?

281
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Got the old part right.

282
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I mean, hi Rob.

283
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,200
Excuse me, what year were you born and what year was I born?

284
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,120
What thing am I holding up?

285
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Rob.

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,280
Alright, that's more years than that that separate us, but...

287
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Rob, Rob, Rob.

288
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
My birthday is in two weeks.

289
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Really?

290
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.

291
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Yes we are.

292
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Yay!

293
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Rockin' Space Mountain.

294
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Hell yeah!

295
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,720
We're back in time for the show, hopefully, otherwise we're doing it live from I-5.

296
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
Uh, hi, this is me and I'm driving.

297
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,680
God damn it!

298
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Fucking SUV!

299
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,080
God damn it!

300
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.

301
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
God damn it, motherfuckers!

302
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,760
That will be me, won't it?

303
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,120
So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the

304
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:55,200
PlayStation 3 20GB system, that's skewed at least, well Sony style is no longer carrying

305
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,560
the 20GB system and that's kind of interesting and that kind of further backs up what everybody

306
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,040
else either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done

307
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,520
with it or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling, the 20GB at least

308
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,300
is not selling and I know for a lot of retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore

309
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:23,120
so I don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20GB system,

310
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,360
probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,760
but I think they're done with the 20GB system, it's my opinion.

312
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,520
And actually, I think, while I was trying to read here, Joystiq, I believe, contacted

313
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,560
Sony style and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month and they said

314
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,160
they're not getting any more, you could go out and find one though.

315
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,800
Has anyone checked the Metreon store?

316
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,880
I don't know, but I know my 20GB is awesome so you don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit,

317
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,360
that's just, just plug it in, plug the damn thing in.

318
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,080
Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play and then I'll talk hardware.

319
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,960
Exactly.

320
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:21,600
Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they

321
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,880
actually are both not coming out in May as we have been told.

322
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,560
They still have a 2007 release but Sony isn't really saying much about it so we'll just,

323
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,680
I guess, keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.

324
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Probably summer.

325
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,040
I don't think they have anything else coming out, I mean Lair, Heavenly Sword, I don't

326
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,520
think they have anything really, well I guess Warhawk, oooh, Warhawk, that's gonna be awesome.

327
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Ohjoyandrapture.com.

328
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,780
Let's see, let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking

329
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,680
waited until 2008 to launch the system.

330
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Write that up there on the board, alright, there we go.

331
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Now we have, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.

332
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,000
But one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam, you know, sometimes

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,240
a lot of people give this system a lot of crap, but the PSP is still chugging along

334
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
and now it's chugging along at a lower price, that's been people's number one bitch about

335
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,860
the system, well now the core system is only $169.99, that is a drop from the $199.00.

336
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,980
Keep in mind though that the core only comes with, I believe, what, the unit, the charger,

337
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
and that's it.

338
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,160
It doesn't come with any games, it doesn't come with shit.

339
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah, but if you're gonna buy the Entertainment Pack or something like that, those have also

340
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,900
dropped down 30 bucks as well, so.

341
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,160
Keep in mind though, the cool thing about the PSP versus the DS is that, you know, you

342
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
can get online with it right out of the box, you can visit OLRPSP.com with it right out

343
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,720
of the box and download your favoritest podcast in the world, oh, you need a memory stick

344
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
though.

345
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm just kidding.

346
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
Touche.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,160
Anyways, other things coming to the PSP, at least if you're in Japan, they're getting

348
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:23,880
a voice over IP service being made by Jaja, and apparently it's not exactly easy to use,

349
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:32,440
you actually have to log into Jaja's mobile link using your PSP web browser and via its

350
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:40,200
Wi-Fi connection, and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking

351
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,680
with phones and stuff like that, not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.

352
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,800
Unfortunately there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.

353
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,760
So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?

354
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,240
I don't know, probably a while.

355
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,640
But yeah, there's a YouTube video out there, so if you want to see it in action, you can

356
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:09,160
do that, but of course if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.

357
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,920
All right.

358
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
You know what?

359
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
What?

360
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I think we should all just move anyway.

361
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Just move?

362
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Yeah, why not?

363
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Make our own country.

364
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,180
What brought that on?

365
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,400
And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any

366
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
games.

367
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Yay!

368
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Games more expensive!

369
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Awesome!

370
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,280
Anyway, there's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final

371
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,240
Fantasy 13 available on the PlayStation 3 network.

372
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this

373
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,880
spring thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year the honor

374
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
will go to the PlayStation Network.

375
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.

376
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
That'd be funny.

377
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,280
Well, it's still floating about the rumor mill, so.

378
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,720
Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing though.

379
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,800
Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?

380
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Right.

381
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
That would be something else.

382
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,920
It might hit Japan Store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.

383
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,680
Not necessarily.

384
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,640
Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the US,

385
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
right?

386
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Yeah.

387
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
There's that and there's ways.

388
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,760
Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.

389
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,720
Yeah, but then all the text is in Japanese.

390
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Who cares?

391
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
It doesn't matter.

392
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,460
Alright, well another who cares for me, you know, we've been talking a lot this episode

393
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,600
about Guitar Hero and Hands On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar

394
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,980
Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.

395
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,880
You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar

396
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,760
Hero on a cell phone because you know it's gonna suck.

397
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,460
I mean, I'm sorry, but you know, rhythm game, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks, so why

398
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,300
would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?

399
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
People should stop gaming on cell phones.

400
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey, I play Lumines.

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah, Lumines is okay.

402
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,560
Tell that to fucking Nvidia, or not Nvidia, Nokia.

403
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Nokia.

404
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, Nokia.

405
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,720
The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.

406
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,760
That's it.

407
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
We don't need anything else.

408
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,720
You know what cell phone game is pretty awesome?

409
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,760
It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive instead of trying to play your stupid

410
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
mobile games at red lights.

411
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,280
Anyways, Apply Makeup The Game.

412
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
That's horrible.

413
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,480
Actually, I think they do have a game like that too.

414
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Do they really?

415
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Like Barbie?

416
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Barbie cell phone game?

417
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
I've actually seen women driving down the road, they're like putting makeup on, like

418
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,960
I've totally seen this in traffic, like lipstick on the rear view mirror, it's like DRIVE!

419
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,840
Yeah, anyways, you have a little bit of makeup, it's not going to transform you from, you

420
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,840
know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen, so.

421
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,560
Anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little

422
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
bit.

423
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:16,320
There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, Jon

424
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,880
Tam, who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.

425
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,880
I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy

426
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,080
that you got, I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of

427
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,320
the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Lawns YouTube, if you look up our

428
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,400
account, you can see this guy that got the smack down here.

429
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:42,680
Anyways, settlement has been reached, they are no longer able to, there was some interesting

430
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,960
stuff around this, because it didn't make any sense to me a little bit, because they

431
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,920
said that they were doing a demo of a game that was based off of Step Mania and Guitar

432
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Hero.

433
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,120
It says a demo incorporating elements of Guitar Hero and Step Mania.

434
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,000
I thought Step Mania is not a game, wouldn't that be in the groove that they're talking

435
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
about?

436
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,720
I don't know, whatever, the groove is basically Step Mania anyway.

437
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,600
Another part of the introduction, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer

438
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,960
based games for the next year, nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero

439
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,360
2 until six months after the game's release, and some other stuff like that.

440
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,120
So, that kind of sucks, oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos

441
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,040
for a while.

442
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,880
This is what you get when you break those NDAs.

443
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,400
Alright, well then you won't be breaking any NDAs, right Loki?

444
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Nope.

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Alright.

446
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I don't break NDAs.

447
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
That's right.

448
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,700
Alright, well, one thing we like to break open every week here on Orange Launch Radio

449
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,920
is the mailbag, and Dark Soccer likes to jump into the mailbag and pull out some of our

450
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,080
favorite emails to read for you right here on the program.

451
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,600
If you want to email us, it's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

452
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Dark Soccer!

453
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
What?

454
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Who sent us Anthrax this week?

455
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
My mother.

456
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,480
Look how evil of her, okay.

457
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,880
First email, hi, it's Zaid from London again.

458
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,360
I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii edition.

459
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,520
I was reading about it on the net, and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.

460
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,840
Also I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any

461
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,640
idea if us Brits will get that too?

462
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?

463
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,320
Always have a good one, Zaid Mohammed.

464
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
And last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.

465
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I hope this one is better.

466
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

467
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,480
Don't even bother.

468
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,700
Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where Dark Soccer is admitting

469
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
she's a bitch?

470
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
No, I'm proud.

471
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Heart.

472
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Hey, Rob.

473
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
What?

474
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Broken heart.

475
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
No.

476
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
No.

477
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
No.

478
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Resident Evil 4 on the Wii.

479
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Yes, it's happening.

480
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,040
We don't know much, but we talked about it in part A, right?

481
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,960
So go download part A. As far as DVD playback on the Wii, well, I think that's been announced

482
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,020
previously.

483
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,600
How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?

484
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,840
Hooray.

485
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,760
That could be the 10th DVD player in my house.

486
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,320
But for the little kid with a Wii in his bedroom, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.

487
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,440
Yes, Loki.

488
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,700
Gateway to porn.

489
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
That's what it is.

490
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Gateway to porn.

491
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,800
Now that can play all the porn DVDs.

492
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,920
So let's gateway the porn.

493
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Hooray.

494
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,980
All right.

495
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,040
Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?

496
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,600
Eventually, I'm sure.

497
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,160
Yes, but six months later than us.

498
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,640
Because Nintendo hates you.

499
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,120
Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.

500
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Anyway, next email please, Rob.

501
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,800
I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.

502
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
I feel sorry for you guys.

503
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Something to do with the revolutionary war.

504
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.

505
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,680
We'll figure something out.

506
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,640
We got an email from Ron says don't call him cute.

507
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
We call Ron?

508
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
I don't remember him calling.

509
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
He was the young one.

510
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Aw, the cute little kid that emailed us.

511
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,000
Next email from AZHP.

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,080
Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast

513
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,560
waiting for my vector calculus class to start and Rob started playing blow my whistle, I

514
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,080
inadvertently began bobbing my head and before I knew it, I was break dancing outside the

515
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,280
classroom and then the music stopped.

516
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
I was sad.

517
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Sad face.

518
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,200
But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2 and for that, I wanted

519
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,800
to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.

520
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,400
We lived to confuse.

521
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,560
That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little

522
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,680
bit of it, it makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.

523
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,360
You know, Rob, camstorm.

524
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,640
You have to have the, you know.

525
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Aw, but I do, I do, I do.

526
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,840
That song was horrible.

527
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Next email.

528
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Alright, yes.

529
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,360
Dear LLR crew, first of all, congratulations to Dark Sakura for graduating and getting

530
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
certified EROC.

531
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
I know.

532
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Thank you.

533
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Finally, someone else says it.

534
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,320
Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program

535
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,040
is produced.

536
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.

537
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,480
I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.

538
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,440
Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?

539
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Yeah.

540
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,880
Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner,

541
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,160
but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland so we could go.

542
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Yeah, it was.

543
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
More.

544
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
What the, why?

545
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Email.

546
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Why hasn't he come on the show?

547
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Email.

548
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Alright.

549
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Maybe he'll answer that question.

550
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Alright, fine.

551
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,640
It seems that I've recently begun to crave pinball mildly.

552
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,800
Oh, you are so in luck.

553
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,440
And while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate

554
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,560
a proper table with flippers and steel balls and lanes and bumpers and popular culture

555
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,120
tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands

556
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,180
that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.

557
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,760
It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate and so

558
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,840
I put the question to you.

559
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,860
Where might I find good local pinball?

560
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Not at RBGL.

561
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Shit.

562
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,640
Oh, there's a PS on here.

563
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,240
My profound thanks, Warrior Bob.

564
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,160
PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's

565
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,560
house, but I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking

566
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
creepy.

567
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,640
PPS, Byron promised me pinball once that they were liars, because Byron is a piece of crap.

568
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,080
Scandia had a bunch of machines.

569
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,520
I haven't been there in a long time, though.

570
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Madison and I-80.

571
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,240
Have you seen the weird thing that they've gotten up and down?

572
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,280
Their new little, like, we're going to throw you up in the air thing, that ride they have,

573
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,480
that thing is scary looking.

574
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,480
As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.

575
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,560
What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.

576
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,800
Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my God, Scandia

577
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,520
has got this new ride called the motherfucking eyesore.

578
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
The piece of shit.

579
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.

580
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
It's called the pooflinger.

581
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I thought, like, for example- Hey, email, right?

582
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
No.

583
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,400
Yes, but I want to say real quick, the last time I went to Scandia, which

584
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,840
granted was a couple years ago, they had, like, seven pinball machines there.

585
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,160
RVGL's machines are shit.

586
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
They don't have anything now.

587
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
They have, like, two machines.

588
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,460
Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.

589
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
And I'm not even joking.

590
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,000
I sadly wouldn't doubt that.

591
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,240
Honestly, it really- she has, like, at least six or seven operational machines, and they're

592
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
free.

593
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,760
At present, I have- and not all of them are mine, because, unfortunately, Dan's friend

594
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.

595
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,040
So we have a bride of pinbot.

596
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,920
We've got, um- what else do I have here?

597
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,360
We have bride of pinbot, judge dread, whodunnit, rocky and bullwinkle, guns and roses, um...

598
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Star Trek The Next Generation.

599
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
What the fuck?

600
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
What is that?

601
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Sorry.

602
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,880
Extrofer and Nellie are in here because they're waiting for match game, and since we haven't

603
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,280
acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.

604
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,080
They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher, and apparently

605
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,840
Extrofer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.

606
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
That was Nellie.

607
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Oh, that was Nellie.

608
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
That's what Extrofer drew with this little-

609
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
It was like a bone.

610
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,500
But then it drew, I heart bunny, and there's this picture of a bunny there-

611
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,800
I think it's supposed to be a cat.

612
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,240
With a teeny tiny penis, with a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.

613
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,120
So, I heart teeny tiny bunny penis.

614
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,960
Only Extrofer can bring this show to a screeching halt.

615
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Anyway- Next email!

616
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Hey, I was still answering his question.

617
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Oh, sorry.

618
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,120
Um, yeah, and I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch, Johnny Mnemonic, and Creature

619
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
from the Black Lagoon.

620
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,020
So, honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.

621
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,680
If you want to play, you've got my number.

622
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
It won't be creepy if you call.

623
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,040
I have friends at my house.

624
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,540
It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.

625
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,880
Dark Soccer owns a gun anyway, so she'll- I own several.

626
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
And knives.

627
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Several good knives.

628
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,040
And I know how to use them.

629
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
And guns to turn into knives.

630
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
And if you think I'm joking, no.

631
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Gun knives.

632
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,440
Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?

633
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
slave-wielding snakes.

634
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,160
No, I asked for a Beretta.

635
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,200
They should have a gun spork.

636
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Any more emails?

637
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Yes!

638
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
There's three more.

639
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Um.

640
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay.

641
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Hey, OLR.

642
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Hey.

643
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:33,640
First, I want to say that I love the podcast, hope you guys continue it for a long time.

644
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,480
Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.

645
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,120
I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there

646
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
yet.

647
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,200
A. Appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower but not something that would

648
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,520
bore them like RollerCoaster Tycoon B. Do not have a frustrating learning curve

649
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,840
C. Are $25 American or less B. And D. Do not have a monthly fee such as

650
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,000
World of Warcrack.

651
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That about covers it.

652
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Thanks, GamerDad.

653
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,320
I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.

654
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:15,160
It is over $25, however, you will not have a registration fee, and aren't there parental

655
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,040
controls available for Guild Wars?

656
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,560
You can censor the dirty language.

657
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,240
You can censor it out.

658
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,680
Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment, considering

659
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,920
that I paid $14 a month for World of Warcraft.

660
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,600
After four months, you've paid for the game, pretty much.

661
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,880
Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.

662
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I would assume that you don't have a Mac.

663
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,960
So I would recommend that you play, oh, actually Star Wars Battlefront II, maybe.

664
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
It's a bit old, and it might be cheap now, where you can play that.

665
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
It might be pretty fun.

666
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
There's also worms.

667
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Well, worms, yeah, it doesn't really benefit from, you know.

668
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,080
There's a bunch of free stuff out there, like all the stuff you can get, like Source, like

669
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,440
Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.

670
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,320
That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.

671
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,280
If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, that's a fun one.

672
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Tetranet!

673
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Tetranet!

674
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Isn't that kind of a violent game?

675
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Garry's Mod?

676
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Oh, no, never mind, never mind.

677
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Sorry.

678
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Let me think.

679
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,520
Seriously, I know you said no monthly fee, but seriously, look in the game tab, because

680
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,380
it's got so many games, and you can set the parental controls in there, and give the kids

681
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,400
their own account, and there's even educational games in there, not that they'd actually play

682
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,640
them, but at least that's available.

683
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,520
There are a lot of other games in there.

684
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
Sims 2 is $25 now.

685
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,040
Sims 2, Civilization, I mean, I know you said the rollercoaster tycoon would bore them,

686
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,680
but Civilization's a heck of a lot of fun, but I don't know, I played it when I was 12,

687
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
the original one.

688
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,380
Command Conquer 3, but it's a bit more expensive, that just came out.

689
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:02,240
It also depends, I would say, not knowing your sons, I'm not sure what type of genres

690
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,960
they're interested in, I would say look at the games that they play off of the PC, or

691
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,160
look at the types of, like if they're interested in books, or what types of movies they like,

692
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,240
and then go to GameStop, or go look online, and find something in the same genre, and

693
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
use that as your criteria.

694
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,200
Mandarin, do you have any suggestions?

695
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I saw one.

696
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,960
Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though the first episode is $32, each of the following

697
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:38,080
are only $9, and they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts,

698
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,000
which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kid's time on the computer to

699
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,920
like an hour or so, it'll give them a little bit more playtime throughout the whole thing,

700
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,440
versus other games where it takes several days to finish.

701
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,240
Kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, for kids, boy or girl,

702
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
and they do really well.

703
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Grab the pitchforks and porches!

704
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Shut up.

705
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,400
I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad, that

706
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,040
you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie, but apparently

707
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad, not bad.

708
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,080
Oh, never mind, I was incorrect, season one, the whole season is $32.

709
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Sorry.

710
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,840
I was incorrect about the price and now I'm getting corrected here, the season is $32

711
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,760
and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying a season, but again

712
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,920
I said it's still a really good game and it's kid-friendly.

713
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,480
Or you get game tab.

714
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.

715
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:49,320
I would say really, take those interests and look for things that associate with those

716
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,200
interests that are within your price range and have the criteria.

717
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,000
Now one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere, okay Rob, if you wrote

718
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,800
I heart pussy Hitler, there's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this

719
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
page.

720
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm going to pretend I never saw that.

721
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,960
I'd like to confiscate this note, frame it, hang it on your fridge, oh Amanda needs to

722
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
see pussy Hitler.

723
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,880
I'll let Amanda guard it for me.

724
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm sorry gamer dad, I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of

725
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
thought.

726
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Sorry gamer dad.

727
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Blame Rob.

728
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,880
You and your 13 year old kids sound pretty cool, but we got pussy Hitler in studio.

729
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,080
Hey, he said both of his sons were 13, I wonder if they're twins.

730
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Maybe.

731
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,960
So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together

732
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
too.

733
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:48,240
So from the Rob D, I just listened to your April Fool Day joke and I got to say I'm cracking

734
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
up like crazy.

735
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,080
I really shouldn't be laughing at this, at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta

736
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,880
and Matilda sent me over the edge.

737
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,120
Good idea and it was pretty funny.

738
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,600
That said, Ms. Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming besides

739
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,660
Ms. Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.

740
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,840
She just had an, she's just an independent woman with an open relationship.

741
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,560
Me and Pac-Man have a kid, don't you remember the old cartoons?

742
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,440
Well yeah, they did suck.

743
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,320
What's your favorite April Fool Day joke this year?

744
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:22,020
I enjoyed the snakes in MySpace joke on VGCats and the 8-bit tie on ThinkGeek.

745
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,760
Of course, nothing beats Shang Long in the old EGM issue.

746
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,920
You must defeat Shang Long to stand a chance.

747
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,240
How many April Fool's jokes have actually influenced the franchise enough to inspire

748
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,680
a new legendary character like Akuma?

749
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,800
I think Gohki was a better name.

750
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,640
Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show, O.L.R. has become a weekly fixture on

751
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,160
my iPod and its space on there is well-deserved.

752
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,400
Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do and I'll keep on listening,

753
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,600
smile face, the Rob D. Roberta's really glad to hear that you're

754
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
a big fan.

755
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,400
You sound like Kirstie Alley.

756
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,360
And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.

757
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,880
I think that, I think, I think, I think, look, you said it best, you sounded like Kirstie

758
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Alley.

759
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Um, let's see, what, uh.

760
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,560
I didn't have to do a damn thing.

761
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm going to, not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most

762
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,800
of the internet's April Fool's jokes this year, so I think we seriously have one of

763
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
the better ones.

764
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.

766
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
We had a great joke.

767
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,160
I think that mine were great.

768
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,400
We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.

769
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,640
So visit dig.com and dig our episode.

770
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,800
By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.

771
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,880
I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.

772
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,320
While you're digging in there, um, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's

773
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,280
because they poked fun at Myspace, which was kind of amusing.

774
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Who wants to touch it?

775
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
This is not a joke.

776
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Who wants to touch it?

777
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,480
Ah, it's the, the Christmas check finally making its way.

778
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,760
We, it got, it got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally,

779
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
so it'll be fun.

780
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,920
Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account set up.

781
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Fun, fun, fun.

782
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:06,480
So I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to, uh, Kristen for being like freaking

783
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
rad.

784
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Okay, now I'm done.

785
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.

786
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,880
Um, all right, what?

787
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
All right.

788
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Yeah.

789
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,160
The 8-bit tie was awesome.

790
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I know.

791
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
I heard, I heard they're going to make it for real.

792
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
That's awesome.

793
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I want one.

794
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?

795
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
All right.

796
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,560
Uh, chat that orangeonsrated.com if you want to join our chat room, I gave you the link

797
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,880
there to a dig, uh, where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.

798
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,920
Uh, Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.

799
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
They didn't have one this year.

800
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Yeah.

801
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Whatever happened to that?

802
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Um, they did have one.

803
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
What was it?

804
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
It wasn't public.

805
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,960
It was actually just someone, what I said on the show, it was actually was a thought

806
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,160
that we, that would come up with on the moderator's thread.

807
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,720
Um, and I just decided just to throw it out there since no one seemed to, you know, wanted

808
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,760
to get off their ass and actually do it.

809
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,040
So, um, the joke was that we were going to tell everybody that there was a big joke hidden

810
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,200
on DDR Freak and if anyone found it, then you win a prize.

811
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,080
Um, Rob found the joke.

812
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,000
So Rob wins a no prize for anyone who was, uh, an old, um, okay.

813
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,560
I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.

814
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Stop.

815
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Okay.

816
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Extra for Drew.

817
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,200
We have extra for Nellie in the room.

818
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,600
Now they can talk and not pass some giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.

819
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,160
It's no, but it says I heart man-gina.

820
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,440
It looks like goat say that he drew on there.

821
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,120
Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and

822
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
you fools can leave.

823
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
All right.

824
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Heart.

825
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
All right.

826
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,560
Quick, more video game stories.

827
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
This one's about violence.

828
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Everybody likes violence.

829
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
Well, um, let's see.

830
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,200
There was a study recently that was done, um, that looked at 120 children, uh, before

831
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,640
and after a 20 minute quake two session.

832
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,480
The study was done by a university Swinburne university technology in Melbourne, Australia.

833
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,080
Um, and it said that, uh, while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending

834
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,440
on their emotional state before playing, the majority of kids were not affected by the

835
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,000
game violence at all quote professor Devley said much of the research linking aggressive

836
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,200
behavior to violent video games has been unconvincing.

837
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,280
It's the only message parents have ever received and it's just not accurate.

838
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,800
He said the study showed aggression link linked to game playing depended on a player's mood

839
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,000
and predisposition to aggression.

840
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,960
He said, so in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they

841
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,040
won't act out, act out on it after they play a video game.

842
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,440
Who would have thought?

843
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,600
Who would have thunk it anyways?

844
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,240
Well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.

845
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,720
Well, I like volume games.

846
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,040
I don't know who wouldn't, but um, apparently the proper, the rapper creator, um, he wants

847
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,920
less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.

848
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,080
I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but anyways, apparently, um, Messiah

849
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,840
Matsuura, uh, creator of the proper, the rapper says that the industry should stop focusing

850
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,280
on X rated violent affairs.

851
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,000
No they shouldn't more X rated games would be better.

852
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,240
Actually some X rated games would be better cause they don't have any.

853
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:21,360
Um, let's see, he was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers

854
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,640
and uh, also basically said at the recent, um, Australian GO3 conference, um, making

855
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:36,000
good games that everybody can play is a very high priority and um, I don't know.

856
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's interesting.

857
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,240
I mean also that he wants faster TVs cause I guess he's talking about the delay between,

858
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,720
you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.

859
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
More rhythm games.

860
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,800
Who would have thought it?

861
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,440
How about we just get another Parappa sequel?

862
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,640
Oh, I hit myself in the chin.

863
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,400
I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.

864
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
More Parappa!

865
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,560
Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.

866
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Well guess what?

867
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,160
What?

868
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
Chicken butt.

869
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:10,120
Anyway, um, they have signed up though, and honestly I don't really give two shits about

870
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,760
the game cause I really don't give two shits about the movie either, but um, Peter Cullen

871
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,200
and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers

872
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
game.

873
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,640
Now, now, now, the new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have

874
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,360
for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.

875
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Really?

876
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Why all the hate for Transformers?

877
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,840
The seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my, you

878
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,120
know, Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.

879
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Maybe, you know, I'm gonna see it.

880
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,040
I haven't said I'm not gonna see it.

881
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,120
I will, and I'll reserve my judgment, my final judgment for when I see it, but right now,

882
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,040
it doesn't seem right, so I don't know.

883
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,180
But if Starscream is fucking awesome, as usual, cause I, I, I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream

884
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,680
when I was little, so it better, if it's cool, then I'll go see it.

885
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,760
It's awesome, and they have it, uh, I think it's on the internet.

886
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,160
Too bad his voice actor's dead.

887
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
He was Cobra Commander.

888
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
COBRA!

889
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Sorry.

890
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,000
They have that on- Wow, that was a random outburst.

891
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,960
I love the 80s, or, like, one of the, I love the 80s things that they did, they had, like,

892
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,440
Cobra Commander, like, a day in the life of Cobra Commander or something like that, and

893
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:39,160
they'd have him do different things, and they'd always go, COBRA!

894
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,440
I just wanna have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.

895
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,960
I think that would be awesome.

896
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Sorry.

897
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
That's not video game news.

898
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,520
Drink, drink like some Drano, and then you'll sound like him.

899
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,040
All right, kids, do you know what time it is?

900
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,600
Ice cream!

901
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,120
No, but almost, almost as good.

902
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,320
It's time to play the match game!

903
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,800
Video game match game here on Orange Laundry AO.

904
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,120
We gotta get ourselves a caller, though, to play.

905
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,680
Uh, GS68 is one of our contestants tonight, I hope he's there.

906
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,000
He changed his nickname, which makes me think he might have left.

907
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,920
If so, he's gonna have to surrender his spot to someone else.

908
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,560
How dare you leave during the show?

909
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
All right.

910
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,480
Well, meanwhile, though, we're going to get another, okay, good, he's still there.

911
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,360
Let's get another contestant on the Skype line right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can

00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,240
Remember the way, oh good, we already got a call.

916
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,480

919
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,960
What's on your mind, buddy?

920
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,400
I'm just hoping I don't lose at the match game.

921
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,560
All right, well you got in first, congratulations, you're gonna play match game with us tonight.

922
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,240
I know I'm not gonna get any matches at all.

923
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,720
That's all right, people usually don't here on the match game, but that's all right.

924
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,240
All right, so stop calling, Zappi got through, he's our contestant.

925
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,400
Zappi versus GS68 tonight, Zappi, do you have a MySpace account?

926
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
No, I don't.

927
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,720
Oh, you should get one, because if you win tonight, you will be put in our MySpace Top

20.

929
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,360
So, that's a very nice prize, but you're gonna have to battle, I know, isn't that as stupid

930
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
as prize ever?

931
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
We have to give him cover.

932
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:27,480
All right, GS68 is one of our other contestants, he will also be battling you for that spot.

933
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,920
All right, so let's meet our celebrities.

934
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,680

00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,960
lot, but she's back tonight, here to match some questions with you.

Say hello to Mandarin.

00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Hi.

938
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,920
All right, that was a very somewhat non-sexy hi.

939
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,360
How are you guys doing?

940
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,200
Do you have any clubs or organizations you'd like to plug while you're here, the charity

945
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,440
That was like the best thing ever.

946
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,400
By the way, that's one of my favorite nicknames ever.

947

Beer batter.

969

What the hell?

970
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Ahem, a show, Loki.

971
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,280

978

Health.

984
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,400
And celebrity number six needs no introduction.

985
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,480
It's me.

986
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,480
And I'm playing for the...

987
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480

00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
Oh, do you want me to do it as Roberta?

989
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,480
No.

990
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,480
No.

991
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?

992
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,160
Because we don't like Christy Alley.

993
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
All right.

994
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Well, I'm playing...

995
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Christy Alley.

996
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,760
Well, my charity is the Save Fat Actress TV Show Foundation.

997
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
That's my charity.

998
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
All right.

999
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,160
So, oh, we had a guy on the phone.

1000
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,640
Zappy, you still there or did you hang up?

1001
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Nope.

1002
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
I'm still here.

1003
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Hi, Zappy.

1004
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
Yeah.

1005
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,640
All right.

1006
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,200
We're going to be asking you some questions and you got to tell us what goes in the blank

1007
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
and everybody here in studio.

1008
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,000
Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer

1009
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
on the computer?

1010
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,400
I will try to remember.

1011
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,400
All right.

1012
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,480
If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.

1013
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,640
You ready for your first clue?

1014
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,640
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,640
All right.

1016
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,640
Here we go.

1017
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,640
Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.

1018
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,360
You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.

1019
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,360
All right.

1020
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,360
Here is question number one.

1021
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,720
There's four questions tonight.

1022
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,600
Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.

1023
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,720
Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

1024
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,080
Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.

1025
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,280
I'll make this game more exciting.

1026
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:03,800
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

1027
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,760
Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.

1028
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,920
Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

1029
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,440
Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway and thought to himself, I know.

1030
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,720
I'll make this game more exciting.

1031
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,440
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

1032
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,080
Celebrities are thinking.

1033
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:40,120
I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

1034
00:51:40,120 --> 00:52:04,480
I'll make this game more exciting.

1035
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,400
I'll install five fret buttons on a dildo, says Zappi.

1036
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,560
I just hope the chat room doesn't fail me.

1037
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Good answer.

1038
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
All right.

1039
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
There we go.

1040
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,960
And GS68 said, we mote.

1041
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,240
So we have dildo and we mote.

1042
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Let's go around and see who's a match.

1043
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,200
Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?

1044
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,760
It was a very close.

1045
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,880
I said a gigantic horse dildo.

1046
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,880
Gigantic horse dildo.

1047
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,880
Judges.

1048
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,880
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1049
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,880
All right.

1050
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Good job.

1051
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,880
Zappi, off to a great start.

1052
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
Nice one.

1053
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,880
All right.

1054
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:42,280
Extifer, five fret buttons on A. I said strand of asshole hair.

1055
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,880
Strand of asshole hair.

1056
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,880
Wow.

1057
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
Okay.

1058
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,880
Dirty asshole.

1059
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Dirty asshole hair.

1060
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,880
I don't know how I got that one.

1061
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,880
Do I get that one, judges?

1062
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,880
No.

1063
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,400
Unfortunately, no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.

1064
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
All right.

1065
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:02,480
Nellie, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian

1066
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
baby.

1067
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,160
The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.

1068
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,160
Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.

1069
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,160
All right.

1070
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,480
Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A.

1071
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,400
You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot

1072
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,720
of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.

1073
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,720
Dildo.

1074
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Another match for Zappi.

1075
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,720
Good job, Zappi.

1076
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
Two to nothing.

1077
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Sorry, GS68.

1078
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,600
That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.

1079
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,600
Dark Sakura.

1080
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,920
I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.

1081
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
There you go.

1082
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Dildo.

1083
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Three to nothing.

1084
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Ding, ding, ding.

1085
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
All right.

1086
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Wow, Zappi.

1087
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.

1088
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
All right.

1089
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,560
My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say dildo because this is my thing.

1090
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,960
I said a Pringles can because I like food.

1091
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,640
Five fret buttons on a Pringles can.

1092
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,640
So I guess.

1093
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Pringles can.

1094
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,400
I'd like to expand it for this.

1095
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
All right.

1096
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,800
Did expanding give you that answer?

1097
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Yeah.

1098
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
All right.

1099
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,480
Well, Pringles can suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth something.

1100
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,320
Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.

1101
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,200
You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.

1102
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
You ready?

1103
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
All right.

1104
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Here we go.

1105
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
Question number two.

1106
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:29,800
Loki thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this

1107
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,280
year's E3 event.

1108
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,960
When Loki walked through the door though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when

1109
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:48,640
he exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.

1110
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,400
Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3, but when he walked

1111
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,560
through the door, he realized that Namco had had the last laugh, he exclaimed, wait a minute,

1112
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:10,000
this isn't E3, this is a blank.

1113
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,080
This isn't E3, this is a blank.

1114
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,040
The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question, I'll just have to like do charades

1115
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,040
or something.

1116
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:27,560
This isn't E3, this is a blank.

1117
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,560
Dark Sakura needs clarification.

1118
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,080
Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?

1119
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Yes.

1120
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
All right.

1121
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,440
Do you understand the question, Zappi?

1122
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
Am I crazy?

1123
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
No, I completely understand.

1124
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
All right.

1125
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Thank you.

1126
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
I'm not crazy.

1127
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
All right.

1128
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Ding.

1129
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Ding.

1130
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Nellie gets ding.

1131
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Extrovert, ding.

1132
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
Mandarin, ding.

1133
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
Dark Sakura, ding.

1134
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Loki, ding.

1135
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
All right.

1136
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Dark Sakura, ding.

1137
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,160
Loki exclaimed, this isn't E3, this is a?

1138
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Porno convention.

1139
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:03,160
A porno convention, all right, and GS68 said a gay bar, all right, so we have porno convention

1140
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,160
and gay bar.

1141
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,200
Mandarin, what did you say, this isn't E3, this is a?

1142
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,400
I think they both might actually get expensive combination, a gay orgy.

1143
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,360
A gay orgy, not going to work, I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.

1144
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:23,000
Extrovert, this isn't E3, this is?

1145
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
A Frankie Muniz convention.

1146
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,760
A Frankie Muniz convention.

1147
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,060
Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.

1148
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:36,000
It's almost like a gay bar, but no, that doesn't work, all right.

1149
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Nellie, this isn't E3, this is a?

1150
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,240
The funny thing is is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all

1151
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:51,080
naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife, darn.

1152
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:56,240
An all naked girl convention, but he brought his wife, darn, good answer, not a match.

1153
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:03,560
Could be porn, no, Zappi's ahead, if he was behind, I'd give it to him, but no, Loki.

1154
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,080
I don't buy that, she would never come to an E3 thing, even if she thought it wasn't

1155
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
E3.

1156
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,720
Anyways, I said a Pringles can, because it's useless.

1157
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,720
You're a dick.

1158
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,360
All right, a Pringles can, not an answer.

1159
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Dark Sakura.

1160
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,760
Orgy of suck.

1161
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,920
An orgy of suck, that's almost like a gay bar, but no, all right.

1162
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,920
And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something,

1163
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,520
it's like damn, why is there all these women here, this sucks, where are the games?

1164
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
All right.

1165
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Although maybe I would say that.

1166
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,480
My answer, this is an E3, this is a gay bath house, I don't know, is that a match with

1167
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,480
gay bar?

1168
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,480
Uh-huh.

1169
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,920
I'm going to say yes, who wants, GS68's behind.

1170
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,920
I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.

1171
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,640
All right, what, you guys aren't going to get me.

1172
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,000
And why would they have a Frankie Muniz?

1173
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,280
So Nellie says yes, I say yes, uh-huh, Dark Sakura says no, Loki says no, all right, sorry

1174
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,280
NGS68.

1175
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,280
All right.

1176
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
No, Loki said yes.

1177
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,280
Oh, Loki said yes?

1178
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,280
Yeah.

1179
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
Gay bath house and gay bar, are they the same thing, Dark Sakura?

1180
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
No.

1181
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,280
All right.

1182
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,880
How was the bath house like a bar?

1183
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,480
Because it's all gay.

1184
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Now we're three and three.

1185
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
Okay, okay.

1186
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
I have a question on the rules.

1187
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,480
What?

1188
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
Yes.

1189
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
What?

1190
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
Yes.

1191
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Okay.

1192
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Yes.

1193
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Dark Sakura says yes.

1194
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
Because you can suck in the bathroom.

1195
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,480
That's true, have you ever been to faces?

1196
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,480
All right.

1197
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Wait, wait, wait, I have a question on the rules.

1198
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,480
That's true, they do have a pool now.

1199
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,480
What?

1200
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,080
The person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people

1201
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,380
choosing for him again.

1202
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,880
Only in certain years they did that and then they didn't do that in future years.

1203
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
That's cheating then.

1204
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,880
No, it's not.

1205
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,880
You're cheating.

1206
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,880
Shut up, Nellie.

1207
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
All right.

1208
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,880
Hey, look, if I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her till she did it.

1209
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Rob.

1210
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
What?

1211
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
Get in your place.

1212
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,280
Answer the thing.

1213
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
Sorry, Miss Jamie.

1214
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,280
All right.

1215
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,280
That's right.

1216
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,840
You're watching her all break out the paddle again.

1217
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Question number three.

1218
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Robby Goodstick.

1219
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,560
Oh, this is a question about Jamie.

1220
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,560
This should be good.

1221
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
You ready, Zappy?

1222
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Yep.

1223
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Three to one.

1224
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,560
You feeling the heat a little bit?

1225
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,560
I'm not ready.

1226
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,560
All right.

1227
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
Here we go.

1228
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:25,400
While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pin bot machine for sale.

1229
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,800
The machine costs $1,000 though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.

1230
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:37,680
Being the ever clever game collector and negotiator though, Jamie told the salesman, I really

1231
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,520
want that pin bot machine.

1232
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,720
I would trade you my blank for it.

1233
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:51,240
Where's my music?

1234
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,040
I really want that pin bot machine.

1235
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,760
I would trade you my blank for it.

1236
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,320
All right.

1237
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,000
Ding, this one's easy for me.

1238
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Uh-oh.

1239
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Did I copy paste that to GS68?

1240
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh, never mind.

1241
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You got it anyway.

1242
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I would trade you my blank for it.

1243
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Ding.

1244
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Expert said ding.

1245
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Ding.

1246
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Dark Sakura?

1247
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
All right.

1248
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That was quick.

1249
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,480
When the question is about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.

1250
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
All right.

1251
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,880
I would trade you my blank for it.

1252
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:31,000
Zappi, I would trade you my massage table.

1253
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Massage table.

1254
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,240
Okay, massage table.

1255
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,320
That is something very precious to her decision.

1256
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,320
All right.

1257
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
GS68 said-

1258
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,080
I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.

1259
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,960
GS68 said I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.

1260
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,840
Which is great because I don't got any, ha ha.

1261
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,560
It could be, well, what about your behind virginity?

1262
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,200
Ew, we're not going there, Rob.

1263
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
I thought your be-hymen.

1264
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
All right.

1265
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Rob, you just ruined my answer.

1266
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
Yes.

1267
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,640
All right, shut up.

1268
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,560
Mandarin, we have virginity and massage table.

1269
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,680
I want that pinball machine.

1270
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,160
I would trade you my-

1271
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,880
Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.

1272
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,000
Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.

1273
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,480
Is that a match for massage table?

1274
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,360
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1275
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,640
That's because of the massage services, so-

1276
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,640
Yeah, I say no.

1277
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,640
That's a half a point.

1278
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Half a point.

1279
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,640
I say no.

1280
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,640
All right, we'll do-

1281
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,640
The table is what you do-

1282
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Fine.

1283
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Half a point for Zappi.

1284
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,640
I'm outvoted.

1285
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,640
Half a point.

1286
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
See, now I have to write half.

1287
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,520
All right, there we go.

1288
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,520
Extra fur.

1289
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
I want that pinball machine.

1290
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
Shut the fuck up.

1291
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,520
I went for the most obvious.

1292
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:51,040
I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.

1293
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,040
It's amazing.

1294
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:57,160
The Dark Sakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.

1295
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Frankie Muniz's ass- She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.

1296
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,800
A strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.

1297
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,560
That's actually one of my prized treasures.

1298
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,560
All right, Nellie, I would trade you a-

1299
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,440
I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.

1300
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,440
B. Eimond.

1301
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
All right.

1302
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,440
Loki.

1303
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
Well, see, I would have matched.

1304
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,440
I'm going to get a point.

1305
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Loki, I would trade you my-

1306
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,320
Well, where would one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Baby?

1307
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,040
Iraqi Suicide Baby, which Dark Sakura also happens to own one.

1308
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,240
Dark Sakura, I would trade you my-

1309
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
Husband.

1310
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,640
Husband for it.

1311
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,160
My answer was, I really want that pinball machine.

1312
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,320
I would trade you my husband for it.

1313
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,200
I also said husband, so there it is.

1314
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,640
Husband was the answer to go with in that round.

1315
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,640
All right.

1316
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
One more question.

1317
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
You ready, Zappy?

1318
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
Yup.

1319
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,640
All right.

1320
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,040
Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.

1321
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,040
All right?

1322
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,440
So, you got to keep the lead here.

1323
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,240
All right, GS68, you can do it.

1324
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,240
All right, here we go.

1325
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Here's the question.

1326
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,960
Xtafur, this is a true story, by the way, Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online

1327
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,420
MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.

1328
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,680
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't

1329
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:31,720
play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

1330
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:50,760
Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

1331
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,520
All right, GS68 has an answer.

1332
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,520
I'm ding.

1333
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,520
How about the other celebrities?

1334
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,520
Ding.

1335
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,520
Some are ding.

1336
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,360
All right, let me read the question again and see if it inspires some folks.

1337
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,360
Xtafur played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively

1338
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
of the game.

1339
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,800
He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't

1340
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,880
play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

1341
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:25,080
Isn't this the best song ever?

1342
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,480
Nelly finally dinged.

1343
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,480
Xtafur?

1344
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,480
Sure, ding.

1345
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,480
Mandarin and ding.

1346
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,520
We have some very apathetic celebrities.

1347
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,520
Last question though.

1348
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,240
Here we go before this segment gets drawn on way too long as if it hasn't already.

1349
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,720
Zappi, Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me

1350
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,720
a slut.

1351
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,720
A slut.

1352
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,720
Okay, a slut.

1353
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,720
There you go.

1354
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:53,900
GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.

1355
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,200
Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.

1356
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,360
All right, let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.

1357
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:03,680
Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game, I would not play that game again unless the creator

1358
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,680
sent me...

1359
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,680
Pussy.

1360
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,680
Pussy!

1361
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,680
Is that a match for slut?

1362
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,680
I don't know where you're coming from.

1363
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,480
No, no, because a slut could be male or female.

1364
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,360
All right, Xtafur, I wouldn't, true story though, you did play the game, right?

1365
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Yeah.

1366
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,360
And it sucked?

1367
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
It sucked balls.

1368
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,800
What was so bad about it?

1369
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,120
Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.

1370
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,120
All right.

1371
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,920
I don't know, I don't like purple balls.

1372
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,800
Like, you're going to suck my balls.

1373
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
Be gentle.

1374
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,520
All right, I wouldn't, I wouldn't play, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator

1375
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,720
sent me...

1376
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:45,760
My butt virginity back, because I'm, I'm pretty loose down there.

1377
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,640
I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.

1378
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:56,520
Oh, this show sucks.

1379
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,000
Shit just falls right out of me.

1380
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's just, it's horrible.

1381
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,600
It's like, I have to, I should, I should get a colostomy bag and it's like...

1382
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:13,980
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators, the chat room is just exploding

1383
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:17,920
with, oh my God, oh, oh God, oh.

1384
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,640
That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.

1385
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,640
Nelly, I...

1386
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,440
Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.

1387
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:36,160
Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creators sent me...

1388
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,640
His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.

1389
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:45,040
His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover, a very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly,

1390
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,640
but unfortunately not a match.

1391
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,400
Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creators sent me...

1392
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,680
I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie

1393
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,960
Mina's butt hair in a Pringles can.

1394
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,640
In a Pringles can, all right.

1395
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,640
Dark Sakura.

1396
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,080
A naked sweaty man slut.

1397
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,280
A naked sweaty man slut, I think that's a match with slut.

1398
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,680
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1399
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,600
So Zappy, you got another point.

1400
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,560
I think Mandarin should get a pussy slut.

1401
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,760
Well, but...

1402
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,920
That doesn't count.

1403
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,440
Dark Sakura actually used the word slut, it doesn't matter, Zappy is still going to win

1404
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:24,100
anyway because GS68 was somehow to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't

1405
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,200
see happening.

1406
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:31,320
But my answer, just so you know, was Frankie Mina's as B. Hyman, which was not a match,

1407
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,080
but probably almost matched Loki's answer.

1408
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,640
So Zappy, by a score of four and a half to one, you win.

1409
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,080
Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.

1410
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Yeah, you did pretty good.

1411
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,960
That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.

1412
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
Congratulations.

1413
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
It's all thanks to the chat room.

1414
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,960
Yes.

1415
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:55,080
Zappy, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.

1416
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,080
You were a part of it.

1417
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,080
I feel so special.

1418
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,080
Yeah, all right.

1419
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,080
Well, congratulations.

1420
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,200
Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?

1421
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
All right.

1422
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,840
In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?

1423
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
Yep.

1424
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Any other comments you want to give?

1425
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,840
Not really.

1426
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,840
All right.

1427
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Well, have a good week, Zappy.

1428
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
All right, thanks.

1429
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,400
And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.

1430
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,480
A nice effort from GS68.

1431
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,040
And Extafur and Nelly have left.

1432
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,480
Thank God.

1433
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,760
Normality can come back and resume with the program.

1434
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,680
Wow.

1435
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:35,680
Let's get back to some game news.

1436
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:41,240
If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their

1437
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,400
Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.

1438
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:51,020
They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.

1439
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,020
So let's see.

1440
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,320
I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.

1441
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,920
They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original

1442
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,320
console back from Microsoft, faster service, you get it back within five business days,

1443
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:09,480
and other enhanced customer care operations, a new pledge from Xbox to you for your three

1444
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,480
rings of death.

1445
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,000
That's all I have.

1446
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,960
Anyways, some other fun stuff.

1447
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:26,920
Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't

1448
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,200
downloaded it in another territory like I did.

1449
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,120
But you get to play three single player missions, and check that out.

1450
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,880
It's an okay average game, but hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that

1451
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,880
anyways.

1452
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,800
Kind of worth checking out.

1453
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,440
It's definitely a lot better than ChromeHounds, that is for sure.

1454
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,720
So if you're looking for a mech combat game, there you go.

1455
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,720
Why?

1456
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Why is it better than ChromeHounds?

1457
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
It's a lot faster.

1458
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,800
I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for god sakes.

1459
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,680
Plus, you know, overall it looks good.

1460
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,440
Just ChromeHounds is very slow.

1461
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Just slow in everything.

1462
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:07,180
Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words

1463
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,960
for snow in Inuit?

1464
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:15,360
No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which maybe makes you

1465
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,600
go really fast, and then like a quick boost.

1466
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Quick boost?

1467
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,180
Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.

1468
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,040
The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets, and then the

1469
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:33,560
super boost is just, you know, your typical anime robot flying over the ocean type thing.

1470
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,520
Can you put two explicit tags on a show?

1471
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,400
I was just wondering.

1472
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,400
What?

1473
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,480
Rated C for Christopher and for Nellie.

1474
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Yeah, NC17.

1475
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,480
Somebody in chat already made that joke.

1476
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,480
Nellie, Christopher17.

1477
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,480
There you go.

1478
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,480
All right.

1479
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,560
Well, Skyline will be open very soon, kids.

1480
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,400
Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack that has the

1481
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn-up mountain and a trial

1482
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:11,840
point which is a modern-day office complex with a background of a busy day, you know,

1483
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,560
behind it, a busy city behind it.

1484
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,680
You can download it on LiveMarketplace.

1485
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,680
Actually it's already up.

1486
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:25,720
It was up there on the 6th, and it's 400 Microsoft points, and so I'd say give it a try.

1487
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Lost Planet's pretty cool.

1488
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,800
Zatty's oil.

1489
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,800
You know what?

1490
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
Hey, Rob.

1491
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,160
We're having a lot of meetings right now, and we really did lose five listeners during

1492
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,160
the match game segment live.

1493
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,160
Did we?

1494
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,160
Yeah.

1495
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
That was great.

1496
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,160
All right.

1497
01:11:43,160 --> 01:12:00,000
The Skyline is open 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can always call us on the Skyline as well.

1498
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
The user name is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1499
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,600
I want to play something for you guys real, real quick though because DMN left us a message

1500
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,400
because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play

1501
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,840
for you guys because you can leave us voicemails during the week.

1502
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,840
Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.

1503
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
This is DMN.

1504
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,840
I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.

1505
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:25,360
I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't because I got forced to

1506
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:31,200
run a Soul Calibur III tournament, so I killed the guy who didn't do it.

1507
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:38,560
Yeah, we're all good, but I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here, hopefully

1508
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,440
one more from closing ceremonies, which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.

1509
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,080
I want you guys to know how much people love OrangeLoungeRadio, even if I force them to

1510
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,960
be crazy about it, but yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.

1511
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,960
Bye.

1512
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,880
So, live from SakuraCon, there's DMN.

1513
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,120
Apparently there's fans of OrangeLoungeRadio at SakuraCon.

1514
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,680
Sorry we couldn't come.

1515
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,400
I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to SakuraCon.

1516
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,400
Something happened.

1517
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,680
We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out, so maybe next year.

1518
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,680
Let's go to Skypline in the meanwhile.

1519
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1520
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,680
Who's this?

1521
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,680
It's Legend of Zaku.

1522
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,680
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1523
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,680
How you doing?

1524
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Pretty good.

1525
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,480
Can you put two explicit tags on the podcast, do you think?

1526
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,460
I'm not sure if that would...

1527
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,080
I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.

1528
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,080
Anyways...

1529
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,920
Right, what's on your mind?

1530
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:35,040
I heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonics is basically trying to give

1531
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:41,880
Konami a run for its money, also for the fact that Konami is lazy.

1532
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,360
They haven't even shown any real initiative that's trying to release guitar freaks and

1533
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,040
drum manias to this country sooner.

1534
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,280
In other words, Harmonics just stole the thunder.

1535
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,840
Do you think maybe they've just given up?

1536
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,840
That they've been beat at their own game?

1537
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,560
Well, it's not really that.

1538
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:02,040
From what I hear, they're supposed to be testing guitar freaks and drum manias this summer

1539
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:09,120
in this country, but the backlash is that people will easily call it a Rock Band rip-off.

1540
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,080
They'll just call Konami a bunch of biters, just for the fact that they are announcing

1541
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,520
that game after Rock Band.

1542
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,720
So it's like they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries

1543
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,200
to release, just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.

1544
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,440
To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?

1545
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,440
I don't think it is.

1546
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,720
Konami still has the Japanese market if nothing else.

1547
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,720
Right, of course.

1548
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:40,760
They have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that the way Harmonics managed to

1549
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,120
get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.

1550
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,920
They have commercials for it.

1551
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,920
That and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in

1552
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,920
right now.

1553
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,280
Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.

1554
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,200
It was a huge, huge risk.

1555
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,240
When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it

1556
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,240
was.

1557
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,880
I know it was, but as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

1558
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:13,880
So it was a damn good risk at best, but it's like they need a lot more marketing if they

1559
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,360
want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania just to catch

1560
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,860
up to Harmonics as the reach that they already have.

1561
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:28,900
So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides karaoke revolution, which

1562
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,200
they may not be known for much longer, or DDR?

1563
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,100
If they want to push something like Guitar Freak Syndrome Mania, they have to get a lot

1564
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:42,060
of marketing and a lot of American, mostly Americanization on it, just more American

1565
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:46,320
licenses which would translate into more sales for the American public.

1566
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,160
They'll give the average Guitar Hero user another choice, an alternative, instead of

1567
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,760
just rejecting a truly Japanese version.

1568
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,960
I hate to be honest, but that's the way it has to be.

1569
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,320
I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.

1570
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,120
How could Konami make BeatMania a success in this country?

1571
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:14,800
Well, they really have to focus on basically licenses, pick up really good licenses, stuff

1572
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:23,440
like really good trance, techno and stuff like that, and maybe some decent hip-hop or

1573
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,440
something.

1574
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,800
But yes, they have to definitely push, they have to do some more marketing and they have

1575
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,960
to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost, just like they did with

1576
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:34,960
DDR.

1577
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,280
It just started in the arcades and then it snowballed into the home versions, although

1578
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,600
the home version came first here already in this country.

1579
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,880
They have to definitely push gold a lot further than it already is right now.

1580
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,440
They have to really get it out there.

1581
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,440
All right.

1582
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,000
Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.

1583
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
We appreciate it.

1584
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
All right.

1585
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Later, buddy.

1586
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Bye.

1587
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Bye.

1588
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Black Boy makes an interesting statement in chat.

1589
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,120
He says, I love that because this is a Bimani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because

1590
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,880
another company improved on something that Bimani pioneered.

1591
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,360
I wouldn't say I'm mad.

1592
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,280
I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.

1593
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,000
It made a great formula even better.

1594
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,200
I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing

1595
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,280
to take and it paid off.

1596
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:27,600
I can't be mad at that, but what Loki's saying there is that when Guitar Hero gets all these

1597
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,600
lavish, it's so original, it's the most original game ever, awards bestowed on it, you can't

1598
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,640
help but feel like, well, I did kind of play a game like it once.

1599
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:42,160
Well, anyway, let's go back to the Skype line and see if there's more calls.

1600
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,960
Black Boy says, by the way, that's the whole point because people here have had such affection

1601
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,800
for Bimani, and I'm an exception, apparently.

1602
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,800
Let's see.

1603
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Hi, you're on Orangetown's radio.

1604
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Who's this?

1605
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,800
Hey, it's Ron.

1606
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,800
What's up, everyone?

1607
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Hi, Rama.

1608
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,800
How you doing?

1609
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,800
What's up?

1610
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,800
Pretty good.

1611
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,080
Look, Konami has other franchises that they're working on that's making them a whole lot

1612
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
of money.

1613
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,920
Seriously, I don't think Konami really gives two shits about Guitar Freaks or 2DX or anything

1614
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,920
like that.

1615
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:13,720
I mean, if you put Pop'n Music, 2DX, DDR, an arcade machine right in front of people,

1616
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,520
people demonstrating it seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks

1617
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:23,040
more easy and more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to

1618
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,840
me one of the reasons why they brought it over.

1619
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:32,040
Yes, there are other franchises' risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is like, you

1620
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,040
know what?

1621
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,040
Hey, we did our thing.

1622
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,040
Let's just call it a night.

1623
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,040
Let's work on other stuff.

1624
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,480
I mean, they're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off, trying to Americanize

1625
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,880
Guitar Freaks and Drummy, I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just

1626
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,240
using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods,

1627
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:54,680
the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming

1628
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,680
out with.

1629
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
Yeah, exactly.

1630
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,640
I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.

1631
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,520
I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?

1632
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:11,760
I mean, they probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX of touring or maybe

1633
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,200
like Guitar Freaks or something like that, you know?

1634
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,800
By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple

1635
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:27,440
sources and contexts I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as

1636
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,240
far as the home version went.

1637
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,860
So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem

1638
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:36,080
to be like that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Rama, that even though

1639
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,760
they could go for it, they're not choosing to.

1640
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
I don't know.

1641
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,760
Exactly.

1642
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,560
I mean, with the much money they've made off the Bimani games, for them to bring over Beatmania

1643
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,440
wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?

1644
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,800
FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.

1645
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,360
Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis is a problem, is to think that arcades

1646
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,640
are relevant enough to give a fuck.

1647
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,000
Arcades are dead in the US.

1648
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,720
That's why they don't give a fuck.

1649
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,200
Same point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar

1650
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:11,840
Hero and this rock band game would be made for a console on the outset.

1651
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Kind of interesting.

1652
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,840
Yeah, exactly.

1653
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,760
Because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine

1654
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,680
in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men, it was a Konami game.

1655
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,440
And now nowadays, the only place you can find a half decent arcade if you're in a big town

1656
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,840
where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little Podunk Corner place, you know?

1657
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,840
It's sad.

1658
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,280
I really hope arcades have a resurgence.

1659
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,280
I really do.

1660
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,280
I miss them.

1661
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,280
Exactly.

1662
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,160
I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.

1663
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,120
Any other thoughts, Rama?

1664
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,120
That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.

1665
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,640
Sure, why not?

1666
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,680
Okay, this is really dirty.

1667
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,260
Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.

1668
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,260
How much worse can we get?

1669
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,260
Go for it.

1670
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,260
Okay.

1671
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:06,360
What does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?

1672
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
What?

1673
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:12,280
A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.

1674
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:18,800
Bye Rama, thanks for the call.

1675
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,480
Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?

1676
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,480
I don't know.

1677
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1678
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,160
Who's this?

1679
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,160
Hey guys, how you doing?

1680
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,160
This is Bandit.

1681
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,160
Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?

1682
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,160
Okay.

1683
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:34,040
What you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever

1684
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,840
be popular in this country.

1685
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,840
Why is that?

1686
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,040
I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, if you look at that game, what the other

1687
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:48,480
couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years

1688
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,960
ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now, I mean, that game

1689
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,600
takes too much time to learn and things like that, way too much dedication.

1690
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:04,720
The casual gamer's not going to just walk into a place, throw in 50 cents and just be

1691
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,360
great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?

1692
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,400
But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard too?

1693
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,880
I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of

1694
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,440
dumbed down modes, which BeatMania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place because

1695
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,380
when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing

1696
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,920
BeatMania down.

1697
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,760
But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?

1698
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,200
Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.

1699
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:38,640
I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.

1700
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:44,800
I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then

1701
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,960
look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.

1702
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,520
Damn, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?

1703
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,480
Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.

1704
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,040
That sounds hard.

1705
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,720
Trying to think if Buckethead does that one.

1706
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,280
All right, well, anything else?

1707
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,520
No, that's it for now.

1708
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,760
And anything non-music, because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.

1709
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,760
Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?

1710
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,320
Right now, I mean, I picked up a, I haven't gone, I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.

1711
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,240
I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but you know, I just haven't made that leap.

1712
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:24,440
So I picked up God of War about a month ago, picked up God of War 2 when it came out.

1713
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,640
I played through both of them.

1714
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,640
They're really good.

1715
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:31,000
I'd definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet, I mean, it's been maybe

1716
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,240
a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.

1717
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,120
I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.

1718
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,360
Well, there's that in Devil May Cry collection.

1719
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,280
It's like all three games for like 29 bucks.

1720
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,280
Nice.

1721
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,280
Definitely get that too.

1722
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,280
Just might.

1723
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,280
All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.

1724
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,280
All right, there you go.

1725
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,280
All right, take care.

1726
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,280
One more call.

1727
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,280
What do you say?

1728
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,280
One more.

1729
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,280
You guys okay?

1730
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,280
You guys doing all right?

1731
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,280
Yes.

1732
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:59,120
All right, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth

1733
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,400
Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually

1734
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,200
looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.

1735
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,120
All right, let's do one more call.

1736
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,560
Hi, you're on Ornishon's radio.

1737
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,560
Who's this?

1738
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,600
Hey guys, this is DDR Dollar Bill here.

1739
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,480
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?

1740
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,000
This whole damn argument is like pissing me off now.

1741
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Why?

1742
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,400
All right, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different

1743
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,040
things at the same time, they're the same thing.

1744
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:40,480
First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level, and I've proven

1745
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,120
this by actually trying to game the other day.

1746
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:49,260
Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four, while Guitar Hero actually

1747
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,000
passed me by missing half the damn song, that's the first thing I've seen the difference.

1748
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,920
Hold on though, because doesn't the Arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?

1749
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
Stop breathing into the mic, please.

1750
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,520
Yeah, careful, you're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.

1751
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,520
Sorry.

1752
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:09,860
That's all right, but yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the Arcade difficulty

1753
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:10,860
setting?

1754
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:16,520
Yes, but most Arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.

1755
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,860
I don't really know too many Arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right

1756
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,280
there, you know?

1757
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:28,360
That's my first thought, and then the second thought is also the song list, and people

1758
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:34,140
keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freaks' song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and

1759
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,280
very few American stuff that people recognize.

1760
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,320
While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada,

1761
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,120
yada, yada, I can play this.

1762
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,320
True, very true.

1763
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,720
And I've said this kind of distinguishes the games and make Guitar Hero more successful

1764
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,720
here, yeah?

1765
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:58,120
Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that

1766
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,020
both the difficulty level and the song list.

1767
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:04,920
You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games, I mean you have DDR in your nickname,

1768
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,400
what do you think of Rock Band?

1769
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,320
Is it something you're going to check out?

1770
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,440
I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't

1771
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,720
have much of an idea what it's about.

1772
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,440
Real quickly, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania,

1773
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,560
and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?

1774
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:28,000
Well imagine doing that online, take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.

1775
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,080
So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1776
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,640
But on the internet.

1777
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,640
Hmm.

1778
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:43,160
And you sound interested, and Guitar Hero type songs.

1779
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:48,720
That wouldn't be so bad actually, because one thing people can forget is that no game

1780
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,960
has actually included like a karaoke type thing.

1781
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,680
So that would actually make it different at the same time.

1782
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,680
That's true.

1783
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,680
You know, because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time, okay.

1784
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,400
Now we have drums, guitars, and singers.

1785
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Yeah.

1786
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,400
It could be interesting.

1787
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,400
We'll see.

1788
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,080
Well I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.

1789
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,760
Alright.

1790
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
Take care buddy, thanks for the perspective.

1791
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,760
Hey, thanks man.

1792
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
No problem.

1793
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,760
Later.

1794
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,760
Later.

1795
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,760
Alright.

1796
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,440
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, thanks to those that called in.

1797
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,120
If you didn't get through though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in

1798
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,760
still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.

1799
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,520
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1800
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,480
And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every

1801
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,040
week because we take the calls to come in.

1802
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:41,460
If you're not calling us, you shouldn't be complaining about that.

1803
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:44,360
So tune in live on a Sunday night sometime or leave us a voicemail.

1804
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,320
I'm going to open it up to any last minute stories that anyone might have here in studio.

1805
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,320
Last minute stories.

1806
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,320
I got a few.

1807
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,320
Yes.

1808
01:27:52,320 --> 01:28:00,440
There's another rumor, also coming from Gamespot, about a keyboard controller attachment that

1809
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,180
they're going to be coming out.

1810
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,320
It looks very legit coming from them, and I do remember seeing a patent or some sort

1811
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:12,360
of picture a while back, and I believe Gamers reports were also saying that they ran a story

1812
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,440
months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.

1813
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:22,080
So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely, and that would kind of tie into

1814
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:28,480
that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.

1815
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,480
Let's see.

1816
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,520
Other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit that's drawn

1817
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,520
to life.

1818
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:41,700
It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet, and it looks

1819
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:50,340
a little bit like Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that, but you actually

1820
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:58,080
doodle stuff onto your DS, and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.

1821
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,080
So that's kind of neat.

1822
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,800
I'm looking forward to that, and they're also making a Worms 2, apparently.

1823
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:12,160
Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP, and apparently it's

1824
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,240
triple triads, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.

1825
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,080
I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy

1826
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,840
IX, but interesting nonetheless, I guess.

1827
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,080
And there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison

1828
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,400
trying to auction off a PS3 at a rock concert.

1829
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,000
Apparently he failed, and it was funny.

1830
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,500
One dollar!

1831
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,200
Area 51's being made into a Hollywood movie?

1832
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Don't care.

1833
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:49,380
The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with

1834
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:55,040
the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be an on-rails shooter game,

1835
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,800
or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.

1836
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:02,320
So that's kind of neat, hopefully that'll come out soon.

1837
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:07,680
Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video

1838
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:12,000
service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.

1839
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,080
Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there on the market, though,

1840
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,680
so it should be interesting.

1841
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,600
And that's it.

1842
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,320
I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat.

1843
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,360
Is this supposed to be like Leetspeak for Havoc 1792?

1844
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,600
I think that's what it is, H4V0C, I think it's Havoc.

1845
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:37,840
Havoc 1792 in Leetspeak sent me this article on Achieve360points.com that shows the Halo

1846
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:44,400
2 achievements, because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite,

1847
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,300
so it has achievements there.

1848
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:50,680
And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well, if you were

1849
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,020
playing the backwards compatibility, eventually.

1850
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:58,200
Well, it looks like the basics are you get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of

1851
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:02,880
the single-player game you go through, then you get some other achievement points if you

1852
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:08,280
actually beat the game, and then of course there's your various multiplayer points.

1853
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:14,080
Steel and occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running

1854
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,080
riot, all that stuff.

1855
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:18,640
But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement

1856
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:24,760
called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.

1857
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,640
There's a Ninja achievement, and then there's also a Legend achievement, and that's what

1858
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,640
you get when you complete the game on Legendary difficulty.

1859
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,680
But here's the thing that I think is cool, not those achievements, but the fact that

1860
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,520
then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.

1861
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,600
One is called Flaming Ninja, kill somebody that has the Ninja achievement, and then the

1862
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,400
other one is Hired Gun.

1863
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:49,040
Kill someone who has the Legend achievement, because you know those types of players are

1864
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,040
going to be really good.

1865
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,240
So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements, that's kind of neat.

1866
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,640
That's better than those Viral ones.

1867
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,640
What was that one?

1868
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:05,440
I want to say it was a game I just recently played, not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.

1869
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:10,760
Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the Virus achievement.

1870
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,560
It's even called a Viral achievement or something.

1871
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,760
It's not worth any points, but it's the only way you can get it, is by playing with somebody

1872
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,760
who has the achievement.

1873
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,760
It's kind of weird.

1874
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,760
I think that's kind of neat.

1875
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,200
Good job to whoever thought of those achievements on Halo 2.

1876
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,640
Anything for you, Jamie?

1877
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,380
For me?

1878
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,380
I don't play the...

1879
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,720
I don't play any last minute news in general.

1880
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,680
Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.

1881
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,800
No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.

1882
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,800
No.

1883
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,400
I don't have anything.

1884
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:46,360
We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.

1885
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,360
I think that would be fun.

1886
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,640
Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck.

1887
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:53,920
So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship, and that would be fun.

1888
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,480
I'm actually decent, I mean, with a lot of games.

1889
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,720
In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle, and the sniper rifles in Grand Theft

1890
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:07,780
Auto suck balls, but I don't know, it'd be pretty fun.

1891
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,780
I suck at Halo 2.

1892
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:10,960
In fact, I think I've only played it once, so...

1893
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,160
No, wait, no, I haven't played Halo 2, I've only played Halo 1 once.

1894
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
That would be fun.

1895
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,160
A long time ago.

1896
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,600
DDR Dollar Bill says, I suck at Halo, I can't even get one kill.

1897
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,240
Act Def says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.

1898
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:27,080
We'll see.

1899
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:31,200
I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest, that would be fun.

1900
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,160
We should make a clan suck at Halo.

1901
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:38,120
There is a Noelle Army Halo clan, supposedly, I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously

1902
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,680
not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually

1903
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,680
play Halo.

1904
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,680
So, there you go.

1905
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,200
All right, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program, so now we're going

1906
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,080
to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1907
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,100
Mandarin, thank you so much for being here, I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity

1908
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:57,800
to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing Match Game with us and

1909
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,600
bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.

1910
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,680
Oh, you're welcome, I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.

1911
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,680
So you will come back?

1912
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,680
Oh yeah.

1913
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,680
Absolutely.

1914
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:12,360
We'll come up here and get settled in, and we'll have to take a day off and he'll have

1915
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,480
to come up and...

1916
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,320
Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.

1917
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,840
If he can get out of work.

1918
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,840
Take a day off, we're worth it.

1919
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,840
No, I'm kidding.

1920
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,840
Yeah.

1921
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,840
All right.

1922
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,840
Oh, your final thought?

1923
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,720
It was fun, even though I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but

1924
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,720
it was still a lot of fun.

1925
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,720
That's all right, we get a lot of guests that do that.

1926
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,280
It's okay, Christopher was kind of...

1927
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,800
Miklakkah's been on the show like 40 times, he never says a damn thing when he's here.

1928
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,800
All right.

1929
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,720
It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing, and...

1930
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,720
Yeah, but you like it.

1931
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,720
You like the kink.

1932
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,720
You know it.

1933
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,720
Eh.

1934
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,720
Eh.

1935
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,720
All right.

1936
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,720
Eh.

1937
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,720
You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?

1938
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,720
No.

1939
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,720
Okay.

1940
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,720
Loki, your final thought?

1941
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,400
I want to play Earth...

1942
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:59,840
Why is it, explain this to me, why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation

1943
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:07,360
2 looks like more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?

1944
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,640
That's what I want to know.

1945
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:12,280
Because it looks like they have a lot more complex, you know, enemies in there, you know,

1946
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,720
some stuff that could have been like from War of the Worlds or something.

1947
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,720
Why...

1948
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,720
I don't know.

1949
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,720
What's up with that?

1950
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,720
Exactly.

1951
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,720
What's up with that shit?

1952
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:25,880
I need to get my PS2 back from my sister, because I think they've played Driver 3 long

1953
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,880
enough.

1954
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,680
All right, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1955
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,080
Um, Deadpool.

1956
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,720
All right, and my final thought tonight...

1957
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:44,080
That was my final thought for tonight.

1958
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,880
Did you enjoy that final thought, Dark Soccer?

1959
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,880
Awesome.

1960
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,880
All right.

1961
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,880
I need an orgy now.

1962
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,920
All right, that's it, guys.

1963
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,040
Thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

1964
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:59,320
You guys are awesome, especially through these episodes that are very X-rated.

1965
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,520
Thank you guys so much for sticking through it.

1966
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,200
We promise we'll be family-friendly next week on the program.

1967
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:09,480
Hey, if you like the show, tell two friends, tell two enemies, who cares, about Orange

1968
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,720
on its Radio, because if everybody tells two people about it, then, you know, then we slowly

1969
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,720
conquer the world.

1970
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,540
You can also leave us a nice review, a five-star review on iTunes.

1971
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:19,040
We always really appreciate that.

1972
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,720
The digs, the other stuff you guys do for us out there on the internet, posting about

1973
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,280
us on a forum.

1974
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,280
There's even...

1975
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,280
Oh, this is really cool.

1976
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,200
If you go to the Orange on its Radio forums, some folks have actually made little artwork.

1977
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,560
Now you can get little Orange on its Radio icons with my face or Dark Soccer's face or

1978
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:38,300
somebody's face on it, and one of those little bars, like those little tiny bars that say,

1979
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:42,720
I'm a Coke drinker, or I'm a watcher of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1980
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,200
Now there's one that says, O.L. Army, a little bar.

1981
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,420
So you can check out that all on the forums.

1982
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,120
So my name is Rob Roberts.

1983
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,120
That's Dark Soccer.

1984
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,120
That's Loki.

1985
01:36:52,120 --> 01:37:11,520
And I'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
