3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:53,048
[SPEAKER_10]: For match game, he will be our chat contestant, but we'll open it up for a phone call a little later on in the program.

6
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:53,909
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll tell you when to call.

7
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,191
[SPEAKER_10]: But, in the meantime, we're going to get back to some gaming news.

8
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:06,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and let's start off with the news that pretty much hit the internet on Monday, and everyone is all excited about it.

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,777
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the next generation of music games, Rock Band.

10
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:17,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the brand new EA Harmonix kind of co-game there.

11
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,981
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:16,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there anything wrong with being a big fad if they're going to sell millions of copies of it?

14
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:21,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're going to sell a lot of copies of it, especially some expensive peripherals involved with it, according to some rumors.

15
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:31,727
[SPEAKER_11]: But it just frustrates me because I know when this game comes out, what's going to happen is everyone's going to forget about Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania.

16
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And they'll be like, oh, this is brand new.

17
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:35,207
[SPEAKER_11]: This is so innovative.

18
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So innovative.

19
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,748
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not innovative at all.

20
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to an extent, though.

21
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:55,791
[SPEAKER_10]: If they do make it playable over the internet and you have this virtual band, that to some extent is innovative because the problem with Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania is A, most of the home peripherals for those games sucked ass.

22
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,111
[SPEAKER_10]: The keyboard was pretty good.

23
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say that.

24
00:02:58,372 --> 00:03:00,333
[SPEAKER_10]: If you put the keyboard up on the table, it was actually really good.

25
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:03,615
[SPEAKER_10]: But the drum controller for home, not that hot.

26
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar controller for home, not that hot.

27
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:08,137
[SPEAKER_10]: The Guitar Hero controller improved on that.

28
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:09,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Session Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania

29
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:43,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, for those people that never wanted to play Karaoke Revolution, because it's like, oh, I don't want to sing, I don't want to sing.

30
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now, oh, here, go bang on a drum.

31
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I think here's what's even the more disappointing part about the whole thing, is fucking, Konami, wake up, where the fuck have you been?

32
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:56,258
[SPEAKER_11]: You've missed a train, and the next train, and the next train, as far as music games go.

33
00:03:56,298 --> 00:04:02,703
[SPEAKER_11]: You're letting these people, I mean, you had the whole market cornered for this stuff, and now you're just kind of letting it slip away.

34
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:04,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what they're thinking.

35
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:06,025
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the big deal?

36
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they really should have

37
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,404
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

38
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,880
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:54,414
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not original.

40
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:54,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

41
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,718
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want to improve on it, great, that's awesome.

42
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,301
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not fucking original.

43
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:09,871
[SPEAKER_11]: If I see a goddamn achievement for originality or some fucking award that they're going to win, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

44
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:15,307
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says Konami wailed on In The Groove and pump it up, but his pretending Guitar Hero doesn't exist.

45
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:26,597
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because Guitar Hero did to Guitar Freaks what In The Groove should have done to DDR, and that is, you know, completely rebuilt it from the ground up and didn't try to make it a clone of Guitar Freaks.

46
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:32,182
[SPEAKER_10]: They, you know, the only similarities between the game is they both have guitar controllers in their rhythm games.

47
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,225
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, otherwise, you know, they gave it the more amplitude look,

48
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:37,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero

49
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is going to turn into this.

50
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,218
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like the harmonics now.

51
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:09,361
[SPEAKER_10]: This kind of makes sense now why they stepped away and they said, okay, Neversoft, you can have Guitar Hero.

52
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,162
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go work on something bigger and better.

53
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That's smart harmonics to me.

54
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:13,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

55
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:16,064
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm curious to see what it's going to become.

56
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:21,047
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's my thing is people bitch about having to buy like $600 systems and stuff.

57
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:29,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine buying, let's just say, I know that this is not real, but the prices that got leaked out there from GameStop

58
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:35,636
[SPEAKER_11]: They were saying that they were starting to do pre-orders on stuff because they'll pre-order games that don't exist yet.

59
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:41,881
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's assume that each of the controllers is going to cost at least $40 or something like that.

60
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You're spending $200 on a fucking game.

61
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:48,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's a little much for me, I would think.

62
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, people are ready to drop $600 on a PlayStation 3.

63
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:50,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

64
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:54,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but still, they drop another just for one game.

65
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,273
[SPEAKER_10]: You buy the guitar, she buys the drums, I buy the mic, we got a band.

66
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to get them all anyway.

67
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're a peripheral whore.

68
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:04,768
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to ask you.

69
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:05,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

70
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:09,110
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this is very interesting, and I think this is why Loki is so passionate about this issue.

71
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:21,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you guys have to realize, six years ago, flashback, Roseville Golf Land, there I am on Keyboard Mania, there she is on Drum Mania, there he is on Guitar Freaks.

72
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, literally, the three of us were playing this band thing.

73
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:26,399
[SPEAKER_14]: And insert random other person on another guitar.

74
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, but still, we were kind of doing this a long time ago.

75
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,203
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a picture of us, all of us, on the machine.

76
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:40,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, nobody look at it because I was 80 pounds heavier in it, but it was all of us on the machine.

77
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really curious, what do you think of it?

78
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, he doesn't seem to care for it because it's not original.

79
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:50,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little disappointed, though, that they just didn't fully rip it off and do, like, a keyboard as well, because that is kind of important, I would think.

80
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:56,458
[SPEAKER_10]: and I generally kind of like the idea because, you know, well, it's a guitar, freaks, drum, music.

81
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:57,439
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

82
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:08,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I honestly, I think it's going to be fun because it's the closest we're going to get in America to, I mean, I do agree with calling it, you know, original and innovative is kind of, you know, bullshit.

83
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:12,711
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's the closest we're going to get over here.

84
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,394
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll make it, you know, I think it'll really catch on.

85
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it's going to be a big thing.

86
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,165
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I am a little disappointed, though, in Konami.

87
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a little bit, because they used to be so edgy with, like, you know, DDR and then Karaoke Revolution.

88
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,010
[SPEAKER_11]: No one had even thought about doing something like that.

89
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:32,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least, you know, I guess SingStar was out there, but, you know, really hadn't, you know, done anything like that big.

90
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they just kind of, let's make more Yu-Gi-Oh!

91
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,299
[SPEAKER_11]: games.

92
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just, they need something to just come out there and go, boom!

93
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:45,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, like, totally knock all this stuff, you know, to the wayside.

94
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,127
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, come out with the next big thing, you know.

95
00:08:47,591 --> 00:09:02,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the other killer about this, though, is the fact that MTV is behind it, and that money machine is behind it, and the fact that they're going to get original bands by the original artists for this game, not covers like you get in Guitar Hero, DER, well, some DER, some Carrier Revolution.

96
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:09,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, EA, you know, don't get me wrong, EA makes, their games are, you know, pretty good.

97
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:09,778
[SPEAKER_11]: They're solid.

98
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:14,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they really take the time to make them good, and

99
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I just hope it's diverse.

100
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to play all these emo bands.

101
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,251
[SPEAKER_11]: One emo song once in a while is kind of fun.

102
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:51,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't mind a little bit of that, but I don't want a whole game full of that.

103
00:09:51,354 --> 00:10:00,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that, like Guitar Hero, there's a balance between some classics, some new classics, 80s, 90s stuff, and today.

104
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:01,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of hope they find a balance.

105
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:02,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see, though.

106
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:05,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sad that there's no keyboard in it.

107
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,457
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be a keyboard, though.

108
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:13,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do keyboard better than I can sing, but I understand why it's not there, but it doesn't make me any less sad.

109
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what I want to know?

110
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:16,975
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

111
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:27,139
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of stupid, but you're going to have four peripherals or whatever for this game, and I'm assuming that they're going to be USB on the 360.

112
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,361
[SPEAKER_11]: They're lacking one USB port for that.

113
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be a problem.

114
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: They need a wireless mic?

115
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:37,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

116
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Microsoft does not allow anyone to do a wireless anything.

117
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:41,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

118
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:41,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

119
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think this is kind of cool.

120
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:58,381
[SPEAKER_14]: During the conference for Rock Band, the Harmonix CEO, when he was asked if there was any chance that Rock Band would make it onto the Wii, he said, absolutely.

121
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:02,263
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually specified he said it without hesitation.

122
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:10,428
[SPEAKER_14]: He's quoted saying, we will at some time bring Rock Band to every important platform, and Harmonix would be...

123
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:15,056
[SPEAKER_14]: tailoring Rock Band to play to the strengths of each of the platforms.

124
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And he likes the Wiimote.

125
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:26,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess that's inevitable, though, that Rock Band would make its way to that platform, except playing online is going to suck because Nintendo will make you put in friend codes.

126
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:34,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're going to do it on the Wii, please do not use the Wiimote as the fucking drumsticks or something like that.

127
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,463
[SPEAKER_11]: It will never work.

128
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Just make new peripherals.

129
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:40,485
[SPEAKER_14]: They could do a Taiko no Tatsujin on...

130
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:44,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Beatmania 2DX trying to relaunch that off the ground in arcades in the U.S.

131
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:08,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania 2DX Gold

132
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:33,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, according to this user on BomaniStyle.com, Brazoliange, I probably mispronounced that horribly, sorry.

133
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,097
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy called Dave & Buster's headquarters and spoke to this woman there.

134
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:43,819
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said that they saw the game at a convention in Vegas, ASI, and fell in love with it.

135
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And that they are seriously thinking about putting the machines in D&B locations.

136
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,461
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're having problems finding a distributor right now in the U.S.

137
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,882
[SPEAKER_10]: and has not seen an easy way to import them.

138
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:57,423
[SPEAKER_10]: They're glad that there is a client base already established for it.

139
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:26,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami or Betsen is likely to be distributed in the US sometime around August or September and this lady I guess is looking into that so Dave and Busters they want to buy 2DX Gold they're glad to see there's a client base and they're looking into purchasing machines if you want to sign the petition or call them and show your support all the information is over there at BomaniStyle.com but pretty interesting it'll be interesting if that game finally took off here but I don't know it's a bit of a novelty I love Beatmania 2DX but

140
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:35,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it will not have that same draw the Guitar Hero has unless Konami starts putting recognizable songs to American audiences in there.

141
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:52,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Put in anything Timbaland produced in there or mix it with some new techno like Faster Kill Pussycat, recognizable stuff, a little blend of R&B, bass, hip-hop stuff and trance and dance and it'll be huge.

142
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:53,578
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know.

143
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,439
[SPEAKER_11]: That would never work.

144
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they need to do is they need to reinvent the whole damn franchise for the U.S.

145
00:13:58,662 --> 00:13:59,322
[SPEAKER_11]: if they're going to do that.

146
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:05,166
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to create an actual game that feels like you're DJing instead of just having keys and stuff.

147
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:08,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, just have turntables and mixer and stuff like that.

148
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:12,972
[SPEAKER_11]: More like Kraken DJ or even like Easy to DJ or something like that.

149
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:20,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Easy to DJ, though, of course, is still more like Beatmania, but I think there was a lot of stuff that was fun about Easy to DJ that wasn't there with...

150
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:22,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Beatmania, 2DX, or something like that.

151
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:32,647
[SPEAKER_11]: They just need to make it... Because right now, people, when they see that, they're all, well, that's not going to teach me how to DJ or scratch or something, but make it closer to it so it makes you actually feel like you're DJing.

152
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:33,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Kraken DJ.

153
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:35,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Kraken DJ is a good example.

154
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,131
[SPEAKER_10]: But Kraken DJ got old for me so fast.

155
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it was just because the songs in there were not recognizable at all.

156
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

157
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Something about 2DX kept me on.

158
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:47,238
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a great... Even though I give it a hard time for not having recognizable songs,

159
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:48,358
[SPEAKER_10]: My birthday is in two weeks.

160
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:15,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

161
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:16,828
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to Disneyland, from what I understand.

162
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:17,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we are.

163
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:18,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

164
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:19,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Rockin' Space Mountain.

165
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell yeah!

166
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll be back in time for the show.

167
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

168
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:24,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, we're doing it live from I-5.

169
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:27,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, hi!

170
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: This is me, and I'm driving.

171
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:30,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Goddammit!

172
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking SUV!

173
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Goddammit!

174
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, by the way, Rock Band's coming out.

175
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Goddammit, motherfuckers!

176
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,059
[SPEAKER_14]: That will be me, won't it?

177
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:51,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, to add more fuel to the fire that is of this rumor that Sony's done with the PlayStation 3 20 gigabyte system, that's skew at least.

178
00:15:52,804 --> 00:16:00,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Sony style is no longer carrying the 20 gig system, and that's kind of interesting, and that kind of further backs up with everybody else.

179
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:08,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Either, you know, this is one of those things where they're either officially done with it, or it's just one of those things that the system isn't selling anymore.

180
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:36,089
[SPEAKER_11]: um the 20 gig at least is not selling and i know for a lot of um retailers out there they aren't carrying them anymore so i don't know if they're going to officially announce that they're done with the 20 gig system probably not because they want people to feel that they at least have a choice out there but i think they're done 20 gig system it's my opinion and uh actually i think what i was trying to read here um

181
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:43,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Joystick, I believe, contacted SonyStyle and they were told that they haven't had it in stock for a month.

182
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:47,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And they said they're not getting any more.

183
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:48,723
[SPEAKER_11]: You could go out and find one, though.

184
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:51,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anyone checked the Metreon store?

185
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:53,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

186
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:56,027
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know my 20 gig's awesome.

187
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,908
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need that fucking Wi-Fi shit.

188
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:00,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Just plug it in.

189
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Plug the damn thing in.

190
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Wake me up when there's a game on the PlayStation 3 I want to play.

191
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll talk hardware.

192
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

193
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:26,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in other news, for anyone who has been interested in Lair and Heavenly Sword, they actually are both not coming out in May, as we have been told.

194
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:36,126
[SPEAKER_14]: They still have a 2007 release, but Sony isn't really saying much about it, so we'll just

195
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:40,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess keep listening to them spew some bullshit in our way and see what happens.

196
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably Summer.

197
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they have anything else coming out.

198
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:46,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Lair, Heavenly Sword.

199
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they have anything really.

200
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess Warhawk.

201
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:51,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, Warhawk.

202
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, joyandrapture.com.

203
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

204
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just add that to the list of reasons why Sony should have just fucking waited until 2008 to launch the system.

205
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:03,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Write that up there on the board.

206
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:04,535
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there we go.

207
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:11,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, now we have, you know, that was the eleventy billionth item on the list there.

208
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:17,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, one system that is, interestingly enough, picking up more steam.

209
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,977
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, sometimes a lot of people give this system a lot of crap.

210
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:23,981
[SPEAKER_10]: But the PSP is still chugging along, and now it's chugging along at a lower price.

211
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,823
[SPEAKER_10]: That's been people's number one bitch about the system.

212
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now the core system is only $169.99.

213
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,786
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a drop from the $199.99.

214
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,372
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

215
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Touche.

216
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:41,776
[SPEAKER_11]: and I guess, I remember reading this and there's like some linking with phones and stuff like that.

217
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:45,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Not exactly easy to use, but you can do it.

218
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, there's no side talking, so that's kind of lame.

219
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:52,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So how long before we get our first phone call to OLR on a PSP?

220
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, probably a while.

221
00:19:55,127 --> 00:20:00,332
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, there's a YouTube video up out there, so if you want to see it in action.

222
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:06,344
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that, but of course, if you don't live in Japan, you're kind of screwed, so.

223
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:09,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

224
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,330
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

225
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:14,071
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

226
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:15,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should all just move anyway.

227
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:16,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Just move?

228
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:17,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, why not?

229
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:18,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Make our own country.

230
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: What brought that on?

231
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:23,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And have all of our stuff imported, so we'd never have to worry about waiting for any games.

232
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

233
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Games more expensive!

234
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome!

235
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:27,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

236
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:36,431
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a rumor floating about that there will be a downloadable demo of Final Fantasy XIII available on the PlayStation 3 Network.

237
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:51,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Square actually replied to the rumor saying Xbox Live may be the download hotspot this spring, thanks in large part to the Halo 3 multiplayer demo, but late this year, the honor will go to the PlayStation Network.

238
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:56,021
[SPEAKER_11]: As until Halo Wars demo comes out in the fall or something like that.

239
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:56,882
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be funny.

240
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:02,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy, wait, here's my thing, though.

241
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:06,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy actually hitting a deadline on time?

242
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:07,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

243
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,519
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be something else.

244
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It might hit Japan's store in fall, which means we'll get it next spring.

245
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily.

246
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:18,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Although the release dates have been getting closer and closer between Japan and the U.S., right?

247
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:19,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's ways.

248
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,697
[SPEAKER_10]: There's... Oh, it's logging on to the Japanese store.

249
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:26,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then all the text isn't Japanese.

250
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:27,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

251
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,760
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

252
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:30,801
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

253
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:32,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, another who cares for me.

254
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:43,830
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we've been talking a lot this episode about Guitar Hero, and Hands-On Mobile has signed a deal with Activision to bring Guitar Hero to cell phones and other mobile devices.

255
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:49,654
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I could read the press release, but seriously, who gives a shit about Guitar Hero on the cell phone?

256
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:50,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know it's going to suck.

257
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:55,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm sorry, but, you know, rhythm games, I mean, DDR on the cell phone sucks.

258
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So why would Guitar Hero on a cell phone be any better?

259
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,873
[SPEAKER_10]: People should stop gaming on cell phones.

260
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:04,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I play Luminous.

261
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:06,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Luminous is okay.

262
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:12,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell that to fucking NVIDIA, or not NVIDIA, Nokia.

263
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:13,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Nokia.

264
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:14,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Nokia.

265
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:16,806
[SPEAKER_10]: The only cell phone game that's worth playing is Snake.

266
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:17,887
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

267
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:19,596
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need anything else.

268
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:20,336
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

269
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Cell phone game is pretty awesome.

270
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:25,059
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Turn Your Phone Off and Just Fucking Drive.

271
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:30,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of trying to play your stupid mobile games at red lights.

272
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:32,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

273
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Apply Makeup, the game.

274
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:37,748
[SPEAKER_11]: That's horrible.

275
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:39,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think they do have a game like that, too.

276
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:40,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they really?

277
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:40,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Barbie?

278
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Scary enough.

279
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbie cell phone game?

280
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen women driving down the road and they're putting makeup on?

281
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I've totally seen this in traffic.

282
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:47,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Lipstick on the rear view mirror.

283
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,475
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, DRIVE!

284
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:52,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, anyways.

285
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:58,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a little bit of makeup is not going to transform you from, you know, Yeti to, you know, Beauty Queen.

286
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:06,780
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyways, there has been some interesting stuff, and I kind of feel bad for the guy a little bit.

287
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:16,723
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a lawsuit, I guess, finally settled between the producers of Guitar Hero, John Tam...

288
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,873
[SPEAKER_11]: who was the brand manager, and we actually met him.

289
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:24,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, when I was reading that article, I was like, wasn't Jon Tam the guy that you got?

290
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:29,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't in this news story, but you guys were on a news story on one of the local stations, which is on YouTube, on the Orange Launch YouTube.

291
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:34,058
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at our account, you can see this guy that got the smackdown here.

292
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:37,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so the, yeah, settlement has been reached.

293
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,222
[SPEAKER_11]: They are no longer able to, there's some interesting stuff I read on this because it didn't make any sense at all.

294
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:46,936
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

295
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:13,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Another part of the injunction, I guess, they basically can't develop any drum, guitar, synthesizer based games for the next year.

296
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Nor can they work on Xbox 360 controllers for Guitar Hero 2 until six months after the game's release.

297
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:22,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And some other stuff like that.

298
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:25,987
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of sucks.

299
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:29,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and they also can't, I guess, work with the Ant Commandos for a while.

300
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,451
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what

301
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,716
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, who sent us anthrax this week?

302
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:04,841
[SPEAKER_14]: My mother.

303
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:06,993
[SPEAKER_14]: How evil of her.

304
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:07,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

305
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,103
[SPEAKER_14]: First email, hi, it's Zayd from London again.

306
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:16,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just wondering if you could shed some light on Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition.

307
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:20,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I was reading about it on the net and I'm still not sure if it was true or false.

308
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:28,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I found out that the US are getting the Wii with DVD playback, but do you have any idea if us Brits will get that too?

309
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:32,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Last of all, what's your views on the Wii with DVD playback?

310
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Always have a good one, Zayd Mohamed.

311
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:39,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and last, sorry about my email last week, mixing numbers, letters, and poor spellings.

312
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope this one is better.

313
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm a bitch.

314
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't even bother.

315
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:49,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Can someone please just cut that little clip of the show out where DarkSakura's admitting she's a bitch?

316
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:51,428
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm proud.

317
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:51,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Heart.

318
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:53,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob.

319
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:53,950
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

320
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Broken heart!

321
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:56,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch.

322
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, yes, it's happening.

323
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,717
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know much, but we talked about it in Part A, right?

324
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So go download Part A.

325
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:08,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, as far as DVD playback on the Wii, um, well, I think that's been announced previously.

326
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:10,894
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we feel about DVD playback on the Wii?

327
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:12,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

328
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:14,757
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be the tenth DVD player in my house.

329
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:20,080
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, for the little kid with the Wii in his bedroom, you know, I suppose it's nice for watching DVD movies.

330
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:23,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Loki.

331
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Gateway to Porn!

332
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,285
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is!

333
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Gateway to Porn!

334
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:31,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that can play all the porn DVDs, so it's Gateway to Porn.

335
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:32,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

336
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Will the Brits get the Wii with DVD playback?

337
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:38,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually, I'm sure.

338
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, but six months later than us.

339
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:42,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Nintendo hates you.

340
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:46,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, all console manufacturers hate you.

341
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:48,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

342
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:49,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email, please, Rob.

343
00:26:50,197 --> 00:26:53,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously don't know what Britain did to the rest of the game world.

344
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:55,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel sorry for you guys.

345
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:57,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Something to do with the Revolutionary War.

346
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,739
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll help you smuggle one into the country if you want.

347
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,679
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll figure something out.

348
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,643
[SPEAKER_14]: We got an email from Ron Says Don't Call Him Cute.

349
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,567
[SPEAKER_10]: We call Ron... He was the young one.

350
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:12,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww, the cute little kid that emailed us a Pokemon.

351
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Next email from AZHP.

352
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:30,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that when I was listening to your podcast waiting for my vector calculus class to start, and Rob started playing Blow My Whistle, I inadvertently began bobbing my head, and before I knew it, I was breakdancing outside the classroom.

353
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:31,946
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the music stopped.

354
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:33,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I was sad.

355
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad face.

356
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:44,572
[SPEAKER_14]: But it brought back great memories of playing that song on Max 2, and for that I wanted to thank you guys for making my day and confusing the hell out of everyone else around me.

357
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:45,793
[SPEAKER_14]: We lived confused.

358
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:56,201
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, but if you think that that song gets stuck in your head when you hear a little bit of it and makes you want to bob your head, we can do worse.

359
00:27:57,663 --> 00:27:58,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but I do, I do, I do.

360
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,946
[SPEAKER_14]: That song was horrible.

361
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Next email!

362
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, yes.

363
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:03,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear LLR crew,

364
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:16,928
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, congratulations to DarkSakura for graduating and getting certified.

365
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:17,328
[SPEAKER_14]: You rock.

366
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:18,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, thank you.

367
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, someone else says it.

368
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:25,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I recently moved very near Sacramento, California, where I understand your fine program is produced.

369
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Being gamers of notable breadth, I was curious if you could solve a conundrum.

370
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:33,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I found myself a dude who used conundrum in an email.

371
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, the funny guy moved to our neck of the woods?

372
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:37,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

373
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:42,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I still remember getting an email a while back where he invited us out to dinner, but it was like, I think the same week we all went to Disneyland.

374
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:42,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was.

375
00:28:44,582 --> 00:29:11,416
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems that I have recently begun to crave pinball mightily, and while I seem to have a number of excellent software pinball solutions, I wish to operate a proper table with flippers and steel balls, and lanes and bumpers in popular culture tie-ins and sampled sound effects and clever magnetic mechanisms that look like giant hands that come out of boxes or tyrannosaurs that eat pinballs or the Death Star.

376
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:18,972
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my understanding that such things have become rare and difficult to locate, and so I put the question to you, where might I find good local pinball?

377
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Not at RBGL, shit.

378
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there's a PS on here.

379
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,676
[SPEAKER_14]: My profound thanks, WarriorBob.

380
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:30,438
[SPEAKER_14]: PS, having listened to this show for some time, I do realize that one answer is Jamie's house.

381
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:35,141
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think I should continue searching in the interest of not being really fucking creepy.

382
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:38,563
[SPEAKER_14]: PPS, Byright promised me pinball once that they were liars.

383
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Byright's a piece of crap!

384
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:42,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Scandia had a bunch of machines.

385
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:44,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been there in a long time, though.

386
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, off Madison and I-80.

387
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen the weird thing that they've got up there now?

388
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Their new little, like, we're gonna throw you up in the air thing?

389
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:52,174
[SPEAKER_10]: That ride they have?

390
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:53,355
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing is scary looking.

391
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:56,238
[SPEAKER_11]: As if you were afraid of, like, oncoming traffic hitting you.

392
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:58,420
[SPEAKER_10]: What a fucking eyesore that thing is, too.

393
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I know this will make sense to no one outside the Sacramento area, but my god, Scandia has got this new ride called...

394
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,868
[SPEAKER_10]: The motherfucking eyesore.

395
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:09,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you drive by that thing, you feel like you're being blinded.

396
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,292
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called the pooflinger.

397
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:12,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, email, right?

398
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:13,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, but I want to say real quick.

399
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:18,500
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I went to Scandia, which granted was a couple years ago, they have like seven pinball machines there.

400
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,881
[SPEAKER_14]: RVGL's machines are shit.

401
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:20,902
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have anything now.

402
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:21,924
[SPEAKER_10]: They have like two machines.

403
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:27,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, the best place in the entirety of the city to play pinball is my house.

404
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:29,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not even joking.

405
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:30,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I sadly wouldn't doubt that.

406
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:36,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, it really, she has like at least six or seven operational machines and they're free.

407
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:43,043
[SPEAKER_14]: At present, I have, and not all of them are mine because unfortunately Dan's friend Will doesn't have anywhere to store the machines.

408
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,364
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a Bride of Pinbot.

409
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,426
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got, what else do I have?

410
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:56,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I have Bride of Pinbot, Judge Dredd, Whodunit, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Guns and Roses, Star Trek The Next Generation.

411
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:56,871
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck?

412
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:57,812
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that?

413
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:01,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Xtifer and Nelly are in here because they're waiting for Match Game.

414
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:03,838
[SPEAKER_10]: And since we haven't acknowledged them on air yet, they haven't been able to talk.

415
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:07,680
[SPEAKER_10]: They're passing notes back and forth, so I confiscated the note like a teacher.

416
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:12,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently Xtifer wrote on it, I heart penis, and actually drew a little penis.

417
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:13,344
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Nelly.

418
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was Nelly.

419
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,126
[SPEAKER_10]: But then Xtifer drew this little... It looks like a bone.

420
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,487
[SPEAKER_10]: But then it drew I heart bunny.

421
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,569
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's this picture of a bunny there.

422
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:21,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's supposed to be a cat.

423
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,270
[SPEAKER_10]: With a teeny tiny penis.

424
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,952
[SPEAKER_10]: With a big arrow pointing at the teeny tiny penis.

425
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:26,533
What?

426
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Only X can bring this show to a screeching halt.

427
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email!

428
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I was still answering his question.

429
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:42,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I've also got Twilight Zone, which is a bitch.

430
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny Mnemonic and Creature from the Black Lagoon.

431
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, those are the best places to play pinball.

432
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:50,194
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to play, you've got my number.

433
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:53,155
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't be creepy if you call.

434
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:54,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I have friends at my house.

435
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,340
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not creepy to have a friend over at your house.

436
00:31:58,401 --> 00:32:01,582
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura owns a gun anyway, so she'll... I own several.

437
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:02,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And knives.

438
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:04,964
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know how to use them.

439
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you think I'm joking, no.

440
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:12,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually... Did I tell you what I asked for Christmas last year, Rob?

441
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:14,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Knife-wielding snakes.

442
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,811
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I asked for a Beretta.

443
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:17,192
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have a gun spork.

444
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:19,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more emails?

445
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:20,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

446
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:21,715
[SPEAKER_14]: There's three more.

447
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:23,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

448
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

449
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:29,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, OLR.

450
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:31,653
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I want to say that I love the podcast.

451
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:33,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you guys continue it for a long time.

452
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:38,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I just purchased a fairly high-end PC, and I'm wondering what games for it.

453
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:53,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a newcomer to the PC gaming world and was wondering what good titles are out there that, A, appropriate for my two 13-year-old sons, rated T or lower, but not something that would bore them like Roller Coaster Tycoon, B, do not have a frustrating learning curve, C, are $25 American or less.

454
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,843
[SPEAKER_14]: and Dee do not have a monthly fee such as World of Warcraft.

455
00:32:58,903 --> 00:32:59,724
[SPEAKER_14]: That about covers it.

456
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:00,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, GamerDad.

457
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:06,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I would suggest that if you are looking for some type of MMO, Guild Wars would be perfect.

458
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,912
[SPEAKER_14]: It is over $25.

459
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:13,776
[SPEAKER_14]: However, you will not have a registration fee.

460
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:16,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Aren't there parental controls available for Guild Wars?

461
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,461
[SPEAKER_10]: You can censor the dirty language and stuff.

462
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:20,582
[SPEAKER_14]: You can censor it out.

463
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:25,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, after having played Guild Wars, I think it would be a good investment.

464
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:32,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Considering that I pay $14 a month for World of Warcraft, after four months you've paid for the game, pretty much.

465
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:39,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was going to say, you said that you have a high-end gaming PC.

466
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume that you don't have a Mac.

467
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:47,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would recommend that you play, I don't know, actually Star Wars Battlefront 2 maybe.

468
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,900
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bit old and it might be cheap now.

469
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Zappi is suggesting Maple Stories is free.

470
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:58,545
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good one, Maple Story, and it would be very appropriate for a younger age.

471
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,466
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can buy Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod, Tetranet.

472
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:00,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetranet.

473
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:02,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that kind of a violent game?

474
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:25,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you said the Rollercoaster Tycoon would bore them, but Civilization is a heck of a lot of fun.

475
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it when I was 12, the original one.

476
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:21,289
[SPEAKER_14]: and use that as your criteria.

477
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, you have any suggestions?

478
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:23,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw one.

479
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:30,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Seg was saying Sam and Max, even though that the first episode is $32, each of the following are only $9.

480
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:42,735
[SPEAKER_00]: And they play in short little six or seven, you know, just a few hour bursts, which is kind of nice, especially if you want to limit your kids' time on the computer to like, you know, an hour or so.

481
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:48,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give them a little bit more play time throughout the whole thing versus other games where it's, you know, takes...

482
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:57,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't kill me, but I hear the Nancy Drew games are actually a lot of fun, even for kids, boy or girl.

483
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do really well.

484
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

485
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:05,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten emails from people that play them and say they're actually not that bad.

486
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,147
[SPEAKER_10]: That you'd think they're lame because it's Nancy Drew and there's also the movie.

487
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:10,668
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently Danger by Design and all that stuff, not bad.

488
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:11,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Not bad.

489
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:13,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

490
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:14,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

491
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I was incorrect about the price, and I'm getting corrected here.

492
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:22,612
[SPEAKER_00]: The season is $32, and each episode is $9, so you actually save a bit of money by buying the season.

493
00:36:23,072 --> 00:36:27,255
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I said it's still a really good game, and it's kid-friendly.

494
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:29,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you get GameTap.

495
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:39,485
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, also, keep in mind that there is a wide, wide world of freeware, of emulation to choose from.

496
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:43,748
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I would say, you know, really...

497
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:51,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Take those interests and look for things that associate with those interests that are within your price frame and have the criteria.

498
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:56,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, now, one thing to be warned about is that if you go to somewhere... Okay, Rob.

499
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Hero, I heart, pussy, Hitler.

500
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a picture of a little Hitler face wearing a pussy on this page.

501
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to pretend I never saw that.

502
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to confiscate this note?

503
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:13,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Frame it.

504
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:13,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang it on your fridge.

505
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:15,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Amanda needs to see Pussy Hitler.

506
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let Amanda guard it for me.

507
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Gamer Dad.

508
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:24,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm moving away from you because I completely lost my train of thought.

509
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:25,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Gamer Dad.

510
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:26,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Blame Rob.

511
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,749
[SPEAKER_10]: You and your 13-year-old kids sound pretty cool, but we got Pussy Hitler in studio.

512
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,590
[SPEAKER_14]: He said both of his sons were 13.

513
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:33,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if they're twins.

514
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:34,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

515
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:38,092
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe you should look into multiplayer things, things that they can play together, too.

516
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:41,974
[SPEAKER_14]: So, from the Rob D.,

517
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:49,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I just listened to your April Fool's Day joke, and I gotta say, I'm cracking up like crazy.

518
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:56,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I really shouldn't be laughing at a bunch of giggling, but the intro of Roberta and Matilda sent me over the edge.

519
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Good idea, and it was pretty funny.

520
00:37:58,951 --> 00:37:59,611
[SPEAKER_14]: That said, Ms.

521
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:02,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man should never be referred to as the ultimate diva in gaming, besides Ms.

522
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:03,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man isn't a lesbian.

523
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:08,335
[SPEAKER_14]: She's just an independent woman in an open relationship.

524
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:09,876
[SPEAKER_14]: She and Pac-Man have a kid.

525
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you remember the old cartoons?

526
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, they did suck.

527
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Goki was a better name.

528
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Ermac.

529
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:37,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for putting together a good, well-informed show.

530
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:42,657
[SPEAKER_14]: OLR has become a weekly fixture on my iPod, and its space on there is well-deserved.

531
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:46,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep on producing the high-quality show that you always do, and I'll keep on listening.

532
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Smile face.

533
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:48,181
[SPEAKER_14]: The rubdy.

534
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Roberta's really glad to hear that you're a big fan.

535
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:52,484
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound like Christy Alley.

536
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:55,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And you should look into a game called Pussy Hitler.

537
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,168
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Loki said it best.

538
00:38:58,188 --> 00:38:59,189
[SPEAKER_14]: You sounded like Christy Alley.

539
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:00,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

540
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't have to do a damn thing.

541
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:10,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to sound like a stuck-up bitch, but I seriously was let down by most of the Internet's April Fool's joke this year.

542
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:12,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we seriously have one of the better ones.

543
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:12,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

544
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:14,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be a stuck-up bitch.

545
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:15,535
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a great joke.

546
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:17,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that mine were great.

547
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:19,256
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get more people to dig it, by the way.

548
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,637
[SPEAKER_10]: So visit dig.com and dig our episode.

549
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,258
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, Rob, this is not a joke.

550
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:27,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to show you all something right now, now that the emails are done.

551
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:29,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.

552
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:37,856
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're digging in there, I just want to say I liked LiveJournal's April Fool's because they poked fun at MySpace, which was kind of amusing.

553
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:39,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to touch it?

554
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:41,919
Oh.

555
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:43,800
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a joke.

556
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Who wants to touch it?

557
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, it's the Christmas check finally making its way.

558
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:53,666
[SPEAKER_10]: It got stuck up in processing, so now we can make use of the money now finally.

559
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:57,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's going to go into a savings account until we get our business account filled up.

560
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:58,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Fun, fun, fun.

561
00:39:58,869 --> 00:39:59,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

562
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:06,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to offer another very, very public thank you to Kristen for being, like, freaking rad.

563
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, now I'm done.

564
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:11,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a big fan of Pussy Hitler.

565
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:13,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what?

566
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, yeah, the 8-bit tie was awesome.

567
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:18,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I heard they're going to make it for real.

568
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:19,659
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

569
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:20,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I want one.

570
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's going to buy me the 8-bit tie?

571
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:25,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, chat.orangelonsradio.com if you want to join our chat room.

572
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:30,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave you the link there to dig where the giggling lesbian show can be dug.

573
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Bandit says, I think DDR Freak is dead.

574
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:34,907
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have one this year.

575
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, whatever happened to that?

576
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,548
[SPEAKER_14]: They did have one.

577
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:40,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob found the joke, so Rob wins a no prize.

578
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:12,411
[SPEAKER_14]: for anyone who is an old... Okay, I do not want to see anything having to do with someone's ass.

579
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:14,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop, okay.

580
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:15,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Extrovert Drew.

581
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:17,152
[SPEAKER_14]: We have extrovert Nelly in the room.

582
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:20,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they can talk and not pass giggling schoolgirl notes with penises.

583
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:22,673
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but it says, I heart mangina.

584
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:25,174
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like goat say that he drew on there.

585
00:41:25,674 --> 00:41:29,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we please talk about video games for like five seconds so we can play match game and you fools can leave?

586
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:30,655
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

587
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:31,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Heart.

588
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:32,696
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

589
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick, more video game stories.

590
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:36,644
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's about violence.

591
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody likes violence.

592
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's see.

593
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:49,627
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a study recently that was done that looked at 120 children before and after a 20-minute Quake 2 session.

594
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:53,748
[SPEAKER_10]: The study was done by Swineburn University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.

595
00:41:55,368 --> 00:42:01,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And it said that while the aggressive children were more or less aggressive, depending on their emotional state before playing,

596
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:05,730
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of kids were not affected by the game violence at all.

597
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, as long as you don't let your kids be violent, then they won't act out on it after they play a video game.

598
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Who would have thought?

599
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Who would have thunk it?

600
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:39,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, well, I wouldn't say everybody loves violent games.

601
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I like violent games, I don't know who wouldn't.

602
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:50,256
[SPEAKER_11]: But apparently the Parappa the Rapper creator, he wants less violent games, more rhythm and fast TV.

603
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:58,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but... Anyways, apparently Masaya Matsuura, creator of Parappa the Rapper...

604
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:00,182
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I've got.

605
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:00,662
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I've got.

606
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: He was praising Nintendo's philosophy of attracting non-traditional gamers and also basically said at the recent Australian GO3 conference, making good games that everybody can play is a very high priority.

607
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:34,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

608
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:36,573
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.

609
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:43,799
[SPEAKER_11]: He was saying also that he wants faster TVs because I guess he's talking about the delay between, you know, how some TVs have a little bit of a delay on them.

610
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:46,329
[SPEAKER_11]: More rhythm games.

611
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:46,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Who would have thought it?

612
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,211
[SPEAKER_10]: How about we just get another Parappa sequel?

613
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:52,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I hit myself in the chin.

614
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:54,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be okay with another Parappa sequel.

615
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:55,672
[SPEAKER_10]: More Parappa!

616
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:57,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Put your money where your mouth is, jerk.

617
00:43:58,493 --> 00:43:59,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, guess what?

618
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:01,534
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

619
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:02,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Chicken butt.

620
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:12,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, they have signed up, though, and honestly, I don't really give two shits about the game, because I really don't give two shits about the movie either.

621
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:20,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter Cullen and Frank Welker have been signed to play Optimus Prime and Megatron for the Transformers game.

622
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:21,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, now, now.

623
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:27,341
[SPEAKER_11]: The new trailers, or not new trailers, the commercial spots that they have for it, the one that shows Starscream is fucking awesome.

624
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:28,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

625
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:29,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Why all the hate for Transformers?

626
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:41,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Because seeing the old trailers, the ones that they had out at first, made part of my Transformers fangirl heart die a little bit inside.

627
00:44:42,865 --> 00:45:11,353
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe I'm gonna see it I haven't said I'm not gonna see it I will and I'll reserve my judgment my final judgment for when I see it but right now it doesn't seem right so I don't know but if Starscream is fucking awesome as usual because I had lots of fangirlism for Starscream when I was little so it better if it's cool then I'll go see it it's awesome and they have it I think it's on the internet

628
00:45:12,216 --> 00:45:13,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Too bad his voice actor's dead.

629
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:15,977
[SPEAKER_14]: He was Cobra Commander.

630
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:17,757
[SPEAKER_11]: COBRA!

631
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:42,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to have a show where Loki does nothing but impressions for the whole show.

632
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:43,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be awesome.

633
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:46,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

634
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:49,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Drink like some Drano and then you'll sound like him.

635
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright kids, do you know what time it is?

636
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice cream!

637
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,701
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but almost as good.

638
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:04,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to play the match game!

639

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the way match, wouldn't that be funny if no one called?

643

[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy, what's on your mind, buddy?

647
00:46:52,063 --> 00:46:54,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just hoping I don't lose at the match game.

[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well you got in first, congratulations, you're going to play a match game with us tonight.

650
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,307
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright, people usually don't here on the match game, but that's alright.

663
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:15,764

701
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,110
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

702
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you want me to play the game as Roberta?

703
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:53,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we don't like Christy Alley.

704
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:54,314
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

705
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:56,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm playing... Christy Alley, whatever.

706
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:59,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my charity is the Save Fat Actress TV Show Foundation.

707
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:01,180
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my charity.

708
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,143
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so... Oh, we had a guy on the phone.

709
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:05,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy, are you still there, or did you hang up?

710
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, I'm still here.

711
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:07,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Zappy.

712
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:08,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So, do you know how the game works?

713
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:09,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

714
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:13,711
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to be asking you some questions, and you've got to tell us what goes in the blank...

715
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:15,279
[SPEAKER_10]: and everybody here in studio.

716
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:19,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Does everybody have a piece of paper to write on or going to think or what about the answer?

717
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:21,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I will try to remember.

718
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:21,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

719
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:25,508
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys are stuck thinking for things, you can always ask the chat room for hints.

720
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:26,548
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready for your first clue?

721
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:27,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

722
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:28,390
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.

723
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, don't shout it out, Zappy.

724
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:33,334
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to let the celebrities think first, but you can think during the music here.

725
00:50:33,374 --> 00:50:34,936
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here is question number one.

726
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,657
[SPEAKER_10]: There's four questions tonight.

727
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:42,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2 but got a defective controller.

728
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

729
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:54,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know, I'll make this game more exciting.

730
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

731
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:06,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob is enjoying Guitar Hero 2, but got a defective controller.

732
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:09,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob's so lazy, though, he didn't want to send the controller back.

733
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:13,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob thought Guitar Hero could be much more fun anyway, and thought to himself, I know,

734
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:14,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make this game more exciting.

735
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:17,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll install five fret buttons on a blank.

736
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:18,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Celebrities are thinking.

737
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:25,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm gonna say, ding.

738
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

739
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:27,532
Mandarin's thinking.

740
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,633
Mandarin's doing research on Wikipedia.

741
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:30,914
Alright, Mandarin's...

742
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:45,107
[SPEAKER_10]: X4, you good?

743
00:51:46,508 --> 00:51:47,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

744
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you good?

745
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

746
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:50,832
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

747
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:53,354
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here it is.

748
00:51:54,555 --> 00:51:56,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to make sure our chatter got it, too.

749
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:56,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there we go.

750
00:51:56,918 --> 00:51:57,518
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.

751
00:51:57,538 --> 00:52:00,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have an answer, Zappy, yet?

752
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:01,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

753
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:01,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here we go.

754
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:02,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

755
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:04,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make this game more exciting.

756
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll install five fret buttons on a... Dildo.

757
00:52:08,513 --> 00:52:10,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Dildo, says Zappy.

758
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope the chatroom doesn't fail me.

759
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:12,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Good answer.

760
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:13,876
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there we go.

761
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:16,138
[SPEAKER_10]: And GS68 said, Weemote.

762
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:19,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Dildo and Weemote.

763
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go around and see who's a match.

764
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, what did you get for an answer?

765
00:52:24,023 --> 00:52:24,784
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very close.

766
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:26,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a gigantic horse dildo.

767
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:28,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Gigantic horse dildo.

768
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:29,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Judges.

769
00:52:29,807 --> 00:52:30,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

770
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:31,708
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, good job.

771
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:32,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy, off to a great start.

772
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,070
[SPEAKER_10]: You matched on the very first one.

773
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,070
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

774
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:35,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Extifer.

775
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:36,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Extifer.

776
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Five fret buttons on A?

777
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:40,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I said strand of asshole hair.

778
00:52:41,678 --> 00:52:43,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Strand of asshole hair.

779
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, okay.

780
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Dirty asshole hair.

781
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how I got that one.

782
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I get that one, judges?

783
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:54,105
[SPEAKER_10]: No, unfortunately no, because that's already there and a dildo is a foreign object.

784
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:54,446
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

785
00:52:55,426 --> 00:53:02,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly, I'll put five fret buttons on A. The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.

786
00:53:05,888 --> 00:53:08,711
[SPEAKER_10]: The tip of a tailbone of a pregnant Ethiopian baby.

787
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:11,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, that is not a match, but that was a good answer.

788
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:25,886
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, I'll install five fret buttons on A. You know, I was going to say the industry of dildonics is not really one to make a lot of gaming peripherals, but they should, so I said dildo.

789
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:28,589
[SPEAKER_10]: and Dildo, another match for Zappy.

790
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:29,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Zappy.

791
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Two to nothing.

792
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:32,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, GS68.

793
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,993
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you get for playing the game legitimately, I guess.

794
00:53:35,454 --> 00:53:36,114
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

795
00:53:36,354 --> 00:53:40,937
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually said a gigantic rubber cock, so it's the same thing.

796
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:41,537
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

797
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Dildo, three to nothing.

798
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:43,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding, ding, ding.

799
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:44,239
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

800
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:44,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, Zappy.

801
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,801
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing a lot better than you thought you would.

802
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:47,521
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

803
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,584
[SPEAKER_10]: My answer was, well, I wasn't going to say Dildo because this is my thing.

804
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:53,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I said a Pringles can because I like food.

805
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:54,765
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

806
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:57,563
[SPEAKER_10]: 5 red buttons on a Pringles can.

807
00:53:57,683 --> 00:54:01,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that I expanded for this.

808
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:02,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

809
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Did expanded give you that answer?

810
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:05,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

811
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:05,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

812
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:12,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Pringles cans, you know, Pringles suck as snacks, so I guess the can would be worth some.

813
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:15,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, GS68, do not admit defeat just yet.

814
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:19,135
[SPEAKER_10]: You still have some more questions, and here's the next question for everybody.

815
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:19,475
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

816
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:20,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

817
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:21,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Question number two.

818
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:23,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki...

819
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:31,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Thought he had made nice with Namco Bandai when they gave him tickets to attend this year's E3 event.

820
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:42,333
[SPEAKER_10]: When Loki walked through the door, though, he realized Namco had had the last laugh when he exclaimed, Wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.

821
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:51,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki thought he had made nice when he got tickets to this year's E3 event.

822
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,082
[SPEAKER_10]: But when he walked through the door, he realized that Namco had the last laugh.

823
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:58,004
[SPEAKER_10]: He exclaimed, wait a minute, this isn't E3, this is a blank.

824
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:11,732
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't E3, this is a blank.

825
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:15,474
[SPEAKER_10]: The celebrities are having a hard time understanding the question.

826
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:18,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just have to, like, do charades or something.

827
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:22,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I did straight.

828
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:23,846
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

829
00:55:25,146 --> 00:55:26,207
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an E3.

830
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:26,987
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a blank.

831
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,848
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura needs clarification.

832
00:55:29,428 --> 00:55:29,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

833
00:55:29,728 --> 00:55:31,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like me to interpretive dance it for you?

834
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:32,389
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

835
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:32,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

836
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:33,670
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

837
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you understand the question, Zappy?

838
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:35,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I crazy?

839
00:55:36,531 --> 00:55:37,591
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I completely understand.

840
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:37,792
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

841
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:38,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

842
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:38,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not crazy.

843
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:39,092
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

844
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:40,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding.

845
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:41,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding.

846
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:41,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly, ding.

847
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:42,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Extrovert, ding.

848
00:55:42,974 --> 00:55:43,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, ding.

849
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, ding.

850
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:45,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, ding.

851
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:46,455
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

852
00:55:46,495 --> 00:55:46,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

853
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:48,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy.

854
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:54,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki exclaimed, this is an E3, this is a... Porno convention.

855
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:57,145
[SPEAKER_10]: A porno convention.

856
00:55:57,245 --> 00:56:01,026
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and GS68 said, a gay bar.

857
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,047
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so we have porno convention and gay bar.

858
00:56:04,547 --> 00:56:06,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, what did you say?

859
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:12,650
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an E3, this is a... I think they both might actually get it, because mine's a combination, a gay orgy.

860
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,891
[SPEAKER_10]: A gay orgy, not going to work.

861
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:18,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Mandarin, but that was a good answer.

862
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:24,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Xtifer, this is an E3, this is... A Frankie Muniz convention.

863
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,856
[SPEAKER_10]: A Frankie Muniz convention.

864
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:31,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all the rage, and judges, that might be porno.

865
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:34,519
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like a gay bar, but no, it doesn't work.

866
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:48,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Nelly, this is an E3, this is a... The funny thing is, is like they were both in my brain, but I decided to go with an all-naked girl convention who all went to have sex with Loki, but he brought his wife.

867
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,313
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura,

868
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:21,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Orgy of Suck.

869
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:25,906
[SPEAKER_10]: An orgy of suck that's almost like a gay bar, but no.

870
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:27,067
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

871
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:32,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And why would I be disappointed that it would be like an orgy with tons of women or something?

872
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:36,211
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, damn, why is there all these women here?

873
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:37,051
[SPEAKER_11]: This sucks.

874
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:38,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are the games?

875
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:38,792
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

876
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:39,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Although maybe I would say that.

877
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:42,334
[SPEAKER_10]: My answer, this is an E3.

878
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,415
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a gay bathhouse.

879
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:45,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

880
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a match with gay bar?

881
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:47,917
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

882
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's about as close to a gay bar as a Frankie Muniz convention.

883
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:00,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would they have a Frankie Muniz convention?

884
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:01,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly says yes, I say yes.

885
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura says no, Loki says no.

886
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:08,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, GS68.

887
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:10,551
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Loki said yes.

888
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:14,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Gay bathhouse and gay bar, are they the same thing, DarkSakura?

889
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,288
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

890
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:35,279
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true, they do have a pool.

891
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:43,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Because with the match game, the person who matches the people that he got right before doesn't get those people choosing for him again.

892
00:58:43,244 --> 00:58:46,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Only in certain years they did that, and then they didn't do that in a few years.

893
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:47,347
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cheating, then.

894
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:47,947
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.

895
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:48,527
[SPEAKER_12]: You're cheating.

896
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up, Nellie.

897
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:50,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, look.

898
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,252
[SPEAKER_10]: If I wanted a woman to run things around here, I'd hit her until she did it.

899
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:55,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob!

900
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:56,673
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

901
00:58:57,293 --> 00:58:58,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Get in your place.

902
00:58:59,254 --> 00:58:59,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Answer the thing.

903
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:00,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Miss Jamie.

904
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:02,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, question.

905
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:02,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

906
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:05,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Watch it all break out the paddle again.

907
00:59:05,435 --> 00:59:06,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Question number three.

908
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,037
[SPEAKER_14]: The Robby Goodstick.

909
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:10,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is a question about Jamie.

910
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,100
[SPEAKER_10]: This should be good.

911
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,061
Yay!

912
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,222
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, Zappy?

913
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:14,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

914
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:14,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Three to one.

915
00:59:14,663 --> 00:59:15,784
[SPEAKER_10]: You feeling the heat a little bit?

916
00:59:16,525 --> 00:59:17,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not ready.

917
00:59:17,185 --> 00:59:17,545
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

918
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:18,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

919
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:24,412
[SPEAKER_10]: While strolling through the flea market, Jamie came across a pinbot machine for sale.

920
00:59:25,372 --> 00:59:30,597
[SPEAKER_10]: The machine costs $1,000, though, which is more than what Jamie had in her bank account.

921
00:59:31,618 --> 00:59:39,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Being the ever-clever game collector and negotiator, though, Jamie told the salesman, I really want that pinbot machine.

922
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I would trade you my blank for it.

923
00:59:46,486 --> 00:59:47,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's my music?

924
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:53,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want that pinbot machine.

925
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I would trade you my blank for it.

926
00:59:57,532 --> 00:59:57,892
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

927
00:59:58,572 --> 01:00:00,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Dang, this one's easy for me.

928
01:00:01,707 --> 01:00:02,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh, did I copy-paste that to GS68?

929
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:08,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, never mind, he got it anyway.

930
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:10,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I would trade you my blank for it.

931
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:11,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding.

932
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,170
[SPEAKER_10]: X-Force said ding.

933
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding.

934
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:16,931
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura?

935
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:17,511
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

936
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:19,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That was quick.

937
01:00:20,432 --> 01:00:23,492
[SPEAKER_10]: When the question's about Jamie, it looks like everybody's ready to go.

938
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:25,073
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I would trade you my blank for it.

939
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:29,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy, I would trade you my... Massage table.

940
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Massage Table.

941
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:33,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Massage Table.

942
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,490
[SPEAKER_10]: That is something very precious to her.

943
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,532
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, GS68 said... I mean, it's funny since I actually don't own one yet.

944
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:46,034
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 said, I would trade you my virginity for it, which is even more hilarious.

945
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:47,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is great because it'll got me.

946
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:47,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha.

947
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:52,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be... Well, what about your behind virginity?

948
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:56,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Ew, we're not going there, Rob.

949
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:57,860
[SPEAKER_10]: How about your behind virginity?

950
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:03,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, you just ruined my answer.

951
01:01:03,433 --> 01:01:03,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, shut up.

952
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin.

953
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:08,715
[SPEAKER_10]: We have virginity and massage table.

954
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:10,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I want that pinball machine.

955
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:14,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I would trade you my... Some cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky.

956
01:01:15,657 --> 01:01:17,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Cash plus massage services as long as he wasn't icky for it.

957
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:19,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a match with massage table?

958
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,020
[SPEAKER_14]: That goes with massage services.

959
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I say no.

960
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:24,961
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a half a point.

961
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:26,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a point!

962
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:27,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I say no.

963
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:30,405
[SPEAKER_00]: The table is what you do it with.

964
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

965
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:31,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Half a point for Zappy.

966
01:01:32,686 --> 01:01:33,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm outvoted.

967
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:34,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Half a point.

968
01:01:34,948 --> 01:01:36,689
[SPEAKER_10]: See, now I have to write half.

969
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:37,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there we go.

970
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:38,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Extra fur.

971
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:39,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I want that pin on me.

972
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:42,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I went for the most obvious.

973
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:48,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I said a strand of Frankie Muniz's asshole hair in a Pringles can convention.

974
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:55,199
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing that DarkSakura actually owns one of those too as part of her collection.

975
01:01:57,123 --> 01:02:00,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankie Munoz's ass... She wasn't even listening, which is the best part.

976
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:02,786
[SPEAKER_10]: A strand of Frankie Munoz's asshole hair in a Pringles can.

977
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:07,188
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's actually one of my prized treasures.

978
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:13,090
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Nellie, I would trade you a... I was going to say butt virginity, but you ruined it.

979
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,411
[SPEAKER_10]: B-Imon, all right.

980
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:17,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, well, see, I would have matched.

981
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:18,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have got a point.

982
01:02:18,232 --> 01:02:25,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I would trade you my... Well, where would, you know, one of these games be if I didn't say Iraqi Suicide Babies?

983
01:02:26,381 --> 01:02:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Iraqi Suicide Baby, which DarkSakura also happens to own one.

984
01:02:30,903 --> 01:02:35,344
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, I would trade you my husband for it.

985
01:02:36,905 --> 01:02:40,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And my answer was, I really want that pinball machine.

986
01:02:40,266 --> 01:02:42,327
[SPEAKER_10]: I would trade you my husband for it.

987
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:44,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I also said husband, so there it is.

988
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:46,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Husband was the answer to go with in that round.

989
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:47,749
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

990
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:49,690
[SPEAKER_10]: One more question.

991
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:50,830
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, Zappy?

992
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

993
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:52,111
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

994
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:55,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if GS68 gets two and a half points, you're fucked.

995
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:14,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Xtifer played the Lord of the Rings online MMO game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.

996
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:20,743
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?

997
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:25,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank messages.

998
01:03:31,778 --> 01:03:32,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Lord of the Rings.

999
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:36,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

1000
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:52,512
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, GS68 has an answer.

1001
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:53,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ding.

1002
01:03:53,293 --> 01:03:57,135
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the other celebrities?

1003
01:03:57,175 --> 01:03:59,277
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let me read the question again, see if it inspires some folks.

1004
01:04:00,282 --> 01:04:04,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Extover played the Lord of the Rings online game this week and didn't think very positively of the game.

1005
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:09,007
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought it was so terrible that he posted in his blog, Lord of the Rings?

1006
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:12,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me blank.

1007
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:20,615
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the best song ever.

1008
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:26,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Nelly finally dinged.

1009
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:26,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Extover?

1010
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:27,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, ding.

1011
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:29,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, eh, ding.

1012
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,400
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1013
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:32,259
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some very apathetic celebrities.

1014
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Last question, though.

1015
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:33,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1016
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:36,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Before this segment gets drawn on way too long, as if it hasn't already.

1017
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:37,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy.

1018
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Lord of the Rings.

1019
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... A slut.

1020
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:44,702
[SPEAKER_10]: A slut.

1021
01:04:45,522 --> 01:04:45,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1022
01:04:46,002 --> 01:04:46,462
[SPEAKER_10]: A slut.

1023
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:46,962
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1024
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:52,864
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, I wouldn't play that game unless the creator sent me a trans vibrator.

1025
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:56,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that would make Lord of the Rings game a res trans vibrator.

1026
01:04:56,404 --> 01:04:56,624
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1027
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we get a slut or a trans vibrator matching.

1028
01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:04,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, I wouldn't play that game again unless a creator sent me... Pussy.

1029
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Pussy!

1030
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:07,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a match for slut?

1031
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where you're coming from.

1032
01:05:10,302 --> 01:05:11,803
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because the slut could be male or female.

1033
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:16,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Extifer, true story though, you did play the game, right?

1034
01:05:16,304 --> 01:05:16,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1035
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:17,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And it sucked?

1036
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:18,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucked balls.

1037
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:20,026
[SPEAKER_10]: What was so bad about it?

1038
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:26,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the whole part where it actually sucked my balls was pretty bad.

1039
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I don't like purple balls.

1040
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:31,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're going to suck my balls, be gentle.

1041
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me my butt virginity back.

1042
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:45,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm pretty loose down there.

1043
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a lot of cocks in my asshole.

1044
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:55,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this show sucks.

1045
01:05:56,336 --> 01:05:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit just falls right out of me.

1046
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's horrible.

1047
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:02,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I should get a colostomy bag.

1048
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:17,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless your creator's chatroom is just exploding with, oh my god, oh god, oh.

1049
01:06:17,845 --> 01:06:21,226
[SPEAKER_10]: That little click you heard was thousands of iPods across the nation shutting off.

1050
01:06:21,987 --> 01:06:25,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Not because of the show, but because Apple sucks.

1051
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:39,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly, I wouldn't play that game again unless the creator sent me... His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.

1052
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:42,510
[SPEAKER_10]: His firstborn is a sacrifice in honor of Passover.

1053
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,991
[SPEAKER_10]: A very good Jewish answer from you, Nelly, but unfortunately not a match.

1054
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:56,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I would not play that game again unless the creator sent me... I was just going to go with what Christopher has been saying all along, you know, Frankie Muna's butt hair in a Pringles can.

1055
01:06:57,215 --> 01:06:58,836
[SPEAKER_10]: In a Pringles can, all right.

1056
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:01,107
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1057
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:02,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And NakedSweatyManslut.

1058
01:07:03,168 --> 01:07:04,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And NakedSweatyManslut.

1059
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:05,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a match with slut.

1060
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1061
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So Zappy, you got another point.

1062
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:14,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mandarin should get it because pussy is a slut.

1063
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:15,372
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that doesn't count.

1064
01:07:15,772 --> 01:07:17,213
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura actually used the word slut.

1065
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:17,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

1066
01:07:17,713 --> 01:07:24,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy's still going to win anyway because GS68 would somehow have to get match four points with my one answer, which I don't see happening.

1067
01:07:25,116 --> 01:07:27,337
[SPEAKER_10]: But my answer, just so you know, was...

1068
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:33,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankie Munez as B. Hyman, which was not a match, but probably almost matched Loki's answer.

1069
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:38,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So Zappy, by a score of 4.5 to 1, you win!

1070
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:41,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I actually didn't do badly.

1071
01:07:42,134 --> 01:07:42,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you did pretty good.

1072
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:44,875
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the higher scores we've had in the match game.

1073
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:45,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

1074
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all thanks to the chat room.

1075
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:54,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and just think, you were a part of when Orange Lounge Radio lost all its subscriber base.

1076
01:07:55,057 --> 01:07:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel so special.

1077
01:07:56,758 --> 01:07:57,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well congratulations.

1078
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, when you get a MySpace account, let us know and we'll put you in our top, okay?

1079
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:01,562
Alright.

1080
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:04,204
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, we'll think of something else special for you, okay?

1081
01:08:04,724 --> 01:08:04,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

1082
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other comments you want to give?

1083
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:07,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Not really.

1084
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:09,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well have a good week, Zappy.

1085
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:10,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks.

1086
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:12,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, of course, as well to GS68.

1087
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:15,433
[SPEAKER_10]: A nice effort from GS68.

1088
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:19,055
[SPEAKER_10]: And Extifer and Nelly have left.

1089
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:20,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God.

1090
01:08:22,577 --> 01:08:25,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Normality can come back and resume with the program.

1091
01:08:26,659 --> 01:08:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1092
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back to some game news.

1093
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:43,967
[SPEAKER_10]: If this show just broke your Xbox 360, don't worry because Microsoft has changed their Xbox 360 warranty and repair program.

1094
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:50,210
[SPEAKER_10]: They will now give free shipping, post-service warranty additions, and more stuff.

1095
01:08:50,973 --> 01:08:54,294
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's see, I'm looking at another link here with some full details there.

1096
01:08:54,314 --> 01:09:01,395
[SPEAKER_10]: They do free shipping, a post-service warranty for 90 days, and they will get their original console back from Microsoft.

1097
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:06,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Faster service, you get it back within five business days, and other enhanced customer care operations.

1098
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,197
[SPEAKER_10]: A new pledge from Xbox to you for your three rings of death.

1099
01:09:12,878 --> 01:09:13,638
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have.

1100
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, some other fun stuff.

1101
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:28,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Armored Core 4 is now on Xbox Live, at least the marketplace, the demo, in case you haven't downloaded it in another territory like I did.

1102
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,723
[SPEAKER_11]: But you get to play three single-player missions and get to check that out.

1103
01:09:33,983 --> 01:09:35,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an okay average game.

1104
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:41,308
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, most of the Armored Core games were kind of like that anyway, so kind of worth checking out.

1105
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:45,631
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely a lot better than Chromehounds, that is for sure.

1106
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:48,253
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're looking for a mech combat game,

1107
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,000
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1108
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:49,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1109
01:09:50,681 --> 01:09:52,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it better than Chromehounds?

1110
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:53,083
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot faster.

1111
01:09:53,103 --> 01:09:56,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's three fucking buttons for boost, for God's sakes.

1112
01:09:56,925 --> 01:09:58,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, you know, overall it looks good.

1113
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:01,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Just Chromehounds is very slow.

1114
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:02,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Just slow in everything.

1115
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Are those three buttons, you know, sort of like the equivalent to why there are 600 words for snow in Inuit?

1116
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:17,258
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's because basically they have boost, they have overboost, which makes you go really fast, and then like a quick boost.

1117
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:20,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Quick Boost.

1118
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:23,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like dashing left and right and stuff.

1119
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:26,529
[SPEAKER_11]: The boost is basically the kind of hover and fly, kind of like jump jets.

1120
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:33,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the super boost is just, you know, your typical anime, you know, robot flying over the ocean type thing.

1121
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:36,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you put two explicit tags on a show?

1122
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:38,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering.

1123
01:10:39,251 --> 01:10:39,491
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1124
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:42,292
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, rated C for Christopher and N for Nelly.

1125
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:43,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, NC-17.

1126
01:10:43,812 --> 01:10:45,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody in chat already made that joke.

1127
01:10:45,493 --> 01:10:46,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly, Christopher, 17.

1128
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:47,373
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1129
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:48,273
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1130
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:50,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Skyplane will be open very soon, kids.

1131
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:55,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, for anyone who's interested in Lost Planet, there's a new map pack.

1132
01:10:56,117 --> 01:11:07,010
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the Hive Complex, which is a mine with tunnels and bridges on a torn up mountain, and Trial Point, which is a modern day office complex.

1133
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:13,880
[SPEAKER_14]: with a background of a busy day, you know, behind a busy city behind it.

1134
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:17,681
[SPEAKER_14]: You can download it on Live Marketplace.

1135
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it's already up.

1136
01:11:19,602 --> 01:11:20,642
[SPEAKER_14]: It was up there on the 6th.

1137
01:11:21,482 --> 01:11:22,942
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 400 Microsoft points.

1138
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:25,563
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'd say give it a try.

1139
01:11:25,603 --> 01:11:26,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Lost Planet's pretty cool.

1140
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:29,244
[SPEAKER_14]: That is all.

1141
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob.

1142
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm just checking the ratings right now.

1143
01:11:35,197 --> 01:11:38,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really did lose five listeners during the Match Game segment live.

1144
01:11:38,558 --> 01:11:38,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1145
01:11:41,058 --> 01:11:41,779
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

1146
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:42,999
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1147
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:45,799
[SPEAKER_10]: The Skype line is open.

1148
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:47,260
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1149
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:53,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, in seriousness, we usually start to lose a handful of people this late in the show.

1150
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:55,042
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1151
01:11:55,302 --> 01:11:59,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can always call us on the Skype line as well.

1152
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:01,243
[SPEAKER_10]: The username is Orange Lounge Radio.

1153
01:12:01,653 --> 01:12:11,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play something for you guys real, real quick, though, because DMN left us a message, because he's at SakuraCon right now, and he left us a quick voicemail we're going to play for you guys, because you can leave us voicemails during the week.

1154
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Matt, Jamie, and Rob.

1155
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is DMN.

1156
01:12:16,643 --> 01:12:19,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I am at SakuraCon, and my voice is almost shot.

1157
01:12:19,905 --> 01:12:27,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I was supposed to do a live show with the guys, and I didn't, because I got forced to run a Soul Calibur III tournament.

1158
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So I killed the guy who didn't do it, and yeah, we're all good.

1159
01:12:32,946 --> 01:12:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to leave a couple other voice messages here.

1160
01:12:38,249 --> 01:12:40,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully one more from Closing Ceremonies.

1161
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, he hasn't done yet.

1162
01:12:41,451 --> 01:12:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you guys to know how much people love Orange Lounge Radio, even if I force them to be crazy about it.

1163
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:50,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'll catch you guys later with another voicemail.

1164
01:12:50,357 --> 01:12:50,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1165
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:54,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So live from SoccerCon, there's DMN.

1166
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:57,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently there's fans of Orange Launch Radio at Sakuracom.

1167
01:12:58,897 --> 01:12:59,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry we couldn't come.

1168
01:13:00,738 --> 01:13:03,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was originally planned that this year we were going to go to Sakuracom.

1169
01:13:03,219 --> 01:13:03,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Something happened.

1170
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:05,620
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a panel, so we didn't spend the money to go out.

1171
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:07,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe next year.

1172
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:09,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to Skyblind in the meanwhile.

1173
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:10,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1174
01:13:11,003 --> 01:13:11,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1175
01:13:12,064 --> 01:13:13,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Legend of Zaku.

1176
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:14,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1177
01:13:14,325 --> 01:13:14,785
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

1178
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:16,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

1179
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you put two explicit tags on a podcast, do you think?

1180
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:20,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1181
01:13:21,474 --> 01:13:25,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if that would... I don't want to be a censorship guy, but yeah.

1182
01:13:26,516 --> 01:13:27,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways... Right, what's on your mind?

1183
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:36,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard about the whole deal with Rock Band and how Harmonix is basically trying to give Konami a run for its money.

1184
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:38,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1185
01:13:39,022 --> 01:13:41,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Also for the fact that Konami is lazy.

1186
01:13:41,843 --> 01:13:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't even shown any real initiative as trying to...

1187
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,460
[SPEAKER_04]: and many more.

1188
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the fact that they're announcing that game after Rockman.

1189
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, they're going to be holding that against everything else that Konami tries to release.

1190
01:14:23,902 --> 01:14:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the whole Guitar Hero rip-off thing.

1191
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:29,327
[SPEAKER_10]: To Konami's credit, is Guitar Hero very popular in Japan?

1192
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it is.

1193
01:14:30,348 --> 01:14:33,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at least Konami still has the Japanese market, if not now.

1194
01:14:33,531 --> 01:14:34,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, of course.

1195
01:14:34,672 --> 01:14:37,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they have that with an iron grip, but the thing is that

1196
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:43,553
[SPEAKER_04]: The way Harmonix managed to get to where they are with Guitar Hero is the marketing.

1197
01:14:44,033 --> 01:14:45,454
[SPEAKER_04]: They have commercials for it.

1198
01:14:46,254 --> 01:14:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And that and the music, those two elements right there help fuel the sales that they're in right now.

1199
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and Konami obviously has not been willing to take that same risk.

1200
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a huge, huge risk.

1201
01:14:58,143 --> 01:15:01,426
[SPEAKER_10]: When they brought DDR out in this country, they were talking about what a big risk it was.

1202
01:15:01,526 --> 01:15:05,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was, but I mean, as the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

1203
01:15:06,827 --> 01:15:22,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you have, I mean, that was a damn good risk at best, but it's like, they need a lot more marketing if they want to really push something of the order of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, just to catch up to Harmonix's, you know...

1204
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're saying Konami wants to be known for anything besides Karaoke Revolution, which they may not be known for much longer, If they want to push something like Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, they have to get a lot of marketing and a lot of American...

1205
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:40,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more question for you being a hardcore music game fan.

1206
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:43,877
[SPEAKER_04]: How could Konami make Beatmania a success in this country?

1207
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:34,108
[SPEAKER_04]: well they really have to focus on on basically licenses you know pick up like really good licenses you know like you know stuff like you know really good trance and techno and stuff like that and maybe like you know some decent hip-hop or something but yes you have to definitely push you know they have to do some more marketing they have to establish themselves within the arcades first and foremost just like they did with DDR

1208
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:35,447
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1209
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:38,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Zaku, we will see what happens, but thank you so much for the call.

1210
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:38,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

1211
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:39,388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1212
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:39,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, buddy.

1213
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:39,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1214
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:40,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1215
01:16:40,249 --> 01:16:40,649
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1216
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:57,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackboy makes an interesting statement in chat.

1217
01:16:57,708 --> 01:17:05,711
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, I love that because this is a Bomani-originated show in chat, all the people are mad because another company improved on something that Bomani pioneered.

1218
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:08,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't say I'm mad.

1219
01:17:08,432 --> 01:17:11,014
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Guitar Hero deserves the success it's getting.

1220
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:14,495
[SPEAKER_10]: It made a great formula even better.

1221
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:21,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I was kind of saying on that call with Zaku, it took the risk that Konami was not willing to take, and it paid off.

1222
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:23,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't be mad at that.

1223
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:25,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's Ron, what's up everyone?

1224
01:17:52,975 --> 01:17:53,956
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1225
01:18:10,862 --> 01:18:14,584
[SPEAKER_01]: An arcade machine right in front of people and people demonstrating it.

1226
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:25,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, they would make more money off the DDR because that looks more easy, more exciting to play compared to the other arcade machines, which is to me one of the reasons why they brought it over.

1227
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:33,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the other machines, the other franchises are risks, but at this time, I mean, Konami is just like, you know what, hey, we did our thing.

1228
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:34,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just call it a night.

1229
01:18:34,195 --> 01:18:35,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work on other stuff.

1230
01:18:35,495 --> 01:18:38,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying that, you know, Konami is just kind of writing off

1231
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,600
[SPEAKER_10]: trying to Americanize guitar freaks in Germany.

1232
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're keeping it going in Japan, but they're just using that money to bring us the Metal Gear Solid 4s, the Castlevania Rondo of Bloods, the other franchises they're doing, Koronipia, Marble Mania, and whatever else they're coming out with.

1233
01:18:55,048 --> 01:18:55,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

1234
01:18:56,209 --> 01:19:01,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because if they really wanted to, I mean, they would have done something earlier.

1235
01:19:01,232 --> 01:19:04,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, didn't they say that Beatmania was a success here?

1236
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:04,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

1237
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:13,993
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably would have thrown in another rehash for a 2DX or maybe Guitar Freaks or something like that.

1238
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:28,583
[SPEAKER_10]: By all practical purposes and from what I understood, and this is coming from multiple sources and contacts that I have, I thought that Beatmania was a success in this country as far as the home version went.

1239
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:38,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So why we're not seeing a sequel is kind of interesting, though, because it does seem to be, like, that would indicate to me kind of what you're saying, Ranma, that, you know, even though they could go for it, they're not choosing to.

1240
01:19:38,798 --> 01:19:39,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1241
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:39,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1242
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:47,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the much money they've made off the B-Mani games, for them to bring over B-Mani, it wasn't that much of a risk for them, you know?

1243
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:50,567
[SPEAKER_10]: FootyMonster in chat has an interesting point.

1244
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:56,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, Konami's first mistake, and this whole analysis' problem, is to think that arcades are relevant enough to give a fuck.

1245
01:19:57,205 --> 01:20:00,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcades are dead in the US, that's why they don't give a fuck.

1246
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:11,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting point, because Konami, all of their music games started as arcade games, whereas Guitar Hero and this Rock Band game would be made for a console on the outset.

1247
01:20:12,196 --> 01:20:12,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting.

1248
01:20:13,317 --> 01:20:22,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, because I remember growing up, I couldn't go to an arcade without finding a Konami machine in there, whether it be TMNT or The Simpsons or X-Men.

1249
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:34,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Konami game, and now, nowadays, the only place you can find a half-decent arcade if you're in a big town where there's a Dave & Buster's or GameWorks or a little podunk corner place, you know?

1250
01:20:34,766 --> 01:20:35,266
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad.

1251
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:37,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope arcades have a resurgence.

1252
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:37,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do.

1253
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:38,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss them.

1254
01:20:38,548 --> 01:20:38,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1255
01:20:39,864 --> 01:20:44,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, besides Laundromat, I would love another place to chuck quarters into.

1256
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:46,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other thoughts, Ranma?

1257
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:51,548
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically it, unless you want another dirty joke.

1258
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:53,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, why not?

1259
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:55,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is really dirty.

1260
01:20:56,129 --> 01:20:59,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hell, the show's already gone explicit tag twice over.

1261
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:00,111
[SPEAKER_10]: How much worse can we get?

1262
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:00,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

1263
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:06,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what does Pussy and the Mafia have in common?

1264
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:06,593
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1265
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:09,394
[SPEAKER_01]: A slip of the tongue and you're up shit's creek.

1266
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:18,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye Ranma, thanks for the call.

1267
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:21,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did we start encouraging people to tell dirty jokes?

1268
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:24,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1269
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:26,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, how you doing?

1270
01:21:26,102 --> 01:21:26,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bandit.

1271
01:21:27,263 --> 01:21:28,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Bandit, what's on your mind?

1272
01:21:29,123 --> 01:21:35,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what you guys were saying, like Zaku and everybody, you know what, I really doubt 2DX will ever be popular in this country.

1273
01:21:36,765 --> 01:21:37,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

1274
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:41,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, compared to Japan and things like that, I mean, if you look at that game...

1275
01:21:42,608 --> 01:21:52,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What the other couple guys were saying about how all the arcades are around and they were around years ago and actually people would even give a crap about these games now.

1276
01:21:52,493 --> 01:21:56,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that game takes too much time to learn and things like that.

1277
01:21:56,856 --> 01:21:58,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, way too much dedication.

1278
01:21:58,577 --> 01:22:03,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The casual gamer is not going to just walk into a place throwing 50 cents and just

1279
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:08,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Be great at the game like they can with a Simpsons or an X-Men machine, you know?

1280
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,312
[SPEAKER_10]: But isn't Guitar Hero kind of hard, too?

1281
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:25,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the reason why people can get good at it is because they really have a lot of dumbed-down modes, which Beatmania 2DX, they're kind of between a rock and a hard place, because when they put easy modes in the game, then the hardcore fans go, oh, they're dumbing Beatmania down.

1282
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:29,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But when they don't put those modes in, then, oh, the game's too hard, you know?

1283
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:33,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at Guitar Hero 1 compared to Guitar Hero 2.

1284
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:37,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's definitely a difficulty there, definitely a better range.

1285
01:22:38,734 --> 01:22:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can see, I mean, when you play Guitar Hero 1 on, what is it, Expert now, if you play that and then look at the Expert on Guitar Hero 2, you can definitely see a difference there.

1286
01:22:49,343 --> 01:22:52,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, I played, what was that song I played today, Jordan on Expert or something?

1287
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, I got my ass handed to me.

1288
01:22:54,408 --> 01:22:54,928
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds hard.

1289
01:22:54,948 --> 01:22:57,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think if Buckethead does that one.

1290
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:58,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

1291
01:22:59,895 --> 01:23:00,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anything else?

1292
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:03,836
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it for now.

1293
01:23:04,456 --> 01:23:06,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And anything non-music?

1294
01:23:06,176 --> 01:23:08,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we do have some folks who don't play music video games.

1295
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:10,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything non-music gaming you've been playing?

1296
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:16,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I mean, I picked up a... I haven't jumped to the next gen yet.

1297
01:23:16,378 --> 01:23:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sony told me it was okay, but I just haven't made that leap.

1298
01:23:20,179 --> 01:23:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked up God of War about a month ago.

1299
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:24,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up God of War 2 when it came out.

1300
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Played through both of them.

1301
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,100
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really good.

1302
01:23:26,857 --> 01:23:29,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely tell anybody who hasn't bought God of War 2 yet.

1303
01:23:29,498 --> 01:23:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been maybe a month since it was released, but definitely pick it up.

1304
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:36,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't played it, so I might just have to do that.

1305
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's that and Devil May Cry Collection.

1306
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:41,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like all three games for like $29.

1307
01:23:41,762 --> 01:23:41,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1308
01:23:41,942 --> 01:23:43,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely get that too.

1309
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:44,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Just might.

1310
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:46,083
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thanks for the heads up, Bandit.

1311
01:23:46,923 --> 01:23:47,303
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bye guys.

1312
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:47,843
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, take care.

1313
01:23:48,984 --> 01:23:49,484
[SPEAKER_10]: One more call.

1314
01:23:49,504 --> 01:23:49,924
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say?

1315
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:50,284
[SPEAKER_10]: One more.

1316
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:51,945
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys okay?

1317
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:52,645
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys doing all right?

1318
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:53,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

1319
01:23:54,092 --> 01:24:06,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I was looking up, I was thinking about, I remembered I put a copy of Earth Defense Force 2 on my sister's PS2, and I really want to play it now, because it actually looks more fun than Earth Defense Force 3, which is Earth Defense Force 2017.

1320
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:09,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's do one more call.

1321
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:11,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio, who's this?

1322
01:24:12,903 --> 01:24:14,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.

1323
01:24:14,604 --> 01:24:16,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?

1324
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:20,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, this whole damn argument is, like, pissing me off now.

1325
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1326
01:24:22,802 --> 01:24:29,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the whole thing with Guitar Hero and Guitar Freaks, it's like they're two different things at the same time, they're the same thing.

1327
01:24:30,806 --> 01:24:37,209
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, Guitar Freaks is a lot more difficult than Guitar Hero on any level.

1328
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:42,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've done this, I've proven this by actually trying the game the other day.

1329
01:24:42,852 --> 01:24:47,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Freaks failed me after I missed four notes, just four.

1330
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero actually passed me by missing half the damn song.

1331
01:24:51,832 --> 01:24:53,412
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first thing I've seen the difference.

1332
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:57,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hold on, though, because doesn't the arcade difficulty setting have a lot to do with it?

1333
01:24:58,773 --> 01:24:59,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop breathing into the mic, please.

1334
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:00,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, careful.

1335
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:03,074
[SPEAKER_10]: You're causing a lot of Darth Vader noises.

1336
01:25:04,274 --> 01:25:04,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1337
01:25:04,694 --> 01:25:05,054
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

1338
01:25:06,014 --> 01:25:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, doesn't Guitar Freak depend a lot on the arcade difficulty setting?

1339
01:25:11,215 --> 01:25:15,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but most arcade owners are just leaving it as a default, normal default.

1340
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:20,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know too many arcades that would actually max the difficulty level right there, you know?

1341
01:25:22,129 --> 01:25:23,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my first thought.

1342
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the second thought is also the song list.

1343
01:25:27,995 --> 01:25:36,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And people keep forgetting this, is that Guitar Freak's song list is mostly on J-pop and J-rock and very few American stuff that people recognize.

1344
01:25:37,243 --> 01:25:42,468
[SPEAKER_07]: While you have Guitar Hero, people are like, ooh, I know this song from the radio, yada yada yada, I can play this.

1345
01:25:43,154 --> 01:25:43,974
[SPEAKER_10]: True, very true.

1346
01:25:45,055 --> 01:25:50,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Something I've said kind of distinguishes the games that make Guitar Hero more successful here, yeah?

1347
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:59,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, and that's pretty much the primary two differences between both games, is that both the difficulty level and the song list.

1348
01:25:59,942 --> 01:26:03,183
[SPEAKER_10]: You obviously sound like a longtime fan of music games.

1349
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:04,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you have DDR in your nickname.

1350
01:26:04,804 --> 01:26:06,344
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of Rock Band?

1351
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:07,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it something you're going to check out?

1352
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:13,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be quite honest, I tuned in after you guys were talking about Rock Band, so I don't have much of an idea what it was about.

1353
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:21,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Real quickly, imagine, remember the good old days when you could play Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania all in the arcade?

1354
01:26:21,452 --> 01:26:23,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, imagine doing that online.

1355
01:26:23,653 --> 01:26:26,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Take out the keyboards and put in Karaoke Revolution.

1356
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:33,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So sort of like one big, like the session mode with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1357
01:26:34,015 --> 01:26:34,695
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the internet.

1358
01:26:35,835 --> 01:26:36,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1359
01:26:37,954 --> 01:26:41,075
[SPEAKER_10]: and Guitar Hero type songs.

1360
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:51,536
[SPEAKER_07]: That wouldn't be so bad, actually, because one thing people keep forgetting is that no game has actually included a karaoke type thing.

1361
01:26:51,896 --> 01:26:55,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would actually make it different at the same time.

1362
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

1363
01:26:57,938 --> 01:27:00,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we've seen guitar and drums at the same time.

1364
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:03,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we have drums, guitars, and singers.

1365
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:06,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That's

1366
01:27:07,284 --> 01:27:07,964
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be interesting.

1367
01:27:08,104 --> 01:27:08,445
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1368
01:27:08,785 --> 01:27:11,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll be looking for you online when the game comes out.

1369
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:13,047
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1370
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:14,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

1371
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:14,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the perspective.

1372
01:27:15,568 --> 01:27:16,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, thanks, man.

1373
01:27:16,269 --> 01:27:16,689
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1374
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:17,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1375
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:18,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1376
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:18,970
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1377
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

1378
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:22,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to those that called in.

1379
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:28,575
[SPEAKER_10]: If you didn't get through, though, because I saw a couple of phones trying to get in still, you can always feel free to leave us a voicemail or an email.

1380
01:27:28,675 --> 01:27:30,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1381
01:27:31,217 --> 01:27:35,779
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're also thinking to yourself, why is it the same fucking people calling in every week?

1382
01:27:36,206 --> 01:27:36,426
[SPEAKER_10]: GameSpot

1383
01:27:55,706 --> 01:28:01,189
[SPEAKER_11]: about a keyboard controller attachment that they're going to be coming out.

1384
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:04,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks very legit coming from them.

1385
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:07,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do remember seeing like a patent or some sort of picture a while back.

1386
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:16,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe Gamers Reports were also saying that they ran a story months ago because they like doing that kind of stuff about it.

1387
01:28:16,356 --> 01:28:20,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So something that we might see pretty soon, very likely.

1388
01:28:20,318 --> 01:28:20,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1389
01:28:21,013 --> 01:28:27,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would kind of tie into that whole being able to chat while watching movies and stuff.

1390
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:35,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, other than that, there was one game I did want to talk about a little bit, that Drawn to Life.

1391
01:28:35,345 --> 01:28:40,309
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game being released by THQ, and they had some cool pictures on QJNet.

1392
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:45,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks a little bit like, what was it, that...

1393
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:49,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Magic Pen Gel or Graffiti Kingdom or something like that.

1394
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:57,444
[SPEAKER_11]: But you actually doodle stuff onto your DS and it creates a player for you or a creature or something.

1395
01:28:58,044 --> 01:28:58,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

1396
01:28:59,405 --> 01:29:00,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to that.

1397
01:29:00,386 --> 01:29:02,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're also making a Worms 2 apparently.

1398
01:29:03,627 --> 01:29:09,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Another cool thing, the first homebrew MMO is coming to the PSP.

1399
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:16,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently it's Triple Triad, so you'll be able to play that over the internet against other people.

1400
01:29:17,402 --> 01:29:21,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you're a fan of that card game that was in, I believe, Final Fantasy IX.

1401
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:24,046
[SPEAKER_11]: But interesting nonetheless, I guess.

1402
01:29:24,747 --> 01:29:31,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there was a funny story that was released pretty much everywhere about Phil Harrison trying to auction off PS3 at a rock concert.

1403
01:29:32,112 --> 01:29:34,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently he failed, and it was funny.

1404
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:38,255
[SPEAKER_11]: One dollar!

1405
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:40,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Area 51 is being made into a Hollywood movie.

1406
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't care.

1407
01:29:43,151 --> 01:29:56,626
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii Blaster attachment has been rumored to be coming to stores soon to coincide with the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which is supposed to be kind of an on-rails shooter game, or a first-person shooter, nonetheless.

1408
01:29:56,646 --> 01:29:58,388
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

1409
01:29:58,789 --> 01:29:59,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully that'll come out soon.

1410
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:11,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony's launching a new service called Beats, which is supposed to be a music and video service very similar to stuff you'd see on the Zune.

1411
01:30:11,841 --> 01:30:16,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't think it's going to beat out anything else that's out there in the market, though, so it should be interesting.

1412
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it.

1413
01:30:20,046 --> 01:30:20,326
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1414
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:25,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I have something actually a listener pointed me to in chat, and I cannot pronounce.

1415
01:30:25,309 --> 01:30:27,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this supposed to be like lead speak for Havoc 1792?

1416
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what it is, H4V0C.

1417
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:28,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Havoc.

1418
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:45,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Havoc1792, EliteSpeak, sent me this article on Achieve360Points.com that shows the Halo 2 achievements because it's going to be, as you know, on the Windows Vista gaming suite so it has achievements there.

1419
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:53,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought I heard that it was going to get these on the 360 as well if you were playing the backwards compatibility eventually.

1420
01:30:53,913 --> 01:30:55,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it looks like, you know, the basics are

1421
01:30:56,021 --> 01:30:59,842
[SPEAKER_10]: You get 30 points, it looks like, for each stage of the single player game you go through.

1422
01:31:00,442 --> 01:31:04,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you get some other achievement points if you, you know, actually beat the game.

1423
01:31:04,483 --> 01:31:07,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, there's your various multiplayer points.

1424
01:31:08,224 --> 01:31:14,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Steal an occupied vehicle, double kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, killing spree, running riot, all that stuff.

1425
01:31:15,246 --> 01:31:24,208
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I thought was really interesting is that, okay, you can get an achievement called Ninja, which is in a non-team game, kill five people by melee from behind.

1426
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:25,788
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Ninja achievement.

1427
01:31:26,104 --> 01:31:31,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's also a legend achievement, and that's what you get when you complete the game on legendary difficulty.

1428
01:31:31,547 --> 01:31:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing that I think is cool.

1429
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:37,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Not those achievements, but the fact that then there's two more achievements, 20 points apiece.

1430
01:31:38,472 --> 01:31:39,933
[SPEAKER_10]: One is called Flaming Ninja.

1431
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:42,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill somebody that has the ninja achievement.

1432
01:31:43,355 --> 01:31:44,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other one is Hired Gun.

1433
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:49,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill someone who has the legend achievement, because you know those types of players are going to be really good.

1434
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:51,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can kill one of those, then you get those achievements.

1435
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,261
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of neat.

1436
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:52,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1437
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:54,798
[SPEAKER_10]: That's better than those viral ones.

1438
01:31:54,998 --> 01:31:57,259
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that one?

1439
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say it was a game I just recently played.

1440
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:04,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Ninja Turtles, but Jetpack.

1441
01:32:05,342 --> 01:32:10,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Jetpack has an achievement in it that you have to play somebody who has the virus achievement.

1442
01:32:10,685 --> 01:32:12,325
[SPEAKER_10]: It's even called a viral achievement or something.

1443
01:32:12,505 --> 01:32:16,487
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not worth any points, but that's the only way you can get it is by playing with somebody who has the achievement.

1444
01:32:16,587 --> 01:32:17,127
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of weird.

1445
01:32:18,848 --> 01:32:19,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's kind of neat.

1446
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:22,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job to whoever thought up those achievements on Halo 2.

1447
01:32:23,897 --> 01:32:25,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything for you, Jamie?

1448
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:27,940
[SPEAKER_13]: For me?

1449
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,584
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't play the... My last minute news in general.

1450
01:32:33,185 --> 01:32:35,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I thought you were talking about if it had any other achievements.

1451
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:37,388
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know you're not much of a Halo player.

1452
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:37,869
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1453
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:39,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have anything.

1454
01:32:40,351 --> 01:32:46,376
[SPEAKER_10]: We seriously need to have here at Orange Lounge Radio a Who Sucks the Worst at Halo tournament.

1455
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be fun.

1456
01:32:47,196 --> 01:32:49,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's a lot of people in chat who say, I suck, I suck, I suck.

1457
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:52,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to have a Who Sucks Most championship.

1458
01:32:53,473 --> 01:32:56,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually decent with a lot of games.

1459
01:32:57,415 --> 01:33:00,557
[SPEAKER_11]: In Grand Theft Auto, I'm a killer with a sniper rifle.

1460
01:33:00,677 --> 01:33:02,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The sniper rifles in Grand Theft Auto suck balls.

1461
01:33:03,018 --> 01:33:05,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1462
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:06,500
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be pretty fun.

1463
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I suck at Halo 2.

1464
01:33:09,021 --> 01:33:10,302
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I think I've only played it once.

1465
01:33:12,443 --> 01:33:13,283
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't played Halo 2.

1466
01:33:13,443 --> 01:33:15,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only played Halo 1 once.

1467
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:17,805
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be fun.

1468
01:33:17,885 --> 01:33:19,866
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRDollarBill says, I suck at Halo.

1469
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:20,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even get one kill.

1470
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:23,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, I haven't even played Halo, so I suck the most.

1471
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:24,530
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1472
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:29,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally think we should have a Who Sucks the Most at Halo contest.

1473
01:33:29,672 --> 01:33:30,153
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

1474
01:33:31,173 --> 01:33:32,234
[SPEAKER_11]: We should make a clan.

1475
01:33:33,094 --> 01:33:33,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck at Halo clan.

1476
01:33:34,035 --> 01:33:36,416
[SPEAKER_10]: There is an OL Army Halo clan, supposedly.

1477
01:33:36,436 --> 01:33:42,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't checked on it in a while, but obviously not a lot of people are in it, and they don't really play together, because none of us actually play Halo.

1478
01:33:42,619 --> 01:33:43,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you go.

1479
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, that's about going to do it for tonight's program.

1480
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:50,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1481
01:33:50,482 --> 01:33:51,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Mandarin, thank you so much for being here.

1482
01:33:51,883 --> 01:33:59,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you didn't get a whole lot of opportunity to chat towards the end here, but thank you so much for playing match game with us and bringing in your friend to the show and all that stuff.

1483
01:33:59,687 --> 01:34:00,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're welcome.

1484
01:34:00,288 --> 01:34:03,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to actually bring him in live and in person.

1485
01:34:03,629 --> 01:34:04,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So you will come back?

1486
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:05,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

1487
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:05,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1488
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:06,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like fun.

1489
01:34:06,111 --> 01:34:15,956
[SPEAKER_00]: After he moves up here and gets settled in, we'll have to take a day off and he'll have to come up and... Bring the soon-to-be hubby to the show, too.

1490
01:34:16,296 --> 01:34:17,177
[SPEAKER_00]: If he can get out of work.

1491
01:34:17,437 --> 01:34:17,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1492
01:34:18,735 --> 01:34:19,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a day off.

1493
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:19,596
[SPEAKER_10]: We're worth it.

1494
01:34:19,776 --> 01:34:20,216
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1495
01:34:20,717 --> 01:34:20,937
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1496
01:34:21,777 --> 01:34:22,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, your final thought.

1497
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:25,781
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.

1498
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:29,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of sat here quietly and observed for the most part, but it was still a lot of fun.

1499
01:34:29,584 --> 01:34:29,924
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

1500
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:30,905
[SPEAKER_10]: We get a lot of guests that do that.

1501
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:34,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher was kind of... Mika's been on the show like 40 times.

1502
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:35,388
[SPEAKER_10]: He never says a damn thing when he's here.

1503
01:34:35,869 --> 01:34:36,149
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1504
01:34:36,549 --> 01:34:39,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It got kind of dirty and raunchy for a while, which was amusing.

1505
01:34:39,111 --> 01:34:40,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you like it.

1506
01:34:40,572 --> 01:34:41,213
[SPEAKER_10]: You like the kink.

1507
01:34:41,613 --> 01:34:41,953
[SPEAKER_10]: You know it.

1508
01:34:42,254 --> 01:34:42,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh.

1509
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:43,335
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1510
01:34:43,955 --> 01:34:45,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't like Frankie Muniz's butt hair?

1511
01:34:45,777 --> 01:34:45,957
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1512
01:34:45,977 --> 01:34:46,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1513
01:34:46,197 --> 01:34:46,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1514
01:34:46,676 --> 01:34:48,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought.

1515
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:54,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play Earth... Why is it... Explain this to me.

1516
01:34:54,377 --> 01:35:06,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it that the Earth Defense Force 2 game on PlayStation 2 looks more fun, looks better graphically than the one on the 360?

1517
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,040
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

1518
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:14,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it looks like they have a lot more complex enemies in there, some stuff that could have been from War of the Worlds or something.

1519
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:15,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Why...

1520
01:35:17,183 --> 01:35:18,264
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

1521
01:35:18,644 --> 01:35:20,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, what's up with that shit?

1522
01:35:20,685 --> 01:35:26,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to get my PS2 back from my sister because I think they've played Driver 3 long enough.

1523
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:30,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?

1524
01:35:31,211 --> 01:35:31,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadpool.

1525
01:35:32,672 --> 01:35:34,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, and my final thought tonight?

1526
01:35:42,678 --> 01:35:44,859
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my final thought for tonight.

1527
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:46,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you enjoy that final thought, DarkSakura?

1528
01:35:47,322 --> 01:35:49,144
[SPEAKER_14]: and even Orgy now.

1529
01:36:09,093 --> 01:36:09,794
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1530
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:41,241
