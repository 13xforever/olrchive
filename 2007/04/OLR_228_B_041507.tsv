15480	19920	Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19920	23640	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15th, 2007.
23640	27800	Happy tax day to you and if youíre thinking, ìGosh, my taxes were long due.
27800	32200	Iím actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.î Thatís because youíve downloaded probably
32200	34360	our audio archive, also known as podcasting.
34360	38120	Well, Orange Lounge Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in
38120	39120	two parts.
39120	43080	Or, if you want to hear it even before itís on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and
43080	47160	B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.
47160	52360	Monday nights at 6 oíclock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6
52360	56920	oíclock, so just kind of be listening around 5.30 Pacific Standard Time or 9 a.m. on Tuesdays
56920	57920	Pacific Time.
57920	61520	You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.
61520	67200	Alright, letís give us some gaming news to talk about, so letís start it off.
67200	70400	We need our Death March to play, Rob.
70400	71400	Why?
71400	72400	We need playing.
72400	73400	Thatís all I got.
73400	77640	I thought for a moment you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars, so that
77640	78640	was kind of cool.
78640	79640	AnywayÖ
79640	83040	Unfortunately, I only have the one, no, I donít even have that.
83040	87120	I have this.
87120	103360	Okay, Death to PlayStation 3, the 20GB model is kaput.
103360	110440	It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so sayeth Sony.
110440	119960	Basically, the consumer market said, ìWe like the 60GB one because the 20GB one just
119960	131800	completely blows my ass.î So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20, however,
131800	139680	I donít know if thatís going to make it all this special thing, so it lasted six months.
139680	140680	You own one of these, right?
140680	141680	Yes, I do.
141680	146400	And itís just as good as the fucking 60GB, because thereís nothing on the download
146400	152560	store to actually put on there, and itís not very easy to get videos on there.
152560	156760	And do I really need wireless internet when itís sitting less than two feet away from
156760	157760	a router?
157760	158760	Probably not.
158760	159760	It has a 60.
159760	165200	Well, Loki has a collectorís item now, because those 20GBs are going to be super rare now.
165200	172400	And do I need the fucking silver molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there?
172400	173400	A little pinstripe?
173400	174400	I donít know.
174400	176640	Now, thatís the rare one now, right?
176640	179000	Iím fucking awesome, yeah!
179000	181000	Suck that, folks!
181000	182000	Well.
182000	189080	Yeah, itís more like theyíre admitting that the 20GB is no longer available.
189080	195160	It hasnít been available for months now, but this was something that happened.
195160	197640	I want to say around January.
197640	201640	Well, since you all found out, you canít order one.
201640	207520	Itís nice that theyíre finally copping to that stuff.
207520	211080	Anyways, so some other fun stuff.
211080	213520	Letís see here.
213520	222640	Sony is trying to get in on the wireless, kind of handheld input devices, very similar
222640	224360	to the Wii now.
224360	229600	Not exactly copying the Wii, but itís a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.
229600	235040	They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a
235040	242360	Power Glove, and itís supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I donít
242360	247520	know, games and stuff, virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.
247520	250120	I donít know, I think it looks kind of cool.
250120	255060	And I donít really give a crap if itís a ripoff of Nintendo or whatever.
255060	257760	At this point, who cares?
257760	264820	Just make it, as long as it doesnít suck like the iToy did, Iím all for it.
264820	265820	So itís a glove?
265820	266820	Yeah, itís like a littleÖ
266820	267820	So like the Power Glove?
267820	268820	Itís so bad.
268820	270360	Itís not really like the Power Glove.
270360	277200	It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for
277200	278200	your thumb.
278200	281840	And then thereís like, I donít know if itís something that will cause it to tighten up
281840	287200	or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of almost feel objects and stuff.
287200	291680	So say, for example, I wanted to grab a virtual boob, I could do that and it would feel like
291680	293120	Iím grabbing a virtual boob.
293120	296480	So thatís what they needed to do with this.
296480	297480	Yeah.
297480	301120	Did you ever play with thatÖ What was that thing?
301120	305800	They had it at the E3 Outpost and it was at E3 in Kensha Hall.
305800	306800	The Novant Falcon?
306800	308800	Was that what it was called?
308800	313600	It sounds kind ofÖ It said the Novant Falcon wasnít a glove, it was this little ball.
313600	314600	That thing was awesome.
314600	318720	Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls
318720	322440	together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.
322440	325480	So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.
325480	327080	Well hereís what itís also going to allow you to do.
327080	332120	It says theyíre going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external
332120	339200	input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending
339200	343280	figures so you can flip off the thing and it will know that.
343280	347280	I think it would be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people in like home
347280	348280	and stuff.
348280	354880	It means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah, blah, blah, tactile
354880	360000	feedback and means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.
360000	363760	So yeah, itís basically going to be like VR gloves.
363760	364840	Hooray!
364840	366960	I have one thing to say about that.
366960	367960	What?
367960	368960	Itís so bad.
368960	376080	Anyhow, I donít know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog 3Speech
376080	379380	from Sony has talked about some upcoming Playstation 3 games.
379380	381600	Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.
381600	386560	ìThatís when weíll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting
386560	391960	game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air-foot vehicle combat game Warhawk,
391960	394920	which is still looking likely to be released over the Playstation Network rather than the
394920	396120	shops.
396120	400120	First person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September as well as the first
400120	405080	Playstation 3 version of Ratchet and Clank.î Kind of interesting because you think about,
405080	408320	ìOkay, well, thatís about the time weíre supposed to get the real version of Playstation
408320	412240	Home as well and everything.î It almost sounds like Playstation 3 is just going to hold on
412240	415120	to everything until the next Christmas season.
415120	417720	All the more reason for Halo to come out in September.
417720	422160	Now, something to consider though is that 3Speech is a semi-official blog handled by
422160	427920	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list
427920	430000	that has a confirmed U.S. date is Lair.
430000	432120	Thatís set for July.
432120	437400	So the 3Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europeís perspective, but not necessarily
437400	438400	us.
438400	441920	Lair, I know thatís been talked about as a July title, same with Warhawk.
441920	447760	Warhawkís been a July title for a while, but then again, itís kind of morphed into
447760	452440	really different things than before, so who knows when thatís coming out.
452440	456320	I hope they donít wait that long because they donít have any exclusives between now
456320	458360	and September, if thatís the case.
458360	462840	Well, it should also be noted that 3Speech said something about BioShock on the Playstation
462840	466960	3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, ìThere is currently
466960	470300	no indication that BioShock will come out on the Playstation 3.î Oops, weíre talking
470300	471300	out of our ass.
471300	479920	Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a, what was the quote from Clerks and
479920	480920	Oral Bow movement?
480920	482480	I really donít know.
482480	487320	Well, I have some good news, at least this is good for me.
487320	492000	They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.
492000	497120	I think thatís great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.
497120	507520	The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007 and there actually is a notice saying that the
507520	512040	Sony Europe site, I suppose, has already been up.
512040	519640	So Iím going to personally think of it as a rumor because it didnít really do all that
519640	525960	great in Japan on PSP, but if itís coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.
525960	527800	The game is just fucked up.
527800	534440	Of course, theyíre going to jump on an opportunity to actually have another game that uses the
534440	535440	6-axis.
535440	540520	It actually uses the 6-axis and use it well, I hope.
540520	541840	I donít know.
541840	542840	We can hope.
542840	543840	Hold our breath, maybe.
543840	547720	Kind of screwed other things up, but okie dokie.
547720	550760	Anyways, weíve got some stuff coming out this week.
550760	556720	Not a whole lot, not really a lot that you may be looking for, but itís coming out anyways.
556720	562520	So starting off on PlayStation 2, Raiden 3 is finally making its way out and thatís,
562520	565040	of course, the arcade shooter game.
565040	571440	Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2, and I know the first one really blew, hopefully this oneís
571440	572440	not so bad.
572440	580960	PC port of The Plan, and thatís coming to PlayStation 2 as well, didnít look very good.
580960	581960	Eureka!
581960	585560	7 Volume 2, the new wave, I believe thatís the new wave.
585560	586560	Anyways, Eureka!
586560	590600	7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks ok.
590600	596320	Red Star, that old claim game thatís been in development forever and now itís finally
596320	598880	making its way out in PlayStation 2.
598880	606480	On the PSP, we have Hollow Knights finally making its way out, as well as Pocket Pool,
606480	618400	that semi-porn billiards game, and letís see here, nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.
618400	627440	Nothing on PlayStation 3, and letís see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics,
627440	634960	letís see here, Mission Blackhawk, and Mission Combat Force, and a game called Made Man,
634960	636600	which got horrible reviews.
636600	642680	Finally, on the Wii, weíve got Bust-a-Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game, but of course
642680	648080	the big stuffís going to be coming out on the DS, and weíve got Pokemon Diamond and
648080	654240	Pearl finally making its way out, as well as a Sudoku game, Tundoku.
654240	656040	Thatís it.
656040	663680	Alright, over in Japan, theyíre having these following releases, for April 19th on the
663680	670040	Wii, Super Paper Mario, they get their version of Super Paper Mario, Furu Park is coming
670040	673800	out as well, looks like a little skating game with little chibi characters, thatís also
673800	675600	coming out on the Wii.
675600	680800	I guess Tony Hawk maybe not as popular over there as Furu Park, at least not Furi Furi
680800	683260	Park, which is what I almost read.
683260	687800	Starting on the PlayStation 3, nothing really to note on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 still
687800	693240	getting a little bit of love, theyíre getting a game called Fate Stay Night, Rialta Nua
693240	700280	is coming out on April 19th, and theyíve got a special edition, its own memory card,
700280	706840	this is based on the Type-Moon Sukihime novel game that was released a couple years ago,
706840	710960	itís anime, manga, figurines, etc., etc., so some of you guys that really follow anime
710960	714280	are probably looking forward to that, so thatís coming out this week.
714280	723120	Also coming out, Oruan Coco Host Buu is coming out in Japan, thatís an anime, Oruan High
723120	730800	School Club something, little roses, and little girly men, yeah, itís a really fucked up
730800	731800	little anime.
731800	734960	Alright, well if you want the little fucked up game that goes with it, itís coming out
734960	737840	on the PlayStation 2 this week.
737840	742720	Also on the Nintendo DS, letís see, what are you getting over there, Gaouken Alice
742720	747800	Waku Waku Happy Friends, thatís coming out from Kidís Station on the DS this week, April
747800	751800	19th, that looks like another anime game, my birthday has a lot of fun stuff on it,
751800	759160	thatís all they get out there, Wi-Fi Tao Senkai No Dare Demo, you might think thatís
759160	763640	an accessory but itís not, oh itís Clubhouse Games, thatís what it is, itís the Japanese
763640	767120	version of Clubhouse Games, there you go.
767120	770320	Once I saw the box art I was like, hey thatís just Clubhouse Games, so they get that this
770320	776560	week on the DS, PSP, thereís your big releases this week, Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition
776560	780840	coming out in Japan this week, so check that out.
780840	791400	Thatís some pretty crazy stuff, now on the 20th for the UK we have Final Fantasy V Advance
791400	799960	for GBA, God of War 2 on PlayStation 2, we have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP,
799960	804760	The Red Star, Iím actually really thinking Iím going to get that game, after playing
804760	811400	it at E3 a while back I thought it was pretty fun, Capcom Puzzle World on PSP, Cube on PSP,
811400	818360	Diddy Kong Racing DS, Free Running on PSP, Hard Rock Casino on PlayStation 2 and PSP,
818360	826440	Capcom US Navy Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 PSP, and Tony Hawkís Project 8 on PSP.
826440	837400	Sweet, anyways, back into the news here, of course weíve got some interesting stuff coming
837400	843120	out, of course one thing thatís been confirmed to be coming out, and Iím sure this is not
843120	850560	a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octaneís site there was a response to I believe
850560	858400	an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3, and it says Guitar Hero 3, and Guitar Hero
858400	865440	3 is headed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and itís supposed
865440	874920	to be coming out Fall 2007, so there you go, yet another release, and interesting, and
874920	881320	according to, apparently there was, itís been removed from the website as well, because
881320	886300	yeah, we didnít realize that there was another Guitar Hero game coming out this year, I mean
886300	890840	after all there are some, was it the 80ís edition coming out later this year, and who
890840	895680	knows what else theyíll throw in there, so not a big surprise.
895680	899360	Itís funny we havenít heard much on Guitar Hero 80ís edition besides that little tidbit
899360	903800	you found a couple weeks ago, itís weird, you would think we would have heard more about
903800	904800	it by now.
904800	905800	No.
905800	907280	You think they might push it back?
907280	910160	Yeah, I already know that, yeah.
910160	917440	Oh, okay, alright then, letís see, moving on, if youíre a fan of music games then youíd
917440	923440	probably like Ohndan as well, so we know hereís Elite Beat Agents, and Ohndan 2 is coming
923440	928240	out in Japan on May 17th is what the rumblings are saying, is that the gameís coming out
928240	934160	quite possibly that soon, some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet,
934160	942540	Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia,
942540	948280	Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube,
948280	952880	the artist is Hirai Ken, Popstar, itís one of the cheesiest songs Iíve ever heard in
952880	957280	my life, so, but itíll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they
957280	961520	know it in Japan, Ohndan, so, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward
961520	963880	to that one.
963880	968600	I actually think that I might definitely pick that one up, except I havenít picked up the
968600	970320	other one either, but anyway.
970320	978960	Well, now this makes me also particularly happy, excuse me, sorry, allergies, anyway,
978960	989000	there is a talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper, well, not second because
989000	997160	thereís only a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2, Nana Oncha has been
997160	1002000	quoted saying, weíre also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all
1002000	1009600	the family, and they said, yeah, that one, so theyíre apparently talking about Parappa.
1009600	1019880	Hmm, letís see, well, you know thereís some, a new Parappa sequel would be kind of cool,
1019880	1025920	one thing thatís not so cool, but, you know, once again, trying to milk something, Guinness
1025920	1032920	Book of World Records, they are releasing a video game edition, hooray, so youíre going
1032920	1042060	to have a book thatís going to have a bunch of gaming achievements in it, awesome.
1042060	1044840	Am I the only one thatís not excited about this, I think this is kind of retarded.
1044840	1045840	Iím not excited.
1045840	1048880	I thought this was with Twin Galaxies.
1048880	1053280	I would rather know about people who have like the worldís longest fingernails, and
1053280	1056280	you know, can bench press a car.
1056280	1061480	Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like throw baby a mile or something
1061480	1062480	like that.
1062480	1063480	Genetic oddities, those are great.
1063480	1067880	Believe it or not, thatís a record, you know, but somebody thatís like, I have the high
1067880	1070520	score DDR, and you know thatís going to be in there.
1070520	1071880	Isnít that what leaderboards are for?
1071880	1074920	I thought this was what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.
1074920	1077920	Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one though.
1077920	1082420	So, I donít know, itís kind of lame.
1082420	1086720	People are listening to all that Twin Galaxies drama on another program, I could give two
1086720	1091120	shits about video game high scores these days, I mean seriously.
1091120	1093920	I donít know, well whatever, there will be some people that are into that, hooray for
1093920	1094920	them.
1094920	1097640	Hopefully a lot more people are into this, because I know thereís a lot of people that
1097640	1102640	are excited about this game, itís called Trusty Bell, and theyíre getting a special
1102640	1105560	Xbox 360 pack in Japan for Trusty Bell.
1105560	1108120	Theyíre calling it something else different over here though, right?
1108120	1109120	Eternal Sonata.
1109120	1111640	Thank you, Eternal Sonata is what theyíre calling it over here, but in Japan itís Trusty
1111640	1116040	Bell, and theyíre getting a whole Xbox 360 pack that will come with the game, Trusty
1116040	1119880	Bell, and of course a controller and all that good stuff.
1119880	1122920	Obviously theyíre thinking this is one of those games like Blue Dragon that might push
1122920	1125960	some consoles, so they are bundling it all together.
1125960	1129440	Itís going to be fucking awesome since you canít save anything because thereís no memory
1129440	1131440	card and itís a core system.
1131440	1132440	Awesome!
1132440	1133440	You suck, Pete.
1133440	1135440	I didnít even catch that, thatís great.
1135440	1141560	Way to go, yeah with an RPG, Iím just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.
1141560	1142560	Thatís awesome.
1142560	1146400	Thatís awesome, I didnít even catch that, thereís no, oh my God, no hard drive and
1146400	1148040	no memory card.
1148040	1149040	Brilliant.
1149040	1150040	Good job.
1150040	1151040	Thatís lovely.
1151040	1160040	Well, what else is brilliant is Dark Sakura surfing the internet all week long at work
1160040	1161480	actually, thatís all she does.
1161480	1164960	No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them
1164960	1172720	with you in this little segment we call Dark Sakuraís Website of the Week.
1172720	1177200	And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, Dark Sakura?
1177200	1186160	The website of the week is ICanHasCheeseburger.com, which is like a Caturday site, I love it.
1186160	1190920	I visited the site, I didnít get it, I thought it was cute.
1190920	1198600	Itís ICanHasCheeseburger.com and cheeseburger is spelled C-H-E-E-Z-V-U-R-G-E-R, ICanHasCheeseburger.com.
1198600	1202960	The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over
1202960	1209640	a kitten with the caption, ìDo not want.î Thereís also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua
1209640	1216880	wearing a dolphin wig, it says, ìI love scotch, here it goes down, down into my bellies.î
1216880	1219480	I was just like hooray, another cat site from Jamie.
1219480	1226120	And thereís dogs on here too, thereís a little puppy making his sad faces, ate all
1226120	1229040	the cheeseburger brownie face.
1229040	1234240	Dark Tetsuya is posting his favorite, Dark Tetsuya is posting from ICanHasCheeseburger
1234240	1239040	the entry on April 13th, ìPrincess in another castle, sorry.î I guess the cats are wearing
1239040	1240040	it.
1240040	1244840	Thereís one of a cat with a wiimote in his lap saying, ìI can please have a walk through.î
1244840	1247360	So, there you go.
1247360	1253440	ICanHasCheeseburger.com, what is it, ICanHasCheeseburgers, is that what it is?
1253440	1254440	ICanHasCheeseburger.com.
1254440	1260560	Alright, check it out boys and girls, the official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.
1260560	1263800	Some interesting stuff, if youíre looking to try some games out, thereís been some
1263800	1269560	demos that have come out on live recently, some that you might not be excited about,
1269560	1274880	some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out, hooray.
1274880	1277880	Some that actually look kind of interesting and havenít gotten to play yet, Monster Madness
1277880	1284480	Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command
1284480	1291400	and Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that would be pretty awesome as well.
1291400	1292880	Look for it.
1292880	1300720	Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed,
1300720	1306160	sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince
1306160	1311840	of Persia Classic, for the record it got a 12 plus years age rating.
1311840	1314520	But that would be, you know, since thereís new Prince of Persia, isnít there a new game
1314520	1317200	coming out somewhat soon, in the not too distant future?
1317200	1320840	Yeah, theyíre supposed to be doing what for like 360 or something.
1320840	1326960	So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.
1326960	1331280	By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me
1331280	1335380	a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie weíve earlier spoken about
1335380	1339320	on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.
1339320	1344360	So as long as he doesnít screw up Transformers, I suppose weíll be looking forward to Prince
1344360	1345360	of Persia.
1345360	1349320	But if he does screw up Transformers, there will be hell to pay.
1349320	1351600	Brimstone and fire will rain down upon him.
1351600	1352600	Yes.
1352600	1359120	Fire and brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.
1359120	1363520	Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire and this isnít though about
1363520	1364520	a dragon.
1364520	1368840	So anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.
1368840	1372000	GameTap can do Saturn games, isnít that great?
1372000	1378200	But itís actually also in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoonís V.I. heading
1378200	1379200	out.
1379200	1385160	Now, Iím sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.
1385160	1391200	Or as it was calledóGod, why canít IóBecause Panzer Dragoon Orta was theó
1391200	1394240	Itís a start, Jamie, Jesus.
1394240	1399880	I know, but the Panzer Dragoon RPG was just like fucking beautiful.
1399880	1401120	You know, I have that game on Saturn.
1401120	1402840	Here, have a cheeseburger.
1402840	1403840	I have that game.
1403840	1405320	You have a cheeseburger game?
1405320	1406960	No, bite my butt.
1406960	1409320	I have aóI actually do have BurgerTime.
1409320	1410320	Does that count?
1410320	1411320	Dude, BurgerTime is awesome.
1411320	1412320	They have BurgerTime on GameTap.
1412320	1413320	Thatís all you need.
1413320	1415320	But Panzer Dragoon RPG is just likeó
1415320	1419280	Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Super BurgerTime on GameTap.
1419280	1420280	I know.
1420280	1423080	I didnít even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once
1423080	1424840	and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?
1424840	1425840	What is this?
1425840	1426840	We have Sega Love now.
1426840	1427840	What is this?
1427840	1428840	Sega!
1428840	1431800	Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.
1431800	1432800	Good.
1432800	1435200	They can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.
1435200	1438120	All right, so be it.
1438120	1441120	You donít want to talk about that.
1441120	1443120	Do not want!
1443120	1444200	Exactly.
1444200	1446800	You might want, though, Halo 3 multiplayer beta.
1446800	1455960	Itís coming out now May 16th and will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.
1455960	1460460	To which the entire internet responded, ìThree weeks!
1460460	1461460	Win!î
1461460	1469080	The beta will contain three multiplayer maps of Valhalla High Ground and Snowbound, graphically
1469080	1475680	improved since the first multiplayer screenshots, and they will only be playable in matchmaking
1475680	1477480	only.
1477480	1478840	And letís see what else.
1478840	1484760	New guns, vehicles, gameplay features, including the mysterious X button, which, by the way,
1484760	1487960	has been spoiled, and itís just an equipment button.
1487960	1494440	So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.
1494440	1496120	Who fucking cares?
1496120	1497120	Whatever.
1497120	1503640	Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda
1503640	1508600	yadda yadda, wonderful.
1508600	1510920	So buy Crackdown if you havenít yet.
1510920	1515000	Well, I was going to share with you all a little bit about what the X button does in
1515000	1520360	the Halo 3 beta, but Loki kind of ruined it, so thank you, Loki, for being a bastard.
1520360	1522360	But if you didnít already hear, yeah, you get the bubble.
1522360	1524600	Itís all confirmed over on Bungie.net.
1524600	1526720	Just look for a post that Frankie made on April 13th.
1526720	1527720	Itís all right there.
1527720	1530840	It gives a little hints about whatís going on.
1530840	1537160	Thereís going to be a shield, the whole bubble shield thing, and whatever, trip mines.
1537160	1541000	Itís going to be interesting, itís going to add a whole new element to the game, but
1541000	1545840	they swear it will not be, like, something thatís, you know, exploitable.
1545840	1549240	You know, itís something thatís going to be limited, all that functionality.
1549240	1551400	So weíll see.
1551400	1554600	Lord knows I could use a shield when Iím playing Halo, because I get shot in the face
1554600	1555840	all the time when Iím playing Halo.
1555840	1556840	I donít like it.
1556840	1559360	Shot in the face is fun.
1559360	1560360	Not really.
1560360	1561360	Not if itís you.
1561360	1562360	Itís getting shot.
1562360	1563360	I donít get shot in the face.
1563360	1570560	But something, though, that is, I think, pretty neat is Pac-Man Versus is going to the Nintendo
1570560	1572880	DS by way of the Namco Museum.
1572880	1574480	Isnít that cool?
1574480	1584600	For anyone who doesnít know, Pac-Man Versus was a, it was like where you played on your
1584600	1591480	portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man while you had your Pac-Man controller
1591480	1592480	playing on the main screen.
1592480	1593480	I thought it was the other way around.
1593480	1598640	I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and then one person had Pac-Man
1598640	1602800	on the, or Game Boy Advance.
1602800	1603800	I never played it.
1603800	1607080	No, the ghosts were split on the screen, thatís right, and it was Pac-Man that was on the
1607080	1608080	Game Boy.
1608080	1609520	You know what I meant.
1609520	1614160	Pac-Man could see everything going on, but I thought it was funny because it was actually
1614160	1618240	really loud when people would play it at my house and be like, ìIs it fun?î
1618240	1619240	Was it fun?
1619240	1620240	Yeah, itís fun.
1620240	1621240	Itís pretty fun.
1621240	1627520	But itís going to be a, it has the multiplayer packed in as 20 bucks and also will include
1627520	1634880	Dig Dug 2, Xevious, Pac-Man, Mappy, Galaxian, Galaga, and Tower of Druaga.
1634880	1637120	Which a lot of those are shit games, but.
1637120	1639000	I love Xevious and Mappy and Galaxian.
1639000	1641760	Those games are cool, but Tower of Druaga, have you ever actually played it?
1641760	1642760	It sucks.
1642760	1643760	No, but I have a sticker for it.
1643760	1644760	Alright, well it sucks.
1644760	1646880	I want the Valkyrie game.
1646880	1650040	Actually I have the Valkyrie game on TurboGrafx.
1650040	1653000	But do you get to play Wi-Fi, like over the internet?
1653000	1656640	That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man Versus on Wi-Fi.
1656640	1657640	Probably not.
1657640	1663320	Alright, well, weíre starting to get late into the show and we still have not done this
1663320	1667160	segment and I donít know, for some reason putting this segment after a story about the
1667160	1670880	Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate, so itís time to bring on the pain in our
1670880	1672680	FUs of the week.
1672680	1679560	Dark Sakura, whatís your bitch this week?
1679560	1689800	Um, I have a rash.
1689800	1690800	Thatís it.
1690800	1691800	Thatís it?
1691800	1692800	F you to your rash?
1692800	1694300	F you to my rash.
1694300	1695300	Where is your rash?
1695300	1696300	Is it in a private place?
1696300	1701320	Or is it a place where I can see it?
1701320	1703320	No questions asked.
1703320	1706320	Itís on my back.
1706320	1708320	On her back, okay.
1708320	1713800	Itís obviously an allergic reaction to something, because whenever I have a rash thatís an
1713800	1715800	allergic reaction, it gets bloody.
1715800	1716800	Ew.
1716800	1720800	So yeah, Iím going to the dermatologist, hopefully next week.
1720800	1721800	Thatíll be fun.
1721800	1722800	Lucky!
1722800	1723800	God, I had an FU earlier.
1723800	1724800	I donít know.
1724800	1725800	Iíve got nothing.
1725800	1726800	Iím really pissed off at.
1726800	1727800	Iím hungry.
1727800	1728800	F you to hunger?
1728800	1729800	Yeah.
1729800	1730800	F you to world hunger?
1730800	1731800	No, itís my hunger.
1731800	1744440	Iím going to say I also F you toÖ F you to the fact that I ate all that pocky, thatís
1744440	1746440	going to make me fat.
1746440	1751880	F you to the freaking aquarium that IÖ if you listen to the bonus segment live tonight
1751880	1755040	or on all games that doesnít go to podcasts, youíre going to be talking about my aquarium
1755040	1759880	I bought, and it killed one of my fish, so F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed
1759880	1762960	my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.
1762960	1765280	Bastard filter.
1765280	1766880	Bastard aquarium.
1766880	1770040	Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart
1770040	1771040	said it would work.
1771040	1772040	So F you to PetSmart.
1772040	1773040	Thatís it.
1773040	1776320	Those were nice short FUs this week.
1776320	1777320	Yes.
1777320	1778320	Good times.
1778320	1781680	Weíll open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.
1781680	1786380	Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking
1786380	1787380	around about.
1787380	1793720	I donít even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is a girly putting
1793720	1796280	up or putting on makeup game.
1796280	1802520	So itís called Cosmetic Paradise, and itís a makeup adventure game, and you live in the
1802520	1810000	magical land of cosmetics and must undergo a trial before becoming a queen.
1810000	1815700	Their heroine must help the townís ladies when they want to confess their love to boys.
1815700	1817560	Help comes in the form of makeup.
1817560	1821720	It says in-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.
1821720	1825640	The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.
1825640	1831040	There are mini games which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.
1831040	1835520	The Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so that items can be exchanged with friends and players
1835520	1839200	and so you can do each otherís makeup.
1839200	1844680	I want this game because it sounds so stupid.
1844680	1847520	Come on Dark Sakura, get the makeup game and play with me.
1847520	1851880	We can do each otherís makeup.
1851880	1860960	This is one of the strangest attempts to get that girl gamer demographic that no one seems
1860960	1861960	to get.
1861960	1866560	I donít know, Dark Sakura, will this make you want to play video games?
1866560	1867940	The makeup game?
1867940	1884640	You can visit the world of Katwa and Cosmetica?
1884640	1887960	What if you could do the gothic Lolita thing with the makeup?
1887960	1889960	That would be awesome.
1889960	1895600	If I could play Be Gothic Lolita the game, then I would definitely do that.
1895600	1898440	Thatís great.
1898440	1902480	In chat, theyíre asking who died, Zach or Kelly, because my two fish were named Zach
1902480	1905800	and Kelly because my aquarium is named Bayside.
1905800	1907060	Kelly died.
1907060	1908060	Kelly was the fat one.
1908060	1911700	She got sucked right up in the filter, so I fear for Zach because Zach was kind of scrawny,
1911700	1913700	so heís the littler fish.
1913700	1916240	I get sucked up and just shop right back out again.
1916240	1921320	I know, Iím kind of worried about that, but he wonít be alive by the time I get back
1921320	1922320	from LA.
1922320	1925500	Either heíll get sucked into the filter tonight or X4 wonít feed him.
1925500	1926500	One of the two will happen.
1926500	1929440	Well, you can leave the fish in there and heíll just eat the other fish.
1929440	1931000	I get you a miniature koi.
1931000	1932000	Weíll see.
1932000	1934120	Letís get Rob a piranha.
1934120	1936640	Thatíd be cool.
1936640	1939640	Letís see.
1939640	1944000	The Rob D says, ìOf course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.î
1944000	1946200	Talking about the makeup game.
1946200	1948520	Gaming Nerd says, ìThis sounds like a sky game, LOL.î
1948520	1949840	What, because Iím gay?
1949840	1951920	Dude, I donít do makeup and stuff.
1951920	1952920	Thatís gay.
1952920	1954920	Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.
1954920	1955920	Thatís different.
1955920	1956920	Thatís theater.
1956920	1959320	I donít even really do makeup at Rocky.
1959320	1965280	Letís see, Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, ìMakeup games sell more copies than even
1965280	1966280	GTA.
1966280	1969160	Oh my God, video games are no longer violent.î
1969160	1970160	Interesting.
1970160	1973720	Hi, we can hear you.
1973720	1979000	Letís see.
1979000	1982680	Bandit in chat says, ìAs long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all
1982680	1983680	win.î There we go.
1983680	1985160	Zach liked fatties.
1985160	1988760	Yeah, I like to smoke them.
1988760	1990840	All right, letís open up the Skype line.
1990840	1994400	If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.
1994400	1995400	We have extra time.
1995400	1996400	We should have done a game tonight.
1996400	1998320	I donít have anything prepped though.
1998320	1999320	Oh well.
1999320	2003080	Weíll take extra calls, I guess, if thereís folks that actually want to call us.
2003080	2009980	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always call us on the regular telephone
2009980	2010980	as well.
2010980	2017560	Thatís 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2017560	2021120	You can ask us about any of the news we talked about tonight or if you have a comment or
2021120	2022120	whatever.
2022120	2024560	Or you know what, you can just ask us anything tonight.
2024560	2026160	We have a lot of extra time.
2026160	2027160	Who cares?
2027160	2028920	Itís potpourri night here on the phones.
2028920	2030360	Hi, youíre on OrangeLoungeRadio.
2030360	2031360	Whoís this?
2031360	2032360	Good evening.
2032360	2033360	This is DMN.
2033360	2034360	Hi, DMN.
2034360	2035360	Whatís up?
2035360	2040920	Iím calling about one of your stories at the top of the show regarding Nintendo and
2040920	2043160	their shortages of Wiiís.
2043160	2044160	Yes.
2044160	2049920	I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve
2049920	2053840	the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiiís.
2053840	2057440	So theyíre purposefully holding back, you think?
2057440	2059640	I do.
2059640	2066240	The big talk around wherever I am is whereís the Wiiís, whereís the Wiiís.
2066240	2069920	Nintendo is trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get
2069920	2074400	them even more.
2074400	2075880	Is that right?
2075880	2077000	What is your opinion on that?
2077000	2078620	Is that right?
2078620	2081520	I think itís stupid.
2081520	2086520	They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win
2086520	2091400	that console war, they need to sell more systems, especially financially.
2091400	2097400	They need to sell two systems for every one of Sonyís PS3 and they need to sell three
2097400	2099920	systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.
2099920	2103880	Yeah, but thatís not necessarily true because theyíre making a profit off each system whereas
2103880	2107360	everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.
2107360	2109360	That is true.
2109360	2114880	Owned by Loki.
2114880	2119000	And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title,
2119000	2128400	Iím surprised Nintendo has released this game and Wiiís are still not readily available.
2128400	2130400	I donít know.
2130400	2133540	I would think that thereís no point to making a shortage now.
2133540	2138600	You donít hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.
2138600	2139600	I donít know.
2139600	2142680	Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas, but even then it would be stupid
2142680	2148440	to do it around Christmas because then thatís when you make your most money.
2148440	2150920	So I donít get the point of a forced shortage.
2150920	2152440	I just donít understand it.
2152440	2156520	Maybe I donít know enough about economics.
2156520	2160480	My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.
2160480	2161480	What?
2161480	2164240	Thatís just my two cents on the matter.
2164240	2165240	Anything else?
2165240	2166240	Whatís up on STFU this week?
2166240	2171800	We didnít have a show last week and the week before I wasnít on so everybody has to suffer
2171800	2173800	because Iím back this week.
2173800	2174800	Congrats.
2174800	2176960	What are you giggling about?
2176960	2179080	Why are there giggling girls over there?
2179080	2180080	I forget Safeword.
2180080	2181080	I donít get it.
2181080	2182080	Bondage!
2182080	2183080	Oh.
2183080	2184080	Oh.
2184080	2185080	I thought I was thinking Safeword.
2185080	2189560	Itís a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, ìI forget Safeword.î
2189560	2190560	Yeah.
2190560	2191560	Hi, John.
2191560	2192560	Hi, Jamie.
2192560	2197920	No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.
2197920	2199320	Oh, hi Irene.
2199320	2201840	Sheís running out of the room crying.
2201840	2202840	All right.
2202840	2206280	I better go call her and talk to her then.
2206280	2207280	Oh, really now?
2207280	2208280	Gotta go.
2208280	2209280	Bye.
2209280	2210280	You so just got caught.
2210280	2211280	All right.
2211280	2212280	Letís take another call.
2212280	2229200	Hi, youíre on Orange
2229200	2230200	Jersey.
2230200	2232960	Youíre always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.
2232960	2234400	What was going on at the end of the break?
2234400	2235680	Was there a tourney or something?
2235680	2236680	No.
2236680	2241680	A massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.
2241680	2245400	But yeah, just word of 2DX and whatnot.
2245400	2253800	But yeah, I donít get why Activision does wonderful things to your 360, case in point,
2253800	2258760	breaking it with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.
2258760	2261400	So basically, if you want theóI mean, I donít get it.
2261400	2265760	If you want the whammy bar fixed, youíre going to have to go through an arm and a leg
2265760	2271600	and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking.
2271600	2274520	I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.
2274520	2276600	Luckily, I wonít have to for a week.
2276600	2279400	So maybe itíll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because Iím going to be gone
2279400	2280400	for a while.
2280400	2285600	But Iím afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because if my 360 breaks, Iím going to be so mad
2285600	2288960	because I know when I call Microsoft, like now they want you to pay to get it fixed.
2288960	2293120	Iím going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesnít deserve
2293120	2294120	it.
2294120	2295120	Think about it, Ryan.
2295120	2296120	Yeah, I understand that.
2296120	2301120	But you know itís like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?
2301120	2302120	What?
2302120	2303720	Thatís a staggering number.
2303720	2304720	9 out of every 10?
2304720	2305720	Yeah, thatís bullshit.
2305720	2306720	Yeah, somebodyís pointed that out here.
2306720	2307720	A 90% break rate though.
2307720	2310720	It says something about a 90% break rate.
2310720	2312120	A 90% break rate?
2312120	2313120	Come on.
2313120	2314120	If that were happeningó
2314120	2315120	I know.
2315120	2320080	No, but only for the people who actually downloaded, who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably
2320080	2321080	notó
2321080	2322080	I know.
2322080	2323080	No, thatís notó
2323080	2324360	It doesnít represent the entire user base at all.
2324360	2325360	But thereís likeó
2325360	2326360	Yeah, thatís bullshit.
2326360	2329420	Iím telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of
2329420	2330760	people on them right now.
2330760	2333080	That game is selling like crazy.
2333080	2336200	I know that youíre not supposed to judge sales of a game based on a leaderboard, but
2336200	2337200	you kind of can.
2337200	2338200	You kind of can.
2338200	2339200	But think about it.
2339200	2343360	Donít you think it was a rush job to get Guitar Hero 2 to the 360 in the first place?
2343360	2345000	Oh, Iím sure it was.
2345000	2348840	Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?
2348840	2349840	I want to know.
2349840	2350840	I mean, of theó
2350840	2358960	How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch break one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the
2358960	2360240	actual number is?
2360240	2361240	1%, whatever.
2361240	2362800	How does it break one 360?
2362800	2364040	I had no idea.
2364040	2368520	All I know is that no matteróI mean, it could happen anytime.
2368520	2369520	Itís completely unrelated.
2369520	2370520	Itís basically like death.
2370520	2374120	Itís like the odds of dying in a car accident.
2374120	2378360	You know, theyíre much higher than actually dying of terrorism.
2378360	2379360	What?
2379360	2380360	Okay, shut up.
2380360	2381360	Knock it off.
2381360	2382360	Listen.
2382360	2385040	Hereís why this crap is going on.
2385040	2387720	Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.
2387720	2391160	Thatís why you get people saying, ìOh, 90% of the consoles are breaking afteróî No,
2391160	2394840	itís because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.
2394840	2398520	Thatís why I have a little 360-form, so you canít blame me for that.
2398520	2400520	No, it might be that your system died.
2400520	2401520	All right?
2401520	2405920	You can put it on the 360-forms from other people who are experiencing the same issue.
2405920	2406920	Yeah, but one personó
2406920	2408680	And they shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.
2408680	2411800	Yeah, but one person has their system crash and then another person is like, ìWell, why
2411800	2412800	did this crash since day two?
2412800	2417400	It must be because of Guitar Hero.î And then other people, ìOh, my friendís system crashed
2417400	2424640	too.î I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now itís broken and itís all because
2424640	2425640	of Guitar Hero.
2425640	2426640	Well, thatís besides the point.
2426640	2430640	I just want to take a bath in my 360.
2430640	2435960	Non-Microsoft, I donít get how a non-Microsoft update can actually break a 360.
2435960	2436960	I donít either.
2436960	2437960	Thatís the first time.
2437960	2439240	I mean, thatís the first time I heard of that.
2439240	2445840	I heard of Microsoft doing that to other unlucky ones and thatís why Iím worried.
2445840	2452200	Iím holding off on the 360 because of that, because of the fact that any update can break
2452200	2455320	my system and I have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to get it replaced.
2455320	2457600	Itís not even worth the time and effort.
2457600	2462280	Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still breaking after theyíve uninstalled
2462280	2466040	the update and when theyíre going into the dashboard, which wouldnít even be running
2466040	2469280	the game at all and wouldnít have anything to do with the fucking update.
2469280	2471560	So itís not related and people are retarded.
2471560	2473560	This conversation is giving me a migraine.
2473560	2477160	Oh, well, I think weíll leave it at that.
2477160	2478160	All right, Zaku.
2478160	2483200	Thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesnít kill your family, okay?
2483200	2484200	All right.
2484200	2485200	All right.
2485200	2486840	Take care.
2486840	2492960	The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and itís killing grandmas across the nation.
2492960	2494520	Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio.
2494520	2495520	Whoís this?
2495520	2496520	Hey, whatís up, guys?
2496520	2497520	Hi, whatís on your mind?
2497520	2498520	Whoís this?
2498520	2500680	This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold them?
2500680	2503760	Hello, the Rob D. Iím not dodging you and hold them.
2503760	2504760	I understand.
2504760	2505760	I understand.
2505760	2507840	You guys play on a bad night, God.
2507840	2509120	Play on like a Monday night.
2509120	2510120	Nothing happens on Monday.
2510120	2511120	Oh, fuck.
2511120	2512120	Heroes is back next week.
2512120	2513120	Never mind.
2513120	2518040	Actually, as a college student, weeknights would be worse, but either way, thatís not
2518040	2519040	what I call them.
2519040	2520040	All right.
2520040	2521040	Whatís on your mind?
2521040	2524240	Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable
2524240	2525240	content.
2525240	2530480	What to you would be a better solution, the iTunes model of buying one song a piece or
2530480	2536360	actually whatís the more egregious offense, the three-song packs or the cost per song,
2536360	2541640	which to me is also pretty bad?
2541640	2544360	One of those songs ended up, but they ended up costing $2 a song, right?
2544360	2545880	About $2.10 per piece, per song.
2545880	2546880	Okay.
2546880	2550560	I think it should just be, they should be priced, I think DDR, even though thereís
2550560	2554640	a whole another can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on
2554640	2559240	the disk and people were mad about that, but that aside, I think the pricing scheme over
2559240	2560240	there was somewhat fair.
2560240	2564520	It was, what, 100 points a song, so it worked out to be, what, $1.25 or something?
2564520	2568960	So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought like a pack of 10, you got a discount,
2568960	2571160	so it only ended up being like a dollar a song.
2571160	2572160	I like that.
2572160	2573160	Yeah.
2573160	2577280	A dollar per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download
2577280	2579640	because I donít want to download every Guitar Hero song.
2579640	2582840	Right, and same thing with DDR is that, you know what, maybe I donít want Candy because
2582840	2587560	Candyís been in every freaking DDR game lately, so maybe I want to skip that one, but I have
2587560	2590840	that option, or I could just download the Mega Pack and itís kind of included.
2590840	2594120	It depends how many of the songs I want, but hereís the other difference between the DDR
2594120	2598940	packs is that not only are they cheaper because itís $1.25 a song, but they are new songs
2598940	2600280	mostly to the series.
2600280	2604280	About, letís say, three quarters of them are new, right?
2604280	2609560	Yeah, I think paying that much and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy
2609560	2613240	all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I donít remember how much, I think
2613240	2617540	it was about $90, then thatís ridiculous.
2617540	2618540	What do you think?
2618540	2619540	Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?
2619540	2622440	Do you think theyíre going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the
2622440	2625460	internet or do you think, you know, hey, if some suckerís going to buy it, letís keep
2625460	2626460	cranking it out?
2626460	2631160	If enough people buy them, not a chance.
2631160	2633800	So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, donít buy it.
2633800	2638840	Exactly, and honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song
2638840	2639840	individually.
2639840	2643040	I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I donít have to download every
2643040	2644040	song.
2644040	2646320	But if theyíre going to put them in three packs, no way.
2646320	2650920	I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar
2650920	2652520	Hero songs are kind of long.
2652520	2656280	You know, DDR songs are short, theyíre like, what, a minute and a half, a minute and 45,
2656280	2659880	so you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs
2659880	2660880	so they could be more.
2660880	2664160	I would, youíre right, Iíd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual
2664160	2665160	song.
2665160	2666160	But none of this packs stuff.
2666160	2667160	I donít like that.
2667160	2669560	Yeah, I think itís almost a double offense in their case.
2669560	2673760	Another game I want to play, though, is the Phoenix Ride, or not the Phoenix Ride game,
2673760	2675040	the Harvey Birdman game.
2675040	2676880	I think thatís a perfect license for Capcom.
2676880	2679920	Yeah, do you think theyíre going to kind of model it after Phoenix Ride or what do
2679920	2680920	you think itís going to be like?
2680920	2683400	I donít think they could avoid it, honestly.
2683400	2687400	I think that theyíd be almost remiss not to do that.
2687400	2688400	Objection!
2688400	2689400	I guess weíll see.
2689400	2690400	Iíll take the case.
2690400	2693840	Do you think Phoenix Ride is popular enough that enough people would get it, like thereíd
2693840	2698920	be enough cross-interest between the two franchises, Phoenix Ride and Harvey Birdman?
2698920	2702320	Maybe itíd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.
2702320	2704320	I guess thatís true.
2704320	2705320	All right, well, RobÖ
2705320	2706600	It depends how theyíll do it.
2706600	2708080	Rob D., anything else on your mind?
2708080	2709080	No, thatís about it.
2709080	2710080	Iíll let you guys take some more calls.
2710080	2711080	All right, sounds good.
2711080	2714120	Iíll give your podcast a cheap plug over on AllGames.com.
2714120	2716320	You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?
2716320	2717320	Five times a week?
2717320	2718320	Yeah, itís a lot of fun.
2718320	2719320	All right.
2719320	2720320	Monday to Friday.
2720320	2721320	Itís so much fun.
2721320	2722320	All right.
2722320	2723320	Yeah, thanks a lot.
2723320	2724320	See you guys later.
2724320	2725320	No problem.
2725320	2726320	See you.
2726320	2727320	Letís go to another call.
2727320	2729320	Weíll take this call here.
2729320	2731360	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
2731360	2732360	Whoís this?
2732360	2733360	Itís Raven Stoffman!
2733360	2734360	Ah!
2734360	2735360	What do you want?
2735360	2736360	Iím sorry.
2736360	2738400	Iím just so excited tonight.
2738400	2740080	Why is that?
2740080	2741720	Because you picked up my call.
2741720	2744040	Well, here you are.
2744040	2745880	You get in almost every week you call.
2745880	2748520	Very rare do you not seem to get in.
2748520	2749800	We have to be ultra busy.
2749800	2752520	Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, thereís
2752520	2753520	not a lot of folks calling in.
2753520	2754600	So, here you go.
2754600	2756280	The phones are dead except for you right now.
2756280	2757680	I think weíve got all the other calls.
2757680	2759920	So, whatís on your mind?
2759920	2760920	Whatís on my mind?
2760920	2761920	Yeah.
2761920	2762920	Oh, what was?
2762920	2763920	Okay.
2763920	2767840	Sam and Max is on my mind, Culture Shock and all the rest.
2767840	2771320	This last season is coming out this month and Iím so sad.
2771320	2772320	Have you been playing Sam and Max?
2772320	2774160	I didnít realize youíve been playing Sam and Max.
2774160	2778200	Oh, Iíve been playing Sam and Max since it first came out.
2778200	2781720	How is it for those folks that havenít really been playing the series?
2781720	2786320	Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?
2786320	2790560	Dude, you should be playing this game because itís kind of like a text adventure and you
2790560	2794520	go around places and the characters are so lovable.
2794520	2797920	If Sam is so funny, weíll go like, ìHoly fish, based on a dance talker.
2797920	2802920	Weíre on it, chief.î And he will hang up the phones like, ìWhatís wrong, sap?
2802920	2804800	We have to sabotage the president.
2804800	2808560	Heís doing something wrong.î And it has like funny dialogue.
2808560	2812880	And you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things, itís a text adventure
2812880	2813880	game.
2813880	2819440	I know you say youíre sad because the series is ending and I think weíve all heard, you
2819440	2821400	know, the last episode for now is coming out.
2821400	2824500	But donít you think that the series has been popular enough that we havenít seen the end
2824500	2826240	of it yet?
2826240	2832720	I think season two has got to be imminent, but I donít know when.
2832720	2838560	Well, I guess thatís true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live?
2838560	2840680	Oh, I hope so.
2840680	2843080	Iím heavily addicted to this game now.
2843080	2846980	Would you play through it again if it came out on Xbox Live or Wii or anything like that?
2846980	2853200	I think I would, but it wouldnít be enjoyable unless they had like something new in it.
2853200	2856120	Anything else youíve been playing this week?
2856120	2857440	Did you talk about Phoenix Wright?
2857440	2860480	My computer overheated if you talked about it.
2860480	2863720	We did mention at the end of part A in our last caller just mentioned Phoenix Wright.
2863720	2865240	Are you a Phoenix Wright fan?
2865240	2871560	Oh my God, I was just running around just screaming my head off going like, ìItís
2871560	2872560	Phoenix Wright 3!
2872560	2877240	Theyíre finally going to bring it out!î I was like, ìHoly shit, I hope it comes out
2877240	2882640	soon because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All,î Iíve been just
2882640	2885640	going just itching for another one.
2885640	2888400	Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark because it seems like theyíre
2888400	2890000	really starting to crank these out?
2890000	2893320	Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.
2893320	2896760	If it comes out tomorrow, Iím there.
2896760	2901840	The Rob Dís in chat says, ìI could envision Ravenstaufen seeing the news, getting up screaming
2901840	2905200	and running around.î Do you have a video on YouTube of this?
2905200	2906200	I should.
2906200	2907200	Thatís what you should do.
2907200	2912200	I should just go, ìOh my God, itís Phoenix Wright!î I should put it in the alt key.
2912200	2913200	Exactly.
2913200	2916120	All right, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaufen?
2916120	2919960	One more thing, as usual.
2919960	2925440	I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.
2925440	2928160	Through the Skype line or through that other service?
2928160	2932720	No, no, no, all live through the Skype line.
2932720	2934800	Did somebody patch the show into you or something?
2934800	2935840	No, no.
2935840	2938640	I actually did something ingenious if you have time.
2938640	2941720	Just give me one minute to tell me, to tell you.
2941720	2942720	Okay.
2942720	2945920	You got me curious, what is up?
2945920	2946920	Okay.
2946920	2953400	My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone and Rob D showed
2953400	2959120	me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer, and that
2959120	2961320	works great and I can hear you.
2961320	2966840	While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.
2966840	2972120	So, you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.
2972120	2974480	No, I called my cell phone.
2974480	2976480	Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.
2976480	2977480	Oh, my gosh.
2977480	2978480	Wow, that's hardcore, Ravenstaufen.
2978480	2984440	He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically
2984440	2985440	pick up.
2985440	2986440	I think I get it now.
2986440	2987440	Mm-hmm.
2987440	2989800	But that's pretty hardcore.
2989800	2990800	You're pretty hardcore.
2990800	2991800	A big nerd.
2991800	2992800	Yeah, a big nerd.
2992800	2994000	Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.
2994000	2995000	Well, thank you.
2995000	2996000	You're taking us to compliment.
2996000	2997000	But you're crazy.
2997000	2998000	You do know this.
2998000	2999640	I know this, but that's okay.
2999640	3001920	All right, Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go.
3001920	3002920	Take more calls.
3002920	3003920	That is fine.
3003920	3004920	Bye.
3004920	3005920	Enjoy.
3005920	3008280	Hopefully, they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for
3008280	3010280	all the calls they're making.
3010280	3011280	Okay.
3011280	3012280	All right.
3012280	3013280	Let's go to another call.
3013280	3015280	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3015280	3016280	Who's this?
3016280	3018280	Hello, all you happy people.
3018280	3020160	Hey, I can barely hear you.
3020160	3021160	Get a little closer to your mic.
3021160	3022160	Try again.
3022160	3024160	Hello, all you happy people.
3024160	3025160	Hey, who's this?
3025160	3026160	This is Dark Knight.
3026160	3027160	Hey, Dark Knight.
3027160	3028160	What's on your mind, buddy?
3028160	3029160	Nothing much.
3029160	3035880	Just hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just make me not convinced to still
3035880	3036880	not get one.
3036880	3039680	So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?
3039680	3042440	I am not a next gen owner at all.
3042440	3043440	At all.
3043440	3045640	You're still in the ancient times.
3045640	3046640	Well, not really.
3046640	3050560	I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.
3050560	3054800	The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.
3054800	3058320	Do you play handhelds at all?
3058320	3060320	I still own a DS.
3060320	3062320	It's the only thing I got.
3062320	3068520	DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.
3068520	3073160	Do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?
3073160	3077160	Thinking about it a while back, but like I said, hearing the brick situation and everything
3077160	3080640	just makes me cut and change my mind every time.
3080640	3086840	It is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.
3086840	3090360	I always said, oh, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send
3090360	3091360	their consoles back.
3091360	3092960	You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.
3092960	3095840	Then it did happen to me, and I remember ranting about it on the show.
3095840	3098040	I got a brick 360 back in February.
3098040	3099720	My first 360 bricked after like a week.
3099720	3103800	I was so pissed.
3103800	3110200	It's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation, you know what I mean?
3110200	3114000	Especially now they want to charge you their beer.
3114000	3115000	What's that?
3115000	3116320	I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.
3116320	3120160	As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill
3120160	3121160	Gates got this name.
3121160	3124040	There ain't nothing wrong with it.
3124040	3127520	Yet the darn thing is still bricked, I don't know.
3127520	3128520	It happens a lot.
3128520	3129520	Well, I don't know.
3129520	3133520	I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird.
3133520	3138500	People don't just show up out of the woodwork, suddenly a handful of people all have their
3138500	3141280	consoles go kaput at the same time because of Guitar Hero.
3141280	3145000	But I would think that Microsoft has this stuff trended, and if something's going on,
3145000	3147120	you're going to hear something about it on Monday.
3147120	3151280	I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Fantasy Star University
3151280	3155440	and hearing people say, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, my room got hacked, every
3155440	3156440	20 minutes.
3156440	3160280	Speaking of which, you're still following Fantasy Star Universe, right?
3160280	3161280	Yes.
3161280	3162280	What news is going on over there?
3162280	3165860	Because I kind of abandoned the game, but I know it's still going strong.
3165860	3168360	What's up with Fantasy Star Universe?
3168360	3170520	Right now, it's leveled off.
3170520	3177160	Not much hacking going on anymore, just basically money problems in the game and whatnot, plus
3177160	3179960	they updated the lobby again recently.
3179960	3183800	Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you've visited all the planets
3183800	3186160	and do all those basic quests?
3186160	3189360	Yes, we're doing S2 missions now.
3189360	3195320	Most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot, like some areas where
3195320	3199880	they get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.
3199880	3200880	What else then?
3200880	3205560	We've got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops, that's all.
3205560	3206560	Sounds pretty cool.
3206560	3207560	All right, Wayne.
3207560	3208560	Yes?
3208560	3212560	Then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.
3212560	3213620	Oh, that's right.
3213620	3214840	There's that expansion pack coming out.
3214840	3216960	When's that supposed to be released?
3216960	3219880	Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the US might
3219880	3220880	see it in December.
3220880	3223360	I guess that's better than never.
3223360	3224360	Yes.
3224360	3226960	I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.
3226960	3231400	So far, from what inside information I got from one of the chat regulars here, it looks
3231400	3234240	pretty interesting with the expansion.
3234240	3237960	Well, spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.
3237960	3238960	Make it so.
3238960	3241400	We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.
3241400	3243600	I'm doing it enough times as it is.
3243600	3244600	All right.
3244600	3245600	We appreciate it.
3245600	3246600	All right.
3246600	3247600	Thanks so much for the call.
3247600	3248600	We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.
3248600	3249600	No problem.
3249600	3250600	You too.
3250600	3251600	All right.
3251600	3254320	Thank you so much for the call and in chat seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight
3254320	3255320	on the phone.
3255320	3256320	Oh, man.
3256320	3258320	I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.
3258320	3260040	I'd be a little scared too.
3260040	3261040	Hi.
3261040	3262040	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3262040	3263040	Who's this?
3263040	3264040	Hi.
3264040	3266040	My name's Billy.
3266040	3268360	Hi, Billy.
3268360	3270360	How old are you, Billy?
3270360	3272560	I'm eight.
3272560	3274080	You're eight, huh?
3274080	3278000	And what are you doing listening to this program?
3278000	3279840	My daddy said I could.
3279840	3281240	Your daddy said you could, huh?
3281240	3284280	Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?
3284280	3285720	Yeah.
3285720	3290600	What kind of video games do you play, Billy?
3290600	3292120	The Mario one.
3292120	3293480	You play the Mario one?
3293480	3296880	Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.
3296880	3297880	Which Mario game is your favorite?
3297880	3298880	The one on the Wii.
3298880	3300240	The one on the Wii?
3300240	3306400	You play Super Paper Mario or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?
3306400	3310640	I don't know what the virtual console is.
3310640	3313360	You don't know what a virtual console is?
3313360	3314360	No.
3314360	3315360	Okay.
3315360	3321280	Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?
3321280	3327920	My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with a guitar hero thing.
3327920	3337480	It didn't work and he threw it out the window and I don't know what to do.
3337480	3344840	Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window or did he throw the guitar out the window?
3344840	3348080	I think the Xbox.
3348080	3350680	He threw the entire Xbox out the window?
3350680	3351920	Yeah.
3351920	3356120	Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?
3356120	3359640	I think he hit a kitten.
3359640	3360640	Really?
3360640	3361640	Yeah.
3361640	3363840	There was a flat sound.
3363840	3365560	That's sad.
3365560	3369080	Nobody likes a flat pussy.
3369080	3372080	I don't know what to ask this kid.
3372080	3376000	So why are you calling us to tell us your dad is throwing things at the neighborhood
3376000	3377000	animals?
3377000	3379160	Shouldn't you call the cops if it's that concerning?
3379160	3386920	Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.
3386920	3388040	What do you want us to do to help?
3388040	3390720	Loki, they think it's you calling him, by the way, but you're right here, right?
3390720	3391720	I'm not calling him.
3391720	3392720	He's right here.
3392720	3393720	He's right there.
3393720	3394720	My voice does not sound like that.
3394720	3401520	My dad, my daddy, thinks Loki's stupid.
3401520	3405120	Why is Loki stupid?
3405120	3408840	Because my daddy loves Max.
3408840	3410680	Your daddy loves men?
3410680	3412040	No, Max.
3412040	3413040	Oh, Max.
3413040	3414880	Oh, your daddy loves Max.
3414880	3415880	Okay.
3415880	3416880	No.
3416880	3417880	That's true.
3417880	3418880	My daddy said that.
3418880	3421720	No, my daddy is not like you, Sky.
3421720	3422720	Oh, okay.
3422720	3424040	Oh, you know what that is at eight years old.
3424040	3425040	I see.
3425040	3426040	You're very perceptive for eight.
3426040	3428040	Are you a Mensa member, Billy?
3428040	3429040	No.
3429040	3430040	What's a Mensa?
3430040	3431040	Don't worry.
3431040	3432040	It's nothing.
3432040	3433800	It's a club for smart people.
3433800	3435080	It's nothing like Menzies.
3435080	3437520	That's all you need to know.
3437520	3441120	So what else are we going to ask this kid about?
3441120	3446840	Oh, don't even go there, Dark Soccer.
3446840	3447840	So well, since we're babysitting-
3447840	3448840	Baby's cool.
3448840	3449840	What?
3449840	3452520	Dark Soccer is cool.
3452520	3453520	Actually if you meet her-
3453520	3454520	Well, that-
3454520	3455520	She's a real bitch, but-
3455520	3458520	That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.
3458520	3459520	Hey!
3459520	3461520	I'm great.
3461520	3462520	Okay.
3462520	3466160	Let's see.
3466160	3470040	I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain
3470040	3472760	you?
3472760	3475800	Can we watch The Lion King?
3475800	3476800	Sure you can.
3476800	3477800	Yes.
3477800	3482440	We'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.
3482440	3487040	I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.
3487040	3490040	It's the circle of life.
3490040	3491920	I'm scared.
3491920	3496320	I think I'm going to hang up now.
3496320	3497320	All right.
3497320	3498320	You do that.
3498320	3499320	Okay.
3499320	3500320	Bye.
3500320	3501320	All right.
3501320	3502320	Thank you.
3502320	3503320	Bye.
3503320	3506880	Which number of callers was that crank calling us?
3506880	3508720	Do you think that was DMN or-
3508720	3509720	I can't say.
3509720	3511920	They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.
3511920	3515840	So whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone.
3515840	3517840	You know who that was, DarkSakura?
3517840	3519960	You're a jerk.
3519960	3522240	Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us through his magic-
3522240	3523240	Excuse me.
3523240	3527920	I was here with the microphone set down looking at fucking Caturday pictures.
3527920	3528920	Telepathy.
3528920	3529920	Hi.
3529920	3530920	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3530920	3531920	Who's this?
3531920	3532920	Uh-oh.
3532920	3533960	Call dropped.
3533960	3534960	Try again.
3534960	3536720	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3536720	3537920	You can always call us on Skype.
3537920	3542040	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3542040	3545720	Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?
3545720	3550760	I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment
3550760	3551760	now.
3551760	3553240	DidYouLoseASock says, Who was it?
3553240	3554240	That was funny.
3554240	3555240	Let's see.
3555240	3560440	GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.
3560440	3564120	GamingNerd says, Sky loves swearing to eight-year-olds.
3564120	3567860	Misty says, If we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch a
3567860	3568860	bitch about that makeup.
3568860	3572600	Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.
3572600	3573600	Hi.
3573600	3574600	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3574600	3575600	Who's this?
3575600	3576600	It's Zappi.
3576600	3577600	Hey, our match game champion.
3577600	3578600	Zappi, what's on your mind?
3578600	3582400	Well, since you brought Pop Pury up, you brought this upon yourself.
3582400	3585600	How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?
3585600	3590080	It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.
3590080	3591080	What happened?
3591080	3594720	Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.
3594720	3596280	Oh, I didn't have no idea.
3596280	3598080	I didn't really mean to be an asshole.
3598080	3599080	No, it's okay.
3599080	3601560	Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.
3601560	3603800	No, it's My Computer's Dying.
3603800	3604920	Aww.
3604920	3609040	The Vio is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.
3609040	3611940	Do you want me to find it and burn it into a DVD for you?
3611940	3615840	I do not burn it into a Divix or X-video format.
3615840	3616840	I need MPEGs.
3616840	3618880	I don't know how to do that.
3618880	3622320	I don't want it burned as a DVD-playing file.
3622320	3626280	I want it as just data without extra crap on it.
3626280	3627280	I think I can do that.
3627280	3628280	I don't know.
3628280	3629280	Okay, MPEG.
3629280	3630280	MPEG is the winner.
3630280	3631280	I'll try.
3631280	3632280	All right.
3632280	3633280	Did you at least get to see last week's?
3633280	3634280	No, I didn't.
3634280	3635280	Oh, you're behind on the whole season.
3635280	3636280	Yes.
3636280	3637280	But think of it.
3637280	3639000	You'll get to have a whole marathon day.
3639000	3642920	Oh, I can see anger rising here in the Orange Lawns radio room.
3642920	3645280	Good job, Zappi, getting us all mad.
3645280	3646400	No, I'm just kidding.
3646400	3647880	What games have you been playing this week, Zappi?
3647880	3652240	Not since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.
3652240	3653240	You broke your PSP?
3653240	3654240	Yeah.
3654240	3655640	How'd you do that?
3655640	3658040	I dropped my laptop on the screen.
3658040	3659040	Ouch.
3659040	3663040	So, what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?
3663040	3665800	I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.
3665800	3668000	Oh, that's great.
3668000	3672120	What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?
3672120	3674680	Call of Duty and Ratchet and Clank.
3674680	3677960	A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.
3677960	3680880	I actually like it.
3680880	3686920	What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?
3686920	3690520	There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.
3690520	3691520	There's a...
3691520	3692520	Let's name that stealth game.
3692520	3695800	It completely slipped my mind.
3695800	3698720	Not Metal Gear Solid, but...
3698720	3699720	Subsistence?
3699720	3700720	No.
3700720	3701720	Oh, wait.
3701720	3702720	No, duh.
3702720	3703720	Is that what?
3703720	3704720	Acid?
3704720	3706680	What was the other Metal Gear one?
3706680	3707680	It's not Metal Gear.
3707680	3714160	It's the number one that's on the PlayStation platform.
3714160	3716600	It starts with an S. A Cyclone Filter.
3716600	3718720	Oh, okay.
3718720	3720120	That's a pretty good one.
3720120	3721120	Cool.
3721120	3722920	Also, there's Daxter.
3722920	3723920	That's good.
3723920	3724920	All right.
3724920	3725920	There's some good...
3725920	3726920	Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?
3726920	3727920	Uh, no.
3727920	3728920	I'm not really...
3728920	3730360	Rondo of Blood!
3730360	3733600	Two people in chat room did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game,
3733600	3734600	so there you go.
3734600	3737200	And why is he giving us the mandatory Rondo of Blood?
3737200	3738200	So there you go.
3738200	3739200	All right.
3739200	3743160	Well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, Dark
3743160	3744160	Sakura.
3744160	3745160	I do my best.
3745160	3746160	All right.
3746160	3747160	Take care, buddy.
3747160	3748160	All right.
3748160	3749160	Bye-bye.
3749160	3753480	See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.
3753480	3754480	He should do that for you.
3754480	3758440	Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.
3758440	3763960	It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on...
3763960	3767320	I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he
3767320	3772060	had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding
3772060	3773600	his laptop.
3773600	3780160	And so since then, I've actually had a problem with the Divix stuff, so...
3780160	3781160	All right.
3781160	3782160	One more call.
3782160	3783160	Hi.
3783160	3784160	You're on Orange Lawn.
3784160	3785160	I'll show you.
3785160	3786160	Who's this?
3786160	3787160	This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.
3787160	3788160	Hey!
3788160	3789160	DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.
3789160	3791160	What's on your mind, buddy?
3791160	3792160	Nothing much, man.
3792160	3794160	This is my first time calling.
3794160	3798400	I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have
3798400	3799400	time.
3799400	3804680	I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show,
3804680	3805680	so...
3805680	3806680	Wow.
3806680	3807680	Congratulations.
3807680	3808680	Jeez.
3808680	3809680	You've been listening for three years, and you've never gotten on the show.
3809680	3811120	Well, there you go.
3811120	3812120	What the hell?
3812120	3813120	Our line doesn't get hammered that much.
3813120	3814120	Well, that's all right.
3814120	3815920	Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.
3815920	3817600	What did you want to talk to us about tonight?
3817600	3821160	Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo...
3821160	3825520	How Nintendo's delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.
3825520	3826840	Of course, yeah.
3826840	3831800	Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't
3831800	3836720	blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues,
3836720	3841360	because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on,
3841360	3846160	whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony, regarding to all these
3846160	3847160	delays.
3847160	3848160	That's IBM.
3848160	3855400	I'm not sure if you guys know this, but IBM is really the main supplier for the chipsets
3855400	3859920	for all three of the next-gen systems, and because of their chips that is all based on
3859920	3864360	the PowerPC model, in effect, they're all kind of borrowing from one another, and all
3864360	3870760	the chipsets are all coming from out of the same factory, and so in a way, any of the
3870760	3874920	shipment problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't
3874920	3881600	get out enough chips, and it happened before with, but I'm not sure if you know that
3881600	3884680	Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.
3884680	3889240	That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips, and Apple was like, well,
3889240	3890240	fuck you guys.
3890240	3894720	You can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel, and now you kind of see
3894720	3897680	the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.
3897680	3901400	You know, that's an interesting point, because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game
3901400	3904920	companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components
3904920	3909960	that go into the system, and for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360
3909960	3913080	delays previously, was that there was like a component?
3913080	3916280	I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip, but I noticed one of these systems got
3916280	3919920	so slowed down, because the factory couldn't produce enough of it, unless it was 360 last
3919920	3920920	year.
3920920	3924920	It was the PlayStation 3, and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really IBM's fault
3924920	3925920	either.
3925920	3929080	It's the fact that Nintendo's retarded, and it only has one factory building these
3929080	3934080	fucking systems, instead of like four factories, or even more building systems.
3934080	3938120	That's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that
3938120	3941600	right now, despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM.
3941600	3945840	It's because they're retarded still, and they only have one factory producing them, despite
3945840	3950760	the fact that most of the components in it were stuff that was in the GameCube, and that
3950760	3954200	they should have tons of, and should be really easy to manufacture.
3954200	3955200	Yeah, but one-
3955200	3956200	That's a good point.
3956200	3957200	Yeah, that's a good point.
3957200	3962320	I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as getting enough factories out
3962320	3967920	there to make these damn systems, but I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look
3967920	3973640	at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles,
3973640	3976240	you kind of have to look at it this way.
3976240	3981880	IBM only has one factory, too, so in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at
3981880	3982880	in this situation?
3982880	3989360	All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the whole overall picture.
3989360	3990600	There's no winners.
3990600	3997680	The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wiis, because
3997680	4002960	Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360, so they're just
4002960	4008200	going to pretty much switch from making 360s into Wiis, because it's all third-party factories
4008200	4009200	anyways.
4009200	4011800	So that's the rumor, at least.
4011800	4015840	Hopefully that's actually the case, and they're not actually just sandbagging all this stuff
4015840	4016840	until Christmas.
4016840	4020120	Well, we could only hope, man.
4020120	4022080	You know what, though?
4022080	4024600	Do you have your Wii, DJ Kibbles and Bitch?
4024600	4025600	Yeah.
4025600	4028560	Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.
4028560	4029560	Exactly.
4029560	4030560	You know what?
4030560	4032880	That's my thoughts now, is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get
4032880	4033880	the system.
4033880	4034880	You know what?
4034880	4037360	Who cares if there are shortages?
4037360	4040360	It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there
4040360	4041360	and wait.
4041360	4042360	But you know what?
4042360	4043360	I agree.
4043360	4045000	You know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with
4045000	4048480	this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June, well, it sucks to be you
4048480	4052680	if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get a console, you know, you don't get
4052680	4055000	the free internet browser or whatever, you know?
4055000	4056320	It would suck.
4056320	4060880	Yeah, you know, I mean, at the same time, though, when you are an early adopter, you
4060880	4065000	do kind of get fucked over later on in the case of, like, the 360 Elite bullshit that's
4065000	4066000	going down.
4066000	4067000	True.
4067000	4068000	Or the Red Rings of Death.
4068000	4072600	We did get to play our systems a year in advance, but, you know, look at the other end of things
4072600	4073600	too.
4073600	4075360	So, whatever, it's a catch-22 at the end of the day.
4075360	4079240	Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space
4079240	4080240	on my 360.
4080240	4081840	Until they sell porn.
4081840	4083440	Good point.
4083440	4087760	Oh, God, please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.
4087760	4088760	HD porn!
4088760	4092080	Oh, my God, sales of 360 would go through the roof, seriously, they would whoop the
4092080	4093080	Wii's ass.
4093080	4099200	I mean, I think about, you know, dads across America going to buy a system for their children.
4099200	4102520	Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have
4102520	4106840	fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high death!
4106840	4107840	Porn wins, always.
4107840	4112360	Well, Viance, PlayZ3 makes that the easiest, since you can put, like, video files on there
4112360	4113640	pretty simple.
4113640	4116440	Baby formula, or wow epic mount?
4116440	4120000	Baby formula, wow epic mount, I just can't choose.
4120000	4124560	DJ Kibbles N Bits, really good first call, really good point.
4124560	4126400	Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?
4126400	4128920	Oh, no, that's it, man, that's it.
4128920	4129920	It's a pleasure, it's a pleasure.
4129920	4133120	Well, no problem, thanks so much for calling, any time, call back.
4133120	4135520	All right, take care, guys.
4135520	4136520	Later!
4136520	4139760	All right, well, that was a good Skype line tonight, lots of people we got to hear from
4139760	4149840	there, and of course our chat room going along there, let's see, I think they're talking
4149840	4151600	about Doctor Who now.
4151600	4153480	Dark Sakura, is there a Doctor Who debate?
4153480	4154480	Ignoring.
4154480	4155480	Ignoring?
4155480	4156480	I see.
4156480	4158480	I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but...
4158480	4159480	Exterminate!
4159480	4164120	Legend of Zaku says, remember this lesson in life, when trying to get a Wii, there will
4164120	4168600	always be at least 10 diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store
4168600	4170600	that sells it.
4170600	4173200	eBay profiteers.
4173200	4174960	Have a special place in hell waiting for them.
4174960	4178400	All right, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?
4178400	4180600	Yes, but Loki can go first.
4180600	4181600	All right.
4181600	4182600	Okay.
4182600	4184800	Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.
4184800	4189320	One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have
4189320	4190600	voice chat.
4190600	4191600	Not true.
4191600	4193960	Let's see here.
4193960	4203160	Dark Alex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.
4203160	4204160	So that's pretty awesome.
4204160	4207120	Get the run homebrew and the latest games.
4207120	4214320	There's a rumor that Dragon Ball Online, Xbox 360 edition is coming, and I don't know, I
4214320	4221680	guess they're basing that off of a posting for job opening on Game Job, and I don't know,
4221680	4224400	that's kind of interesting I guess.
4224400	4231000	Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller, looks like a 360 controller, don't care.
4231000	4235200	Virtual consoles for Monday, apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's
4235200	4236880	Revenge.
4236880	4239320	So that would be kind of neat for the US.
4239320	4240320	Where's my Actraiser?
4240320	4243520	Well it doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.
4243520	4247960	There's a new game coming to the Playstation Network that looks exactly like, I cannot
4247960	4256480	remember the damn name, it's on the 360, whatever, what do you think?
4256480	4257480	What that game is?
4257480	4262080	Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.
4262080	4263080	I don't know.
4263080	4266440	No, it looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.
4266440	4267440	Boom Boom Rocket?
4267440	4268440	It's not Boom Boom Rocket.
4268440	4269440	Geometry Wars?
4269440	4270440	I don't know.
4270440	4271440	No, not Geometry Wars, the other one.
4271440	4273000	Like, Mutant Storm Reloaded, that's what it was.
4273000	4274000	Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?
4274000	4276600	Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.
4276600	4283440	For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source, for the Half-Life engine, who
4283440	4291800	cares, and, oh, this is stupid, Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.
4291800	4292800	Makes me want to paint.
4292800	4294320	Was it spray painted red?
4294320	4298120	Yes, it was, more or less.
4298120	4299120	People are retarded.
4299120	4304680	And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox
4304680	4308160	Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the Playstation.
4308160	4311360	So I hope that is true.
4311360	4313120	Alright.
4313120	4324640	Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend, Brad, from
4324640	4325640	PodCulture.
4325640	4327280	Yay, Brad.
4327280	4330840	This is, it's not really news, but it's something that's really cool.
4330840	4336880	It's from Tech Blog, sorry, I should say Tech e-blog, I should say.
4336880	4340800	The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.
4340800	4347960	Number ten is the Cliccovision Portable, the NES station, which is basically a Nintendo
4347960	4353160	don't have to look like a PS2, just a mod.
4353160	4363560	There's the N-Pod, which is a, it runs NES games, it's interesting, it actually looks
4363560	4365440	kind of cool, I want one.
4365440	4370720	There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a nomad,
4370720	4373960	and then attached a CD player to it.
4373960	4382360	The GameCube ToGo, which, yeah, whatever, that one's kind of bizarre, but neat at the
4382360	4383360	same time.
4383360	4389360	The NES Plus Sega, that's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.
4389360	4393000	The handheld Atari Jaguar, next!
4393000	4395660	Only good game on that was Tempest.
4395660	4399120	Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, yeah, whatever.
4399120	4404200	Dreamcast Portable, that's kind of cool, and PlayStation 2 Portable.
4404200	4410080	I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.
4410080	4413080	He brought it over, it worked, it was pretty cool, I think that this is cool, I still want
4413080	4414080	a game axe.
4414080	4415080	A what?
4415080	4416080	A game axe.
4416080	4417080	What the hell is that?
4417080	4419140	Let me find a picture of it.
4419140	4422160	It's another handheld, chopped up system.
4422160	4423160	But there's no time!
4423160	4424160	That was it!
4424160	4425160	We're out of stories!
4425160	4426160	We're out of steam!
4426160	4428160	We're out of time!
4428160	4431240	So that's it, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
4431240	4432240	Was that your last story?
4432240	4433240	I'm sorry.
4433240	4440040	Okay, I'm trying to pull up the thing, it's a portable NES player.
4440040	4441720	End game gear.
4441720	4442720	And stuff.
4442720	4443720	Anyway.
4443720	4444720	Rob!
4444720	4445720	Rob.
4445720	4448720	Let's go around and get everyone's...
4448720	4449720	Rob.
4449720	4450720	What?
4450720	4451720	Rob.
4451720	4452720	I will kill you.
4452720	4455080	Can I have a cheeseburger, please?
4455080	4457560	That's it, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4457560	4459360	Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.
4459360	4460360	What's that?
4460360	4461360	Tuesday.
4461360	4462360	Yeah?
4462360	4463360	I have class.
4463360	4464440	No pump on the volume.
4464440	4467680	There may not be guys on a show Wednesday, because of my trips, so it's going to be a
4467680	4470840	very quiet week on Orange Laundrio, but at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan
4470840	4471840	live this week.
4471840	4475160	And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.
4475160	4476160	Interesting.
4476160	4477160	Yeah.
4477160	4478160	Alright.
4478160	4481920	Also, next week's show should be very interesting, because Dark Soccer and I will be at Disneyland
4481920	4488360	Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or not Sunday, we're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving
4488360	4489360	Thursday.
4489360	4490360	On Sunday.
4490360	4491360	Yeah, anyway.
4491360	4492360	Too confusing.
4492360	4495000	So we'll be pulling into town just when the show's about to start, so next week could
4495000	4499320	very well be the Loki show, with hilarious commentary from Dark Soccer and Sky, so won't
4499320	4500320	that be fun, Loki?
4500320	4501320	Yeah.
4501320	4502320	Still think Loki should come with us.
4502320	4503320	I know.
4503320	4504320	I wish Loki would come with us.
4504320	4505320	Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?
4505320	4506320	No.
4506320	4507320	You make me sad.
4507320	4509320	Don't you want to ride a, you know, Rockin' California Screamin'?
4509320	4510320	No.
4510320	4511320	Alright.
4511320	4512320	I know.
4512320	4513320	He's so boring.
4513320	4515040	He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.
4515040	4516040	Guess I can't say I blame him.
4516040	4517040	Play games.
4517040	4518040	Alright.
4518040	4520640	Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.
4520640	4522640	Loki, your final thought.
4522640	4527480	Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force
4527480	4530880	2 on Blade Season 2.
4530880	4532120	Dark Soccer, your final thought.
4532120	4537120	I have the best wallpaper ever, and I just posted links to it in the chatroom.
4537120	4541160	My final thought is penguins.
4541160	4544800	And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.
4544800	4545800	You're a dick.
4545800	4546800	That's it.
4546800	4549640	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
