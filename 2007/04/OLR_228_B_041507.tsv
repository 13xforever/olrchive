487	5569	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5889	14752	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15452	19133	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19853	22014	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15, 2007.
22094	22974	Happy Tax Day to you.
24997	27759	And if you're thinking, gosh, my taxes were long due.
27859	30381	I'm actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.
30682	34505	That's because you've downloaded probably our audio archive, also known as podcasting.
34725	38648	Well, Lauren's Launch Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in two parts.
39489	46575	Or if you want to hear it, you know, even before it's on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.
47155	52660	Monday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6 o'clock.
52680	53721	So just kind of be listening around 5.30.
54366	56267	Pacific Standard Time, or 9 a.m.
56367	57587	on Tuesdays, Pacific Time.
57607	61848	You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.
62248	64749	All right, let's get into some gaming news to talk about.
64849	65930	So, let's start it off.
67150	69151	We need our Death March to play, Rob.
70291	70351	Why?
70371	71011	We need it playing.
71431	74552	That's all I got.
74612	77333	Although, for a moment, I thought you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars.
77353	77933	That was kind of cool.
78453	82415	Anyway... Unfortunately, I only have the one... No, I don't even have that.
83095	83355	I have...
84301	86362	Death to PlayStation 3.
86482	87763	The 20 gigabyte model is kaput.
87863	93906	It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so saith Sony.
111021	121366	Basically, the consumer market said, we like the 60 gigabyte one because the 20 gig one just completely blows my ass.
122467	127090	So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20.
128771	135494	However, I don't know if that's going to make it all this special thing.
135554	138156	So, it lasted six months.
139231	140612	Loki, you own one of these, right?
140812	141172	Yes, I do.
141592	148016	And it's just as good as the fucking 60 gig because there's nothing on their download store to actually put on there.
148696	152258	And it's not very easy to get videos on there.
152458	157181	And do I really need wireless internet when it's sitting less than two feet away from a router?
157241	157741	Probably not.
158482	158882	It has a 60.
160603	165045	Well, Loki has like a collector's item now because, you know, those 20 gigs are going to be super rare now.
165125	168227	And do I need the fucking silver, you know, the silver, like,
170149	172110	Molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there.
172130	173950	A little pinstripe, whatever.
174450	176011	Now that's the rare one now.
176791	178311	I'm fucking awesome, yeah.
178951	183753	Suck that, folks.
184613	188934	It's more like they're admitting that the 20 gig is no longer available.
189074	191435	It hasn't been available for months now.
192455	197756	This was something that happened I want to say around January.
197776	199857	Well, since you all found out you can't order one
204188	206549	It's nice that they're finally copping to that stuff.
206809	210371	Anyways, so some other fun stuff.
211871	212532	Let's see here.
213452	223817	Sony is trying to get in on the wireless kind of handheld input devices, very similar to the Wii now.
224237	228999	And not exactly copying the Wii, but it's a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.
229568	235630	They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a power glove.
236350	243852	And it's supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I don't know, games and stuff.
244212	246913	Virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.
247653	247994	I don't know.
248014	249094	I think it looks kind of cool.
250054	253895	And I don't really give a crap if it's a rip-off of Nintendo or whatever.
255036	257336	At this point, who cares?
257516	258457	Just make it...
259625	263187	Long as it doesn't suck like the eye toy did, I'm all for it.
264768	266289	So it's a glove?
266629	268150	Yeah, it's like a little... So like the power glove?
268210	269951	It's not really like the power glove.
270091	277556	It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for your thumb.
277596	284900	And in the middle, there's like... I don't know if it's something that'll cause it to tighten up or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of...
285506	287047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
313447	314608	That thing was awesome.
314688	321913	Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.
322353	325215	So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.
325355	326996	Well, here's what it's also going to allow you to do.
327036	339685	It says they're going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending figures.
339925	342867	So you can flip off the thing and it will know that.
343308	347732	I think it'd be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people at home and stuff.
348653	353177	Means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah blah blah.
354499	355720	Tactile feedback.
356501	359443	And means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.
359904	362386	So yeah, it's basically going to be like VR gloves.
364068	364288	Hooray.
364929	366190	I have one thing to say about that.
367611	367811	What?
367991	368512	It's so bad.
370057	379123	Anyhow, I don't know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog Three Speech from Sony has talked about some upcoming PlayStation 3 games.
379163	381244	Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.
382785	395333	Quote, that's when we'll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air, foot, and vehicle combat game Warhawk, which is still looking likely to be released over the PlayStation Network rather than the shops.
395893	399035	First-person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September.
399366	400327	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
424412	429756	and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list that has a confirmed US date is Lair.
430117	431358	That's set for July.
432018	437603	So the Three Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europe's perspective, but not necessarily ours.
437803	440925	Lair, I know that's been talked about as a July title.
440945	441766	Same with Warhawk.
441806	443407	Warhawk's been a July title for a while.
443727	450853	But then again, it's kind of morphed into really different things than before, so who knows when that's coming out.
451896	458219	I hope they don't wait that long, because they don't have any exclusives between now and September, if that's the case.
458579	469204	Well, it should also be noted that 3 Speech said something about Bioshock on the PlayStation 3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, there is currently no indication that Bioshock will come out on the PlayStation 3.
469625	470945	Oops, we're talking out of our ass.
473747	478249	Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a... What was the quote from...
479506	480887	Clerks and Oral Bowel Movement.
481147	482107	I really don't know.
482867	484048	Well, I have some good news.
484708	485609	At least this is good for me.
487249	491271	They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.
492151	496613	I think that's great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.
497133	498814	The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007.
498934	503716	And there actually is a notice saying that the...
507464	511126	Sony Europe site's supposed to already be up.
511987	524755	So I'm going to personally think of it as rumor, because it didn't really do all that great in Japan on PSP, but if it's coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.
525955	527416	The game is just fucked up.
529678	532059	Of course they're going to jump on an opportunity to actually
533171	533812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
555580	556421	It's coming out anyways.
556661	559503	So, starting off on PlayStation 2.
559703	561864	Raiden 3 is finally making its way out.
562165	564366	And that's, of course, the arcade shooter game.
565007	567348	Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2.
567889	569530	I know the first one really blew.
569930	572032	Hopefully this one's not so bad.
572892	574774	PC port of the plan.
575194	577455	And that's coming to PlayStation 2 as well.
579577	580397	It didn't look very good.
580958	582439	Eureka 7 Vol.
582459	583159	2, the new wave.
583179	585361	I believe that's the new wave.
585731	589773	Anyways, Eureka 7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks okay.
590553	597456	Red Star, that old acclaimed game that's been in development forever, and now it's finally making its way out on PlayStation 2.
598757	603599	On the PSP, we have Halo Knights, finally making its way out.
604599	610081	As well as Pocket Pool, that semi-porn billiards game.
610181	612883	And let's see here.
614329	617691	Nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.
618131	619251	Nothing on PlayStation 3.
620952	625594	And let's see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics.
627215	632457	And let's see here, Mission Blackhawk and Mission Combat Force.
633638	636259	And a game called Made Man, which got horrible reviews.
636839	641021	Finally, on the Wii, we've got Bust a Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game.
641874	645437	Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario
667591	668632	FateStayNight
692281	693102	Rialta Nua
716857	719638	Coco Host Boo is coming out in Japan.
719838	725640	That's an anime, Iran High School Club something.
725700	728361	Little Roses and little girly men.
728421	731502	Yeah, it's a really fucked up little anime.
731702	736584	Alright, well, if you want the little fucked up game that goes with it, it's coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week.
737644	741246	Also on the Nintendo DS, let's see, what are you getting over there?
741586	744487	Gouken Alice, Waku Waku Happy Friends.
745216	746236	Wifi Tau, Senkai No Dare Demo PSP
773001	774062	Final Fantasy 5 Advance for GBA Good game.
794466	796267	God of War 2 on PlayStation 2.
797028	799750	We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP.
799890	800730	The Red Star.
801111	803532	You know, I'm actually, I'm really thinking I'm going to get that game.
804333	807215	After playing it at E3 a while back, I thought it was pretty fun.
808035	809736	Capcom Puzzle World on PSP.
809836	810897	Cube on PSP.
811337	812678	Diddy Kong Racing DS.
813539	815140	Free Running on PSP.
815360	817682	Hard Rock Casino PlayStation 2 on PSP.
818282	821564	SOCOM US Navy SEALS Fireteam Bravo 2 PSP.
822085	823946	And Tony Hawk's Project 8 on PSP.
827819	828139	Sweet.
828740	828900	Yep.
830261	832862	Anyways, back into the news here.
834503	838386	Of course, we've got some interesting stuff, I know, coming out.
838466	853275	And, of course, one thing that's been confirmed to be coming out, and I'm sure this is not a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octane's site, there was a response to, I believe, an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3.
854235	854696	And it says...
856467	885193	Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 3 is headed for the Playstation 2 Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii and it's supposed to be coming out fall 2007 so there you go, yet another release and interesting and according to apparently there was it's been removed from the website as well because we didn't realize that there's another Guitar Hero game coming out this year
886418	890280	After all, there are some... Was it the 80s edition coming out later this year?
890761	892662	Who knows what else they'll throw in there.
894503	895363	Not a big surprise.
896064	900886	It's funny we haven't heard much on Guitar Hero 80s edition besides that little tidbit you found a couple weeks ago.
901327	901707	It's weird.
902767	904148	You don't think we would have heard more about it by now?
905729	905969	No.
906109	907070	You think they might push it back?
907690	907970	Yeah.
908351	909891	I already know that.
909951	910672	Oh, okay.
912313	912693	Alright then.
913824	914765	Let's see, moving on.
915926	918909	If you're a fan of music games, then you probably like Owen Don as well.
919430	921211	So we know he hears Elite Beat Agents.
921712	922292	And Owen Don 2.
923095	929456	is coming out in Japan on May 17th, is what the Rumblings are saying, is that the game's coming out quite possibly that soon.
930336	933357	Some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet.
934097	950500	Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life, Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia, Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube, the artist is Hiraiken Popstar.
950942	953224	It's, um, one of the cheesiest songs I've ever heard in my life.
953544	958548	So, but it'll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they know it in Japan, Oh and Don.
959009	961951	So, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward to that one.
964033	969277	I actually think that, uh, I might definitely pick that one up, except I haven't, you know, picked up the other one either.
969437	969998	But anyway.
970878	973140	Now this makes me, um, also particularly happy.
974221	974681	Excuse me.
974982	976663	Sorry, allergies.
977203	980406	Anyway, um, there is, um, uh,
982123	986647	Talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper.
987787	991770	Well, not second, because there's already a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2.
994493	1002559	Nanon Shah has been quoted saying, we're also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all the family.
1003399	1004500	And they said, yeah, that one.
1004900	1006982	So they're apparently talking about Parappa.
1011996	1012676	I like Parappa.
1042038	1043699	Am I the only one that's not excited about this?
1043759	1044861	I think this is kind of retarded.
1044941	1045641	I'm not excited.
1056414	1061517	Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like, throw baby a mile or something like that.
1061537	1063198	Genetic oddities, those are great.
1063618	1070522	That is something, that's a record, you know, but somebody that's like, I have the high score DDR, and you know that's gonna be in there.
1070542	1071783	Isn't that what leaderboards are for?
1071943	1074344	I thought this is what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.
1074364	1076846	Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one, though.
1077846	1081208	So, I don't know, it's kind of lame.
1082276	1084318	Eternal Sonata Eternal Sonata is what they're calling it over here
1110796	1111456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1136209	1136589	That's great.
1136609	1137210	Way to go.
1137630	1138911	Yeah, with an RPG.
1139331	1141513	I'm just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.
1141533	1142293	Leave the system on.
1142854	1143454	That's awesome.
1143474	1144234	I didn't even catch that.
1144254	1147056	There's no, oh my god, no hard drive and no memory card.
1147537	1148037	Brilliant.
1150038	1150539	Good job.
1151700	1153121	That's lovely.
1153601	1160466	Well, what else is brilliant is DarkSakura surfing the internet all week long at work, actually.
1160546	1161106	That's all she does.
1161705	1165326	No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them with you.
1165686	1168747	And it's a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
1172628	1177069	And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?
1177189	1184151	The Website of the Week is IkenHouseCheeseburger.com, which is like a Saturday site.
1185051	1185971	I just, I love it.
1186211	1189032	I visited the site, I didn't get it.
1189052	1189812	I thought it was cute.
1190783	1196185	It's I can has cheese and cheeseburgers spelled C-H-E-E-Z-B-U-R-G-E-R.
1196545	1197886	I can has cheeseburger.com.
1198546	1205248	The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over a kitten with the caption, Do not want.
1205268	1211010	There's also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua wearing a Dolphy wig.
1211030	1212811	It says, I love scotch.
1213251	1215232	Here it goes down, down into my bellies.
1216935	1219357	I was just like, hooray, another cat sight from Jamie.
1220017	1221018	No, there's dogs on here, too.
1221038	1225080	But I love Catterday, so... There's a little puppy making us sad faces.
1225801	1226962	Ate all the cheeseburger.
1227142	1227702	Frowning face.
1228863	1230684	DarkTetsuya is posting his favorite.
1231625	1235507	DarkTetsuya is posting from I Can Ask Cheeseburger, the entry on April 13th.
1235868	1237128	Princess in another castle.
1237168	1237509	Sorry.
1238049	1239090	I guess the cat's worried.
1239110	1243653	There's one of the cat with a Wiimote in his lap saying, I can please has walkthrough.
1244733	1245674	So, they don't.
1247415	1256070	iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com Alright, check it out, boys and girls.
1256971	1258714	The official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.
1259095	1259516	Okay.
1260440	1261480	Some interesting stuff.
1261540	1266582	If you're looking to try some games out, there's been some demos that have come out on live recently.
1267762	1273544	Some that you might not be excited about, some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out.
1273804	1274144	Hooray.
1274825	1289129	One that actually looked kind of interesting and I haven't gotten to play it yet, Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live, and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command & Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that'll be pretty awesome as well.
1291297	1291857	Look for it.
1292677	1300280	Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed.
1300660	1307282	Sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince of Persia Classic.
1308022	1310803	For the record, it got a 12 plus years age rating.
1311644	1315585	But that would be, you know, since there's new Prince of Persia, isn't there a new game coming out somewhat soon?
1316249	1317110	and Not Too Distant Future.
1317130	1320712	Yeah, they're supposed to be doing one for like the 360 or something.
1320772	1326616	So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.
1326896	1337924	By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie we've earlier spoken about on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.
1339225	1344789	So as long as he doesn't screw up Transformers, I suppose we'll be looking forward to Prince of Persia.
1345182	1350845	But if he does screw up Transformers, Brimstone and Fire will rain down upon him.
1352706	1352946	Yes.
1353787	1357188	Fire and Brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.
1358789	1363932	Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire, and this isn't, though, about a dragon.
1364712	1367934	Anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.
1368694	1370115	GameTap can do Saturn games.
1370836	1371496	Isn't that great?
1372577	1378461	But it's actually, also, in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoon's Vi heading out.
1379161	1383424	Now, I'm sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.
1385165	1392090	Or as it was called, God, why can't I, because Panzer Dragoon Orto was the Dreamcast one.
1392150	1393571	It's a start, Jamie, Jesus.
1394411	1399494	I know, but Panzer Dragoon RPG was just, like, fucking beautiful.
1399815	1401015	You know, I have that game on Saturn.
1401135	1401956	Here, have a cheeseburger.
1402935	1403556	I have that game.
1404336	1405257	You have a cheeseburger game?
1405297	1405518	No.
1405998	1406559	Bite my butt.
1407039	1409241	I have a... I actually do have BurgerTime.
1409261	1410422	Does that count?
1410442	1411423	Dude, BurgerTime's awesome.
1411583	1412684	They have BurgerTime on GameTap.
1412704	1413145	That's all you need.
1413185	1418510	The Panzer Dragoon RPG is just like... And, and, and, and, and... Super BurgerTime on GameTap.
1419351	1419611	I know.
1419631	1424976	I didn't even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once, and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?
1425016	1425437	What is this?
1425457	1426398	We have Sega Love now.
1426418	1427158	What is this?
1427178	1427539	Sega...
1429048	1431670	Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.
1431710	1434371	Good, they can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.
1435792	1436793	Alright, so be it.
1437953	1441035	You don't want to talk about that.
1441075	1441856	Do not want!
1442676	1443236	Exactly.
1444157	1446798	You might want, though, Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta.
1446878	1449700	It's coming out now, May 16th.
1450701	1455924	And it will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.
1456304	1458245	To which the entire internet responded,
1458812	1459132	3 WEEKS!
1459292	1459653	WEEE!
1477278	1478359	and let's see what else.
1478820	1487467	New guns, vehicles, gameplay features including the mysterious X button which by the way has been spoiled and it's just an equipment button.
1487907	1493232	So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.
1494412	1495613	Who fucking cares?
1496074	1496514	Whatever.
1496694	1504561	Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda yadda yadda.
1508535	1510576	So, bye Crackdown, if you haven't yet
1536533	1537093	TripMinds.
1538514	1539115	It's going to be interesting.
1539135	1540596	It's going to add a whole new element to the game.
1540916	1545499	But they swear it will not be something that's exploitable.
1546040	1547501	It's something that's going to be limited.
1548041	1549022	All that functionality.
1549182	1549982	So we'll see.
1551403	1555847	Lord knows I could use a shield when I'm playing Halo because I get shot in the face all the time when I'm playing Halo.
1555887	1556387	I don't like it.
1557408	1558468	Shot in the face is fun.
1559269	1559609	Not really.
1559649	1560230	Not if it's you.
1560570	1561150	It's getting shot.
1561170	1562351	I don't get shot in the face.
1563132	1563312	But...
1566577	1572719	Pac-Man vs. is going to the Nintendo DS by way of the Namco Museum.
1572999	1573580	Isn't that cool?
1574440	1588506	For anyone who doesn't know, Pac-Man vs. was where you played on your portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man.
1590174	1592316	while you had your Pac-Man controller playing on the main screen.
1592336	1593216	I thought it was the other way around.
1593256	1600581	I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and the one person had Pac-Man on the Game Boy Advance.
1602903	1603583	I never played it.
1604244	1605745	The ghosts were split on the screen, that's right.
1606345	1607386	It was Pac-Man that was on the Game Boy.
1608767	1609527	You know what I meant.
1609607	1610988	Pac-Man could see everything going on.
1612689	1615892	But I thought it was funny because it was actually really loud when people would play it at my house.
1617353	1617813	Was it fun?
1617833	1618794	Yeah, it's fun.
1618834	1619234	It's pretty fun.
1619981	1623504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1650035	1652976	Do you get to play Wi-Fi over the internet?
1652996	1657297	That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man versus on Wi-Fi.
1657657	1658077	Probably not.
1659677	1660097	All right.
1660157	1663838	Well, we're starting to get late into the show, and we still have not done this segment.
1663938	1664418	And I don't know.
1664478	1669219	For some reason, putting this segment after a story about the Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate.
1669259	1671640	So it's time to bring on the pain in our FUs of the week.
1682543	1685144	DarkSakura, what's your bitch this week?
1686224	1688245	Um, I have a rash.
1689605	1690005	That's it.
1691206	1691666	That's it?
1691846	1692686	F you to your rash?
1692926	1693947	F you to my rash.
1694167	1694967	Where is your rash?
1695027	1696127	Is it in a private place?
1696607	1697868	Or is it in a place where I can see it?
1701269	1702449	No questions asked.
1702549	1705810	It's on my back.
1705830	1706630	Ah, on her back.
1706710	1707371	Okay, well that works.
1708071	1711752	But, um, it's obviously an allergic reaction or something.
1712213	1715916	because whenever I have a rash that's an allergic reaction, it gets bloody.
1717357	1717557	Ew.
1717577	1720800	So yeah, I'm going to the dermatologist hopefully next week.
1720840	1721680	That'll be fun.
1722901	1723242	Loki!
1724683	1727585	Uh... God, I had an FU earlier.
1727605	1730687	I don't know.
1730707	1732188	Got nothing that really fits off that.
1732449	1732949	I'm hungry.
1733710	1734710	FU to hunger?
1736051	1736812	FU to world hunger?
1737513	1738313	No, it's my hunger.
1738894	1738994	Uh...
1740100	1744183	I'm going to say I also F you to the fact that I ate all that Pocky.
1744203	1745443	That's going to make me fat.
1746744	1749326	F you to the freaking aquarium.
1749646	1753628	If you listen to the bonus segment live tonight or on all games, it doesn't go to the podcast.
1753648	1755470	You're going to be talking about my aquarium I bought.
1755750	1757031	And it killed one of my fish.
1757551	1761813	So F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.
1762574	1763495	Bastard filter.
1764955	1765796	Bastard aquarium.
1766539	1770700	Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart said it would work.
1770820	1771880	So F you to PetSmart.
1773361	1773701	That's it.
1774701	1776022	Those were nice short FUs this week.
1776362	1776602	Yes.
1776822	1777902	Good times.
1777922	1781403	We will open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.
1781903	1787145	Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking around about.
1787725	1791686	I don't even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is...
1792335	1794696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1815549	1818070	Help comes in the form of makeup.
1818090	1821652	In-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.
1821692	1825293	The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.
1825533	1830696	There are many games in which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.
1831076	1837099	A Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so the items can be exchanged with friends and players and so you can do each other's makeup.
1839340	1842281	I want this game because it sounds so stupid.
1844574	1845735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1874691	1876232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1903516	1904997	I'll get you a miniature koi.
1905417	1905837	Ah, we'll see.
1932867	1933847	Let's get Rob a piranha.
1933867	1935548	That'd be cool.
1937749	1938310	Let's see.
1939590	1943892	TheRobD says, of course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.
1944312	1945313	Talking about the makeup game.
1946073	1948174	GamingNerd says, this sounds like a Sky game.
1948334	1948594	LOL.
1948634	1948835	What?
1948855	1949615	Because I'm gay?
1949775	1951676	Dude, I don't do makeup and stuff.
1952136	1953917	That's gay.
1953997	1955538	Rocky's different.
1955558	1956398	That's theater.
1956938	1958319	I don't even really do makeup at Rocky.
1960202	1960662	Let's see.
1961903	1966224	Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, Makeup games sell more copies than even GTA.
1966965	1969005	Oh my god, video games are no longer violent.
1970246	1970666	Interesting.
1971166	1971786	Hi, we can hear you.
1975668	1976048	Let's see.
1978949	1982730	Bandit in chat says, As long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all win.
1982791	1983171	There we go.
1983571	1984511	And Zach liked fatties.
1986472	1986592	Sigh.
1987617	1988517	I like to smoke them.
1988797	1990758	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
1990798	1994318	If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.
1994338	1994979	We have extra time.
1994999	1996179	We should have done a game tonight.
1996779	1997899	I don't have anything prepped, though.
1998379	1998619	Oh, well.
1999439	2002240	We'll take extra calls, I guess, if there's folks that actually want to call us.
2003040	2010402	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.
2010462	2011362	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2016892	2018832	Good evening, this is DMN Yes
2045109	2052872	I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiis.
2053772	2055873	So they're purposefully holding back, you think?
2057533	2057874	I do.
2059554	2064196	The big talk around wherever I am is, where's the Wiis?
2064436	2065256	Where's the Wiis?
2065816	2070578	Nintendo's trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get them even more.
2072839	2073479	And if that
2074965	2079529	I think it's stupid.
2081451	2088999	They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win that console war, they need to sell more systems.
2089360	2094445	Especially financially, they need to sell two systems for every one of Sony's PS3s.
2095973	2099534	and they need to sell three systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.
2099854	2106115	Yeah, but that's not necessarily true because they're making a profit off each system whereas everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.
2107216	2107796	That is true.
2110676	2112537	Owned by Loki.
2114797	2125440	And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title, I'm surprised Nintendo, you know, has released this game and, you know, the Wii's are still not readily available.
2127014	2128995	Well, I mean, I don't know.
2129295	2133357	I would think that there's no point to making a shortage now.
2133417	2138460	You don't hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.
2138780	2139160	I don't know.
2139581	2141261	Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas.
2141562	2147865	But even then it would be stupid to do it around Christmas because then that's when you make your most money.
2148365	2150886	So I don't get the point of a forced shortage.
2150966	2151847	I just don't understand it.
2152287	2153768	Maybe I don't know enough about economics.
2156481	2159222	My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.
2160102	2160302	What?
2161363	2162883	That's just my defense on the matter.
2163063	2163363	All right.
2163983	2164464	Anything else?
2164544	2165884	What's up on STFU this week?
2168045	2173026	We didn't have a show last week and the week before I wasn't on, so everybody has to suffer because I'm back this week.
2175047	2175467	Congrats.
2175487	2176827	What are you giggling about?
2176867	2178208	Why are there giggling girls over there?
2179148	2180689	I forget a safe word.
2180889	2181389	I don't get it.
2181529	2181689	Bye.
2182521	2183241	Oh, oh.
2183261	2185402	Oh, I thought it was a nice safe word.
2185442	2189143	It's a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, I forget it's a safe word.
2191884	2192325	Um, yeah.
2192465	2192805	Hi, John.
2194265	2194926	Hi, Jamie.
2195286	2197527	No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.
2198667	2200187	Oh, hi, Irene.
2200247	2201368	She's running out of the room crying.
2201948	2203469	Alright, they gotta go anyway.
2203489	2205269	Oh, I better go call her and comfort her then.
2205629	2206970	Oh, ooh, really now?
2208590	2209751	Um, gotta go, bye.
2212861	2216022	You're always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.
2216042	2217123	What was going on at 8 on the break?
2217143	2218864	Was there a tourney or something?
2218884	2222845	No, a massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.
2242059	2244060	But yeah, I just hoard up 2DX and whatnot.
2245201	2257909	But yeah, I don't get why Activision does, you know, does wonderful things to your 360, case in point, breaking it after, with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.
2258689	2270136	So basically, if you want the, I mean, I don't get it, if you want the whammy bar fixed, you're gonna have to go through an arm and a leg, and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking it.
2271696	2274438	I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.
2274498	2279802	Luckily, I won't have to for a week, so maybe it'll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because I'm going to be gone for a while.
2280122	2283384	But I'm afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because of my 360 bricks.
2283704	2288668	I'm going to be so mad because I know when I call Microsoft, now they want you to pay to get it fixed.
2288988	2292871	I'm going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesn't deserve it.
2293598	2294259	Think about it, Ren.
2294519	2301024	Yeah, I understand that, but you know it's like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?
2302575	2303696	That's a staggering number.
2303836	2304856	Nine out of every ten?
2305137	2306077	Yeah, that's bullshit.
2306097	2307418	Yeah, somebody's pointing that out here.
2307438	2308258	A 90% brick rate, though.
2308879	2311120	It says something about a 90% brick rate.
2311140	2311880	A 90% brick rate?
2311940	2315702	Come on, if that were happening, it would be on the NBC nightly news.
2316102	2324407	No, but only for the people who actually download it who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably not... It doesn't represent the entire user base at all.
2324427	2326308	Yeah, that's bullshit.
2326348	2330250	I'm telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of people on them right now.
2330680	2331501	Thank you for watching!
2344105	2344945	Oh, I'm sure it was.
2344985	2348806	Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?
2348866	2349346	I want to know.
2349886	2359809	How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch brick one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the actual number is, 1%?
2361029	2362749	How does it brick one 360?
2362829	2363849	I have no idea.
2363989	2368711	All I know is that, I mean, it could happen any time.
2368771	2369351	It's basically like death.
2369431	2370591	It's completely unrelated.
2371480	2374101	is like, you know, the odds of dying in a car accident.
2374701	2374921	Okay.
2374941	2378343	You know, they're much higher than actually dying of terrorism.
2378943	2379563	What?
2379743	2380443	Okay, shut up.
2381104	2381684	Knock it off.
2381744	2384545	Listen, here's why this crap is going on.
2384605	2387606	Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.
2387626	2390867	That's why you get people saying, oh, 90% of the consoles are breaking after.
2391087	2394969	No, it's because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.
2395009	2397089	That's why I have a 360 form, though, so you can't blame me for that.
2397109	2398350	No, it might be that your system died.
2400253	2405916	Alright, I just saw it on the 360 forums that, you know, from other people are experiencing the same issue.
2406116	2408518	Yeah, but one person... Having to shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.
2408818	2413081	Yeah, but one person has their system crashed and then another person's like, well, mine is crashed recently too.
2413101	2414822	It must be because of Guitar Hero.
2415102	2420645	And then other people, my friend's system crashed too.
2421086	2425408	I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now it's broken and it's all because of Guitar Hero.
2426249	2426689	Well, that
2427188	2428369	I just want to take a bath in my 360.
2428409	2428790	I don't either.
2441209	2441389	and so on.
2457768	2469172	Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still bricking after they've uninstalled the update and when they're going into the dashboard, which wouldn't even be running the game at all and wouldn't have anything to do with the fucking update.
2469252	2471333	So it's not related and people are retarded.
2471493	2473354	This conversation is giving me a migraine.
2475375	2476855	Oh, well, I think we'll leave it at that.
2477415	2482957	All right, Zaku, thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesn't kill your family, okay?
2483778	2484078	All right.
2484098	2484738	All right, take care.
2486803	2493084	The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and it's killing grandmas across the nation.
2493444	2494445	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2494485	2494805	Who's this?
2495525	2496185	Hey, what's up, guys?
2496665	2497425	Hi, what's on your mind?
2497585	2497925	Who's this?
2498545	2500326	This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold him?
2500526	2503546	Hello, the Rob D. I'm not dodging you and hold him.
2503566	2504367	I'm just messing with you.
2504447	2505067	I understand.
2505107	2506907	You guys play on a bad night.
2506987	2507327	God.
2507667	2508888	Play on like a Monday night.
2508928	2509848	Nothing happens on Monday.
2510368	2510788	Oh, fuck.
2510888	2511928	Heroes is back next week.
2511988	2512388	Never mind.
2514389	2515629	But actually, as a college student...
2516601	2519122	Weeknights would be worse, but either way, that's not why I called in.
2519282	2520082	Alright, what's on your mind?
2520902	2524223	Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable content.
2524743	2526244	What to you would be a better solution?
2526384	2531945	The iTunes model of buying one song apiece, or actually, what's the more egregious offense?
2532065	2538427	The three song packs or the cost per song, which to me is also pretty bad.
2540798	2544241	What if those songs end up costing $2 a song?
2544261	2545562	About $2.10 per piece.
2545722	2548664	Okay, I think they should be priced.
2548924	2557730	I think DDR, even though there's a whole other can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on the disc and people were mad about that, but that aside...
2558069	2560190	I think the pricing scheme over there was somewhat fair.
2560230	2564131	It was 100 points a song, so it worked out to be $1.25 or something.
2564432	2570614	So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought a pack of 10, you got a discount, so it only ended up being $1 a song.
2571214	2571734	I like that.
2573195	2579458	Yeah, $1 per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download, because I don't want to download every Guitar Hero song.
2579798	2581458	Right, and same thing with DDR.
2581498	2584860	Maybe I don't want Candy, because Candy's been in every freaking DDR game lately.
2585908	2587950	So maybe I want to skip that one, but I have that option.
2588130	2590512	Or I could just download the Mega Pack and it's kind of included.
2590772	2592013	It depends how many of the songs I want.
2592233	2600019	But here's the other difference between the DDR packs, is that not only are they cheaper because it's $1.25 a song, but they are new songs, mostly, to the series.
2600059	2602480	Now about, let's say, three quarters of them are new.
2603721	2603962	Right?
2604262	2614209	So... Yeah, I think paying that much, and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I don't remember how much, I think it was about $90.
2616021	2616862	Then that's ridiculous.
2617442	2617822	What do you think?
2617842	2619504	Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?
2619524	2622826	Do you think they're going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the internet?
2622866	2626109	Or do you think, you know, hey, if some sucker's going to buy it, let's keep cranking it out.
2626809	2628130	If enough people buy them, not a chance.
2630432	2631093	I guess it all depends.
2631133	2633214	So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, don't buy it.
2634555	2634976	Exactly.
2635016	2639299	And honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song individually.
2639839	2643122	I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I don't have to download every song.
2643522	2645884	But if they're going to put them in three packs, no way.
2646443	2652246	I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar Hero songs are kind of long.
2652446	2654087	You know, DDR songs are short.
2654227	2655888	They're like, what, a minute and a half, minute 45?
2656228	2659590	So you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs.
2659930	2660491	So they could be more.
2660951	2661851	You're right.
2661891	2664213	I'd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual song.
2664233	2665473	But none of this PAX stuff.
2665754	2666254	I don't like that.
2667455	2669215	Yeah, I think it's almost a double offense in their case.
2669936	2670176	All right.
2670692	2675035	Another game I want to play though is the Phoenix Wright, or not the Phoenix Wright game, the Harvey Birdman game.
2675055	2676656	I think that's a perfect license for Capcom.
2677757	2680619	Do you think they're going to kind of model it after Phoenix Wright, or what do you think it's going to be like?
2681159	2682520	I don't think they could avoid it, honestly.
2683501	2686964	I think that they'd be almost remiss not to do that.
2687144	2687624	Objection!
2688325	2688825	I guess we'll see.
2689445	2690106	I'll take the case.
2690566	2693468	Do you think Phoenix Wright is popular enough that enough people would get it?
2693528	2697511	Like there'd be enough cross-interests between the two franchises, Phoenix Wright and Harvey Birdman?
2698743	2702005	Maybe it'd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.
2702685	2703185	I guess that's true.
2704266	2704546	All right.
2704626	2706286	Well, Rob... Because it depends how they'll do it.
2706667	2707727	Rob D., anything else on your mind?
2707747	2709148	No, that's about it at all.
2709168	2710028	You guys take some more calls.
2710148	2710388	All right.
2710408	2710768	Sounds good.
2710808	2714030	And hey, I'll give your podcast a cheap plug over on allgames.com.
2714070	2715871	You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?
2716151	2716671	Five times a week?
2716711	2717211	It's a lot of fun.
2717652	2717892	All right.
2717912	2718392	Monday to Friday.
2718592	2719352	It's so much fun.
2720493	2720773	All right.
2721213	2721673	Thanks a lot.
2721733	2722134	See you guys later.
2722174	2722754	No problem.
2722794	2722994	See ya.
2725853	2727634	Let's go to another call.
2727694	2728715	We'll take this call here.
2729555	2731236	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
2731256	2731596	Who's this?
2732317	2733417	It's Raven Stauffen.
2734418	2734858	What do you want?
2735699	2736179	I'm sorry.
2736799	2738080	I'm just so excited tonight.
2738300	2738800	Why is that?
2739861	2741222	Because you picked up my call.
2742462	2743283	Well, here you are.
2743303	2745644	I mean, you get in almost every week you call.
2745704	2747625	Very rare do you not seem to get in.
2748454	2749475	We have to be ultra busy.
2749715	2753517	Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, there's not a lot of folks calling in.
2754538	2756258	The phones are dead except for you right now.
2756299	2757299	I think we've got all the other calls.
2758400	2758940	What's on your mind?
2759760	2760521	What's on my mind?
2760661	2760921	Yeah.
2762022	2763883	Oh, what was... Okay.
2763923	2765383	Salmon Max is on my mind.
2765824	2767184	Culture Shock and all the rest.
2767745	2770927	It's last season's coming out this month, and I'm so sad.
2771207	2772387	Have you been playing Salmon Max?
2772427	2773788	I didn't realize you've been playing Salmon Max.
2774468	2777010	Oh, I've been playing Salmon Max since it first came out.
2778383	2781524	How is it for those folks that haven't really been playing the series?
2781624	2785485	Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?
2786626	2793868	Dude, you should be playing this game because it's kind of like a text adventure, and you go around places, and the characters are so lovable.
2794368	2795528	Like, Sam is so funny.
2795548	2797849	He'll go like, holy fish, based on a dance talker.
2798069	2798829	We're on it, chief.
2799069	2801230	And he'll hang up the phones like, what's wrong, Sap?
2801930	2804451	We have to sabotage the president.
2805011	2806091	He's doing something wrong.
2806171	2807692	And it has, like, funny dialogue.
2808447	2838211	and you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things it's a text event again I know you say you're sad because the series is ending and I think we've all heard the last episode for now is coming out but don't you think that the series has been popular enough that we haven't seen the end of it yet I think season 2 has got to be imminent but I don't know when well I guess that's true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live
2839484	2840845	PhoenixRide.com
2865367	2874049	Oh my god, I was just running around, just screaming my head off, going like, it's Phoenix Wright 3, they're finally gonna bring it out!
2875429	2884571	I've been like, holy shit, I hope it comes out soon, because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All, I've been just going, just itching for another one.
2885611	2887691	Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark?
2887711	2889572	Because it seems like they're really starting to crank these out.
2890912	2893133	Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.
2893273	2894973	If it comes out tomorrow, I'm there.
2896725	2902588	TheRobD is in chat and says, I could envision Raven's Dolphin seeing the news, getting up, screaming, and running around.
2903088	2904369	Do you have a video on YouTube of this?
2905289	2905809	I should.
2906550	2907190	That's what you should do.
2908190	2910351	I should just go, oh my god, it's Phoenix Wright!
2912052	2912412	Exactly.
2913513	2914974	Alright, anything else on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
2916234	2918215	One more thing, as usual.
2918955	2919296	Of course.
2920096	2924538	I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.
2925370	2928071	Through the Skype line or through that other service?
2928732	2929312	No, no, no.
2930093	2931934	No, all live through the Skype line.
2932254	2932654	How is that?
2932674	2934395	Did somebody patch the show into you or something?
2935035	2935716	No, no.
2935996	2938137	I actually did something ingenious if you have time.
2938517	2941099	Just give me one minute to just tell me, to tell you.
2941379	2941799	Okay.
2942820	2943780	Now, you got me curious.
2943840	2944580	What is that?
2945561	2945861	Okay.
2946722	2950904	My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone.
2951983	2961107	and Rob D showed me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer and that works great and I can hear you.
2961647	2966290	While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.
2966730	2972032	So you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.
2972792	2973993	No, I called my cell phone.
2974884	2976364	Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.
2976504	2977245	Oh my gosh.
2977385	2978505	Wow, that's hardcore, Ravens.
2978525	2984806	He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically pick up.
2985066	2985806	I think I get it now.
2986326	2988547	But that's pretty hardcore.
2989667	2990467	You're pretty hardcore.
2990547	2991027	A big nerd.
2991167	2991767	Yeah, a big nerd.
2992528	2994148	Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.
2994208	2994688	Well, thank you.
2994708	2995608	We take it as a compliment.
2996148	2996748	But you're crazy.
2996788	2997308	You do know this.
2998249	2999749	I know this, but that's okay.
3000475	3001756	All right, Ravensoft, we've got to let you go.
3001816	3002456	Take more calls.
3002757	3003177	It's fine.
3003217	3003437	Bye.
3003597	3009341	Enjoy, and hopefully they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for all the calls you're making.
3010102	3010422	Okay.
3010502	3012003	All right.
3012063	3013264	Let's go to another call.
3013764	3015185	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3015205	3015526	Who's this?
3016726	3018228	Hello, you happy people.
3018768	3020069	Hey, I can barely hear you.
3020089	3021050	Get a little closer to your mic.
3021070	3021450	Try again.
3022350	3023872	Hello, you happy people.
3024152	3024772	Hey, who's this?
3025293	3026013	This is Dark Knight.
3026233	3027474	Hey, Dark Knight, what's on your mind, buddy?
3028655	3029435	Nothing much.
3029536	3029756	Just...
3030615	3036436	Hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just makes me not convinced to still not get one.
3036836	3038857	So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?
3039917	3041977	I am not a next-gen owner at all.
3042417	3042877	At all.
3043637	3045758	You're still in the ancient times.
3045798	3046358	Well, not really.
3046418	3049659	I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.
3050519	3052039	The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.
3052619	3053119	Yeah.
3054599	3057440	But do you play handhelds at all?
3058742	3060924	I still own a DS, that's the only thing I got.
3061065	3066930	Well, hey, DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.
3066990	3067170	Yeah.
3067311	3071014	So, yeah, do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?
3072495	3079302	I was thinking about it a while back, but like I say, hearing the brick situation and everything just makes me change my mind every time.
3080619	3086303	It is a little bit, you know, it is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.
3086343	3091086	And, you know, I always said, I'm like, oh, you know, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send their consoles back.
3091126	3092507	You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.
3092867	3094148	And then it, like, did happen to me.
3094448	3095869	And I remember ranting about it on the show.
3095949	3097990	I got a brick 360 back in, like, February.
3098050	3099691	My first 360 bricked after, like, a week.
3099751	3100832	I was so pissed.
3101252	3108857	And, yeah, I can't, it's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation.
3108897	3109417	You know what I mean?
3110259	3112100	Especially now they want to charge the repairs.
3113902	3114262	What's that?
3115063	3116284	I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.
3116324	3122408	As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill Gates got this, ain't nothing wrong with it.
3123789	3125751	But yet the darn thing's still bricked, I don't know.
3126091	3128273	Yeah, I mean, it happens a lot.
3128873	3129574	Well, I don't know.
3129614	3132956	I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird, you know.
3133317	3140082	People don't just show up out of the woodwork, you know, suddenly a handful of people all have their consoles go kaput at the same time.
3140492	3145294	I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Phantasy Star Universe and hearing people saying, My room got hacked!
3145314	3145875	My room got hacked!
3145915	3147275	My room got hacked!
3147295	3147696	Every 20 minutes.
3147716	3148916	What's up with Phantasy Star Universe?
3168232	3170133	Right now it's leveled off.
3170413	3172414	Not much hacking going on anymore.
3172514	3176817	Just basically money problems in the game and whatnot.
3176977	3179058	Plus they updated the lobby again recently.
3179858	3185842	Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you visit all the planets and do all those basic quests?
3186462	3188283	Yeah, we're doing S2 missions now.
3188403	3193826	And most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot like...
3194690	3197972	Some areas where you get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.
3198733	3200154	And what else?
3200174	3203476	Then we got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops.
3204056	3204436	That's all.
3205417	3205997	Sounds pretty cool.
3206498	3211601	And then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.
3212742	3213482	Oh, that's right.
3213522	3214803	There's that expansion pack coming out.
3214823	3215804	When's that supposed to be released?
3216984	3219786	Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the U.S.
3219806	3221747	might see it in December.
3221767	3222588	I guess that's better than never.
3223334	3226316	Yeah, so I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.
3226457	3233943	And so far, from what inside information I got from when the chat regular was here, it looks pretty interesting with the expansion.
3234343	3237746	We'll spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.
3237966	3238586	Make it so.
3238907	3240828	We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.
3241769	3243330	I'm doing it enough times as it is.
3243771	3244831	All right, we appreciate it.
3245072	3246052	All right, thanks so much for the call.
3246072	3247794	We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.
3248594	3249235	All right, light up.
3251092	3254674	Mystic Gohan in chat, seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight on the phone.
3255115	3258037	Oh man, I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.
3258977	3259918	I'd be a little scared too.
3259978	3260959	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3260979	3261339	Who's this?
3263480	3265061	Hi, my name's Billy.
3266422	3267223	Hi, Billy.
3268304	3269284	How old are you, Billy?
3271105	3271726	I'm eight.
3272426	3273487	You're eight, huh?
3273967	3275929	And what are you doing listening to this program?
3277970	3279291	My daddy said I could.
3279744	3281165	Your daddy said you could, huh?
3281225	3282887	Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?
3284128	3284668	Yeah.
3285629	3287250	What kind of video games do you play, Billy?
3290533	3291714	The Mario one.
3292074	3293456	You play the Mario one?
3293476	3296078	Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.
3296478	3297979	Which Mario game is your favorite?
3297999	3298460	The one on the Wii.
3299321	3300141	The one on the Wii?
3300201	3301623	You play Super Paper Mario?
3301943	3304445	Or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?
3306711	3309853	I don't know what a virtual console is.
3310593	3312234	You don't know what a virtual console is?
3313334	3313695	No.
3314155	3315515	Okay.
3316436	3318877	Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?
3321258	3326901	My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with the Guitar Hero thing.
3327882	3329022	It, like, didn't work.
3329903	3332824	And he threw it out the window and...
3337392	3340614	Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window?
3340974	3342574	Or did he throw the guitar out the window?
3348036	3350077	He threw the entire Xbox out the window.
3351857	3354738	Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?
3354758	3356619	Really?
3356739	3357059	Really?
3361459	3363340	Yeah, but there was a flat sound.
3363360	3366041	Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.
3386852	3387773	What do you want us to do to help?
3388013	3390695	Loki, they think it's you calling in, by the way, but you're right here, right?
3390735	3391656	I'm not calling in.
3391676	3392557	I'm right here.
3392597	3393117	He's right there.
3393297	3394658	My voice does not sound like that.
3394778	3396400	All right.
3396720	3400343	My dad, my daddy thinks Loki's stupid.
3401143	3402805	Why is Loki stupid?
3404666	3407048	Because my daddy loves Max.
3408769	3410150	Your daddy loves men?
3411672	3412312	No, Max.
3412412	3413013	Oh, Max.
3413233	3414514	Oh, your daddy loves Max.
3415054	3415454	Okay.
3415675	3415935	No.
3416388	3416909	DarkSakura.com
3447722	3449262	Baby's cool.
3450783	3453464	DarkSakura is cool.
3453845	3454385	Thank you.
3454405	3457927	That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.
3459047	3459748	Hey!
3460608	3461849	I'm great.
3462869	3464450	Okay, let's see.
3466271	3470153	I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain you?
3472634	3474355	Can we watch The Lion King?
3475656	3476456	Sure you can.
3477557	3481020	Yes, we'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.
3482562	3486205	I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.
3486926	3489589	It's the circle of life.
3493412	3494473	I'm scared.
3494573	3496155	I think I'm going to hang up now.
3496455	3497336	All right, you do that.
3498557	3500019	Okay, bye.
3500179	3501180	Thank you, bye.
3504960	3506741	Which of our callers was that crank calling us?
3506761	3507902	Do you think that was DMN?
3508802	3509162	I can't say.
3509363	3511324	They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.
3511864	3515746	So, whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone number.
3515786	3516827	You know who that was, DarkSakura?
3517887	3518448	You're a jerk.
3519889	3521910	Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us?
3522470	3528594	Excuse me, I was here with the microphone set down, looking at fucking Saturday pictures.
3529274	3530195	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3530215	3530555	Who's this?
3532796	3533697	Uh-oh, call dropped.
3533877	3534297	Try again.
3535007	3537889	1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always call us on Skype.
3537909	3539790	Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
3542031	3545392	Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?
3545833	3551595	I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment now.
3551635	3552516	Did you lose a sock?
3552556	3553136	Says, who was it?
3553176	3553676	That was funny.
3555017	3556038	And let's see.
3556558	3558579	GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.
3560220	3562781	Gaming Nerd says, Sky loves swearing to 8-year-olds.
3564107	3568731	Misty says, if we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch about that makeup.
3570052	3572374	Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.
3572714	3573795	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3573815	3574155	Who's this?
3574876	3575417	It's Zappy.
3575637	3577138	Hey, our match game champion.
3577178	3578039	Zappy, what's on your mind?
3578719	3581862	Well, since you brought Potpourri up, you brought this upon yourself.
3582302	3584424	How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?
3585525	3588708	It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.
3589946	3590226	What happened?
3590246	3594550	Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.
3595371	3596251	Oh, I didn't have no idea.
3596271	3597573	I didn't really mean to be an asshole.
3597973	3598613	No, it's okay.
3598914	3601396	Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.
3601496	3603157	No, it's my computer's dying.
3603998	3604138	Oh.
3604859	3609042	The VAIO is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.
3609062	3610864	Do you want me to find it and burn it to a DVD for you?
3612283	3615765	I do not burn it into a DivX or X video format.
3616026	3616926	I need MPEGs.
3617086	3618327	I don't know how to do that.
3618967	3622270	I don't want it burned as a DVD playing file.
3622350	3623931	I want it as just data.
3624711	3625972	With that extra crap on it.
3626352	3627233	I think I can do that.
3627873	3628233	MPEG.
3628353	3629094	MPEG is better.
3629534	3631776	Did you at least get to see last week's?
3632396	3633136	No, I didn't.
3633817	3635078	Oh, you're behind on the whole season.
3635498	3635838	Yes.
3636779	3637279	But think of it.
3637319	3638640	You'll get to have a whole marathon day.
3639943	3642284	Ooh, Anger Rising here in the Orange Lounge Radio Room.
3642724	3645285	Good job, Zappy, getting us all mad.
3645325	3645825	No, I'm just kidding.
3645845	3647606	What games have you been playing this week, Zappy?
3648567	3651928	Nothing since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.
3652149	3653109	You broke your PSP?
3653749	3653990	Yeah.
3654390	3655030	How'd you do that?
3655710	3657171	I dropped my laptop on the screen.
3658692	3658912	Ouch.
3659632	3662574	So what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?
3663094	3664915	I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.
3665955	3666996	Oh, that's great.
3667888	3671189	What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?
3672069	3674570	Call of Duty and Ratchet & Clank.
3675170	3676970	A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.
3678231	3678971	I actually like it.
3680511	3684733	What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?
3685773	3686273	Let's see.
3686753	3689474	There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.
3690314	3692295	What's the name of that stuff game?
3692875	3694035	It completely slipped my mind.
3694762	3699184	Not Metal Gear Solid, but... Subsistence?
3700425	3700725	Uh, no.
3702166	3703727	Or wait, no, are that what, Acid?
3703907	3706268	Or what was the other Metal Gear one?
3706648	3710470	It's not Metal Gear, it's another one that's on the PlayStation platform.
3714152	3715953	It starts with an S. Oh, Cyclone Filter.
3716453	3716974	Oh, okay.
3718595	3719375	That's a pretty good one.
3720356	3720616	Cool.
3720656	3723137	Also, there's Daxter, that's good.
3724113	3726294	Alright, there's some good... Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?
3727314	3729534	Uh, no, I'm not really... Rondo of Blood!
3730295	3734035	Two people in the chatroom did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game, so there you go.
3734736	3737176	And YYZ gives us the mandatory Rondo of Blood!
3737536	3737856	There you go.
3738697	3743438	Alright, well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.
3744418	3745298	I'll do my best.
3745458	3746458	Alright, take care, buddy.
3746999	3748079	Bye.
3748539	3748839	Bye-bye.
3749571	3753394	See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.
3753454	3754394	He should do that for you.
3754815	3757957	Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.
3758377	3772847	It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on... And I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding his laptop.
3773547	3775789	And so since then, I've actually had a problem with...
3779130	3779951	The DivX stuff.
3781152	3782013	Alright, one more call.
3783215	3784176	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3784196	3784536	Who's this?
3785518	3786739	This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.
3787059	3789302	Hey, DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.
3789342	3789963	What's on your mind, buddy?
3791182	3791942	Nothing much, man.
3792322	3793203	It's my first time calling.
3793223	3798804	I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have time.
3800344	3804585	I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show.
3805105	3806246	Wow, congratulations.
3806406	3809686	Geez, you've been listening for three years and you've never gotten on the show.
3809726	3810306	Well, there you go.
3811007	3811587	What the hell?
3811607	3813127	Our line doesn't get hammered that much.
3813147	3813707	Well, that's all right.
3813727	3815688	Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.
3815828	3817048	What did you want to talk to us about tonight?
3817935	3825081	Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo is delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.
3825521	3827563	Of course, yeah.
3827603	3836470	Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues.
3836510	3844937	Because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on, whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony...
3845359	3845739	and so on.
3868995	3877283	Any of the shipping problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't get out enough chips.
3877443	3884170	And it happened before with, I'm not sure if you know that Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.
3884570	3887834	That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips.
3888274	3893299	And Apple was like, well, fuck you guys, you can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel.
3893920	3897562	and now you kind of see the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.
3898042	3906085	You know, that's an interesting point because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components that go into the system.
3906485	3911967	And for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360 delays previously was that there was like a component?
3912347	3915389	It wasn't so much... I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip.
3915469	3918730	One of these systems got so slowed down because the factory couldn't produce enough of it.
3919450	3923492	It was the PlayStation 3 and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really...
3924096	3947827	IBM's fault either it's the fact that Nintendo's retarded it only has one factory building these fucking systems instead of like four factories or even more building systems that's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that right now despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM it's because they're retarded still and they only have one factory producing them despite the fact that most of the components in it are
3948436	3954279	were stuff that was in the GameCube and that they should have tons of and should be really easy to manufacture.
3955020	3956200	Yeah, but one... That's a good point.
3956721	3957621	Yeah, that's a good point.
3957661	3963904	I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as, you know, getting enough factories out there to make these damn systems.
3964445	3975811	But, I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles, you kind of have to look at it this way.
3975871	3977692	IBM only has one factory, two.
3978323	3982587	So, in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at in this situation?
3982687	3988772	All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the overall picture.
3989252	3990073	There's no winners.
3990614	4001022	The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wii's because Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360s.
4002208	4002988	DJ Kibbles and Bits
4025120	4027961	Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.
4028461	4033542	Exactly, you know what, that's my thoughts now is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get the system.
4033662	4034182	You know what?
4035342	4036822	Who cares if there's shortages?
4037262	4040763	It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there and wait.
4041363	4047504	But you know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June.
4047764	4050705	Well, sucks to be you if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get...
4051275	4051816	DarkSakura.com
4071972	4072933	Other End of Things, too.
4072973	4073433	So, whatever.
4073453	4075074	It's a catch-22 at the end of the day.
4075094	4079517	Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space on my 360.
4080437	4081298	Until they sell porn.
4083179	4083599	Good point.
4084900	4085321	Oh, God.
4085361	4087482	Please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.
4087742	4088583	HD porn!
4089163	4089643	Oh, my God.
4089903	4091284	Sales of 360 would go through the roof.
4091304	4092665	Seriously, they would whoop the Wii's ass.
4093165	4098669	I mean, think about dads across America going to buy a system for their children.
4099059	4106061	Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high def?
4106601	4107522	Porn wins, always.
4108342	4113083	Well, Beyonce, PlayStation 3 makes that the easiest since you can put video files on there pretty simple.
4113383	4115744	Baby Formula or WoW Epic Mount?
4116204	4118585	Baby Formula, WoW Epic Mount.
4118705	4119425	I just can't choose.
4120605	4124226	DJ Kibbles and Bits, really good first call, really good point.
4124327	4125887	Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?
4127032	4128112	Oh, no, that's it, man.
4128133	4128473	That's it.
4128813	4129373	It's a pleasure.
4129393	4129913	It's a pleasure.
4130313	4130934	Well, no problem.
4130974	4131914	Thanks so much for calling.
4131954	4132394	Anytime.
4132434	4132794	Call back.
4132814	4133795	All right.
4133835	4134435	Take care, guys.
4134675	4134915	Later.
4136536	4136976	All right.
4137036	4138417	Well, that was a good Skype line tonight.
4138457	4140077	Lots of people we got to hear from there.
4141838	4144539	And, of course, our chat room going along there.
4145059	4145599	Let's see.
4149321	4150921	I think they're talking about Doctor Who now.
4151442	4153022	DarkSakura, is there a Doctor Who debate here?
4153042	4153422	Ignoring.
4154083	4154483	Ignoring.
4154623	4154843	I see.
4155305	4158446	I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but... Exterminate!
4160967	4162948	Legend of Zaku says, Remember this lesson in life.
4162968	4169251	When trying to get a Wii, there will always be at least ten diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store that sells it.
4170992	4171792	eBay profiteers.
4173112	4174673	Have a special place in hell waiting for them.
4175453	4178235	Alright, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?
4178415	4179755	Yes, but Loki can go first.
4180596	4180896	Alright.
4181336	4181516	Okay.
4182673	4184794	Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.
4184954	4189975	One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have voice chat.
4190515	4190995	Not true.
4192236	4192696	Let's see here.
4193936	4201678	DarkAlex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.
4203099	4203839	So that's pretty awesome.
4204298	4207100	Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller that looks like a 360 controller.
4207120	4207340	Don't care.
4230758	4232079	Virtual consoles for Monday.
4232179	4235702	Apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's Revenge.
4236822	4238364	So that'd be kind of neat for the U.S.
4238944	4240205	Where's my Actraiser?
4240845	4242266	Doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.
4243367	4249192	There's a new game coming to the PlayStation Network that looks exactly like... I cannot remember the damn name.
4251713	4254115	It's on the 360... whatever.
4254135	4255156	What do you think?
4256591	4257272	What that game is?
4257372	4259674	Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.
4262196	4262616	I don't know.
4263277	4265839	It looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.
4266379	4267160	Boom Boom Rocket?
4267280	4268241	It's not Boom Boom Rocket.
4268261	4268901	Geometry Wars?
4268941	4269282	I don't know.
4269562	4270563	No, not Geometry Wars.
4270583	4271203	The other one.
4271383	4272444	Like Mutant Storm Reloaded.
4272464	4272945	That's what it was.
4273005	4273705	Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?
4273725	4275627	Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.
4276568	4282453	For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source for the Half-Life engine.
4282633	4284354	Who cares?
4284534	4285375	Oh, this is stupid.
4286251	4290235	Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.
4291676	4294138	Makes me want to paint... Was it spray-painted red?
4294398	4295960	Yes, it was, more or less.
4297861	4298942	People are retarded.
4299222	4307569	And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the PlayStation.
4308110	4309891	So I hope that is true.
4312694	4312994	Alright.
4314048	4324015	Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend Brad from PodCulture.
4325135	4326016	Yay, Brad!
4327177	4330559	This is not really news, but it's something that's really cool.
4330719	4332300	It's from TechBlog.
4333341	4335682	Sorry, I should say TechEblog, I should say.
4336903	4339585	The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.
4340666	4342727	And number ten is the ColecoVision Portable.
4344381	4349302	The NES Station, which is basically Nintendo done up to look like a PS2.
4351023	4351543	Just a mod.
4352943	4360405	There's the N-Pod, which runs NES games.
4361225	4361945	It's interesting.
4363046	4364126	It actually looks kind of cool.
4364166	4364606	I want one.
4365226	4372068	There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a Nomad and then attached a CD player to it.
4373949	4379292	The GameCube2Go, which, yeah, whatever.
4379912	4380773	That one's kind of bizarre.
4381213	4382634	But neat at the same time.
4383294	4385135	The NES Plus Sega.
4385735	4388076	That's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.
4389317	4390738	The handheld Atari Jaguar.
4390838	4391238	Next!
4392899	4394059	Only good game on that was Tempest.
4395620	4397081	Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini.
4397761	4398342	Yeah, whatever.
4399122	4399922	Dreamcast Portable.
4400463	4401043	That's kind of cool.
4401703	4402884	And PlayStation 2 Portable.
4404090	4406771	I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.
4406811	4407051	Hmm.
4409932	4410792	He brought it over.
4410812	4411232	It worked.
4411252	4411792	It was pretty cool.
4411812	4412752	I think that this is cool.
4412792	4413673	I still want a GameX.
4414553	4414753	What?
4414973	4415593	A GameX.
4415613	4416333	What the hell is that?
4416974	4418394	Let me find a picture of it.
4418774	4421815	It's another handheld chopped-up system.
4422095	4422815	But there's no time.
4423475	4423895	That was it.
4424596	4425296	We're out of stories.
4425516	4426156	We're out of steam.
4426276	4426896	We're out of time.
4428097	4428597	So that's it.
4428697	4430997	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
4431017	4431838	Was that your last story?
4431878	4432218	I'm sorry.
4433198	4433438	Okay.
4434089	4435350	I'm trying to pull the thing.
4435390	4436511	It's a portable NES player.
4439993	4440473	And Game Gear.
4441694	4442034	And stuff.
4442815	4443115	Anyway.
4445797	4446197	Rob!
4447318	4448979	Let's go around and give everyone's... What?
4449759	4450240	What?
4451160	4451841	I will kill you.
4451961	4453222	Can I have some cheeseburger, please?
4454883	4455303	That's it.
4455403	4456904	Let's go around and give everybody's final thought.
4457404	4459325	Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.
4460166	4460446	What's that?
4460586	4460967	Tuesday.
4461367	4461607	Yeah?
4461667	4462187	I have class.
4462528	4463208	No pump up the volume.
4464357	4466539	There may not be guys on the show Wednesday because of my trips.
4466679	4468881	So it's going to be a very quiet week on Orange Lingerie.
4468901	4471703	But at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan live this week.
4472184	4473945	And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.
4475486	4475947	Interesting.
4476707	4476968	All right.
4477888	4483373	Also, next week's show should be very interesting because DarkSakura and I will be at Disneyland Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
4484654	4485094	Not Sunday.
4485134	4488877	We're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving Thursday.
4488997	4489358	On Sunday.
4489698	4491099	Anyway, too confusing.
4491139	4493501	So we'll be pulling into town just when the show is about to start.
4493928	4498990	So next week could very well be the Loki show with hilarious commentary from DarkSakura and Skye.
4499010	4500170	So won't that be fun, Loki?
4500190	4501530	I still think Loki should come with us.
4502291	4502511	I know.
4502551	4503531	I wish Loki would come with us.
4503931	4505192	Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?
4505672	4505812	No.
4506052	4506612	You make me sad.
4506812	4508953	Don't you want to ride Rockin' California Screamin'?
4509493	4509653	No.
4510473	4510713	All right.
4510753	4511174	Boring.
4512134	4512834	He's so boring.
4513294	4514835	He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.
4514855	4515715	I guess I can't say I blame him.
4516155	4516595	Play games.
4516975	4517336	All right.
4518196	4520176	Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.
4520877	4521777	Loki, your final thought.
4522573	4528838	Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force 2 on Blade Season 2.
4530759	4531920	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4532200	4533621	I have the best wallpaper ever.
4533921	4535442	I just posted links to it in the chatroom.
4537123	4539144	My final thought is penguins!
4541106	4543627	And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.
4544408	4545148	You're a dick.
4545949	4546329	That's it.
