3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We're here on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 29th of 2007, continuing on with episode number 229 of our show.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you are just tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the very first time, hi, how are you?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But you're listening to the second part of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you want to go back in our audio archive and listen to the first part, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All the details are there or whatever program you use to get this program like maybe iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And, of course, our chat room is over at www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we always like to read your comments.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And, of course, the Skype line will be open in the show a little later.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The iToy is no more as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out and it's called just the Eye, not the iToy because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the camera will now instead of taking 320 by, or no, I think before like the camera was only taking like what, 300 by 200, I mean it was really small.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's not bad.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not HD, but that's not bad.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or 320 at twice that.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye, but I guess so.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So there you go.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself, dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Enjoy.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Does this have anything to do with the exclusive release Loki got word about for The Brown Eye of Judgment some months ago?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have no idea. Possibly.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know, Loki. How about The Brown Eye of Judgment?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Speaking of The Brown Eye of Judgment, it's a sisterly game or brotherly game, whatever.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The Eye of Judgment has been dated for the very specific date of fall, and that's for Japan, of course.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Anyways, it is going to use the eye camera, and it's going to be a card game.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hurrah.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like 80 bucks if this game is bundled in there.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Looks exactly the same to me.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff, have they?

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let me put it this way.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Granted, the camera is better than the last camera.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But let's just look at the examples here, and I'm not just saying that the eye toys suck.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks as well.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special...

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If that's actually what it can do, then great.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And according to this, I think you can.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But if it does suck, I'm going to be fucking pissed again.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I'm not buying it.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was going to say, are you actually buying this to try it out?

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't buy it, exactly.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera,

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That was very fucking lame.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I wanted that game to be so good, and then it required the camera,

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I said, screw it.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera,

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but I don't want to use it.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's useless.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I seriously don't even want to play it.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Apparently in multiplayer, you get to see other people playing the game,

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
which might be kind of funny.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I would play it just so I could play it.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet,

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
maybe somebody in chat can clarify,

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but if that's true, then you can play that by waving your arms,

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube,

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and we could all have a laugh.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That might be a good use of the...

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can already do that with DDR, though.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That might be a good use of the Xbox 360.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I did show him the orange bat, by the way.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All right, anyway.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, yes, the bat.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's old.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I saw the bat.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Did you go to her house and play pinball?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
March soccer invited me over, and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games,

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and then Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was great.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The only PS3 game I've ever played, but it was tons of fun.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Cool. All right. Good job.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I played Deadpool the whole time. It was great.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, she did. Nerd.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She was kicking ass.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, who are you playing?

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I played Thor, and then I played Iron Man.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I played a lot of Iron Man, and I was like, dude...

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dude, he has a freaking rocket kick. It's great.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All right. No Wonder Woman still.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's Marvel!

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's my new favorite joke on this show.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not a very good joke.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can play Spider Woman.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Uh, my word.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Anyway.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Pinball's awesome.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, moving forward, shall I?

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hasbro, actually, is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
God, why?

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, no.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Our card crack!

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Me too.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I started playing Magic again.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I had my black bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books,

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to...

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I just gave them away because they were my...

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why don't you sell half of it?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, but...

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I sold what I could out of it, like my Moxes.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, I go outdoors.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I sold my Moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert, nerd alert!

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, anyway.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This show has reached maximum nerd levels.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get money for or I can see naked chicks.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And obviously Magic has neither of those.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I used to play the Illuminati game.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, was that good?

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That was really fun.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert!

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Anyway, so yeah, Hasbro's bringing out cards for piece of shit the game.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Piece of shit the game?

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, what's kind of funny though is they're still producing these cards,

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same,

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
because the camera doesn't know any different.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's a fucking camera, it's a card, and boom, works!

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I was going to ask you about this.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there?

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, in fact, it's really complicated to play the game,

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated,

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because otherwise they'll just recast the card,

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because the game doesn't know.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's very fucking complicated to play,

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and when I ask them, I'm like,

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's the point of this game?

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
See, it's just retarded.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a fucking tech demo.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box,

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but the problem is it's thinking a little too far outside of the box.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's one thing to think outside the box if the box is made out of cardboard.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All it's really going to do is supplement.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Say, for example, if you want to take this and make an official Magic of the Gathering game,

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The Judgment or something like that,

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever,

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and it just enhances that.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that,

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can place them down,

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
To be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though,

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't think anyone's going to give a shit,

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place,

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
like any other iToy game that's out on the market right now

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because they're frustrating and don't work properly.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I will give a shit when you can hack that thing like people have hacked other games

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so we can get our OLR game going

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and we can see a little dancing Rob whenever we put his card down.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, hooray.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I am so excited. I just can't hide it.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That will go on YouTube.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube,

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sony is creating a service called iVEO.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a video sharing site in Japan,

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and of course it's something that's going to hopefully,

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
if PlayStation gets their way in,

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sony will compete against YouTube.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now,

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's interesting about it is that you can actually download

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There will be a mobile version of this service as well,

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped,

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
which is kind of funny.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So there it is.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that,

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation i,

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you'll also be able to upload those to the service,

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and then so you can hopefully someday download

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
My Humps, My Humps, My Humps.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And it's definitely not in slow motion.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come on, just My Lovely Lady Humps.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come on, Loki.

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So retarded.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Anyways, so some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They've actually put out a new patent.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
James Patrick in chat says,

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How is it a good idea? Just go to YouTube.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Zing.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sorry, Loki.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anyways, so they have a brand new patent,

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And what this basically is, in layman's terms,

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is it will actually use your console to have,

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
communicate with other devices, like handheld devices.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So say for example, I have a Playstation 3,

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
although this isn't a Microsoft thing,

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but say I had a Playstation 3, and they have this thing in it,

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers,

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but at the same time, my game system is communicating to my PSP

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to,

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I guess, speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out more polygons and whatnot.

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or fold proteins.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Goody, goody, goody.

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Fuck that shit.

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I am damn well not wasting my console resources,

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So this is like the original design for the cell processor,

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together,

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
except that it works with things that aren't Sony branded.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, something like that.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's right.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait, is this Microsoft?

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is Microsoft, right?

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, this is Microsoft.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It says basically in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones,

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and consoles in a way that increases the processing power

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
of all the connected devices.

243
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The more gaming components in the network,

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the more computing power is generated.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So can you imagine?

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So it's Voltron, right?

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No, it's not gay, and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, it's Voltron.

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I like vehicle Voltron.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Microsoft has just patented Voltron.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's what it is. It's Voltron.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It doesn't have theme music. It isn't Voltron.

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I like vehicle Voltron.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I like vehicle Voltron.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey, guess what?

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A lot cooler.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, Star Soccer. A lot cooler.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Tron.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tron.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's like Voltron without a mole.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can't make Voltron without Tron.

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Great minds.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Rob, three words for you.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Great minds think like me.

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
End of line.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Anyway.

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Four words for you. Die in a fire.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
For people who don't know,

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever,

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
which I have on laserdisc and DVD.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have like the Uber, Uber laserdisc that's like,

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you know, this big fat box of Tron.

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This reminds me of something, if I may, real quick.

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, Dark Soccer, trust me.

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This will have your blessing.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

283
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What does that have to do with Tron?

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
F you to Disney for not having the people mover.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I know.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All because that stupid grad jumped off of it.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Because the people mover.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Most graduate high school and jump off the people mover.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Tron ride at Disneyland.

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because you could go through like Tron,

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
which is the coolest thing ever.

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I believe Tim Curry narrated it,

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
which makes it just double cool.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know what they could do though?

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And so, you know,

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
if they should do instead of the people movers,

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
actually just do the things together,

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
like a little track ride and have it enclosed.

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was called the Rocket Rods.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Also someone died on that one and they removed that as well.

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and I rode on it in the back.

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some games.

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because it was like the people movers,

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Same track.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It went through the Tron thing too.

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was just like pew, real fast.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No narration.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Tron.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Tron.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Anyway, although Disney Interactive has not confirmed this yet,

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the ESRB is actually reviewing a rating for the discs of Tron.

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And also it says there's another one supposed to be coming out,

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but they were talking about a...

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
IGN actually was saying that they received a package

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that included a DVD of Tron

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and a note that says, SARC is ready, are you?

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And so we're getting...

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, sorry.

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Another note to that was,

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
two classics return this summer to the arcade.

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
More data to be downloaded soon.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That is so frickin' rad, I can't even contain myself.

328
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I found the Discs of Tron machine.

329
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games.

330
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That was an excellent game.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The light cycles, that little cone thing.

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Did you ever play Tron 2.0?

333
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I never did.

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There's something that Dan downloaded a while back,

335
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and it was pretty fun.

336
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's actually just a light cycle game.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was about to say, the online one?

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah, the online light cycle game.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That was pretty cool.

340
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That Tron 2.0 though was supposed to be like a big play-through game.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because you're a nerd.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No, Dan was using my laptop last and...

345
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
God.

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Anyway.

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Tron is one letter off from Pron.

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's true.

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you know how everyone misspells porn?

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Pron.

351
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Tron.

352
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
T-R-0-N.

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Discs of Pron.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh no, that's what Dark Sakura denies having, is hard discs of Pron.

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
End of line.

357
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh wait, no, I pointed...

358
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Loki's like sitting here going,

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you going to cut her off yet with the next story?

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I'm going,

362
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on, Loki, get into your story.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oops, it's my turn.

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hi.

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Rob.

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No, I just wanted to try that one time.

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It doesn't work for you, it works for her.

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's actually kind of fun.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, it's not.

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the way.

372
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now, it's one step above a rumor because harmonics fans seemed to call the first set of arcade

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
packs before they came out, so this looks like it could be pretty true, is that there

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.

375
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Pack one will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett,

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and The Black Hearts and Cochise by Audioslave.

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Content pack two will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones,

378
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And content pack three will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand,

380
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,

382
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
then fail.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Although, I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price.

384
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had these one packs that cost 200 points and these

385
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
other packs that cost 100 points?

386
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That would look kind of stupid, so I think they're going to be the same price like it

387
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
or not.

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Everybody bought them.

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The market sustains it.

390
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah.

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.

392
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Exactly.

393
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ditto.

394
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's kind of rad.

396
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That was the one pack I really didn't want.

397
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I didn't enjoy any of those songs nearly as much as the others.

398
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Anyways, there's a rumor that the BioWare sci-fi role-playing game, you know, this phenomenal

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.

400
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So, it's rumor mill and yada, yada, yada.

403
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's actually moved.

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What, what, what?

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Nothing.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't say anything.

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Did you say it's actually true?

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Probably.

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And how would you know this?

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because I heard about it before.

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, right.

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But it's probably true.

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's not done.

414
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let me put it this way.

415
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not coming out, you know, right now, but definitely later.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So September until you get your Mass Effect.

417
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Sorry.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
East.

419
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
At least.

420
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at Too Human, delayed to like next year.

421
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because

422
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
their games division is actually reporting a lower sales by 21%.

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Basically, they've had a drop from 402 million for this quarter last year to 315 million.

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So that's quite a bit.

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're basically saying the revenues were actually down by $1.2 billion.

426
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So.

427
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Of course, it's not surprising, you know, they've lost a lot of money before with their

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
product.

429
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.

430
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
2003.

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
See, there's that shipped again.

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's not sold, it's shipped.

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Shipped equals sitting on store shelves collecting dust.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And they're up, you know, but also during the same time, their operating losses fell

436
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
by 20%.

437
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So maybe it's going to balance.

438
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They'll pull through.

439
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They have the resources.

440
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's Microsoft.

441
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They have the power of gates because he's tainted them.

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It'll be fine.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They'll be fine.

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Halo 3 is on its way.

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Halo Wars.

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
They'll be fine.

447
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I see their parachutes.

448
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
All right.

449
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is not going to help their situation though much.

450
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sorry.

451
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't

452
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
have any sort of idea what's coming out the list mass effect for September as well.

453
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So, you know, you heard it from Gamefly.

454
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's September because they were, they were listing some other weird title called like

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out ever.

456
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Didn't some little internet radio sites somewhere mentioned that one once?

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, we disavow all knowledge of that.

458
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah.

459
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Look, he's afraid of getting NAMM code by nine Microsoft.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
NAMM code is a verb now.

461
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Some site somewhere.

462
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Some, something we wish would get NAMM code is this, although I don't see how that's possible.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But, look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox live marketplace recently and what

464
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
they are is they're 100 MS point videos.

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Basically all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
of War.

468
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And they have one of these videos for each chapter.

469
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, basically you could spend, what about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out

470
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.

471
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's awesome except for the facts that YouTube and game FAQs and many other gaming sites

472
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing.

473
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So, Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell

476
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
strategy guides.

477
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, you know, should they stop publishing strategy guides since game FAQs are out there?

478
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things

480
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that you can't really get online.

481
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And they make great coffee table books for the gamer.

482
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They really do.

483
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is.

484
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of like cool

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
art and stuff.

486
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, you know, I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.

487
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.

488
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Same thing with strategy guides.

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know about these videos though.

490
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay because if there are suckers out

491
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're going to sell it and that's

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
just going to motivate them to make more.

493
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm just going to say a preemptive F.U. to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy type videos for free.

495
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, apparently, Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kane & Lynch

496
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and Crossfire.

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

498
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but

499
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know, news to me, but they are now coming out on both systems.

500
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't know why this is a big surprise because, I mean, how many games like before came out

501
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?

502
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.

503
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Who gives a fuck anyways?

504
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they

505
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.

506
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So, you know, heavenly sword.

507
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So, you know, whatever.

508
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a

509
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing the

510
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
exclusive things.

511
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So, you know, there's been a lot of ra-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May

512
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Cry is coming out on 360, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's

513
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
working the other way.

514
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't know.

515
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I think it's just really, it's not surprising, though.

516
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I mean, that's just, why would you publish something for one system, only one system,

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
unless, I don't know.

518
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't know why you would just do that.

519
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?

520
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I mean, more people, even if it is only a few million more, more is better.

521
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So, I don't know.

522
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Ravenstaufen is in our chat room and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.

523
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's like, I do not give a shit.

524
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I thought we were like that every week.

525
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't.

526
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I really don't some weeks.

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's see, and Kiki's in our chat room.

528
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's a new name.

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Hi, Kiki.

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Says, Rob, Rob, Rob.

531
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

532
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.

533
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That sounds awesome.

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
All right.

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Deakman says, announcement of the podcast.

536
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
My girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.

537
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Wow.

538
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.

539
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Congratulations.

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, what's that?

541
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, my.

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
No.

543
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Really, Dark Sakura?

544
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No.

545
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're not Deakman's baby?

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No.

547
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You're not Mary Deakman's baby?

548
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Hi, Mary.

549
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't even carry my own husband.

550
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
We kid.

551
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We kid.

552
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We kid.

553
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 AM by

554
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
a cesarean.

555
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 AM.

556
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He is six pounds eight ounces.

557
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
How come you have it at 6.66 AM?

558
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, Rob, duh.

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a joke, people.

560
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's a joke.

561
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But his name is Julian Donald.

562
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
He just did not want to come out, anyway.

563
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So, I did want to share that, though, with everyone because I'm very...

564
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I feel what that baby's going through, not wanting to come out.

565
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Seriously, though, this is my friend's first baby, and I'm very excited for her.

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Congratulations to her.

567
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And to Deakman.

569
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
See, we have someone nice in the room, Rob.

570
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?

571
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
God of War.

572
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
How about a decapitated goat?

573
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No.

574
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's an offering.

575
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think it's great, though, because his parents are both Trekkies.

576
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.

577
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
They didn't name the kid Spock, did they?

578
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
His name is Julian.

579
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay.

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Wait a minute.

581
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Wasn't that Picard's real name or something?

582
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know.

583
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I forget it.

584
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Jean-Luc?

585
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.

587
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Patrick Stewart.

588
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I swear I read that in some dig article this week.

589
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It was supposed to be Julian Picard, and they changed it last minute.

590
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Guess what, Rob?

591
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think we have another segment to do.

592
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Every week, you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and I'm so excited.

593
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite

594
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
emails for you to read.

595
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's start the mailbag segment.

596
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Hooray.

597
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You can read them with that attitude.

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Anyway, first email is from Ariz...

599
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

600
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Should I get an Xbox 360?

601
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I have a high death monitor that can support 360 VGA.

602
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.

603
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Is it worth it?

604
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
No, get a Wii.

605
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
No, you should get a 360.

606
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need

607
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
live.

608
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I have live and I don't play games over it.

609
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Although I do like to download some arcade games, but you'd be fine without it.

610
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Get a Wii.

611
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So I've got live silver and I play on a monitor, which looks fine.

612
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'd say a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

613
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes.

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So what games do you want to play?

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You can play mature games, so there's nothing really good out.

616
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Anyway.

617
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, that's true.

618
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Sorry, I stepped out of the room, but Warrior Bob sounded like he was on target.

619
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What game was that?

620
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Test Drive.

621
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That is not a mature game and it is awesome.

622
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I love it.

623
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Next email comes from AZHP.

624
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad dirty jokes that people have been coming

625
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
up with.

626
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm here to save you guys.

627
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.

628
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let me pull up the ad.

629
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh God, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will

630
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
share with our chat room right now.

631
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There you go, everybody.

632
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual in the windows in

633
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
it.

634
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's very small for me to read.

635
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I use a higher resolution, obviously.

636
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Anyway, here it is.

637
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The text says this and this is no joke.

638
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Please have this read in the slightest voice you can find in the studio.

639
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, fuck that.

640
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm going to use my regular voice.

641
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night and you're warm and safe in your living

642
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.

643
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Killing vampires goes great with friends and the closest ones you have here are helping

644
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
you through a tough level.

645
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You pause.

646
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
There are monsters up ahead and you're unsure of how to proceed.

647
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.

648
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Perhaps it's something in the juice.

649
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Perhaps it's the high from the intense side scrolling action that only NES can deliver,

650
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
which is a lie because the Genesis had it, too, and so did the Master System.

651
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But there seems to soar around the two of you.

652
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You don't look away.

653
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You can't.

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.

655
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It scares you, yet you must have it.

656
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Your gaze never breaks.

657
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Neither does his.

658
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions and fantasy lands.

659
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Tonight there will be a new adventure.

660
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Nintendo, now you're playing with power.

661
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What did you see in his eyes?

662
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You saw blast processing.

663
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Game power.

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize

665
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.

666
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
In the U.S.

667
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Or Japan or whatever.

668
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh really?

669
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That's where it's at.

670
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Korea?

671
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Alright.

672
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I wonder about that.

673
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, you're right.

674
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Anyway, next email, shall I?

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every

676
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
week.

677
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.

678
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Can I say it real fast?

679
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.

680
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Unlike the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck, I actually like your

681
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
show.

682
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.

683
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Can I continue please?

684
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Alright, sorry.

685
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.

686
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Week after week, I listen to the cowardly beat around the bush responses, Apple sucks,

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Apple blows.

688
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well thought out, valid response

689
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to that argument.

690
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Is it because you can't run Windows?

691
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh wait, yes you can.

692
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Is it because you can't play the Sims?

693
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance, oh wait, yes you can.

694
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?

695
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Would you feel better if they called it a Zune cast?

696
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?

697
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I guess because me and Chris bought him a Zune.

698
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Hi.

699
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Weren't you listening to this?

700
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got him

701
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
a Zune.

702
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Hi.

703
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And sure, you did just out of spite.

704
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Have you tried to install Vista yet?

705
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I believe if you did, you'll notice it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?

706
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total rip off of the

707
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.

708
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.

709
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?

710
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, and this was by, God, I'm sorry I closed the email.

711
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
God wrote that email?

712
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh my gosh, you are fucked, Loki.

713
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I closed your email, I'm sorry person.

714
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh wait, here it is.

715
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's by JG2000.

716
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh, not God, one of those.

717
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Phew, I was going to say, God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.

718
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm not fucked.

719
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No, but seriously though, I mean, let's talk about what they're doing to basically advertise

720
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the iMac right now.

721
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They're talking about how, oh yes, programs are so hard to install, but with Apple you

722
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
don't have to do anything because they're all preloaded on there for you.

723
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Well that's good that you've preloaded the software that will actually run on a Mac versus

724
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and

725
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we're not talking about Doom 2 or stuff like that.

726
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh goody, Prey plays on there, wonderful.

727
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.

728
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it

729
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
based on colors or flavors as I should put it.

730
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Who cares what color the damn system is?

731
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If I can't fucking install-

732
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Nintendo DS.

733
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.

734
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's retarded that they even sell it by colors.

735
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But to be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.

736
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I really don't.

737
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.

738
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It sucks, I'm not going to buy one, and you know what?

739
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.

740
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But you know what?

741
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac

742
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice.

743
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But whenever I guess the next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out, Mac's definitely not

744
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
going to be able to play it.

745
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Eh, I still like being bi with computers.

746
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop, works great.

747
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things.

748
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's just two emails, it's quick.

749
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh well the iDVD, it's so awesome, you know.

750
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
There's programs out there that use, they're on everything.

751
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because

752
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
all the programs are there for you, and you don't need to download any extra stuff.

753
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But you know what?

754
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
People like me, who aren't super basic with computers, like to have that option to customize

755
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
things, and you know, I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.

756
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So shall I move on to the next email then?

758
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes, please.

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay, hi guys.

760
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Hey, boobs please, thank you.

761
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm just writing to let you know.

762
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?

763
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It was me saying that because he said guys, and I'm like, no.

764
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
No.

765
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
BPC, thank you.

766
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I thought that was a request.

767
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm like, well if you really want, I'll just.

768
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Rob, no, I don't need that.

769
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Anyway, I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting

770
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.

771
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
No, thank you.

772
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm studying abroad from my junior year of high school in Italy right now.

773
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Lucky.

774
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.

775
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.

776
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They never fail to disappoint.

777
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And they never fail to disappoint.

778
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
What?

779
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

780
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They never.

781
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Anyway.

782
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't think that was what they meant.

783
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't think that's what they meant.

784
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Chirp, chirp, chirp.

785
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Everything else is all positive.

786
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
What?

787
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Anyway.

788
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up

789
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
here and you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.

790
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint?

791
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I haven't put a review up yet.

792
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I should do that.

793
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Could you do that?

794
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Could you put a five.

795
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OLR never fails to disappoint.

796
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.

797
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Thank you.

798
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.

799
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I saw that.

800
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That was beautiful.

801
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, anyway.

802
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer and more specifically a

803
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Bimani fan care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn,

804
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the vagina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.

805
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you

806
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.

807
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.

808
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.

809
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I won't say last name unless he wants me to.

810
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
P.S.

811
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,400
I challenge Guy's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to

812
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,000
duel to the death over said throne at any time.

813
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky unwashed toilet.

814
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Okay, I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at

815
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Halo 2.

816
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,000
But what if you fail to disappoint?

817
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Then you lose.

818
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So hey, I'm really curious.

819
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Matthew, was that the name?

820
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah.

821
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Matthew, you're in Italy and that's okay.

822
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's pretty awesome.

823
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
First of all, listener base is international.

824
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Rock.

825
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan and I'm curious.

826
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What is the Bimani and arcade scene like over there?

827
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never

828
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
heard this confirmed.

829
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.

830
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Not Japan.

831
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, yeah, not Japan.

832
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, unless you count Ticket Games and Pachinko.

833
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Anyway.

834
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Japan has tons of arcades.

835
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Which I do.

836
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,440
Anyway, the last email tonight.

837
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,000
This is from Sakura Max.

838
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,960
Anime was created because we killed ourself because hot anime chicks don't exist in real

839
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
life.

840
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Okay.

841
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,060
I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.

842
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,600
I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth two weeks

843
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,480
ago reference to my email.

844
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Rita Dracer.

845
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,880
I recommend any MMOs, I already played Maplestory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy

846
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,040
Online, Fly FF, Gunbound, GunZ, and Ragnarok.

847
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,200
I think that's it.

848
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,520
Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.

849
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,400
Those guys' emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.

850
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,680
Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like...

851
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
I can't say I have.

852
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,120
Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.

853
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
No, seriously.

854
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
No, no, seriously.

855
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,280
I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is the side

856
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
I love.

857
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,720
But if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, World Peace,

858
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,520
I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, all these random things.

859
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
What's this guy saying?

860
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,300
He's like, I was once served in a tavern medium rare.

861
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,600
It's like poetry practically.

862
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
I love the signature best on this though.

863
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,280
Let me read this to you.

864
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,920
Zachary Maxx, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.

865
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,200
You get a gold star just for your closing to that email.

866
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
You can play Loki's game.

867
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Done.

868
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,760
Next, please.

869
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
All right.

870
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,600
Well, then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

871
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,640
Meanwhile, more news, and we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.

872
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,320
I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.

873
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,240
There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.

874
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,880
Robert Garcia, the man who brought us is Dan Hideki.

875
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Right.

876
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Yee-hoo!

877
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
I get that joke.

878
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,800
Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.

879
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,120
I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2, and this is, again, thanks

880
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,400
to the ESRB, who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.

881
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,040
The ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.

882
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,600
Of course, the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally

883
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,000
came out on the Neo Geo.

884
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Awesome.

885
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,480
You know what else it does?

886
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,840
It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.

887
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,320
They've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.

888
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,760
They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.

889
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,800
Make something new.

890
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,760
Weren't Neo Geo games supposed to come to Virtual Console anyway?

891
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
That's not new.

892
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,240
That's old shit, again.

893
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,280
There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.

894
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,040
That was new, and it was really good.

895
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, well, one game.

896
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,480
I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.

897
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:24,280
All right, well, anyway, so that's an Art of Fighting.

898
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,040
Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to

899
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
the DS.

900
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,920
Yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on that screen.

901
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Yay.

902
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,160
Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.

903
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,280
Exactly.

904
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,440
Don't die.

905
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,440
It's going to feature wonderful tracks like the Super Mario Brothers theme, as well as

906
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:55,560
classical tunes like Flight of the Bumblebee, and let's see, some J-pop songs like Dance

907
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,760
2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.

908
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that

909
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,600
song that goes, I don't want to work.

910
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
I just want to bang on Z-Drum all day.

911
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
You know that song?

912
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,040
No.

913
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,880
Never mind.

914
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,120
We'll just clip that out of the audio archive.

915
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,840
We'll just make that an edit.

916
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,160
No.

917
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,760
Well, I don't know.

918
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,320
Is there any fun peripheral to come with it, or are they just doing the Leap Beat Agents

919
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,760
thing where you just tap on the thing?

920
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,200
The Leap Beat Agents thing.

921
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,240
It's kind of boring to me.

922
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,020
Well, there is actually something that might not be so boring, because I think this is

923
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,800
really cool.

924
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:52,040
There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious, about a person jailed for

925
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,320
the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack.

926
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:06,580
So it's a shooter that's like House of the Dead, and what's that other one?

927
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,320
Like the Ghost Squad.

928
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Like a light gun shooter.

929
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,800
Yeah, it's a light gun shooter, but you're using your stylus.

930
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,880
So you shoot zombies dead with the power of tapping.

931
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,760
Like point blank on the DS, right?

932
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah, like that.

933
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,760
And you also have multiple possible endings depending on which way you do it, so that's

934
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,920
pretty cool.

935
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,280
I like Killing the Undead.

936
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,560
You know, there's a new game, and I'm thinking it's probably the same thing.

937
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:43,240
It's actually coming out in June called Touch the Dead, which I think may be the US version

938
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,920
of Dead and Furious.

939
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,120
They will have to change that name.

940
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Touch the Dead.

941
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,800
Yes, that is the actual name.

942
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
That's actually what Sony was inviting everyone to do at their God of War II press conference,

943
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
to Touch the Dead.

944
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
They asked you to eat stuff out of it.

945
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,680
Apparently, the goat was emptied out, and they had some fake stuff, or some sort of

946
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,440
dish I guess that's like intestines in there.

947
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Awful.

948
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
It's so disgusting.

949
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,160
Apparently, it came from a butcher making that okay, because it's from a butcher.

950
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,880
Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?

951
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,680
Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.

952
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,760
Well, you can actually buy horse meat on the market.

953
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,860
They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.

954
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,280
They sell horse meat for international consumption.

955
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,480
I know, and I really want some.

956
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,880
Anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have, and they were doing all the jokes.

957
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,120
This really gets my goat.

958
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,080
This is nothing to lose your head over.

959
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,560
Gotta love the internet.

960
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,680
The Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly

961
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,160
because they open it up and free and all that stuff.

962
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,200
One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put

963
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,880
gay marriage in the game.

964
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,520
They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.

965
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,440
In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're

966
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,840
not going to have marriage in the game at all.

967
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
It's stupid.

968
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
Why would you want marriage in the game?

969
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,520
In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.

970
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,280
It was completely pointless.

971
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,360
You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.

972
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
This is stupid.

973
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,720
I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.

974
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,360
You actually could share your hit points.

975
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,320
You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.

976
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,480
There are also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody

977
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,040
else.

978
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,620
On the private server I played on, the mods that actually have it were in the game.

979
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:40,240
It was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.

980
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,720
If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you could marry anything, including

981
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,600
the villains and creatures that you're fighting.

982
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,320
You would cast a spell and you'd be like- I married a zombie.

983
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
I married the rabbit.

984
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,680
No, I'm going to kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.

985
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,560
No, it's like the end of Shaun of the Dead.

986
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,440
But I still have the ring.

987
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
He's my husband.

988
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
Wow.

989
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,080
Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that the Lords of the Ring Online, they

990
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,840
decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the

991
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,940
original books.

992
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:19,020
Although they had some inter-special dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were

993
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,160
going to have that.

994
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,400
There was no mention in the books ever of two males or two females marrying, so they

995
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
weren't going to put it in the game.

996
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,720
You know the elves are doing it.

997
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
But who knows?

998
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,120
They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull

999
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,840
the marriage option all together.

1000
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,320
And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining the Lords of the Ring Online,

1001
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,800
you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game because the game

1002
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,300
sucks a lot.

1003
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,320
If you want to play Lords of the Ring Online, just go play World of Warcraft, seriously.

1004
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,360
Did you say Lords of the Ring?

1005
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
I don't know.

1006
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,360
It's the Lord of the Rings.

1007
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
You've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.

1008
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,540
Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.

1009
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,540
That's their problem.

1010
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,680
It's a load balancing issue.

1011
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:06,760
Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever

1012
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,440
you want in the game.

1013
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,640
Actually we have another announcement speaking of marriages.

1014
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,340
Okay.

1015
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,080
This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.

1016
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,600
His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today and she said yes, and they're getting

1017
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,880
married in an anime con.

1018
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,120
Are they listening to the show?

1019
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
I believe so.

1020
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,000
Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.

1021
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,640
This is don't give a shit night.

1022
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:40,240
I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards, especially Loki.

1023
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,200
I just got us on a PM, just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a

1024
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
dump right now.

1025
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,840
Did he get married to him?

1026
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,400
This is about marriage right now.

1027
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,920
Oh my God, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.

1028
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,020
Does this show cause people to want to release or something?

1029
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,020
It's possible.

1030
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,020
Okay.

1031
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,360
Congratulations to Ranma's friend because that's awesome.

1032
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,760
And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still horse from California screaming.

1033
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,920
And congratulations to your other friend's pals.

1034
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
That's amazing.

1035
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Awesome.

1036
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,600
Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version because

1037
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,560
the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created causing the

1038
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,080
game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.

1039
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,000
But as you're probably listening to this podcast now or tomorrow if you're listening to it

1040
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,160
live, there will be a patch.

1041
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:48,440
So yay, your expansion will work as it should have when you first downloaded it.

1042
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,600
Had they tested the damn game, tested the game.

1043
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
That's very important.

1044
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,680
Don't just release his shit and patch it later.

1045
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,160
That's all I got.

1046
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,040
All right.

1047
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Anyway.

1048
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,360
Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about because what?

1049
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,440
It's the theme.

1050
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
It really is.

1051
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,800
Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.

1052
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,400
Well, just because I hate Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, because I know people, I had an ex who

1053
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,040
would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.

1054
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,520
And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool.

1055
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,240
And I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.

1056
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,920
But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like

1057
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,360
five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.

1058
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:46,960
So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed in the US and in Europe until

1059
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,600
first quarter of 2008.

1060
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
So yeah.

1061
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:58,840
And in other news, RicePrinceOfAllCosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.

1062
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,320
You guys are so freaking mature.

1063
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,720
I was just picking that up.

1064
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,720
Mature.

1065
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:15,920
Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.

1066
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Dear God, why?

1067
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,240
That game is shit on ice.

1068
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,640
I actually like that game.

1069
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,040
Exactly why I used that transition.

1070
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.

1071
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,440
Well, I think, okay, because I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind

1072
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,920
of loose and just you running around.

1073
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Damn it.

1074
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,040
Loose like the bowels?

1075
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,360
I should have thought that up before I said that.

1076
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,080
They were not terrible, okay.

1077
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,240
There was not much there but battle system and so I grew to like it because I played

1078
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,240
it too much.

1079
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
So now I like the universe.

1080
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
I think I remember correctly.

1081
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,480
I don't know if it was something limited or whatever, but I think that you can get this

1082
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,040
game for like 20 bucks now, which I mean for that price is not that bad.

1083
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,600
I mean, especially when you consider it does have a single player game portion of it.

1084
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:00,080
I mean, so you are getting an actual RPG, which for 20 bucks, that's not bad at all.

1085
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:07,640
And this is what you do in said RPG, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y.

1086
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,880
That batch of monsters is dead.

1087
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,880
Let's go to the next zone.

1088
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,880
Just like every other bow I've ever played.

1089
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,200
X, X, Y, X, X, Y.

1090
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,960
It's like all you did in the whole game.

1091
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
That's three buttons.

1092
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Most RPGs have one attack.

1093
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,960
So Phantasy Star universe is getting an expansion, it's called Ambition of the Illuminous and

1094
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,500
I have to confess the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said abortion

1095
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,000
of the illuminous.

1096
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,120
Like I said, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.

1097
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
I actually read that.

1098
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,640
I was like, what?

1099
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,840
Abortion of the illuminous?

1100
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:43,240
And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous and yeah, that's the title and there's going

1101
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,960
to be some new weapon types, Medug, Shadug and Whip.

1102
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,320
And also there'll be new photon arts and yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's going

1103
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
to be new planets as well.

1104
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,380
I don't see how there couldn't be.

1105
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,440
If you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.

1106
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,320
If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're going to have to buy a new disc, which

1107
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,160
seems weird because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.

1108
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,420
I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello, oh well.

1109
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,440
So there it is, abortion of the illuminous coming soon.

1110
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
Abortion of the illuminous.

1111
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:24,720
That's so wrong, but anyways, now the brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today

1112
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:32,520
and if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard

1113
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:40,000
drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could of course hack your current drive

1114
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,680
for say about $80 and get 120GB as well.

1115
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:51,960
And this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program

1116
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,760
of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things, you can create your

1117
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,200
own 120GB drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.

1118
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,600
I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there

1119
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,100
without having to hack the whole drive apart, which I'm sure someone can create if it's

1120
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,100
not already available, to just do that.

1121
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,560
Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.

1122
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:25,120
Why they don't have that anyways is beyond me.

1123
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,740
But there you go, save $100.

1124
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,000
If you're not going to buy an Elite system and just want a larger hard drive, might as

1125
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
well.

1126
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,200
All right, hacking and cracking.

1127
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,560
Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the

1128
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,720
internet and sometimes she stumbles upon to a website that she wants to share with all

1129
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,860
of you.

1130
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:54,680
It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.

1131
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:04,920
The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.

1132
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:12,320
It's a real life comics and from what I understand, he used to I think buy comics from my husband

1133
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,320
at the GameStop.

1134
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,440
He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.

1135
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,880
Yeah, okay, well he was local then, but it's a pretty cool webcomic as you check it out.

1136
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:28,800
The URL is reallifecomics.com, so it's funny, it's good.

1137
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,520
All right.

1138
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,920
I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.

1139
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Yeah, cool.

1140
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Over in Folsom.

1141
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Really?

1142
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,600
Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time and then I saw a picture of him on his site

1143
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
like whoa, that guy.

1144
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,120
Did we ever run into each other playing DDR back in the day?

1145
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,840
Did you play at Folsom?

1146
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,520
We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.

1147
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
Jeez.

1148
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Years ago.

1149
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
I wondered, do I know you?

1150
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,800
2001, did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?

1151
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
Back in the day, yeah.

1152
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
Wasn't that Scat?

1153
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
That was Scat.

1154
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Sacramento's cosplaying tournament.

1155
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Oh, God.

1156
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,800
Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.

1157
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,600
I started playing in 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.

1158
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,760
Oh, funny.

1159
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,760
Small world.

1160
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,760
Small world, jeez.

1161
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,760
Yeah, exactly.

1162
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,480
Small is my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives

1163
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,840
down my street, also happens to be in Denmark.

1164
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Very strange.

1165
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
And they meet and have lunch.

1166
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,680
All right, well, it is a small world and we want to open up the world to call our show

1167
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,080
right now on the Skype line.

1168
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,000
If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always

1169
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,480
give us a call on the old telephone.

1170
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:40,320
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll take our calls on Skype.

1171
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,800
And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, you always go, why is it the same

1172
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,200
people calling into the show every week?

1173
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, hey, it's an open line, all I got to do is give us a call Sunday.

1174
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,400
I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific time, you

1175
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,120
can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.

1176
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,560
So there you have it, 8.30 Pacific time.

1177
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

1178
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,560
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1179
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,560
Who's this?

1180
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
Hello.

1181
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,200
This is the dead goat from the God of War story.

1182
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.

1183
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,720
Dead goat, do you have a name?

1184
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,200
My name's Bill.

1185
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,160
Well, hi, Bill, I'm really sorry to hear about this.

1186
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,780
I mean, gosh, what are your thoughts on being used as a dead carcass to promote God of War

1187
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,640
II?

1188
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,640
I don't know.

1189
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:37,480
Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.

1190
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,300
But I mean, some goats just get milked and are turned into goat milk, and some goats

1191
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,040
get turned into burgers in some countries, but you get to be a promotional icon for God

1192
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,040
of War II.

1193
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,040
So that's kind of awesome, isn't it?

1194
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,320
Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.

1195
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,400
I thought that was kind of gross.

1196
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,640
But you got to hang out with topless women.

1197
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,440
I couldn't do anything with them.

1198
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,840
None of them were into goats.

1199
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,840
It made me so wack.

1200
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:16,040
Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, dead goat, Bill?

1201
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,560
I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.

1202
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,960
They want me to tell you to buy God of War II if you haven't.

1203
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,680
Well, I will definitely have to consider that.

1204
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,680
I mean, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our stations.

1205
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,880
Especially from beyond the grave.

1206
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,280
So shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.

1207
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,120
Well, thanks for letting me call in.

1208
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,840
I love listening to your show.

1209
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
No problem.

1210
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,240
Actually, I have another question.

1211
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,240
Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary

1212
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,240
episode?

1213
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:58,440
I'll get back to office, so I don't want to talk about it on the air.

1214
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,440
All right.

1215
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,080
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1216
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Okay.

1217
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
Let us know, Bill.

1218
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,080
Okay.

1219
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Thanks, Ryan.

1220
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,080
All right.

1221
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Take care.

1222
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
Bye.

1223
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,080
Bye.

1224
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,080
Bye.

1225
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:17,080
Oh my God, there's tons of stupid people on the internet.

1226
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,680
What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?

1227
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,440
That's what I want to know.

1228
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,680
How do you get Skype in the graveyard?

1229
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,960
I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, tucking into a mic.

1230
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,360
We need to Photoshop that.

1231
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,680
They're going, crap, the levels are off.

1232
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,920
We need to adjust the microphone.

1233
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
That needs to be imagined.

1234
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
It's the guy who called it.

1235
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
It's the Raven's Dolphin.

1236
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?

1237
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,280
Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?

1238
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
I called it.

1239
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,280
It's a chat room.

1240
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,280
What?

1241
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,280
It's a shit show.

1242
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,280
This is the what?

1243
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
I called it.

1244
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,840
You don't give a shit tonight.

1245
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
I know.

1246
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Well, we don't give a shit.

1247
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,560
Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?

1248
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,440
What do you call tonight?

1249
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I'm sorry, Rob.

1250
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm pissing you off.

1251
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,560
I just want to say I love it.

1252
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,960
I love the tone.

1253
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,200
You love the tone tonight?

1254
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,840
Yeah, I love it.

1255
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,480
I love that you go like, Kane and Lynch is going to the PS3.

1256
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,400
I just don't give a shit.

1257
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,640
Well, I don't know.

1258
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,440
Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.

1259
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,560
Maybe, I don't know, maybe Dark Soccer and I rode California Screamin' one too many times

1260
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,920
and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.

1261
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
I don't know.

1262
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,920
That made me laugh.

1263
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,880
Everyone was like, oh my God, Kane and Lynch is going multi platform and you can go like,

1264
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
I don't give a shit.

1265
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,440
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

1266
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,440
What else is on your mind?

1267
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
Gaming-wise this week, Raven's Dolphin?

1268
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,000
Well, the Xbox Elite came out today and I think they're last.

1269
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The what came out?

1270
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
The Elite.

1271
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,200
Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.

1272
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,240
Did anybody, well, Dark Soccer, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.

1273
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,240
Yes, I did.

1274
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,920
Now, what made you want to get one?

1275
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
It wasn't me.

1276
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
It was Dan because our old one died.

1277
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Oh, that's right.

1278
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
You guys had no one that died.

1279
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,440
Okay, well, I can see that.

1280
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,400
Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?

1281
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,960
When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from

1282
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
them.

1283
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,840
So, I would like someone else to get an Elite.

1284
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,840
All right.

1285
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,700
Well, Raven's Dolphin, you're just not interested.

1286
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,880
You don't think there's nothing.

1287
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,280
Do you own an Xbox 360 regular?

1288
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,280
Of course, yes.

1289
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,880
I own a premium with the nice chrome thing, but I'm not going to taunt you with that.

1290
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,640
Well, that's, yeah, I only have a mediocre core system, but that's all right.

1291
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,080
I'm not hurting or anything.

1292
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,880
So you're just thinking the Elite's not worth the upgrade because you already own one?

1293
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,560
Yeah, but I feel like, well, hold, now let me hear.

1294
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,380
I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.

1295
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,080
The DS Lite was an upgrade?

1296
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,560
Yeah, I had a DS Lite and I upgraded to a DS Lite.

1297
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,560
I thought that was the world.

1298
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,280
Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing, but with the, you know,

1299
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,760
with the Xbox 360 Elite, there's not really, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not

1300
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,840
that much new to it.

1301
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,840
You know what I mean?

1302
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,000
How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?

1303
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,400
I can't.

1304
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
That's why I don't care.

1305
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
Well, then there you go.

1306
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,400
All right.

1307
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
All right, let's go.

1308
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,400
Thank you.

1309
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,400
No problem.

1310
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
One more thing?

1311
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,200
This is a great show.

1312
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,520
I hope you do another bullshit episode.

1313
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,520
We'll see.

1314
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
We'll see what kind of mood we're in next week.

1315
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
All right.

1316
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,520
Thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin.

1317
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Bye.

1318
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
Later.

1319
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,520
All right.

1320
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
That was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call.

1321
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,840
Let's go back to the phones and take another call.

1322
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,840
If you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

1323
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
Hello.

1324
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

1325
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
Who's this?

1326
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,840
Hi.

1327
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
This is Chris.

1328
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
Hi, Chris.

1329
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
What's on your mind, buddy?

1330
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Oh, wow.

1331
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,720
First of all, I just wanted to say I'm glad to show.

1332
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,320
I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.

1333
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,720
I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.

1334
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Welcome to the live experience.

1335
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,280
Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.

1336
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
Ah, congratulations.

1337
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,280
That's right.

1338
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,200
Sundays are big days for Wiis.

1339
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,960
Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buyer Toys R Us was going to have

1340
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
them?

1341
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Is that how you got them?

1342
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,960
No.

1343
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,960
I actually had a friend from work.

1344
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,240
He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wiis in today.

1345
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,840
That was the most they had ever coming at one time.

1346
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
Very cool.

1347
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
Thanks a lot.

1348
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,400
Did you buy any games for the Wii?

1349
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,720
No, I didn't.

1350
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,080
I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe

1351
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,080
rent something.

1352
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,080
I wasn't really interested in that.

1353
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:36,280
I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago, and now they have 45 Wiis

1354
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,280
coming out.

1355
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,280
I said they were competing.

1356
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,280
Okay.

1357
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
That's a good thought.

1358
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:45,720
Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wiis, maybe to have a big push

1359
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,840
the day the Elite came out?

1360
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,800
That way, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually

1361
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,800
have Wiis in stock.

1362
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,440
Maybe I should get that instead.

1363
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,440
No.

1364
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,440
No, you don't think that would happen?

1365
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,440
I don't think so.

1366
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,440
All right.

1367
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,440
Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?

1368
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,440
No.

1369
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,040
I kind of feel they did a student out there.

1370
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,880
It really isn't a real successor to the original one.

1371
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,720
So you think that was kind of more of a response to the PlayStation 3 going, well, we have

1372
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,720
HDMI, MMMMS.

1373
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,840
So the Xbox 360 and Microsoft was like, well, I guess we'll just put this out there and

1374
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,080
make Sony shut up.

1375
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,080
Yeah.

1376
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,520
I pretty much feel that that's what they all did.

1377
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,880
Actually, one thing I want to say is because of Ken Kutaragi stepping down, but did Loki

1378
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,360
have to think about that?

1379
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,120
What does Loki think of Ken Kutaragi stepping down?

1380
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,080
It's a step in the right direction, that's for sure.

1381
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:45,760
The goat thing, though, is a step in the wrong direction, but I don't know.

1382
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,680
Getting rid of him talking, that's definitely a good way to go.

1383
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,800
But what about all the good things Kutaragi did?

1384
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,880
I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?

1385
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,560
I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.

1386
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:00,600
He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night,

1387
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:05,680
is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.

1388
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,840
Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?

1389
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,800
I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but at some point you've got

1390
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
to put them down.

1391
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,360
And what about all the great things that goat did?

1392
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,520
No, it's they had to put them down.

1393
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,120
Rice Prince of all cosmos in the chat room says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.

1394
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,920
Sounds like a great idea.

1395
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,680
All right, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?

1396
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,880
No, that's basically it.

1397
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,560
Actually, I want to know which game you think I should get for the Wii.

1398
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,120
You don't own any games yet for the Wii, and you want to know which game to get.

1399
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,600
Well, let's see, do you own a PlayStation 2?

1400
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
Yeah.

1401
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,360
What's your favorite game on PlayStation 2?

1402
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,760
I would say 2DX.

1403
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,160
Ah, sure.

1404
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
You're a Bamani fan.

1405
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,520
Well, definitely, you've got to get DDR Hottest Party when it comes out then on the Wii.

1406
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,480
In the meantime, I would say check out Zelda Twilight Princess or Super Paper Mario are

1407
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,800
two of my favorites right now.

1408
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,920
Anybody care to chime in?

1409
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,560
What Wii game should Chris get?

1410
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,560
Excite Truck.

1411
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,560
If you like Wii.

1412
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,640
Excite Truck's not bad.

1413
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,880
I was going to say Excite Truck 2.

1414
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,880
Does it use a controller?

1415
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:21,080
I want to be able to use the Wii remote a little bit more.

1416
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,240
Yes, all those games.

1417
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,480
Not so much Super Paper Mario, I mean it does incorporate it a little bit, you do like thuds

1418
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,320
by shaking the thing, but yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wii remote like a normal controller,

1419
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,960
but you steer with it, like you turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.

1420
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,320
And then of course Legend of Zelda's all about using that, like you swing it like a sword

1421
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,520
and all that crazy stuff.

1422
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
Okay.

1423
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
All right, thanks.

1424
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
All right, no problem, Chris.

1425
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,520
Thanks for calling the show, and call us back sometime.

1426
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,760
All right, take care.

1427
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Later.

1428
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,760
We like new colors.

1429
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,360
This is a good show.

1430
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,760
We need to take vacations more often, because we get new guests in the studio, and we get

1431
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,760
new callers.

1432
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,840
Not that we don't appreciate the old callers, too.

1433
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,480
Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.

1434
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,360
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1435
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,880
It's Legend of Zaku.

1436
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,080
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1437
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,360
What's on your mind, buddy?

1438
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,360
Nothing much.

1439
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,680
Just coming back from Queens, playing Papa Nade, and pump it up.

1440
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,880
I love people calling this show.

1441
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
I go, hey, what's up?

1442
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
Ah, nothing.

1443
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,720
I just thought I'd call to let you know.

1444
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
I did stuff today.

1445
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
No, I'm just kidding.

1446
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,880
What do you think of tonight's show?

1447
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,720
Any stories you want to comment on?

1448
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,000
You know that they are happening.

1449
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,840
You know it's official now that the Supernova 2 test location has already been announced

1450
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,840
for next month.

1451
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,360
Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.

1452
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,720
Actually, that was my post.

1453
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Was it?

1454
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,720
I don't know.

1455
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,720
Yeah, I configured it.

1456
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,720
Maybe you submitted it, and we ran it.

1457
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,720
I don't know.

1458
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,720
I did.

1459
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,720
Well, good.

1460
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,320
Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us, and like

1461
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,440
two Japanese Bimani sites linked to that story.

1462
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,840
So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.

1463
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,840
So good job.

1464
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,840
Yay.

1465
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,840
All right.

1466
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,840
Well, tell us.

1467
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,160
How did you come across this information about the location test?

1468
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:15,360
No, just a random post from other Bimani sites, Bimani style, Air Japan, all the other stuff.

1469
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:24,240
Even the original posting in ride19.com, the place for the guy that had tech at Brunswick

1470
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,640
Zone, I got it from there as well.

1471
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,640
All right.

1472
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,320
Since I know you're such a hardcore Bimani and music game fan because you've been listening

1473
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:38,000
to us since the day when that's all we talked about on this show, what do you hope is the

1474
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,580
number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?

1475
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,760
Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1?

1476
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Unlockables.

1477
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,760
Pretty much.

1478
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,200
You know how DDR Max was back in the day.

1479
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,520
It only had like 60 songs.

1480
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,280
It didn't have any returning songs.

1481
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,480
It just had brand new songs.

1482
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,800
And there wasn't really that much.

1483
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:06,520
And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and added new ones and had an unlock system.

1484
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
Okay.

1485
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,520
I got you.

1486
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,040
And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards, was

1487
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
unlocking all this stuff.

1488
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,040
Yeah.

1489
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,040
I mean, think about it.

1490
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,120
If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami just to

1491
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:23,560
gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.

1492
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,760
And we already know the outcome of that.

1493
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,120
I guess so if we're getting a Supernova 2.

1494
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,120
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,120
All right.

1496
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,600
That and hopefully, you know, they are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar

1497
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,080
to EMUs, you know, something that's not necessarily connected online.

1498
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,040
Like a card system like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.

1499
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,040
Build your own dancer.

1500
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,480
It'd be fun.

1501
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,480
Not even that.

1502
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,400
Just track scores, but, you know, battle people and stuff like that.

1503
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,520
Buy hot pants for your character.

1504
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,440
Hopefully, Konami would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent

1505
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,440
in Supernova this morning.

1506
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,960
Totions yelling link support in chat room.

1507
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,960
Yes.

1508
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
I hope they found a good work-around.

1509
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,960
That's all I'm saying.

1510
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,960
Let's see what else is being said in chat here.

1511
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,360
GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bahmani.

1512
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,040
Well, that too.

1513
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,400
I mean, also like revival songs that weren't even, that haven't been revived in a long

1514
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,400
time.

1515
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,200
Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.

1516
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,960
I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.

1517
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,600
You know, stuff like that.

1518
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,920
Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bahmani, Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.

1519
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,360
Well, what do you expect?

1520
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,160
Hey, it ruined my life too.

1521
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
That's how I met Dark Sakura.

1522
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,960
Hugs and kisses and bunnies.

1523
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,960
Love you, Rob.

1524
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,400
What?

1525
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,800
She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.

1526
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,120
Yes I do.

1527
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
Let's see.

1528
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,320
James Patrick says, DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.

1529
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
DDR is pretty big.

1530
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,320
What?

1531
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,320
500?

1532
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
Really?

1533
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Where's that sales figure come from?

1534
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,720
I'll be damned if it reaches a million.

1535
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,720
That's a lot.

1536
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,720
And we don't even know when they're jumping.

1537
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,960
I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know,

1538
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,080
for any future DDR mixes, obviously I don't see that happening now since they're going

1539
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,760
to hold onto the PS2 as long as, as long as possible.

1540
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,200
There's a big install phase backing it up.

1541
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
All right.

1542
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,640
Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go, but how far are you going to drive out to the

1543
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,400
test of Supernova 2?

1544
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,400
I don't know.

1545
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,400
Maybe.

1546
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,800
I don't even know if I, I don't even know if I have vacation time, but I'll probably

1547
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,760
get, I'll probably get the videos, you know, eventually and I'll see.

1548
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,520
And hopefully once, once Supernova 2 comes in the city, then I'll be able to decide for

1549
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,520
myself.

1550
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,520
All right.

1551
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,520
Well, good luck with that.

1552
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,520
Have fun.

1553
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,520
Okay.

1554
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
All right.

1555
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
Later, dude.

1556
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,520
Bye.

1557
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Ah, Zaku's hilarious.

1558
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
He's got the best, best voice.

1559
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,400
Yeah, this is Colin, talk about Supernova.

1560
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:06,120
You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music

1561
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
games.

1562
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,480
You know, I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow like

1563
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,760
no rules.

1564
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,000
When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like

1565
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,240
when you meet them.

1566
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,440
No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York city.

1567
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,840
He's, he's a good kid.

1568
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,760
We just give him a hard time on the show because he's been listening for a long time and we

1569
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,760
can.

1570
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,320
Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York city

1571
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,680
the week of June 9th.

1572
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,760
That's all I'm saying for now.

1573
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,040
I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.

1574
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,080
June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York city, which is good.

1575
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,080
I love New York city.

1576
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,080
Love it, love it, love it.

1577
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,560
So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of

1578
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,880
make a, make an appearance.

1579
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,280
And so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo world store with people just

1580
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,360
loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.

1581
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,400
All right.

1582
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,440
Let's see.

1583
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,960
The Rob Dean chat says Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.

1584
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,480
We'd love to do that if we had the money.

1585
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,200
I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?

1586
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,320
Yeah, they'll be there.

1587
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
They're going to ASEN.

1588
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,680
So the OLR lesbians will be there.

1589
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,200
So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.

1590
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,880
I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN, so look for them.

1591
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,160
They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.

1592
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,160
We'll be in front of me.

1593
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,160
Oh yeah.

1594
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,240
Hell, we should have announced that at the top of the show.

1595
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,280
Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.

1596
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,280
We did get confirmed for this year's FONOMAY.

1597
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:34,480
We're going to be doing a live show from FONOMAY, the Saturday of FONOMAY at 2 p.m.

1598
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,440
We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right, right?

1599
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,440
We only have the one, which is fine because we didn't really need two last year.

1600
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,760
Your panels were booked solid.

1601
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,760
Yeah, so.

1602
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
We're lucky to get a Saturday.

1603
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,760
Yeah, that's awesome.

1604
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
That's a good time.

1605
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,600
So Saturday at two, we'll be there taping one of our shows live, and for that reason

1606
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,800
we will not be live Memorial Day weekend because some folks will be staying at FONOMAY.

1607
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
I have other commitments.

1608
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,160
I'm going to be going to FONOMAY for like a day and a half, but then I have other commitments,

1609
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,160
so we'll see.

1610
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,160
All right.

1611
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,520
I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with

1612
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,720
the rest, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco

1613
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:16,360
I'm very excited about because that's a thing I'm like really into is bad movies like Rocky

1614
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,680
Horror and all that.

1615
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Excellent.

1616
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:24,560
So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, and let's ask right now if there's

1617
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,520
any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.

1618
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,460
Well, something interesting you should know.

1619
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:39,380
The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess, and a review on IGN saying

1620
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:44,720
that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the blue, was it the Blu-ray

1621
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,080
Java or whatever, the BD Java.

1622
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,320
It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.

1623
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:57,880
There used to be one for five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha.

1624
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,640
Some other fun stuff, I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend, but they had the announcement

1625
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:10,940
for Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, and it looks pretty fucking awesome, and of course

1626
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:18,320
Tom Clancy's End War, which is supposed to be an online persistent war, you're basically

1627
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,120
going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other.

1628
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,960
So, that's kind of neat, and let's see what else, oh, Lego Star Wars 2 and Saints Row

1629
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:36,480
have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both of

1630
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,920
those games are available for $29.99.

1631
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,480
Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.

1632
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,480
Saints Row is fucking awesome.

1633
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,000
I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game and I never bought it, so maybe

1634
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,400
I will now.

1635
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:52,480
There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disgaea are coming to the PS3.

1636
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,480
That's kind of interesting, I guess.

1637
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:58,160
I know it was a new Disgaea game coming out, I thought, or maybe that's called the stuff

1638
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,480
that I'm thinking.

1639
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:09,680
Let's see, what else do we have here?

1640
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,960
I think that was pretty much it.

1641
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
Yeah.

1642
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Alright.

1643
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,200
Dark Sakura, you got anything?

1644
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Any last minute stories?

1645
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,200
No.

1646
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
Oh, alright.

1647
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:24,000
I guess that does it then for tonight, so Warrior Bob, you got anything you'd like to

1648
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
read about?

1649
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,640
So the show I used to co-host, pressstart.thefighting.org.

1650
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,640
Are they still on?

1651
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,640
Yeah, they still are.

1652
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,640
I've just left.

1653
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,720
I Skype in now and again, but first I want to plug them second.

1654
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:44,080
I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week, so ha, that's

1655
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,080
our news.

1656
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,080
Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.

1657
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,360
Ah, yes, that's right.

1658
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,600
That's coming up, what, Friday, when they officially announced it?

1659
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Two days ago.

1660
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Oh, two days ago.

1661
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,600
I think so.

1662
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,040
Ah, yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.

1663
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,080
Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st or,

1664
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
you know, weird.

1665
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,680
Oh, I think they said it'll be done when it's done.

1666
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,760
They want to make a good game, and if it takes that long, it'll take that long.

1667
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,760
I guess so.

1668
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,400
This game better do my dishes, that's all I have to say, it better be that freaking

1669
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,400
good.

1670
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,400
I mean, they named it after the development time.

1671
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,400
That was innovative, right?

1672
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,400
I guess so.

1673
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Alright.

1674
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,400
I guess that's it.

1675
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1676
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,600
Here, Bob, thanks so much for being here, and I hope you enjoyed your first show.

1677
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,800
The only guest who ever brought their own mic, that's pretty impressive, oh, wait, I

1678
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,080
take that back, because I believe DDR Angel actually brought this mic when she came with

1679
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,080
it.

1680
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,080
So you're the second guest to ever bring their own mic.

1681
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,880
Well, now that one's Dark Sakura's mic, and this one's still mine.

1682
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,880
That's true.

1683
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,420
She ended up giving hers away, and we haven't heard from her in a long time, I hope she's

1684
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,420
doing well.

1685
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,800
But yeah, you got your mic there, so anyway, thanks for being on the show.

1686
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,800
Thank you for having me.

1687
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
It's been a pleasure.

1688
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,720
Awesome radio voice, chat loves you guys, chat room loves you and wants you to come

1689
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,720
back.

1690
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,720
I love chat.

1691
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,720
Make sure you do come back soon.

1692
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,720
Thank you very much.

1693
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,720
No problem.

1694
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:57,720
Final thought.

1695
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,720
Oh, that was my final thought.

1696
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,720
Thank you for having me.

1697
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,720
All right.

1698
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,720
There you go.

1699
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,720
Good enough.

1700
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,720
My final thought.

1701
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:10,880
My final thought is garlic is delicious and keeps the vampires away.

1702
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,920
Loki, your final thought.

1703
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:19,720
Apparently Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and Starcraft 2 as well.

1704
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,600
Wouldn't that be one and the same?

1705
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,880
No, they're going to be two different games.

1706
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,960
My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.

1707
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,760
It costs money and I don't have money.

1708
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,760
That's my new final thought is I want you to open a laser tag arena.

1709
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,000
Me too.

1710
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,240
Dark Sakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.

1711
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,240
Reject false icons.

1712
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,180
It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.

1713
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,080
It's good to see it make a comeback.

1714
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1715
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,600
Without you guys, we would die.

1716
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,440
Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.

1717
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,320
It's you guys that help support us.

1718
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,040
If you like what you hear, all we ask is to tell two friends.

1719
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,720
They don't even have to be friends.

1720
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,720
Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to

1721
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,840
us and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world.

1722
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,160
If you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even

1723
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:23,460
more, you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or podcast

1724
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,640
alley or any of those sites that are like, hey, rate your favorite podcast because then

1725
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,240
we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people will bother to look at it.

1726
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:37,680
If you really, really like us and you can do it, you'll send us invitations to E3.

1727
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,680
That's also a good idea.

1728
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,440
On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.

1729
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,880
