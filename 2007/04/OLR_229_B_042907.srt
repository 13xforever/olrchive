00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,085

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Just head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com All the details are there.

4
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:53,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever program you use to get this program, like maybe iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show, there should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.

5
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.

6
00:00:56,411 --> 00:01:02,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course our chat room is over at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.

7
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always like to read your comments.

8
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the skyline will be open in the show a little later.

9
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:13,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The Eye Toy is no more, as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.

10
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:23,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out, and it's called just the Eye, not the Eye Toy, because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.

11
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And the camera will now, instead of taking a 320 by, or no,

12
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I think before, like, the camera was only taking, like, what, 300 by 200 pixels?

13
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was really small.

14
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:37,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.

15
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not bad.

16
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:39,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not HD, but that's not bad.

17
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 320 at twice that.

18
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:47,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye.

19
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess so.

20
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:49,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

21
00:01:50,736 --> 00:02:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.

22
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.

23
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:13,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

24
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:15,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this have anything to do with the...

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,022
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:47,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.

27
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:57,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it is going to use the iCamera, and it's going to be a card game.

28
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:58,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurrah!

29
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like $80 if this game is bundled in there, so...

30
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:13,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.

31
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.

32
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:23,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.

33
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks exactly the same to me.

34
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.

35
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff.

36
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

37
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted...

38
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:38,638
[SPEAKER_03]: The camera is better than the last camera.

39
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:41,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's just look at the examples here.

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not just saying, you know, that the eye toys suck.

41
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:48,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks.

42
00:03:50,109 --> 00:04:14,241
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, and, you know, this, hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special, you know, I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that, if that's, you know, actually what it can do, then great, you know, I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that, and according to this, I think you can, but if it does suck, I'm gonna be fucking pissed, again, but I'm not buying it.

43
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say, are you actually buying this to try it out?

44
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,503
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.

45
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy it, exactly.

46
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:30,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.

47
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very fucking lame.

48
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:37,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted that game to be so good and then it required the camera and I said, screw it.

49
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:42,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera, but I don't want to use it.

50
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's useless.

51
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously don't even want to play it.

52
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's useless.

53
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid.

54
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently in multiplayer, though, you get to see other people playing the game, which might be kind of funny.

55
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:52,412
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

56
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play it just so I can play it.

57
00:04:54,893 --> 00:05:05,557
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet, maybe somebody in chat can clarify, but if that's true, that you can play that by waving your arms and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing,

58
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:13,406
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube and we could all have a laugh.

59
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:17,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good use of the... You can already do that with DDR, though.

60
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,607
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good use of the Xbox 360 video game.

61
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I did show him the orange bat, by the way.

62
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:22,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

63
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:23,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

64
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,008
[SPEAKER_09]: The bat.

65
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,089
[SPEAKER_07]: That's old.

66
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:25,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the bat.

67
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:27,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you go to her house and play pinball?

68
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

70
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,251
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura invited me over and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games.

71
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:36,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance

72
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a very good joke.

73
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:07,464
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?

74
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:10,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.

75
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:11,668
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play Spider Woman.

76
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:13,008
[SPEAKER_02]: My word.

77
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:16,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

78
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:18,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinball's awesome.

79
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:21,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So, moving forward, shall I?

80
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,018
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.

81
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:38,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Hasbro actually is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game God, why?

82
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:49,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast Oh no And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us Our card crack!

83
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.

84
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:55,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.

85
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't play it very long.

86
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:57,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I started playing Magic again.

87
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:13,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I had my black-bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books, turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to... I just gave them away because they were... Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?

88
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you sell half of it?

89
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,958
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but... I sold what I could out of it, like my moxes.

90
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,198
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I go outdoors.

91
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:23,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold my moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.

92
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.

93
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerd alert!

94
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerd alert!

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

96
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This show has reached maximum nerd levels.

97
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:38,682
[SPEAKER_03]: The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get.

98
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:39,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that goes back a ways.

99
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:40,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that goes back a ways.

100
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:07,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same because the camera doesn't know any different.

101
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking camera.

102
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It sees a card and boom, works.

103
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:12,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask you about this.

104
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:15,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there.

105
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:26,652
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's really complicated to play the game because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated because otherwise it'll just recast the card because the game doesn't know.

106
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very fucking complicated to play and when I asked them, I'm like...

107
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?

108
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:36,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... What's the point of this game?

109
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... See, it's just... It's retarded.

110
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking tech demo.

111
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box, but the problem is...

112
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:48,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's thinking a little too far outside of the box.

113
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:53,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing to think outside the box if the box, you know, is made out of cardboard.

114
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:57,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.

115
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: All it's going to do, all it's really going to do is supplement, like, you know, if they want, let's say, for example, they want to take this and make, like, an official...

116
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:10,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Magic the Gathering, Game, The Judgment, or something like that.

117
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:16,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever, and it just enhances that.

118
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:24,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that, you can place them down and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.

119
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster!

120
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,817
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though...

121
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:37,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's going to give a shit, and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place.

122
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:43,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any other itoy game that's out on the market right now, because they're frustrating and don't work properly.

123
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:51,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give a shit when you can hack that thing, like people have hacked other games, to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in, so we can get our OLR game going.

124
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:56,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can see a little dancing Rob, whenever we put his cart down.

125
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

126
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so excited, I just can't hide it.

127
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:01,873
[SPEAKER_09]: That will go on YouTube.

128
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:08,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube, Sony is creating a service called iVio.

129
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:17,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a video sharing site in Japan, and of course, you know, it's something that's going to, hopefully, if PlayStation gets their way and Sony will compete against YouTube.

130
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now, but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.

131
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about it is that you can actually download PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.

132
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:37,229
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a mobile version of this service as well, and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.

133
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:45,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped, which is kind of funny.

134
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

135
00:10:46,669 --> 00:11:03,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that, oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation Eye, you'll also be able to upload those to the service, and then so you can hopefully someday download Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.

136
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.

137
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,341
[SPEAKER_03]: My homes, my homes, my homes.

138
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:09,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's definitely not in slow motion.

139
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, just... My lovely lady homes.

140
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Loki.

141
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So retarded.

142
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:17,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

143
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:22,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.

144
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,353
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually put out a new patent.

145
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.

146
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:32,236
[SPEAKER_02]: James Patrick in chat says, How is it a good idea?

147
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to YouTube.

148
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.

149
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:41,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Zing.

150
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:42,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

151
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:49,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so they have a brand new patent, and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.

152
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:56,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this basically is in layman's terms is it will actually use your console to have...

153
00:11:57,457 --> 00:12:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate with other devices like handheld devices so say for example I have a Playstation 3 although this isn't a Microsoft thing but say I had a Playstation 3 and it had this thing in it and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers but at the same time my game system is communicating to my PSP to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster so this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to I guess speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out you know

154
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,470
[SPEAKER_03]: More polygons and whatnot.

155
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Or full proteins!

156
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Goody, goody, goody!

157
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:32,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit.

158
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.

159
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I am damn well not wasting my console resources, wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.

160
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is like the original design for the cell processor, where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together, except that it works with things that aren't Sony-branded.

161
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

162
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:55,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

163
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:56,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

164
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is this Microsoft?

165
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:01,057
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Microsoft, right?

166
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:01,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is Microsoft.

167
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:14,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, basically, in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones and consoles, in a way that increases the processing power of all the connected devices.

168
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:17,967
[SPEAKER_03]: The more gaming components in the network, the more computing power is generated.

169
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So, can you imagine... So, it's Voltron.

170
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:25,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not gay and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.

171
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's Voltron!

172
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:29,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Vehicle Voltron.

173
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:31,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft has just patented Voltron.

174
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.

175
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:37,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is, it's Voltron.

176
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have theme music, it isn't Voltron.

177
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:40,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Vehicle Voltron.

178
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:41,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Vehicle Voltron.

179
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guess what?

180
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:44,550
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

181
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.

182
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:49,565
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot cooler.

183
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.

184
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, DarkSakura, a lot cooler.

185
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:53,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron!

186
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:54,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron.

187
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:54,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron.

188
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:58,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Voltron without a V. You can't make Voltron without Tron.

189
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Great minds.

190
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, three words for you.

191
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:02,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Great minds think like me.

192
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: End of line.

193
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:06,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

194
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Four words for you.

195
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Die in a fire.

196
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:15,962
[SPEAKER_07]: For people who don't know, Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever, which I have on Laserdisc and DVD.

197
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like the uber, uber Laserdisc that's like this big fat box of Tron.

198
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:27,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.

199
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,870
[SPEAKER_02]: This reminds me of something, if I may real quick.

200
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,170
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

201
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,071
[SPEAKER_02]: No, DarkSakura, trust me, this will have your blessing.

202
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:32,451
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

203
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does that have to do with Tron?

204
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Disney for not having the People Mover.

205
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:48,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, all because that stupid grad jumped off of it.

206
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the People Mover was only... Let's graduate high school and jump off the People Mover.

207
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:55,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron ride at Disneyland.

208
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you could go through, like, Tron, which was the coolest thing ever, and I believe Tim Curry narrated it, which makes it just double cool.

209
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:06,097
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they could do though?

210
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: The people movers actually just do the things together like a little track ride and have it enclosed.

211
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was called the Rocket Rods.

212
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, someone died on that one and they removed that as well.

213
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad and I rode on it in the back.

214
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:22,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some gaming.

215
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:27,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool because it was like the people movers except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.

216
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:27,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Same track.

217
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It went through the Tron thing too.

218
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like real fast.

219
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:31,889
[SPEAKER_03]: No narration.

220
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Tron.

221
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Tron.

222
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Sark is ready, are you?

223
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:11,222
[SPEAKER_07]: and so we're getting, oh sorry, another note to that was two classics returned this summer to the arcade, more data to be downloaded soon.

224
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.

225
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:17,147
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so freaking rad, I can't even contain myself.

226
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I found a Discs of Tron machine.

227
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:20,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games ever.

228
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an excellent game.

229
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:24,352
[SPEAKER_02]: The light cycles, that little cone thing, oh my god.

230
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:25,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Tron 2.0?

231
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:27,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I never did.

232
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, there's something that Dan downloaded a while back, and it was pretty fun.

233
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually just a light cycle game.

234
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I was about to say, the online one?

235
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the online light cycle game.

236
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:37,504
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty cool.

237
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:41,327
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, that Tron 2.0, though, was supposed to be like a big playthrough game.

238
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.

239
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?

240
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're a nerd?

241
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:52,795
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dan was using my laptop last, and, oh God.

242
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:53,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

243
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Tron is one year off from Prawn.

244
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:57,208
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

245
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know how everyone misspells porn?

246
00:16:58,668 --> 00:16:59,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Prawn.

247
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Tron.

248
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:01,689
[SPEAKER_09]: TR0N.

249
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:02,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Discs of prawn.

250
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, that's what DarkSakura denies having, is hard discs of prawn.

251
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:11,192
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

252
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:12,412
[SPEAKER_07]: End of line.

253
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:17,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, no, I pointed, I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?

254
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's like sitting here going, are you gonna cut her off yet with the next story?

255
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:24,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going, come on, Loki, get into your story.

256
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:24,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, it's my turn.

257
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:25,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

258
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

259
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,067
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

260
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

261
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:27,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to try that one time.

262
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:28,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work for you.

263
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:29,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for her.

264
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of fun.

265
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:31,372
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

266
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:38,158
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on the way.

267
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:45,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's one step above a rumor because Harmonix fans seem to call the first set of arcade packs before they came out.

268
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:47,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So this looks like it could be pretty...

269
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:52,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty true is that there are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.

270
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:59,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Pack 1 will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett, and Coach Ice by Audioslave.

271
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:06,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Content Pack 2 will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones, and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.

272
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:13,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And Content Pack 3 will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand, and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.

273
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,

274
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:19,307
[SPEAKER_02]: then fail.

275
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:22,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price they changed.

276
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had like these one packs that cost, you know, 200 points and these other packs that cost like, you know, 100 points?

277
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That would look kind of stupid.

278
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're going to be the same price, like it or not.

279
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:34,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody bought them.

280
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:35,038
[SPEAKER_09]: The market sustains it.

281
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:36,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

282
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:39,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.

283
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:39,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

284
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:40,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Ditto.

285
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:44,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.

286
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of rad.

287
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the one pack I really didn't want.

288
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:47,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't enjoy it.

289
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of those songs nearly as much as the others.

290
00:18:50,605 --> 00:19:02,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, there is a rumor that the Bioware sci-fi role-playing game, this phenomenal game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.

291
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

292
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's rumor mill, yada, yada, yada.

293
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:15,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually moved.

294
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

295
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:18,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say anything.

296
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say it's actually true?

297
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:21,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

298
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:23,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you know this?

299
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I heard about it before.

300
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's probably true.

301
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not done.

302
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:32,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

303
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:35,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming out right now, but definitely later.

304
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So September until you get your Mass Effect.

305
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:40,849
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.

306
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:41,910
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.

307
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:47,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at 2Human, delayed to, like, next year.

308
00:19:50,668 --> 00:20:03,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because their games division is actually reporting lower sales by 21%.

309
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they've had a...

310
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:17,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Drop from $402 million for this quarter last year to $315 million.

311
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's quite a bit.

312
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:24,824
[SPEAKER_07]: They're basically saying the revenues are actually down by $1.2 billion.

313
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:30,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that's not surprising.

314
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They've lost a lot of money before with their product.

315
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.

316
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:47,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter 2003.

317
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:49,555
[SPEAKER_09]: See, there's that shipped again.

318
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:51,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not sold, it's shipped.

319
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Shipped equals sitting on storage shelves collecting dust.

320
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:00,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But also during the same time, their operating losses fell by 20%.

321
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it's going to balance?

322
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,504
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll pull through.

323
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:08,325
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the resources.

324
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Microsoft.

325
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:10,386
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the power of gates.

326
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:12,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's tainted them.

327
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fine.

328
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be fine.

329
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3's on its way.

330
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:18,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo Wars.

331
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:19,011
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be fine.

332
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:19,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I see their parachutes.

333
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:20,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

334
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,894
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not going to help their situation though much.

335
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:24,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

336
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:33,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't have any sort of idea what's coming out the list of

337
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect for September as well.

338
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:39,717
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it from Gamefly!

339
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:40,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's September!

340
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:47,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were listing some other weird title called Beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out.

341
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever.

342
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't some little internet radio site somewhere mention that one once?

343
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:55,222
[SPEAKER_09]: We disavow all knowledge of that.

344
00:21:57,263 --> 00:22:00,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Loki's afraid of getting Namco'd by 9Microsoft.

345
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:01,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco is a verb now.

346
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:04,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

347
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:06,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of some site, somewhere.

348
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:10,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we wish would get Namcode is this, although I don't see how that's possible.

349
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:16,041
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox Live Marketplace recently.

350
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they are is they're 100 MS Point videos.

351
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:22,143
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.

352
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:28,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears of War.

353
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have one of these videos for each chapter.

354
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you could spend, what, about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.

355
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:46,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, except for the facts that YouTube and GameFAQs and many other gaming sites will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing!

356
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:57,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.

357
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:02,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell strategy guides.

358
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So should they stop publishing strategy guides since GameFAQ is out there?

359
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:17,271
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things that you can't really get online.

360
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:20,853
[SPEAKER_02]: and they make great coffee table books for the gamer.

361
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:21,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do.

362
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is, but a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of cool art and stuff.

363
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:34,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.

364
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:36,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.

365
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing with strategy guides.

366
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:39,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about these videos, though.

367
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:48,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay, because if there's suckers out there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're gonna sell it, and that's just gonna motivate them to make more.

368
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:57,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna say a preemptive F you to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy-type videos for free.

369
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,430
Hmm.

370
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kanan Lynch and Crossfire.

371
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

372
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:19,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but, well, news to me, but they are now coming out in both systems.

373
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why this is a big surprise, because, I mean, how many games like before came out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?

374
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:29,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.

375
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:30,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a fuck anyways?

376
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:37,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.

377
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:41,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Heavenly Sword, ooh.

378
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:45,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, whatever.

379
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing exclusive things.

380
00:24:55,595 --> 00:25:04,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's been a lot of rah-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May Cry's coming out on 360, blah-blah-blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's working the other way.

381
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

382
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just really... It's not surprising, though.

383
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:13,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just... Why would you publish something for one system?

384
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:14,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one system?

385
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless... I don't know.

386
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why you would just do that.

387
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:22,506
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?

388
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:22,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

389
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:24,041
[SPEAKER_03]: More people.

390
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it is only a few million more, more is better.

391
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

392
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:33,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven Stolfen is in our chatroom and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.

393
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I do not give a shit.

394
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:37,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were like that every week.

395
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

396
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't some weeks.

397
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:42,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

398
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kiki's in our chatroom.

399
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:44,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new name.

400
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recognize that.

401
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:45,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Kiki.

402
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Says, Rob, Rob, Rob, I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

403
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.

404
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.

405
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:56,744
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

406
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Deakman says, announcement of the podcast, my girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.

407
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:02,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

408
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.

409
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:05,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's that?

410
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:06,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my.

411
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:07,452
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

412
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, DarkSakura?

413
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:11,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You have Deakman's baby?

414
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:12,697
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

415
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:14,078
[SPEAKER_11]: You're carrying Deakman's baby?

416
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, married.

417
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even carry my own husband.

418
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:19,362
[SPEAKER_11]: We kid, we kid, we kid.

419
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, um, wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 a.m.

420
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:27,673
[SPEAKER_07]: by a cesarean.

421
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:30,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 a.m.

422
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:32,776
[SPEAKER_07]: He is six pounds, eight ounces.

423
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: How come you have it at 6.66 a.m.?

424
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rob, duh.

425
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:39,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a joke, people.

426
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a joke.

427
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But his name is Julian Donald.

428
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:47,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, she had a... He just did not want to come out anyway.

429
00:26:47,804 --> 00:26:48,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

430
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I did want to share that though with everyone because I'm very... I feel what that baby's going through.

431
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:55,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Not wanting to come out.

432
00:26:56,808 --> 00:26:58,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously though, this is my friend's first baby.

433
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very excited for her.

434
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:02,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to her.

435
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:03,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

436
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Deakman.

437
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,516
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we have someone nice in the room wrong.

438
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?

439
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,080
[SPEAKER_06]: God of War.

440
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's send it... How about a decapitated goat?

441
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:16,325
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an offering.

442
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:16,385
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

443
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:20,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great though because his parents are both Trekkies.

444
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,171
[SPEAKER_07]: His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.

445
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,212
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't name the kids Spock, did they?

446
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,272
[SPEAKER_07]: His name is Julian.

447
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:33,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, wasn't that Picard's real name or something?

448
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean-Luc?

449
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.

450
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:41,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear I read that in some dig article this week.

451
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be Julian Picard and they changed it last minute.

452
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have another segment to do.

453
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:58,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and I'm so excited that DarkSakura is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails for you to read.

454
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start the mailbag segment.

455
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:03,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

456
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:07,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read them with that attitude.

457
00:28:09,412 --> 00:28:14,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, first email is from Ariz... I guess that's how it's pronounced.

458
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:17,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I get an Xbox 360?

459
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a high def monitor that can support 360 VGA.

460
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:23,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.

461
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:24,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it worth it?

462
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,106
[SPEAKER_07]: No, get a Wii.

463
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:26,767
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you should get a 360.

464
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:31,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need live.

465
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I have live and I don't play games over it.

466
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:38,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do like to download some arcade games but you'd be fine without it.

467
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a Wii.

468
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:39,728
[SPEAKER_09]: A.Z.H.P.

469
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:08,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad, dirty jokes that people have been coming up with.

470
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:09,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to save you guys.

471
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.

472
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me pull up the ad!

473
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:23,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will share with our chatroom right now.

474
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,530
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, everybody.

475
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual innuendos in it.

476
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,634
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually is too small for me to read.

477
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I use a higher resolution, obviously.

478
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:36,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, oh no, here it is.

479
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,108
[SPEAKER_07]: The text says this, and this is no joke.

480
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:41,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have this read in the sluttiest voice you can find in the studio.

481
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fuck that, I'm going to use my regular voice.

482
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:51,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night, and you're warm and safe in your living room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.

483
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:56,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing vampires goes great with friends, and the closest ones you have here are helping you through a tough level.

484
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:59,515
[SPEAKER_07]: You pause, there are monsters up ahead, and you're unsure of how to proceed.

485
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:03,097
[SPEAKER_07]: You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.

486
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:04,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps it's something in the juice.

487
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:12,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps it's the high from the intense side-scrolling action that only NES can deliver, which is alike as the Genesis had it too, and so did the Master System.

488
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,648
[SPEAKER_07]: But there seems to slow around the two of you.

489
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't look away.

490
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:18,089
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't.

491
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:21,171
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.

492
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It scares you, yet you must have it.

493
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:25,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Your gaze never breaks, neither does his.

494
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:30,256
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions in Fantasylands.

495
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight there will be a new adventure.

496
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, now you're playing with power.

497
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, what did you see in his eyes?

498
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw blast processing.

499
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:49,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.

500
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:50,968
[SPEAKER_09]: In the U.S.? ?

501
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,408
[SPEAKER_02]: or Japan or whatever.

502
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

503
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:55,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's at.

504
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Korea?

505
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

506
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder about that.

507
00:30:59,013 --> 00:30:59,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're right.

508
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, next email, shall I?

509
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:08,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every week.

510
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:13,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.

511
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say it real fast?

512
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:18,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.

513
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck.

514
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like your show.

515
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.

516
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:28,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But today I actually like it.

517
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:29,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I continue, please?

518
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:30,366
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sorry.

519
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:34,090
[SPEAKER_07]: For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.

520
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Week after week I listen to the cowardly, beat-around-the-bush responses, Apple sucks, Apple blows.

521
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:43,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well-thought-out, valid response to that argument.

522
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because you can't run Windows?

523
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, yes you can.

524
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:47,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because you can't play The Sims?

525
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance?

526
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:50,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, yes you can.

527
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:53,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?

528
00:31:54,427 --> 00:31:56,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you feel better if they called it a Zunecast?

529
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:58,649
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?

530
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess because me and Chris bought a Mizzun, hi.

531
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:03,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't you listening to this?

532
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:07,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got a Mizzun, hi.

533
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:10,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure you did just out of spite.

534
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you tried to install Vista yet?

535
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe if you did, you'll notice that it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?

536
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:25,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total ripoff of the Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.

537
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:29,334
[SPEAKER_07]: It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.

538
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:33,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?

539
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:35,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and this was by...

540
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,944
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm sorry I closed the email.

541
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:41,204
[SPEAKER_02]: God wrote that email?

542
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:42,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, person.

543
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: You are fucked, Loki.

544
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:46,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I closed your email.

545
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, person.

546
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:49,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, here it is.

547
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:50,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by JG2000.

548
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not God.

549
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:53,547
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those.

550
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:56,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, if God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.

551
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:58,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not fucked.

552
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:02,269
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, though, I mean, let's talk about...

553
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,155
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're doing, like, to basically advertise the, you know, the iMac right now.

554
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:17,557
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about how, you know, oh, yes, programs are so hard to install, but with, you know, Apple, you don't have to do anything, because they're all preloaded on there for you.

555
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:29,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good that you've preloaded the software that'll actually run on a Mac, you know, versus, you know, actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and we're not talking about, like, Doom 2 or stuff like that.

556
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, oh, goody, Prey plays on there.

557
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

558
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:32,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's

559
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.

560
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:45,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it based on colors or flavors, as I should put it.

561
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares what color the damn system is?

562
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:52,100
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can't fucking install... Nintendo DS?

563
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.

564
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's retarded that they even sell by colors.

565
00:33:58,184 --> 00:33:58,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

566
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,915
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.

567
00:34:02,055 --> 00:34:03,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

568
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:06,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.

569
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

570
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to buy one.

571
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

572
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:16,004
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.

573
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:17,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

574
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:25,731
[SPEAKER_03]: When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice, but

575
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:33,407
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever I guess the next next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out Mac's definitely not going to be able to play it.

576
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:36,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, I still like being bi with computers.

577
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop.

578
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Works great.

579
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:45,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things and do emails.

580
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:45,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quick.

581
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:54,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh, well the, you know, iDVD, it's so awesome, you know, it's, so he's used, there's programs out there that use, you know, they're on everything.

582
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:55,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It,

583
00:34:56,033 --> 00:35:06,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get... Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because all the programs are there for you and you don't need to download any extra stuff.

584
00:35:06,962 --> 00:35:07,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

585
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: People like me who aren't super basic with computers like to have that option to customize things and I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.

586
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.

587
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So shall I move on to the next email then?

588
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

589
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:25,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

590
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:26,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, guys.

591
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:27,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

592
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:28,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs, please.

593
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:28,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

594
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:30,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just writing to let you know.

595
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:33,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?

596
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,848
[SPEAKER_07]: That was me saying that because you said, guys.

597
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:35,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, no.

598
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:36,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

599
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,210
[SPEAKER_07]: BPC, thank you.

600
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was a request.

601
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, if you really want, I'll just... Rob.

602
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:42,912
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

603
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:44,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need that.

604
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

605
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:51,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.

606
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:52,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.

607
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm studying abroad for my junior year of high school in Italy right now.

608
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:56,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky.

609
00:35:57,432 --> 00:36:00,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.

610
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:03,133
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.

611
00:36:03,173 --> 00:36:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: They never fail to disappoint.

612
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And they never fail to disappoint.

613
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:08,134
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

614
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:11,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

615
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:14,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They never...

616
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

617
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that was what they meant.

618
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:17,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's what they meant.

619
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp, chirp, chirp.

620
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:20,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everything else is all positive.

621
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what?

622
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:21,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

623
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:28,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up hearing you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.

624
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:32,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint.

625
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't put a review up yet, I should do that.

626
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:36,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you do that?

627
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:36,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you put a five?

628
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,169
[SPEAKER_02]: There's OLR never fails to disappoint.

629
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:41,251
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.

630
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:41,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

631
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:44,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.

632
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that.

633
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That was beautiful.

634
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:46,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway.

635
00:36:48,294 --> 00:37:01,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer, more specifically a Bitmoni fan, care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn, Moongina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.

636
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.

637
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:13,164
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.

638
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.

639
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:17,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't say the last name unless he wants me to.

640
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:18,646
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

641
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:24,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I challenge Sky's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to duel to the death over said throne at any time.

642
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky, unwashed toilet.

643
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

644
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:31,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You...

645
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:40,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at Halo 2.

646
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,383
[SPEAKER_09]: But what if you fail to disappoint?

647
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:44,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you lose.

648
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:46,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So hey, I'm really curious.

649
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:47,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Matthew, was that the name?

650
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:48,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

651
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:51,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Matthew, you're in Italy, and that's pretty awesome.

652
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,599
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, listener base is international.

653
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:52,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock.

654
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:55,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan, and I'm curious.

655
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,481
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the Bimani in arcade scene like over there?

656
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:02,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never heard this confirmed.

657
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:05,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.

658
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:06,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Japan.

659
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:07,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, Japan.

660
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:10,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unless you count, you know, Ticket Games and Pachinko.

661
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Japan has tons of arcades.

662
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:13,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I do.

663
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:17,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the last email tonight.

664
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:20,197
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from Sakura Max.

665
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Anime was created because we killed ourselves because hot anime chicks don't exist in real life.

666
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:26,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

667
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.

668
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:34,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth.

669
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:36,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks ago referenced in my email.

670
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:38,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Rhea Dracer.

671
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:40,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Recommend any MMOs.

672
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:44,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I already played MapleStory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy Online.

673
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,759
[SPEAKER_07]: FlyFF, Gunbound, Gunzi, and Ragnarok.

674
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's it.

675
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.

676
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, those guys' emails... Okay, that guy's emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.

677
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like... I can't say I have.

678
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.

679
00:39:03,763 --> 00:39:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, no, no, seriously.

680
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:09,544
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is a site I love.

681
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:14,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, you know...

682
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:20,024
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, World Peace, I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, you know, it's like all these random things.

683
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,324
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this guy saying?

684
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:25,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he's like, I was once served in a tavern, medium rare.

685
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what?

686
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like poetry, practically.

687
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the signature best on this, though.

688
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read this to you.

689
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Sakura Max, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.

690
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:43,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You get, like, you get a gold star just for your closing to that email.

691
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,910
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play Loki's game.

692
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Done!

693
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:47,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Next, please.

694
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:49,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

695
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday.

696
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Meanwhile, more news.

697
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.

698
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.

699
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.

700
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:06,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Garcia, the man who brought us Dan Hedeke.

701
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:07,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

702
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,108
Yahoo!

703
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:10,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that joke.

704
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:14,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.

705
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:25,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2 and this is again thanks to the ESRB who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.

706
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.

707
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:36,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally came out on the Neo Geo.

708
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:37,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

709
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what else it does?

710
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:44,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.

711
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:49,290
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.

712
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:53,473
[SPEAKER_09]: They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.

713
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:59,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Make something new!

714
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:02,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, weren't Neo Geo games supposed to become a virtual console anyway?

715
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,379
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not new.

716
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:04,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's old shit again.

717
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,302
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.

718
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: That was new.

719
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:10,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was really good.

720
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:13,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, one game.

721
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.

722
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:20,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, anyway.

723
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an art of fighting.

724
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:30,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to the DS.

725
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:34,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on touchscreen.

726
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:35,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

727
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.

728
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:39,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

729
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

730
00:41:41,258 --> 00:42:00,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance 2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.

731
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that song that goes, I don't wanna work, I just wanna bang on Z-Drum all day.

732
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that song?

733
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

734
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:56,604
[SPEAKER_07]: There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious about a person jailed for the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack!

735
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:05,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like a shooter that's like House of the Dead and what's that other one?

736
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:09,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the Ghost Squad.

737
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a light gun shooter.

738
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Touch the Dead

739
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:41,265
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

740
00:44:05,223 --> 00:44:05,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful.

741
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So disgusting.

742
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:09,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it came from a butcher, making that okay.

743
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:11,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's from a butcher.

744
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?

745
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.

746
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:19,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but you can actually buy goat meat.

747
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:20,686
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy horse meat on the market.

748
00:44:20,746 --> 00:44:22,647
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.

749
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: They sell horse meat for international consumption.

750
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:27,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and I really want some.

751
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:33,070
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have.

752
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing all the jokes.

753
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this really gets my goat.

754
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:38,112
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing to lose your head over.

755
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:41,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love the Internet.

756
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:50,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly because they opened it up and free and all that stuff.

757
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:55,373
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put gay marriage in the game.

758
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.

759
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:03,738
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're not going to have marriage in the game at all.

760
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:04,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

761
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:05,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want marriage in the game?

762
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,681
[SPEAKER_03]: In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.

763
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:09,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It was completely pointless.

764
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.

765
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:14,074
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stupid.

766
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:15,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.

767
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:19,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually could share your hit points.

768
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,141
[SPEAKER_07]: You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.

769
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: There were also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody else.

770
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:33,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the private server I played on, the mods would actually have it.

771
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:39,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Where in the game it was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.

772
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:44,911
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you can marry anything.

773
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Including the villains and creatures that you're fighting.

774
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You would cast a spell and... I married a zombie!

775
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:52,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I married the rabbit!

776
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,196
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm gonna kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.

777
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:57,478
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's like The End of Shaun of the Dead.

778
00:45:58,218 --> 00:45:59,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still have the ring!

779
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: He's my husband!

780
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:03,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

781
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:11,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that, you know, the Lords of the Ring Online, they decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the original books.

782
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And although they had some interspecial, you know, like a dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were going to have that.

783
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no mention in the books ever of males, two males or two females marrying, so they weren't going to put it in the game.

784
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:27,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the elves are doing it.

785
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows.

786
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,303
[SPEAKER_02]: They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull the marriage option all together.

787
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:43,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining Lords of the Ring online, you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game, because the game sucks.

788
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,791
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.

789
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:49,034
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play Lords of the Ring online, just go play World of Warcraft.

790
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:49,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

791
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say Lords of the Ring?

792
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:52,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

793
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:54,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So Lords of the Ring is you've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.

794
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.

795
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:57,099
[SPEAKER_09]: That's their problem.

796
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a load balancing issue.

797
00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:07,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever you want in the game.

798
00:47:08,274 --> 00:47:10,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we have another announcement speaking of marriages.

799
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:12,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

800
00:47:13,258 --> 00:47:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.

801
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:21,784
[SPEAKER_07]: His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today, and she said yes, and they're getting married in an anime con.

802
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they listening to the show?

803
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:24,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.

804
00:47:25,628 --> 00:47:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.

805
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Don't Give a Shit Night.

806
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:37,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards.

807
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:39,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially Loki.

808
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got this on a PM.

809
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:44,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a dump right now.

810
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he get married to him?

811
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:50,984
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about marriage right now.

812
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:57,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.

813
00:47:57,816 --> 00:48:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this show cause people to want to release or something?

814
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:02,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.

815
00:48:03,017 --> 00:48:05,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, hey, congratulations to Ranma's friend, because that's awesome.

816
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:13,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still hoarse from California screaming.

817
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:15,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And congratulations to your other friend's bowels.

818
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:16,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.

819
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

820
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version.

821
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:32,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created, causing the game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.

822
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:40,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But, as you're probably listening to this podcast now, or tomorrow if you're listening to it live, there will be a patch.

823
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:41,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yay!

824
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:44,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Your expansion will work.

825
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:47,667
[SPEAKER_03]: As it should have when you first downloaded it,

826
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they tested the damn game?

827
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:51,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Tested the game.

828
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:52,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very important.

829
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:54,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just release his shit and patch it later.

830
00:48:59,154 --> 00:48:59,714
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.

831
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

832
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:02,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

833
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about.

834
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:09,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, um... What?

835
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:10,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the theme.

836
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:11,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

837
00:49:12,038 --> 00:49:13,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.

838
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just because I hate Warhammer.

839
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:16,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Warhammer 40k.

840
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:25,003
[SPEAKER_07]: because I know people, I had an ex who would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.

841
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool and I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.

842
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:40,093
[SPEAKER_07]: But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.

843
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:43,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed.

844
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: in the US and in Europe until first quarter 2008.

845
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:48,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

846
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news, Rice Prince of All Cosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.

847
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:00,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are so freaking mature.

848
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:01,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just picking that up.

849
00:50:01,704 --> 00:50:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Mature.

850
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe... Did it say yes or no?

851
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

852
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:15,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.

853
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:16,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear God, why?

854
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,794
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is shit on ice.

855
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:21,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly why I used that transition.

856
00:50:21,576 --> 00:50:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.

857
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:29,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think... Okay, so I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind of loose and just... You run around... God damn it.

858
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:30,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Loose like the bowels?

859
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:33,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have thought that up before I said that.

860
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:35,625
[SPEAKER_09]: They were not terribly... Okay.

861
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:36,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

862
00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:37,425
[SPEAKER_09]: X, X, Y X, X, Y X, X, Y

863
00:51:06,352 --> 00:51:08,754
[SPEAKER_02]: X, X, Y. Oh, that batch of monsters is dead.

864
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next zone.

865
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: X, X, Y. X, X, Y. It's like all you did in the whole game.

866
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:17,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three buttons.

867
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:19,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Most RPGs have one attack.

868
00:51:20,939 --> 00:51:23,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.

869
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Ambition of the Illuminous.

870
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to confess, the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said Abortion of the Illuminous.

871
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.

872
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:32,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I actually read that.

873
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?

874
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:35,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Abortion of the Illuminous?

875
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous.

876
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:42,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, that's the title.

877
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:44,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be some new weapon types.

878
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Madug, Shadug, and Whip.

879
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there'll be new Photon Arts.

880
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:55,301
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's gonna be new planets as well, I don't see how there couldn't be.

881
00:51:56,002 --> 00:52:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.

882
00:52:00,404 --> 00:52:03,565
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're gonna have to buy a new disc.

883
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:07,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Which seems weird, because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.

884
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:09,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello.

885
00:52:09,948 --> 00:52:10,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

886
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:11,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there it is.

887
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:13,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Abortion of the Illuminous, coming soon.

888
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Abortion of the Illuminous.

889
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:17,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so wrong.

890
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, um, now if

891
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:24,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today.

892
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:41,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could, of course, hack your current drive for, say, about $80 and get 120GB as well.

893
00:52:44,582 --> 00:53:03,509
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things you can create your own 120 gig drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.

894
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there without having to hack the whole drive apart which I'm sure someone can create.

895
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,072
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not already available.

896
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:16,933
[SPEAKER_03]: To just do that.

897
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.

898
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:22,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Why they don't have that anyways, you know, is beyond me.

899
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:25,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But there you go.

900
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Save $100.

901
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:29,123
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not going to buy an Elite system, just want a larger hard drive.

902
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:30,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well.

903
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:31,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

904
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:33,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Hackin' and crackin'.

905
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:42,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the internet and sometimes she stumbles upon a website that she wants to share with all of you.

906
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:45,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.

907
00:53:54,669 --> 00:54:03,552
[SPEAKER_07]: The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.

908
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real life comics.

909
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:12,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I understand, he used to, I think, buy comics from my husband at the GameStop.

910
00:54:12,813 --> 00:54:14,833
[SPEAKER_09]: He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.

911
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:16,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, well he was local then.

912
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,655
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a pretty cool webcomic.

913
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:20,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I say check it out.

914
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: The URL is reallifecomics.com So it's funny.

915
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:27,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

916
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:29,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

917
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.

918
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:35,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Over in Folsom.

919
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:35,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

920
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:38,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time that I saw a picture of him on his site.

921
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:39,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, whoa!

922
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:40,309
[SPEAKER_09]: That guy.

923
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we ever run into each other playing DDR?

924
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day?

925
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:44,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play it Folsom?

926
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:47,312
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.

927
00:54:47,512 --> 00:54:47,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.

928
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:48,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Years ago.

929
00:54:48,813 --> 00:54:51,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder, do I know you?

930
00:54:52,274 --> 00:54:51,954
2001?

931
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:54,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?

932
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:55,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, yeah.

933
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that SCAT?

934
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:57,253
[SPEAKER_06]: That was SCAT.

935
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:58,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament?

936
00:54:59,074 --> 00:54:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

937
00:54:59,654 --> 00:55:00,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.

938
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:03,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I started playing when I was 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.

939
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:04,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, funny.

940
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:06,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Small world.

941
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:06,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Small world, gee.

942
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:07,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

943
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Not as small as my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives down my street.

944
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:15,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Also happens to be in Denmark.

945
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:17,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Very strange.

946
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:18,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And they meet and have lunch.

947
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:23,250
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, it is a small world, and we want to open up the world to call our show right now.

948
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:24,976
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Skype line.

949
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:30,959
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call on the old telephone.

950
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

951
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:37,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

952
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll take our calls on Skype.

953
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:47,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, and you always go, why is it the same people calling into the show every week?

954
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:48,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, it's an open line.

955
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,669
[SPEAKER_02]: All I gotta do is give us a call Sunday.

956
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:57,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific Time, you can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.

957
00:55:58,033 --> 00:55:58,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

958
00:55:59,094 --> 00:55:59,574
[SPEAKER_02]: 8.30 Pacific Time.

959
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:01,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

960
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:02,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

961
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:02,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

962
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:05,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

963
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:09,119
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the dead goat from the God of War story.

964
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.

965
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:14,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead goat, do you have a name?

966
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:18,204
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Bill.

967
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:19,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

968
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.

969
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:41,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.

970
00:56:41,045 --> 00:56:42,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of gross.

971
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:44,207
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to hang out with topless women.

972
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:05,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't do anything with them.

973
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:07,187
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them were into golf.

974
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:09,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me go wah.

975
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:14,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, Dead Goat?

976
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:14,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill?

977
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:19,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.

978
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:20,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah.

979
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:23,874
[SPEAKER_05]: They want me to tell you to buy God of War 2 if you have it.

980
00:57:23,914 --> 00:57:24,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah.

981
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:27,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will definitely have to consider that.

982
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:27,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

983
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our station.

984
00:57:31,779 --> 00:57:33,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially from beyond the grave.

985
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So, shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.

986
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:41,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for letting me call in.

987
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:43,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I love listening to your show.

988
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:43,605
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

989
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have another question.

990
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:50,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary episode?

991
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

992
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get back to you off the show.

993
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to talk about it on the air.

994
00:57:58,262 --> 00:57:58,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

995
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:01,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

996
00:58:01,464 --> 00:58:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

997
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:02,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know, Bill.

998
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:04,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

999
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:05,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Rob.

1000
00:58:05,126 --> 00:58:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1001
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1002
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:08,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1003
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:08,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1004
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1005
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1006
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,074
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of stupid people on the Internet.

1007
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:19,536
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?

1008
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

1009
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:23,089
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get Skype in the graveyard?

1010
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:27,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, talking into a mic.

1011
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:29,295
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to Photoshop that.

1012
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:31,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So they go, crap, the levels are off.

1013
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to adjust the microphone.

1014
00:58:33,298 --> 00:58:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the guy who called it.

1015
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?

1016
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?

1017
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:40,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it in the chat room.

1018
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:41,305
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1019
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:42,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shit show.

1020
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:43,327
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the what?

1021
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:45,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it.

1022
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:46,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't give a shit tonight.

1023
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:47,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1024
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:48,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't give a shit.

1025
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:52,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?

1026
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:54,250
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call tonight?

1027
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:56,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Rob.

1028
00:58:56,272 --> 00:58:57,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pissing you off.

1029
00:58:57,113 --> 00:58:58,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say I love it.

1030
00:58:58,634 --> 00:58:59,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the tone.

1031
00:58:59,955 --> 00:59:01,036
[SPEAKER_11]: You love the tone tonight?

1032
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:02,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love it.

1033
00:59:02,878 --> 00:59:06,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that you go like, Kanan Lynch is going to the PS3.

1034
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:07,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't give a shit.

1035
00:59:09,485 --> 00:59:10,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

1036
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.

1037
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, I don't know, maybe DarkSakura and I rode California Screamin' one too many times and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.

1038
00:59:20,972 --> 00:59:21,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1039
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:29,777
[SPEAKER_11]: That was, that made me laugh when you went like, everyone was like, oh my god, DataLynch is going multi-platform and you just go like, I don't give a shit.

1040
00:59:30,957 --> 00:59:32,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know what to tell you.

1041
00:59:32,258 --> 00:59:34,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else is on your mind gaming-wise this week, Ravis Dolvin?

1042
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Xbox Wii came out today and I think they're left.

1043
00:59:39,975 --> 00:59:40,855
[SPEAKER_02]: The what came out?

1044
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:42,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Elite.

1045
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.

1046
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:49,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DarkSakura, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.

1047
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:49,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

1048
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what made you want to get one?

1049
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't me, it was Dan, because our old one died.

1050
00:59:54,322 --> 00:59:55,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, you guys had no one that died.

1051
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:56,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I can see that.

1052
00:59:57,423 --> 00:59:59,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?

1053
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:06,107
[SPEAKER_09]: When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from them.

1054
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:08,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like someone else to get an Elite.

1055
01:00:09,414 --> 01:00:12,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I felt, well, hold, now let me hear, I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.

1056
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:42,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The DS Lite was an upgrade?

1057
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:47,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had a DS Bad and I upgraded to a DS Lite.

1058
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:51,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing.

1059
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the Xbox 360 Elite, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not that much new to it.

1060
01:00:58,302 --> 01:01:00,562
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?

1061
01:01:02,123 --> 01:01:02,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't.

1062
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:03,963
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I don't care.

1063
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:06,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then there you go.

1064
01:01:07,853 --> 01:01:10,934
[SPEAKER_02]: alright, left the tone, thank you one more thing?

1065
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:32,160
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a great show I hope you do another bullshit episode we'll see, we'll see what kind of mood we're in next week alright, thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin later alright, that was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call let's go back to the phones and take another call if you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1066
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,161
[SPEAKER_02]: hi, this is Chris hi, Chris what's on your mind, buddy?

1067
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:38,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1068
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,718
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I just wanted to say I like the show.

1069
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:46,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.

1070
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.

1071
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:50,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the live experience.

1072
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.

1073
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, congratulations.

1074
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:59,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Sundays are big days for Wiis.

1075
01:01:59,144 --> 01:02:03,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buy or Toys R Us was going to have them?

1076
01:02:03,145 --> 01:02:03,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you got them?

1077
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:07,192
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I actually had a friend from work.

1078
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:10,354
[SPEAKER_08]: He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wii's in today.

1079
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:13,856
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like the most they had ever coming at one time.

1080
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:15,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1081
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:17,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you buy any games for the Wii?

1082
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:20,239
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't.

1083
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:26,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe rent something.

1084
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:28,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't really interested in that.

1085
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:33,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago and

1086
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:39,828
[SPEAKER_08]: and now they have like 45 Wii's coming out as if they were competing.

1087
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:41,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good thought.

1088
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:47,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wii's maybe to kind of have a big push the day the Elite came out?

1089
01:02:47,612 --> 01:02:52,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, you know, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually have Wii's in stock.

1090
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, maybe I should get that instead.

1091
01:02:54,677 --> 01:02:56,178
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.

1092
01:02:57,138 --> 01:02:59,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?

1093
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:02,322
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I kind of feel...

1094
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,671
[SPEAKER_08]: They just threw that out there.

1095
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:09,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It really isn't a real successor to the original one.

1096
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:10,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I pretty much feel like that's what they all did.

1097
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:26,169
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1098
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:49,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a good way to go.

1099
01:03:49,464 --> 01:03:51,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but what about all the good things Kutaragi did?

1100
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:54,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?

1101
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.

1102
01:03:55,527 --> 01:04:05,652
[SPEAKER_07]: He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night, is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.

1103
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:10,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?

1104
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:14,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but...

1105
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,923
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, you gotta put them down, so... And what about all the great things that Goat did?

1106
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:21,305
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's dead.

1107
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:22,026
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to put them down.

1108
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:27,450
[SPEAKER_02]: RicePrince of all cosmos in the chatroom says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.

1109
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a great idea.

1110
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?

1111
01:04:34,216 --> 01:04:36,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no, that's basically it.

1112
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:38,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I wanna know which game you think I should get for the Wii.

1113
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:39,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1114
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:40,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Excite Truck

1115
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:12,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Excite Truck's not bad.

1116
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Excite Truck too.

1117
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:15,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it use a controller?

1118
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:19,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be able to use the Wiimote a little bit more.

1119
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:22,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all those games.

1120
01:05:23,072 --> 01:05:24,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much Super Paper Mario.

1121
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:26,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does incorporate it a little bit.

1122
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You do thuds by shaking the thing.

1123
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:34,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wiimote like a normal controller, but you steer with it.

1124
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.

1125
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:41,233
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course Legend of Zelda is like all about using that like you swing it like a sword and all that crazy stuff.

1126
01:05:42,014 --> 01:05:43,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, alright, thanks.

1127
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, no problem, Chris.

1128
01:05:44,196 --> 01:05:46,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for calling the show and call us back sometime.

1129
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:47,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care.

1130
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1131
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We like new callers.

1132
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,901
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good show.

1133
01:05:52,162 --> 01:05:57,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we need to take vacations more often because we get new guests in studio and we get new callers.

1134
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:00,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we don't appreciate the old callers too.

1135
01:06:00,888 --> 01:06:03,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.

1136
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:04,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1137
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:04,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1138
01:06:05,994 --> 01:06:07,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's Legend of Zaku.

1139
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:09,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, hello, Legend of Zaku.

1140
01:06:09,976 --> 01:06:10,756
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1141
01:06:12,017 --> 01:06:12,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, nothing much.

1142
01:06:12,877 --> 01:06:16,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Just coming back from Queens, playing Poppin' 8, and pumping up.

1143
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:18,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I love people calling this show.

1144
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:19,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, hey, what's up?

1145
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, nothing.

1146
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought I'd call and let you know I did stuff today.

1147
01:06:24,782 --> 01:06:25,362
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

1148
01:06:25,642 --> 01:06:26,742
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of tonight's show?

1149
01:06:26,802 --> 01:06:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Any stories you want to comment on?

1150
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:37,751
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's official now that Supernova 2 test location has already been announced for like next month.

1151
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:39,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.

1152
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:42,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that was my post.

1153
01:06:42,573 --> 01:06:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?

1154
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:43,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1155
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:44,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I contributed.

1156
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you submitted it and we ran it.

1157
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:46,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1158
01:06:46,856 --> 01:06:47,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1159
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

1160
01:06:48,378 --> 01:06:57,085
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think, actually, Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us and, like, two Japanese Bomani sites linked to that story.

1161
01:06:57,406 --> 01:06:59,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.

1162
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So good job.

1163
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:02,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1164
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:03,131
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1165
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:05,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us, how did you come across this information about the location test?

1166
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just...

1167
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, since I know you're such a hardcore, you know, Bomani and music game fan because you've been listening to us, you know, since, you know, the day when that's all we talked about on this show.

1168
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:41,045
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you hope is the number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?

1169
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1.

1170
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlockables, pretty much.

1171
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:51,133
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how DDR Max was back in the day.

1172
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:54,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It only had like 60 songs.

1173
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:57,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have any returning songs.

1174
01:07:57,438 --> 01:07:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It just had brand new songs.

1175
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And there wasn't really that much.

1176
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and

1177
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,226
[SPEAKER_04]: and added new ones and had an unlock system.

1178
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I gotcha.

1179
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards was unlocking all this stuff.

1180
01:08:12,891 --> 01:08:14,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, think about it.

1181
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:22,719
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami to gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.

1182
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And we already know the outcome of that.

1183
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so, if we're getting a Supernova 2.

1184
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:28,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1185
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:31,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That and hopefully, you know,

1186
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:35,398
[SPEAKER_04]: They are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar to EMUs.

1187
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:39,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, something that's not necessarily connected online.

1188
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a card system, like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.

1189
01:08:44,862 --> 01:08:45,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Build your own dancer.

1190
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:46,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.

1191
01:08:47,343 --> 01:08:52,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even that, just track scores, you know, battle people and stuff like that.

1192
01:08:52,366 --> 01:08:54,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy hot pants for your character.

1193
01:08:54,106 --> 01:08:55,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully Konami would

1194
01:08:55,748 --> 01:09:00,310
[SPEAKER_04]: would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent in Supernova this time.

1195
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:02,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Toshin's yelling Link support in chat room.

1196
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1197
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they found a good workaround.

1198
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:06,593
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

1199
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:08,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else is being said in chat here.

1200
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bomani.

1201
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:14,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that too.

1202
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:19,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and also like revival songs that haven't been revived in a long time.

1203
01:09:20,629 --> 01:09:24,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.

1204
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.

1205
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:29,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, stuff like that.

1206
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bomani.

1207
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.

1208
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what do you expect?

1209
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it ruined my life too.

1210
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met DarkSakura.

1211
01:09:42,914 --> 01:09:44,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugs and kisses and bunnies.

1212
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:45,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you.

1213
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:45,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what?

1214
01:09:48,342 --> 01:09:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.

1215
01:09:52,586 --> 01:09:53,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

1216
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1217
01:09:55,468 --> 01:09:59,171
[SPEAKER_02]: James Patrick says DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.

1218
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:00,052
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR is pretty big.

1219
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:01,213
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1220
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:01,213
500?

1221
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:02,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1222
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that sales figure come from?

1223
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:05,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Cite your source, James Patrick.

1224
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:08,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd be damned if it reaches a million.

1225
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:10,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't even know when they're jumping.

1226
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:17,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know, for any future DDR mixes.

1227
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:47,596
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously I don't see that happening now so is it going to hold on to the PS2 as long as possible there's a big install phase backing it up alright well Zaku we're going to let you go but are you going to drive out to the test of Supernova 2 I don't know maybe I don't even know if I have vacation time but I'll probably get the videos you know eventually and hopefully once Supernova 2 comes in the city then I'll be able to decide for myself alright well good luck with that have fun

1228
01:10:48,737 --> 01:10:49,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later dude.

1229
01:10:49,838 --> 01:10:50,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1230
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Zaku's hilarious.

1231
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,961
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the best voice.

1232
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:59,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is Colin talking about Supernova.

1233
01:11:01,326 --> 01:11:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music games.

1234
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:12,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow no rules.

1235
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:16,516
[SPEAKER_09]: When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like when you meet them.

1236
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,294
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York City.

1237
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good kid.

1238
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:27,038
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just give him a hard time on this show because he's been listening for a long time and we can't.

1239
01:11:27,378 --> 01:11:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York City the week of June 9th.

1240
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying for now.

1241
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.

1242
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York City, which is good.

1243
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:41,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I love New York City.

1244
01:11:41,988 --> 01:11:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it, love it, love it.

1245
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of

1246
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:55,665
[SPEAKER_02]: make an appearance, and so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo World Store with people just loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.

1247
01:11:57,826 --> 01:11:58,066
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1248
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:00,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1249
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:04,529
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD in chat says, Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.

1250
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:06,430
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to do that if we had the money.

1251
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?

1252
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they'll be there.

1253
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,080
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to ASEN.

1254
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So the OLR lesbians will be there.

1255
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:15,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.

1256
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:16,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN.

1257
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for them.

1258
01:12:18,804 --> 01:12:20,085
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.

1259
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:20,785
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be at FONAME.

1260
01:12:21,445 --> 01:12:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1261
01:12:21,886 --> 01:12:22,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell.

1262
01:12:23,026 --> 01:12:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have announced that at the top of the show.

1263
01:12:24,347 --> 01:12:25,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.

1264
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:28,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get confirmed for this year's FONAME.

1265
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:33,932
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing a live show from FONAME the Saturday of FONAME at 2 p.m.

1266
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:37,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right.

1267
01:12:37,374 --> 01:12:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have the one.

1268
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fine, because we didn't really need two last week.

1269
01:12:40,324 --> 01:12:41,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Your panels were book solid.

1270
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:43,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so... We're lucky to get a Saturday.

1271
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.

1272
01:12:44,686 --> 01:12:45,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good time.

1273
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Saturday at 2, we'll be there taping one of our shows live.

1274
01:12:48,987 --> 01:12:51,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that reason, we will not be live Memorial Day weekend.

1275
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:54,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some folks will be staying at Faname.

1276
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other commitments.

1277
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:58,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be going to Faname for like a day and a half.

1278
01:12:58,069 --> 01:12:59,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We still need to talk about that.

1279
01:12:59,169 --> 01:13:00,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have other commitments.

1280
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:00,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

1281
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:01,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1282
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:11,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with the rest of them, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco.

1283
01:13:11,774 --> 01:13:17,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited about it because that's the thing I'm really into is bad movies like Rocky Horror and all that.

1284
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:17,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1285
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:18,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1286
01:13:19,139 --> 01:13:27,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line and let's ask right now if there's any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.

1287
01:13:27,284 --> 01:13:29,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1288
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something interesting you should know.

1289
01:13:32,411 --> 01:13:36,453
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess.

1290
01:13:37,174 --> 01:13:45,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And a review on IGN saying that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the Blu... Was it the Blu-ray Java or whatever?

1291
01:13:46,178 --> 01:13:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: The BD Java.

1292
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:51,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.

1293
01:13:51,221 --> 01:13:56,764
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be one for a five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha!

1294
01:13:57,804 --> 01:13:58,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other fun stuff.

1295
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:25,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend but they had the announcement for Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and it looks pretty fucking awesome and of course Tom Clancy's End War which is supposed to be an online persistent war you're basically going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other so that's kind of neat

1296
01:14:26,435 --> 01:14:27,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see what else.

1297
01:14:27,836 --> 01:14:37,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, LEGO Star Wars 2 and Saints Row have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both those games are available for $29.99.

1298
01:14:38,364 --> 01:14:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.

1299
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:41,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row is fucking awesome.

1300
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:44,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game, I never bought it, so maybe I will now.

1301
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:50,594
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disguise are coming to the PS3.

1302
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting, I guess.

1303
01:14:54,451 --> 01:14:57,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was your new Disgaea game coming out, I thought.

1304
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:58,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe that's called Deceptive, I'm thinking.

1305
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else do we have here?

1306
01:15:02,855 --> 01:15:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that was pretty much it.

1307
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:12,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1308
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1309
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:15,882
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you got anything?

1310
01:15:16,102 --> 01:15:16,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last minute stories?

1311
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:17,803
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1312
01:15:19,004 --> 01:15:19,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

1313
01:15:19,844 --> 01:15:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that does it then for tonight's Warrior Bob.

1314
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:23,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything you've read about?

1315
01:15:23,526 --> 01:15:23,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1316
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:32,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the show I used to co-host, PressStart.TheFighting.org Are they still on?

1317
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:33,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they still are.

1318
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:34,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just left.

1319
01:15:34,945 --> 01:15:35,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I Skype in now and again.

1320
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:36,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1321
01:15:36,526 --> 01:15:38,046
[SPEAKER_09]: But first I want to plug them.

1322
01:15:38,086 --> 01:15:42,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week.

1323
01:15:43,308 --> 01:15:44,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So, ha, that's our news.

1324
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:47,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.

1325
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes, that's right.

1326
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming up, what, Friday?

1327
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:51,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was two days ago.

1328
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, two days ago.

1329
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

1330
01:15:56,494 --> 01:15:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.

1331
01:15:59,015 --> 01:16:02,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st?

1332
01:16:03,678 --> 01:16:05,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they said it'll be done when it's done.

1333
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to make a good game.

1334
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,740
[SPEAKER_09]: If it takes that long, it'll take that long.

1335
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

1336
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:10,622
[SPEAKER_02]: This game better do my dishes.

1337
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:11,322
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

1338
01:16:11,342 --> 01:16:12,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be that freaking good.

1339
01:16:12,743 --> 01:16:14,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they named it after the development time.

1340
01:16:14,284 --> 01:16:15,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That was innovative, right?

1341
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

1342
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:16,985
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1343
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:19,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it.

1344
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:20,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1345
01:16:42,219 --> 01:17:10,355

1346
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

1347
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently that Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and StarCraft 2 as well.

1348
01:17:20,444 --> 01:17:21,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be one and the same?

1349
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:23,045
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're going to be two different games.

1350
01:17:24,846 --> 01:17:28,189
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.

1351
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But it costs money and I don't have money.

1352
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:33,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my new final thought, is I want you to open a laser tag arena.

1353
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:34,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

1354
01:17:34,853 --> 01:17:37,815
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.

1355
01:17:39,235 --> 01:17:40,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Reject false icons.

1356
01:17:41,055 --> 01:17:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.

1357
01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:44,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see it make a comeback.

1358
01:17:44,936 --> 01:17:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1359
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:51,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Without you guys, we would die.

1360
01:17:52,218 --> 01:17:56,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.

1361
01:17:57,879 --> 01:17:59,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's you guys that help support us.

1362
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two friends.

1363
01:18:03,421 --> 01:18:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have to be friends.

1364
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:08,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to us.

1365
01:18:09,395 --> 01:18:38,421
[SPEAKER_02]: and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world and if you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even more you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or Podcast Alley or any of those sites that are like hey rate your favorite podcast because then we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people bother to look at it and if you really really like us and you can do it you'll send us invitations to E3 that's also a good idea

1366
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:42,307
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.

1367
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:43,747
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
