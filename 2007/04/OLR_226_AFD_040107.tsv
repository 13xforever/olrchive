12856	18960	Welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show with your hosts, Chris and Maisie.
19881	21002	Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
21222	22683	She is not a lesbian.
23764	25725	All I know is that I can play.
27106	28327	Gather up your pillows.
28880	35243	Makeup, Ice Cream Sundaes, and Xboxes, it's time for the show to begin.
36023	42586	Hi, and welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Game Show.
44507	47188	How is everybody out there in Radioland tonight?
47949	51470	I'm your host, the ever-always Lesbian Kris.
51590	52191	Yeah.
52491	52911	Yeah.
53627	63395	And with me forever, of course, is my beautiful, wonderful, lovey-dovey, little, wonderful girlfriend, Meg Z, with the size C cup.
64216	65016	Say hi, baby.
65597	68079	Hi, everyone.
68679	72242	And of course, always with me is my cream-filled Jamie.
72302	73483	How is my sweetheart?
76046	77407	I'm an angst cookie, as usual.
77847	78528	Angst cookie?
78908	80089	Not any good clit-loving, honey?
81270	82551	No, just a stupid man.
82972	84453	I'm sorry, boys are bad.
84473	85213	Sad face.
85433	86394	Sad face.
87094	93618	And of course, always we have to introduce our special guest, Roberta Roberts.
93758	94759	Sweetheart, give me a kiss.
96400	97480	Hi, baby.
97821	98681	How are you doing?
99121	101303	My gosh, did your breasts get bigger?
101843	103604	You are so hot, honey.
103764	104685	I love you.
105465	107846	They have gotten a little bit bigger.
107906	109407	I've been using this cream on them.
109427	110188	But I digress.
110228	112129	We're talking about video games.
113217	114017	Get her alive!
114057	114758	Get her alive!
114798	115478	Get her alive!
116138	117499	I know!
117519	118400	Boobies!
118480	120421	Boobies!
120921	125943	But first, first, we have to talk about our gaming week, sweetheart.
126404	128124	So, first of all, I'll go first.
128965	137349	My gaming week was, of course, I had to be playing WoW, and I only play my Blood Elf because she does the sexy dance when I do this thing with her.
138029	139470	You know, you do the dance thing, so...
140743	141924	I played a guy blood elf.
142244	143365	Those guys are so gay.
144186	144826	I mean, really.
145987	148568	If you're playing a guy blood elf, of course you're doing it for the make out.
149369	152611	Not that there's anything wrong with being gay.
152771	153912	Of course not.
153952	154432	Of course not.
154452	156414	It's only wrong when you're a man.
158135	158675	Of course.
158715	161457	Because penises are gross.
162217	162758	Oh, no.
163118	164939	Roberta, be nice.
165059	166460	We've got some gay listeners.
166480	167201	I'm sorry.
167261	167821	I'm sorry.
169933	171054	I'm sorry about that.
171114	172655	The penis is okay if you're a boy.
173275	176457	So, honey, sweetheart, baby, honey, how was your gaming week?
177137	178698	My gaming week was fantastic.
178858	179939	I played Dead or Alive 4.
183360	184661	And it was amazing.
184681	187062	It has really good graphics.
191605	193786	Jamie, Creamy, how was your baby?
195067	198569	I was playing some Marvel Ultimate Alliance because it's all about Ms.
198609	198869	Marvel.
199705	226632	Miss Marvel, Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman, that's DC, bitch, oh, I'm sorry, and Spider Woman, because of her, it's okay, reverse, that's my baby, Jamie makes me cry, she's okay, touch my boobie, you need to wait until after the radio show, Jamie, I'm sorry, keep going, that's it, I'm,
232470	234291	Jamie, I love you.
235291	238013	Let's go bake a pie and make it better.
238773	240114	Doesn't that sound like fun?
240735	241675	You're a whore.
243896	247959	Just because I slept with your ex-girlfriend doesn't make me a whore.
248679	250060	Okay, then she was slut.
250782	253384	My God, Roberta, you sound like Kirstie Alley.
253424	254005	I'm sorry.
254465	256246	And all this talk with pies and stuff.
256767	259029	What the hell am I doing here anyways, by the way?
259309	271559	Look, I had to bring my ex-girlfriend Matilda on tonight, and I realized she sounds like a scary bulldike man, but she eats really good pussy.
271579	273681	I know that, Jamie.
273701	274021	All the time.
275612	276593	Not as good as my girlfriend.
276613	280334	And we must say that Butch Dykes are always welcome on this show.
280735	284837	Now, we need to... Oh, by the way, how was your gaming week, Roberta?
285897	288759	Well, my gaming week was a lot of fun.
289439	301765	I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live because I wanted to play a game with a character whose month it is.
302165	303326	And it's April!
304093	305193	It's April!
305373	305973	Get it?
306614	307014	Get it?
307214	307854	It was fun.
307914	308814	It was a lot of fun.
309254	314315	I played on Xbox Live, but some stupid boy called me a fag.
314895	316375	I don't like Xbox Live.
316655	318796	They're mean on Xbox Live, aren't they?
318936	321176	They just don't understand girls.
321356	323937	I'm going to go join PMS Clan.
323957	324677	I'm so upset.
326437	328658	They do do a lot of good work, that PMS Clan.
329018	330378	And April looked hot in that jumpsuit.
332526	333927	Girlfriend, how was your gaming week?
334807	345614	Yes, when I'm totally not riding motorcycles or wearing flannel, I was playing lots of Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is fucking awesome.
346855	355620	And yeah, that's pretty much all I was playing this week because I was too busy lezzing out.
359696	360316	That was great.
360336	362978	Does anyone else have anything to contribute to their gaming week?
364498	364659	No.
365799	378385	Okay, well, at least, so we have to get to our first story, and the first story is Uno has reached, I'm sorry, has sold 1 million copies on Xbox Live Arcade!
378445	380707	Yay!
381467	381987	You want to take over?
382027	383408	A million is a lot.
383708	385509	A million is really a lot, isn't it?
386489	387470	It's a bit a lot.
387570	389271	It's just below a trillion.
390695	394536	I didn't even know that there were a million people on Xbox Live.
394936	403217	Because when I tried to play Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live, I had to wait five minutes for that stupid boy to join.
403237	404478	Boys are so gross.
404658	405778	Boys are gross.
406638	407458	Boys are gross.
408018	408578	Stupid boys.
409398	412599	But yes, Uno has sold one million copies.
412779	418000	Now, I personally am not an Uno player, but I know some people are out there.
418767	421929	and I just don't work well with cards, really.
422109	423610	Does anybody have an opinion about this?
424150	428013	I think that this is a travesty because Ms.
428173	435937	Pac-Man, bless her heart, the ultimate diva in gaming, is also available on Xbox Live.
436658	439519	And why hasn't she sold a million copies?
440020	445483	I think all of us lesbians need to band together and make sure that we support
446135	452978	Miss Pac-Man herself and purchase it because she deserves to sell one billion copies.
453198	454179	Isn't that right, Matilda?
454359	456099	That is completely wrong.
456219	461802	I mean, after all, Miss Pac-Man is horrible for, you know, cam-whoring yourself out.
462042	463603	What is wrong with you?
464343	468125	Why do you have to take out our relationship on this show?
468425	470786	We had something beautiful, Matilda.
471306	473027	You're breaking my heart.
473387	475488	Girls, girls, let's stay on topic.
478268	481590	We all know what happens when you move in together.
481671	483192	It's gone in five seconds.
484853	486253	Well, it's not my fault.
486594	490376	The bitch brought a U-Haul on her second date like a typical lesbian.
495379	500302	You girls, if you're going to get this bad about it, you need to take it outside because we're supposed to be talking about games.
502364	503004	I'm sorry.
503344	504285	Yes, you should be sorry.
505262	513566	Alright, now it's time for our favorite part, Slumber Party Discussion!
514767	518349	Who do you think is the hottest chick in gaming?
518909	520550	I'm going to ask my girlfriend.
521851	524152	It's got to be Helena from Dead or Alive.
527233	528114	That's a tough choice.
528314	530655	Jamie, Cookie?
531115	534357	I'm going to go old school and say Sama Saran running around in a bikini.
535907	540990	Justin Bailey, Justin Bailey Really?
543111	564823	Okay Good ex-girlfriend You do realize that Samus' name is not Justin Bailey, by the way No, but see, this is why I know more about gaming than you Because if you put in the code Justin Bailey in Metroid Then you get to see her in her hot little bra and panties The original 8-bit pin-up doll
569142	569722	I see.
569802	570943	Well, me personally.
571943	577566	I'm a little bit new, so I'll have to go with Aerith.
578207	580808	I just like that whole innocent than thou.
580868	581448	You would.
581468	582549	I would.
582609	583550	She's so innocent.
584630	586311	Tifa could kick ass, though.
586711	589533	Tifa and Aerith were having sex, Jamie.
591864	596808	No, no, no, no, because Tifa was having the relationship with Scarlet, hence the bitch fight when they broke up.
598769	600771	This is going to be a long, drawn-out conversation.
600791	602252	I don't want to help with you on the radio, okay?
602913	604014	Fine, we'll take this outside.
604034	606575	Fine, we will take this outside, but first we have to go to another... Okay.
606756	608677	Wait, wait, my girl.
608797	609938	I didn't say mine.
610679	614341	My favorite is Ivy from Soul Calibur.
614782	616463	She can whip me any time.
616703	617924	That girl is a slut.
618084	618485	Hey.
619886	620766	So is Mac's girlfriend.
620806	621487	We don't talk about that.
625229	628290	Okay, next.
630050	636372	Next, there's an announcement that it is now 19 weeks since the release of Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
638793	641573	And there's still been no announcement of a sequel.
641934	644814	Boo!
645274	646935	Coms still run by boys.
647475	648715	Stupid boys.
649796	650636	Let's kill them.
651696	654137	Let's fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.
655853	657254	Anyway, next story.
657734	658494	You know what, though?
659034	667596	From our chat room, SSJ100Matt, even, you know, we forgive you for certain things, but I have to say, did make a good point, but that's my from King of Fighters.
669377	673438	The goddess of boobs.
674078	674358	Yeah.
675518	676538	That is a good point.
676718	677018	All right.
678879	679379	Touche.
680319	680599	All right.
680799	682940	Our next story, it's our final story.
683887	688790	I'm going to hand this over to my girlfriend because she's such a Kingdom Hearts fan.
689270	690531	Honey, baby, it's your turn.
691671	699155	Okay, so the extended ending and trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been released with the final mix video game.
700996	703217	I saw this and there were no hot chicks in it.
705619	707339	It was sad.
707380	711962	I think that was supposed to be the third person in the armor.
715513	722236	I hope it's Tyra Banks.
724337	725078	No, no, no, no.
726138	726618	Not hot.
735343	736963	And that's pretty much it for the Kingdom Hearts thing.
737103	740845	Anyway, does anybody have anything else to contribute to that?
742226	742386	Nope.
743120	749664	Well, I'm looking at our chat room and the sexy stalker says something about a blue haired girl in it.
750204	751364	But I don't know.
751545	753306	I couldn't really see the boobies.
753606	759229	Yeah, she wasn't very hot because I'm a breast kind of girl and she didn't really have a lot of boobage.
759349	764812	So I'm really hoping that maybe if there's another trailer later on, we might see a little bit more of that.
764972	766953	Yeah, yeah, maybe, maybe so.
768666	775469	As a lesbian, I have to say, I'm a little bit upset that Minnie hasn't gotten a lot more press within the Kingdom Hearts.
775949	776809	And I'm just upset.
776829	778049	She's oppressed by the man.
778510	779150	Exactly!
779390	783712	Mickey was holding that phallic Keyblade, and I just think it's sad.
784172	785672	Anyway, that's my opinion on it.
785952	788693	Does anyone else have any things to contribute to that?
788893	789414	Ex-girlfriend?
789714	789954	Anything?
791795	792415	I have nothing.
794033	798996	Alright then, well, that was our last story, which means the show is over.
799416	801557	Oh, wait, wait, we have an announcement!
801998	805560	Well, we hope you've enjoyed tonight's program.
805580	812924	If you haven't already figured out, we haven't really replaced Orange Lingerie or anything, we're just having a little fun like lesbians do.
815333	816454	I mean, look at today's date.
816494	817974	Hello, it's April 1st, 2007.
818594	820394	And you know what that means.
820494	821535	Everybody say it with me.
821555	823875	April Fools!
824715	826616	I do not sound like this in normal life.
828516	832077	Yeah, in case any real lesbians are listening tonight, we hope you didn't get offended.
832517	840239	But the whole idea was inspired from a review I saw on our podcast once that said we were nothing but a bunch of giggling lesbians lately.
840359	841599	So I thought, hey.
842597	844118	Let's give the people what they want!
867270	896325	so that way if people don't really want to listen to the April Fool's joke they can skip right past it because it is a little silly although we did do the stories we talked about were legitimate there really was a Kingdom Hearts 3 thing at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 and the whole Uno thing Kingdom Hearts 3rd Strike or whatever they're going to call it so anyway we're going to take a real quick musical break for those folks listening live for those on the podcast if you just downloaded this on April 1st in just a few hours the real show will hit the podcast feed and for those of you guys listening live we're going to take a quick break
896690	898531	and come back with tonight's real show.
898611	899931	So thank you guys for putting up with us.
899971	901112	Hope we didn't drag it out too long.
901412	903893	Chris, you did a great job, especially with like five minutes notice.
903913	904993	I was freaking scared.
905013	914837	All right, but the good news is Chris and Maisie are going to join us for our regular show and give us a real down-to-earth, not the playboy lesbian, you know, that's all fake airbrush.
914877	915977	So we're going to see.
916117	919359	I'm going to hit you with a pillow.
920079	921779	All right, so we'll be back after this quick.
921799	922840	With your dirty pillows.
924940	928222	We'll be back after a quick music break with the real Orange Lounge Radio.
