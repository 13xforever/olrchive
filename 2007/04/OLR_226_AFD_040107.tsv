0	19320	Welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show, with your hosts, Chris and Megsy.
19320	21320	Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
21320	23800	She is not a lesbian.
23800	25920	All I know is that I can play.
25920	34160	Gather up your pillows, make up, ice cream sundaes, and Xboxes, it's time for the show
34160	35160	to begin.
35160	42160	Hi, and welcome to the Giggling Lesbian Game Show.
42160	47760	How is everybody out there in radio land tonight?
47760	53680	I'm your host, the ever always lesbian Chris.
53680	59360	And with me forever, of course, is my beautiful, wonderful, lovey-dovey, little, wonderful
59360	63600	girlfriend, Megsy, with the size C cup.
63600	65640	Say hi, baby.
65640	66640	Hi, everyone.
66640	75940	And of course, always with me is my cream-filled Jamie, how is my sweetheart?
75940	77880	I'm an angst cookie, as usual.
77880	78880	Anx cookie?
78880	80880	Not any good clit-loving, honey?
80880	82880	No, just a stupid man.
82880	83880	I'm sorry.
83880	84880	Boys are bad.
84880	85880	Sad face.
85880	86880	Sad face.
86880	93880	And of course, always we have to introduce our special guest, Roberta Roberts.
93880	95880	Sweetheart, give me a kiss.
95880	97880	Hi, baby.
97880	98880	How are you doing?
98880	101880	My gosh, did your breasts get bigger?
101880	103880	You are so hot, honey.
103880	104880	I love you.
104880	107880	They have gotten a little bit bigger.
107880	110880	I've been using this cream on them, but I digress.
110880	112880	Are you okay?
112880	113880	Gosh, Roberta.
113880	114880	Dead or alive.
114880	115880	Dead or alive.
115880	116880	Dead or alive.
116880	117880	I know.
117880	118880	Boobies.
118880	119880	Boobies.
119880	125880	But first, we have to talk about our gaming week, sweetheart.
125880	128880	So first of all, I'll go first.
128880	134880	My gaming week was, of course, I had to be playing WoW, and I only play my Blood Elf because
134880	137880	she does the sexy dance when I do this thing with her.
137880	139880	You do the dance thing.
139880	141880	I played a guy Blood Elf.
141880	143880	Those guys are so gay.
143880	145880	I mean, really.
145880	148880	If you're playing a guy Blood Elf, of course you're doing it for the make out.
148880	152880	Not that there's anything wrong with being gay.
152880	153880	Of course not.
153880	154880	Of course not.
154880	157880	It's only wrong when you're a man.
157880	158880	Of course.
158880	161880	Because penises are gross.
161880	162880	Oh, no.
162880	164880	Roberta, be nice.
164880	166880	You've got some gay listeners.
166880	167880	I'm sorry.
167880	168880	I'm sorry.
168880	169880	Gosh.
169880	170880	I'm sorry about that.
170880	172880	The penis is okay if you're a boy.
172880	174880	So honey, sweetheart, baby.
174880	176880	Honey, how was your gaming week?
176880	178880	My gaming week was fantastic.
178880	184880	I played Dead or Alive 4, and it was amazing.
184880	187880	It has really good graphics.
187880	188880	Please.
188880	189880	Please.
189880	194880	Jamie, Creamy, how was your baby?
194880	198880	I was playing some Marvel Ultimate Alliance because it's all about Ms. Marvel.
198880	199880	Ms. Marvel.
199880	200880	Wonder Woman.
200880	201880	Wonder Woman.
201880	203880	That's DC, you bitch.
203880	205880	Oh, I'm sorry.
205880	208880	And Spider Woman because of her...
208880	209880	It's okay, Roberta.
209880	210880	It's okay, baby.
210880	212880	Jamie makes me cry.
212880	214880	She is okay.
214880	217880	Touch my booby.
217880	221880	You need to wait until after the radio show.
221880	223880	Jamie, I'm sorry.
223880	225880	That's it.
225880	226880	I'm...
226880	227880	Come on, now.
227880	228880	Come on.
228880	231880	Jamie, I love you.
231880	237880	Let's go bake a pie and make it better.
237880	239880	Doesn't that sound like fun?
239880	242880	You're a whore.
242880	247880	Just because I slept with your ex-girlfriend doesn't make me a whore.
247880	249880	I can't make you a slut.
249880	250880	My God.
250880	252880	Roberta, you sound like Kersey Alley.
252880	253880	I'm sorry.
253880	255880	And all this talk with pies and stuff.
255880	258880	What the hell am I doing here anyways, by the way?
258880	265880	Look, I had to bring my ex-girlfriend Matilda on tonight and I realized she sounds like
265880	271880	a scary bull dyke man, but she eats really good pussy.
271880	273880	I don't know that, Jamie.
273880	274880	Not as good as me.
274880	275880	Not as good as my girlfriend.
275880	279880	And we must say that butch dykes are always welcome on this show.
279880	284880	By the way, how was your gaming week, Roberta?
284880	288880	Well, my gaming week was a lot of fun.
288880	298880	I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live because I wanted to play a game with
298880	301880	a character whose month it is.
301880	302880	It's April.
302880	303880	It's April.
303880	304880	Get it?
304880	305880	Get it?
305880	306880	It was fun.
306880	308880	It was a lot of fun.
308880	314880	I played on Xbox Live, but some stupid boy called me a fag.
314880	316880	I don't like Xbox Live.
316880	318880	They're mean on Xbox Live, aren't they?
318880	320880	They just don't understand girls.
320880	323880	I'm going to go join PMS Clan.
323880	324880	I'm so upset.
324880	328880	They do do a lot of good work, that PMS Clan.
328880	331880	And April looked hot in that jumpsuit.
331880	334880	Ex-girlfriend, how was your gaming week?
334880	341880	Yes, when I'm totally not riding motorcycles or wearing flannel, I was playing lots of
341880	346880	Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is fucking awesome.
346880	355880	Yeah, that's pretty much all I was playing this week because I was too busy lezzing out.
355880	357880	That was great.
357880	364880	Does anyone else have anything to contribute to their gaming week?
364880	365880	No.
365880	366880	Okay.
366880	375880	So we have to get to our first story, and the first story is Uno has sold one million
375880	377880	copies on Xbox Live Arcade.
377880	378880	Yay!
378880	381880	A million is a lot.
381880	384880	A million is really a lot, isn't it?
384880	386880	It's a bit a lot.
386880	389880	It's just below a trillion.
389880	395880	I didn't even know that there were a million people on Xbox Live because when I tried to
395880	402880	play Ninja Turtles on Xbox Live, I had to wait five minutes for that stupid boy to join.
402880	403880	Boys are so gross.
403880	405880	Boys are gross.
405880	407880	Boys are gross.
407880	408880	Stupid boys.
408880	411880	But yes, Uno has sold one million copies.
411880	419880	Now, I personally am not an Uno player, but I know some people are out there, and I just
419880	421880	don't work well with cards really.
421880	423880	Does anybody have an opinion about this?
423880	430880	I think that this is a travesty because Ms. Pac-Man, bless her heart, the ultimate diva
430880	439880	in gaming, is also available on Xbox Live, and why hasn't she sold a million copies?
439880	446880	I think all of us lesbians need to band together and make sure that we support Ms. Thing, Ms.
446880	452880	Pac-Man herself, and purchase it because she deserves to sell one billion copies.
452880	453880	Isn't that right, Matilda?
453880	455880	That is completely wrong.
455880	461880	I mean, after all, Ms. Pac-Man is horrible for, you know, cam-whoring yourself out.
461880	463880	What is wrong with you?
463880	467880	Why do you have to take out our relationship on this show?
467880	470880	We had something beautiful, Matilda.
470880	471880	Now, girls.
471880	472880	You're breaking my heart.
472880	475880	Girls, girls, let's stay on topic.
475880	477880	Stay on topic.
477880	480880	We all know what happens when you move in together.
480880	483880	It's gone in five seconds.
483880	485880	Well, it's not my fault.
485880	494880	The bitch brought a U-Haul on her second date like a typical lesbian.
494880	498880	You girls, if you're going to get this bad about it, you need to take it outside because
498880	500880	we're supposed to be talking about games.
500880	501880	Games for the rublies.
501880	502880	I'm sorry.
502880	504880	Yes, you should be sorry.
504880	505880	All right.
505880	508880	Now it's time for our favorite party.
508880	514880	Slumber party discussion.
514880	518880	Who do you think is the hottest chick in gaming?
518880	521880	I'm going to ask my girlfriend.
521880	524880	It's got to be Helena from Dead or Alive.
524880	527880	That's a tough choice.
527880	529880	Jamie, Cookie.
529880	535880	I'm going to go old school and say Samus Aran running around in the bikini.
535880	539880	Justin Bailey, Justin Bailey.
539880	541880	Really?
541880	543880	Okay.
543880	545880	Your ex-girlfriend?
545880	551880	You do realize that Samus' name is not Justin Bailey, by the way.
551880	555880	No, but see, this is why I know more about gaming than you because if you put in the
555880	561880	code, Justin Bailey in Metroid, then you get to see her in her hot little bra and panties,
561880	565880	the original 8-bit pinup doll.
565880	568880	Ooh.
568880	569880	I see.
569880	571880	Well, me personally.
571880	577880	I'm a little bit new, so I'll have to go with Aerith.
577880	579880	I just like that whole innocent-
579880	581880	You would.
581880	582880	I would.
582880	584880	She's so innocent.
584880	586880	Tifa could kick ass, though.
586880	590880	Tifa and Aerith were having sex, Jamie.
590880	591880	You know this from that.
591880	595880	No, no, no, no, because Tifa was having the relationship with Scarlet, hence the bitch
595880	598880	fight when they broke up.
598880	601880	This is going to be a long drawn-out conversation, and I don't want to have with you on the radio,
601880	602880	okay?
602880	603880	Fine, we'll take this outside.
603880	606880	Fine, we will take this outside, but first we have to go to another-
606880	607880	Okay.
607880	608880	Wait, wait.
608880	609880	My girl, I didn't say mine.
609880	614880	My favorite is Ivy from Soul Calibur.
614880	616880	She can wit me any time.
616880	618880	That girl is a slut.
618880	620880	Hey, so's Mack's girlfriend.
620880	624880	We don't talk about that.
624880	625880	Okay.
625880	635880	Next, there's an announcement that it is now 19 weeks since the release of Dead or Alive
635880	641880	Extreme 2, and there's still been no announcement of a sequel.
641880	642880	Boo.
642880	643880	Boo.
643880	646880	Calm's still run by boys.
646880	647880	Stupid boys.
647880	648880	Stupid boys.
648880	650880	Let's kill them.
650880	654880	Let's fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.
654880	657880	Anyway, next story.
657880	658880	You know what, though, though?
658880	664880	From our chat room, SSJ100Matt, we forgive you for certain things, but I have to say
664880	670880	did make a good point, but that's Mai from King of Fighters, the goddess of boobs.
670880	671880	Ooh.
671880	672880	Ooh, please.
672880	673880	Yeah.
673880	676880	That is a good point.
676880	677880	All right.
677880	678880	Touché.
678880	679880	All right.
679880	682880	Our next story, it's our final story.
682880	688880	I'm going to hand this over to my girlfriend because she's such a Kingdom Hearts fan.
688880	691880	Honey, baby, it's your turn.
691880	692880	Okay.
692880	697880	The extended ending and trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been released with the final
697880	700880	mix video game.
700880	703880	I saw this, and there were no hot chicks in it.
703880	705880	It was sad.
705880	711880	I think that was supposed to be, though, wasn't that... It was the third person in the armor.
711880	713880	Wasn't it supposed to be, like-
713880	714880	That's me, baby.
714880	716880	Wasn't it supposed to be Kairi?
716880	717880	I hope not.
717880	719880	Kairi was a flex.
719880	720880	Maybe.
720880	722880	I hope it's Tyra Banks.
722880	724880	No, no, no, no.
724880	725880	I've got biz on me.
725880	726880	Not hot.
726880	727880	I think that's it.
727880	736880	And that's pretty much it for the Kingdom Hearts thing.
736880	741880	Anyway, does anybody have anything else to contribute to that?
741880	742880	No?
742880	748880	Well, I'm looking at our chat room, and the sexy stalker says something about a blue-haired
748880	750880	girl in it, but I don't know.
750880	752880	I couldn't really see the boobies.
752880	757880	Yeah, she wasn't very hot because I'm a breast kind of girl, and she didn't really have a
757880	762880	lot of boobage, so I'm really hoping that maybe if there's another trailer later on,
762880	765880	we might see a little bit more of that.
765880	766880	Maybe, maybe.
766880	773880	As a lesbian, I have to say I'm a little bit upset that Minnie hasn't gotten a lot more
773880	776880	press within the Kingdom Hearts, and I'm just upset.
776880	778880	She's oppressed by the man.
778880	779880	Exactly.
779880	783880	Mickey was holding that phallic keyblade, and I just think it's sad.
783880	785880	Anyway, that's my opinion on it.
785880	790880	Does anyone else have any things to contribute to that, ex-girlfriend?
790880	791880	Anything?
791880	792880	I have nothing.
792880	793880	All right, then.
793880	798880	Well, that was our last story, which means the show's over.
798880	799880	Oh, wait, wait.
799880	800880	We have an announcement.
800880	804880	Well, we hope you've enjoyed tonight's program.
804880	809880	If you haven't already figured out, we haven't really replaced Orange Lounge Radio or anything.
809880	812880	We're just having a little fun like lesbians do.
812880	815880	I mean, look at today's date.
815880	816880	Hello.
816880	818880	It's April 1st, 2007.
818880	819880	I know what that means.
819880	821880	Everybody say it with me.
821880	823880	April Fools!
823880	826880	I do not sound like this in normal life.
826880	827880	Me neither.
827880	831880	Yeah, in case any real lesbians are listening tonight, we hope you didn't get offended.
831880	837880	But the whole idea was inspired from a review I saw in our podcast once that said we were
837880	839880	nothing but a bunch of giggling lesbians lately.
839880	843880	So I thought, hey, let's give the people what they want.
843880	849880	And so Chris and Megsy were so kind to come here and be very stereotypical forms of their
849880	851880	usual selves and play along in tonight's April Fools!
851880	852880	joke.
852880	854880	So we hope you guys enjoyed it.
854880	855880	Except for Matt.
855880	856880	You sound like Chris Yalley.
856880	857880	I know.
857880	858880	What's up with that?
858880	859880	Well, I have no voice.
859880	860880	So.
860880	861880	All right.
861880	865880	Well, anyway, we're actually going to put this up as a special edition of our podcast,
865880	866880	just a quick little show.
866880	869880	So that way, if people don't really want to listen to the April Fools!
869880	872880	joke, they can skip right past it because it is a little silly, although we did do the
872880	874880	stories we talked about were legitimate.
874880	877880	There really was a Kingdom Hearts 3 thing at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2 and the whole
877880	878880	Uno thing.
878880	881880	Kingdom Hearts 3rd Strike or whatever they're going to call it.
881880	885880	Anyway, we're going to take a real quick musical break for those folks listening live, for
