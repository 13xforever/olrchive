0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	24000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on Sunday, April 1, 2007.
24000	28000	We already did our April Fool's joke. The rest of the show is legit.
28000	35000	If you want to check out our fun little April Fool's joke, go back in our podcast archive or audio archive, whatever you want to call it, and check it out.
35000	36000	It's there.
36000	38000	But we have a lot of news this break.
38000	42000	Some video game noobs and Dark Sakura and Loki joining me as always.
42000	47000	Also joining me tonight, Chris and Meg Z, the OLR lesbians.
47000	49000	Hi.
49000	50000	Alright.
50000	53000	Let's go to the Xbox 360.
53000	63000	Xbox 360 Elite is official, which further proves the point that all Microsoft rumors are true, except the ones that came out today on April 1.
63000	67000	But we all knew the black Xbox 360 was coming for some time.
67000	69000	And Loki, I got to hand it to you.
69000	74000	Last week when we went over this on the show, you called it a 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.
74000	76000	You called the price down to the dollar.
76000	78000	It's not that hard.
78000	80000	It's really not, but it's still kind of impressive.
80000	84000	The premium system and the Elite system are the price of the core plus the hard drive.
84000	88000	So the pro system being $399.
88000	91000	The hard drive is $100 to the 20 gig.
91000	96000	So I figured, OK, $479 so that the hard drive is probably $179.
96000	98000	And what do you know?
98000	100000	They kept to the pattern.
100000	102000	So yay me.
102000	109000	Well, the Elite will be coming with this 120 gigabyte hard drive, and it's coming out for $479 on April 29.
109000	114000	The Elite also comes with an HDMI port and comes in sexy black.
114000	116000	They're bringing sexy black.
116000	118000	I'm bringing sexy black.
118000	119000	Wow.
119000	122000	Just because it's April Fool's Day doesn't mean I ran out of bad jokes.
122000	125000	That was not an invitation to break into song.
125000	131000	Also, black wireless controllers, black battery packs, and black play and charge kits will be coming out as well.
131000	133000	Pretty exciting stuff.
133000	134000	And black headsets.
134000	135000	Although, I don't know.
135000	137000	It's exciting stuff for some people, but not for me.
137000	144000	Because the first Xbox period was black.
144000	148000	So hooray for having a black console for Microsoft.
148000	149000	I mean, we've already had one.
149000	150000	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
150000	152000	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
152000	154000	People still buy the black console.
154000	155000	Why?
155000	159000	Because the DS Lite came out and it's white, and now the black one came out and everyone's like,
159000	160000	Oh my God, I got to get it black.
160000	161000	Or pink.
161000	162000	Pink.
162000	163000	Oh, no one wants pink.
163000	164000	I've got a pink one.
164000	165000	Black.
165000	166000	You know, it's just, I don't know.
166000	168000	People are suckers for new colors.
168000	169000	Yeah, that's true.
169000	175000	It's like, one of the things you look at in marketing is the color of something.
175000	178000	As long as it's different from whatever it was before, it'll be more popular.
178000	180000	And also, it's only limited time.
180000	181000	It's going to go back to the white.
181000	184000	So buy the black ones while you can.
184000	185000	Random thought.
185000	188000	The low-end PlayStation 3 is $4.99.
188000	195000	So isn't it interesting that Microsoft's kind of getting close to entering Sony's price range,
195000	197000	especially when they have their own little back and forth and stuff?
197000	200000	As they would say, it's all about choices.
200000	203000	You don't have to buy that Elite One.
203000	205000	Although, if you want HDMI, you do.
205000	207000	So, hooray.
207000	212000	JeremyTod1 wants you to know, the DS Lite is a handheld, not a console.
212000	213000	Aha, touche.
213000	215000	Okay, fine.
215000	222000	Let's see then, how about, well, the GameCube came in multiple colors.
222000	225000	Look at the PlayStation 2 Slim.
225000	227000	That came out in multiple colors.
227000	232000	Or PlayStation 2, the original system, came out in multiple colors in different countries.
232000	234000	I mean, who cares?
234000	235000	It doesn't matter.
235000	236000	It's just a fucking console.
236000	240000	To be honest, if you really wanted a black console, you can do it for like $60.
240000	243000	Or get some spray paint and you can do it even less.
243000	245000	I mean, seriously.
245000	249000	Rama's in our chat room, taping live here on Sunday nights.
249000	251000	Chad.orangelandtrader.com.
251000	255000	Rama says, I have a big black Wii.
255000	262000	And if you know Rama, then that's funny if you're six years old.
262000	267000	Or if you're a lesbian, apparently.
267000	272000	If you hear the cackling in the background, that's the two lesbians giggling at Rama's big black Wii.
272000	274000	Anyways.
274000	275000	Isn't he cute?
275000	279000	So, with the 120 gigabyte system, you're probably wondering a few things like,
279000	284000	say for example you do have a 20 gig hard drive, how are you going to move your stuff over?
284000	289000	Well, you'll be happy to know that it is going to come with a data cable.
289000	296000	So, if you do have one of the older hard drives, you can transfer your saves using that data cable to the new hard drive.
296000	299000	However, you cannot transfer more than one hard drive.
299000	305000	And I remember previously they suggested that you get more than one hard drive for those digital downloads and stuff.
305000	311000	Well, you're fucked because if you put another hard drive on there, it will just overwrite all the data on there.
311000	315000	That also being said, you know...
315000	321000	Well, not to sound like a cock, but it's not that hard to switch the hard drives out.
321000	328000	I mean, if you could afford multiple hard drives, is it really going to kill you to switch the one out and put the other one in?
328000	330000	It makes you say yes.
330000	332000	Y'all are some lazy bitches.
332000	337000	No. Well, here's what I'd suggest though.
337000	341000	If you're going to run into these problems and you don't like these restrictions that they have on there,
341000	345000	buy the XSATA or something very similar to that.
345000	351000	It's one of those devices you can buy for 50 bucks, you can transfer stuff to your PC, vice versa and stuff.
351000	355000	Just transfer, dump everything on your PC, dump it back onto the hard drive.
355000	356000	There you go.
356000	358000	You can do multiple hard drives, whatever.
358000	361000	So, do that if you don't like these restrictions.
361000	363000	Otherwise, stick with the free cable.
363000	369000	The other thing, much like the original hard drive, it's going to be loaded full of crap.
369000	377000	And, you know, as you probably remember before, and I'm kind of wondering how much of that 120 gigs is actually available to use,
377000	386000	because you remember before in the 20 gig one, 7 gigs is for the updates and stuff for the emulation.
386000	389000	So, logic tells me 113.
389000	393000	Well, there's been more updates since then and that partition might be bigger.
393000	394000	Touch√©.
394000	402000	Anyway, so, what you're going to get, or I should say, have to delete off your hard drive are the following things.
402000	406000	For trailers, you're going to be getting the Forza 2 customization damage videos,
406000	414000	Halo Wars Fable 2, Halo 3 TV ad, Halo 3 trailer, Halo 3 8.2 Brute video,
414000	420000	Accessory TV Spot, Wireless World video, and Holiday 06 accessories video.
420000	422000	Why the fuck do they have this stuff on there for free?
422000	427000	I don't understand, because you can download it off of Live for free.
427000	429000	Not everybody gets on Live though.
429000	430000	Oh, goody.
430000	437000	So, they really probably want to see the Holiday 06 accessories video, because I'm sure that's really exciting.
437000	442000	You know, I have to be honest, when I first bought my Xbox 360, I did watch some of the videos on there,
442000	447000	because I was like, oh, hi-def videos on my HDTV, that's kind of pretty, because I didn't have an HD DVD player,
447000	449000	and I don't think Comcast had been installed yet for the HD.
449000	451000	It was kind of fun, I don't know.
451000	453000	I deleted those.
453000	454000	Well, I deleted them since then.
454000	461000	Other things you'll have on there, playable demos, including Assault Heroes, Cloning Clyde, Geometry Wars,
461000	467000	Marble Blast Ultra, Small Arms, Feeding Frenzy, Uno, Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Luminous Live,
467000	474000	Zuma, Heavy Weapon, Lego Star Wars 2, Lost Planet, the multiplayer one, Madden 07, Fusion Frenzy 2,
474000	479000	and Call of Duty 3, and of course, like usual, Hexac HD will be on there, the full game.
479000	481000	Wow.
481000	483000	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
483000	490000	But then again though, from what I hear, if you do end up having to transfer your stuff over to that new hard drive,
490000	492000	you'll wipe it all out anyways.
492000	497000	Some real quick chat comments before we get to our next story.
497000	502000	In chat we have Hostile One says, I guess they don't want people sharing downloaded games.
502000	504000	I mean, with this whole...
504000	508000	Well, at least with that free cable, you're going to have to buy an extra tool to do that.
508000	514000	Mystic Gohan asks, does anyone know if the 360 uses USB hard drives for storage?
514000	516000	No, it does not.
516000	518000	Big fat no, sorry.
518000	521000	Mystic Gohan also asks, who would buy a 120GB hard drive without Live?
521000	525000	What would be the point, other than music, which I doubt is what someone would do?
525000	526000	Good point, good point.
526000	529000	Seems fairly pointless.
529000	532000	Some people, Magsy, what was this?
532000	534000	Well, okay, this is my first reaction.
534000	537000	It's like, ooh, it's bigger and better, I must have it.
537000	539000	You know what, it's a valid point.
539000	542000	There are not a lot of people, but there are a small amount of people.
542000	546000	It's like, ooh, big, new, shiny, must have.
546000	549000	No.
549000	554000	But you want to know what's funny, though, is that Sony is taking all the credit for the idea.
554000	565000	Well, they're going around saying that, you know, there's actually a quote from their SVP of marketing
565000	569000	saying, we think that every PlayStation 3 owner should have the elite experience,
569000	574000	which is why we include an internal hard drive and HDMI output in every PS3 we sell,
574000	579000	along with the 50 gigabytes of storage capacity on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.
579000	586000	So they're all trying to do, like, oh, well, we're all hot shit, and, you know, they're trying to be like us.
586000	593000	It's getting really soap opera-y and kind of fun to watch what's going on between Microsoft and Sony,
593000	598000	because like with the UK launch where Microsoft was, like, crashing the party with those big Xbox 360
598000	604000	heart shoe signs and stuff, it's kind of getting funny watching the two fight like little bitches.
604000	606000	It's great. I mean, I'm eating this shit up.
606000	610000	There should be a podcast all to, like, dramatizing this whole thing.
610000	613000	These are the days of our gaming.
613000	614000	Maisie, I'll put you in charge of that project.
614000	615000	They should do a reality show like that.
615000	617000	All right. Cool.
617000	618000	All right.
618000	625000	Well, I have another story, speaking of which, which is an interesting follow-up,
625000	630000	because, you know, Sony says that, you know, welcome to the elite status Xbox 360.
630000	636000	But what's interesting is that Sony actually filed something on March 2nd, 2007,
636000	643000	indicating that they are going to be releasing another PlayStation 3 model with an 80-gigabyte hard drive.
643000	645000	It was something that, you know, they were running it by the FCC.
645000	647000	They have to get the approval and all that stuff.
647000	650000	Could this be a whole new model?
650000	652000	Could this just be a storage upgrade?
652000	656000	I don't know, but Sony kind of was doing a little bit of damage control earlier this week with the whole thing.
656000	657000	I remember reading a little later.
657000	659000	Well, we have no plans to do that.
659000	663000	Except we do have plans to do that.
663000	664000	I don't know.
664000	666000	No, we're not copying them.
666000	668000	We are not copying them.
668000	670000	How many times has Sony done that, though, really?
670000	674000	Like, you know, back when, I think it was E3 2004, I think,
674000	678000	was when the, it was announced that the 360 was going to have two packages,
678000	681000	and Sony just lapped them, and then, you know, what happened with the PS3 is two packages.
681000	682000	Good point.
682000	686000	Yes, because of hard drive size, that's why people aren't buying your console.
686000	689000	It must be because the hard drive's not 80 gigs.
689000	690000	That's why.
690000	692000	That's why you're not selling any systems.
692000	696000	Well, rumor goes around that Ken Kutaragi wants 250 gigabytes.
696000	697000	Great!
697000	699000	Two, great, so the system will be...
699000	701000	Hey, you know how many Crayolas that holds?
701000	703000	You know what I'm doing with my system?
703000	706000	And I'll tell you right now, we're loading that shit with porn.
706000	708000	I kid you not.
708000	713000	That is what we are doing with that 20 gigabytes I have in there.
713000	714000	Maybe.
714000	717000	I do have lesbian porn in HD, so we can do that, but...
717000	720000	I've seen the lesbian porn in HD, it's pretty weird.
720000	722000	Wait, you have pirates on HD DVD, don't you?
722000	724000	Oh my god, bring that shit over, I have an HD DVD player.
724000	725000	Okay.
725000	729000	Yeah, I have the highest budgeted porn in my possession that's HD DVD.
729000	730000	It's actually pretty funny.
730000	733000	Hey, I wonder if I can get that in Blu-ray.
733000	734000	You can.
734000	735000	No, maybe.
735000	741000	The porn industry signed their allegiance over to HDTV.
741000	742000	Blu-ray's going down.
742000	745000	Sorry guys, we forgot we were a video game show for a minute.
745000	747000	Hey, it's talking about...
747000	749000	I'm talking about video games, so I'm just saying though,
749000	752000	that's the only use I've found for the 20 gigs that I have in there right now,
752000	755000	and I couldn't imagine if I had 250 gigs, I guess.
755000	758000	It'd be cool if you could use it as external storage or something.
758000	760000	More porn.
760000	763000	That's what I was thinking.
763000	767000	All right, well, I don't know about you guys,
767000	770000	but if you're Dark Sakura and you only own a Blu-ray player,
770000	775000	you're pretty pissed to hear that HD DVD is going to get the porn industry,
775000	778000	and I know that makes Dark Sakura a little bit angsty, right?
778000	779000	No, not really.
779000	780000	Roll with me here, because we've got...
780000	781000	Makes me angsty.
781000	784000	Oh, so angry.
784000	787000	Maybe I'll just use the music to do this.
787000	797000	If you're not mad about the Blu-ray,
797000	800000	then find something else to F you of the week, Dark Sakura.
800000	807000	My rage is the fact that I can't find any decent Deadpool icons for LiveJournal,
807000	812000	so I have to make them myself.
812000	816000	That's really it, because I've had a pretty darn good week.
816000	818000	I graduated!
818000	819000	Congratulations.
819000	822000	Seriously, those who have been listening to the show for a long time,
822000	824000	I know you've been working hard at the massage stuff.
824000	826000	I am a fucking massage therapist now, bitches.
826000	828000	I want my Happy Birthday!
828000	829000	No!
829000	830000	Oh, great.
830000	832000	I'm really glad to hear you've graduated.
832000	834000	Now, Jamie, I have a real sore spot right here.
834000	836000	$75.
836000	838000	Low-key.
838000	840000	F you to Epson.
840000	844000	I tried refilling my printer ink.
844000	848000	Apparently there's some fine print that they don't like to talk about,
848000	854000	and that fine print would be that you can only use Epson cartridges for your Epson printers.
854000	859000	I have the Photo R300 or whatever,
859000	862000	and apparently I tried buying generic brand ink,
862000	866000	because in the past for every other fucking printer I've owned, it works.
866000	871000	I understand that maybe the quality of the ink or whatever may be the last big deal.
871000	876000	I'm willing to spare the extra dollars for lower quality ink.
876000	877000	Whatever.
877000	880000	But when I put it in my printer, after spending, I might add,
880000	882000	even on this cheaper ink, $60,
882000	885000	because that's how much it costs to refill the fucking ink and this stuff,
885000	890000	it said we've detected that this is not Epson ink,
890000	895000	and please use genuine products, and it will not work at all.
895000	898000	So that's money just down the drain.
898000	899000	Thank you, Epson.
899000	901000	I'm not buying any more of your products.
901000	904000	In fact, I'm thinking about dumping my printer into the dumpster.
904000	909000	So fuck you, and I'm writing some hate mail to you.
909000	911000	Build on eBay. They'll always help.
911000	913000	Better business bureau.
913000	915000	All right. Is that it?
915000	918000	Well, I was going to say, if you're looking for a printer out there,
918000	922000	Epson, I think Canon, HP, they all have the chips inside of them
922000	925000	that will count how many days go by or whatever,
925000	929000	and basically your cartridge will stop working after so many days,
929000	931000	even if you don't print anything.
931000	934000	So just that in mind, you want to make sure you freeze them
934000	935000	when you first get them.
935000	937000	If you get software off the internet, feel free to do that.
937000	939000	Just be careful when you're buying stuff.
939000	944000	Read up on it first.
944000	946000	More FUs of the Week from me. I have many tonight.
946000	948000	One FU to April Fool's Day.
948000	952000	This is my least favorite day of the year, because everybody's a damn fool.
952000	956000	This is my voice for making me sound like a 12-year-old all over again tonight.
956000	962000	And I want to say FU to folks that don't...
962000	969000	Folks that sometimes don't have to work for what they're given very hard,
969000	973000	and sometimes folks are kind of giving things on a silver platter
973000	975000	and it makes them a little bit ungrateful.
975000	978000	I'm not... I'm talking about people who are ungrateful.
978000	980000	I'm not talking about anybody. No, no, no.
980000	985000	This is something completely in another dimension.
985000	989000	Because there are people I know that are, you know, fortunate,
989000	992000	but are yet humble, if that makes sense.
992000	997000	There's a big difference between that and being un-humble.
997000	1003000	So there's certain people out there that should have to work harder for the FUs.
1003000	1005000	And then I would also like to give a big FU to the fact
1005000	1007000	I have to pee so fucking bad right now,
1007000	1011000	so I'm going to run out of the room while Chris and Megsy do their FUs.
1011000	1013000	I found something for Megsy just now.
1013000	1018000	I found an icon of Emma Foster's boobs that makes me happy.
1018000	1020000	I'm angsty. Okay.
1020000	1025000	Oh, FU. Okay, my FU goes to the guy that was sitting behind us
1025000	1028000	during T. and Susan's turtles, which we went to see today.
1028000	1032000	This guy sitting behind us first had the nerve to talk on his cell phone
1032000	1034000	during the first part of the film, which was annoying,
1034000	1036000	but I mean, he's just like, oh, I'll call you back.
1036000	1040000	I liked his cell phone ring, which was like, don't pick up the phone.
1040000	1042000	That was his cell phone ring. Don't pick up the phone.
1042000	1044000	Which was fucking annoying to begin with.
1044000	1047000	And then after that, like maybe 20 minutes later,
1047000	1050000	we hear someone kind of snoring.
1050000	1055000	This guy started talking on his cell phone and then fell asleep and was snoring.
1055000	1059000	I really wish I had some possible reflection like throwing back at him.
1059000	1062000	He should have thrown some reason at his head, then you would have given him a reason to wake up.
1062000	1066000	Hell yeah.
1066000	1070000	Well, I don't really have a big FU of the week,
1070000	1075000	except for your people who cannot take a joke, Mickey.
1075000	1082000	I'm not going to elaborate too much since we spent like a half an hour of me bitching about it.
1082000	1085000	So I'm not going to elaborate.
1085000	1090000	But FU to the people on April Fools who fall for an April Fools joke
1090000	1095000	and then can't take a fucking joke, you losers.
1095000	1098000	I don't mean that. You guys are nice, but seriously, fuck off.
1098000	1099000	I mean it then.
1099000	1100000	Okay, Jamie means it.
1100000	1104000	Dude, this is the best icon ever. It's the one where Kitty has a gun at Emma's head.
1104000	1106000	That's hot.
1106000	1107000	Did Maisie do hers?
1107000	1109000	Yeah, we're done.
1109000	1112000	Sorry, I was peeing. I didn't know.
1112000	1113000	You and your peeing, Ross.
1113000	1117000	Well, look, when Mother Nature calls, I've learned you probably want to answer.
1117000	1121000	Because if you hang up on her, she's not going to like that.
1121000	1124000	Mother Nature will do that to you.
1124000	1125000	She's killing you for that shit.
1125000	1127000	Let's get back into the news.
1127000	1130000	Anyways, speaking of killing you.
1130000	1132000	No, well, I'm not really dying in this case.
1132000	1143000	But Sony, CR, and Vivendi, I guess, are being sued because Spyro has induced seizures in somebody's baby.
1143000	1159000	Yes, Corinne Gamespot is reporting that a mother of a child who suffered permanent disability injuries from a grand mal seizure while playing Spyro Enter the Dragonfly has filed suit in New York State Supreme Court.
1159000	1165000	And she names all those three companies and seeks unspecified damages.
1165000	1174000	And you might want to point out also that it is in the manual. There is an epilepsy warning in there.
1174000	1179000	And it is common practice in the video game software industry to put that stuff in there.
1179000	1182000	So I think it's your own damn fault, to be honest.
1182000	1185000	Yeah, you know, it's funny because you always see those warnings.
1185000	1187000	Like, I know I see those warnings all the time.
1187000	1192000	And I always just kind of go, oh, gosh, I must really kind of, like, suck if that's, you know, you.
1192000	1195000	I mean, sometimes we take certain things for granted that, you know.
1195000	1204000	But to kind of hear that somebody's going to sue over that is kind of like, well, I mean, I know I see that thing all the time because I've thought about people who might want to be careful about that.
1204000	1205000	I don't know.
1205000	1209000	I've actually got a friend with epilepsy and he loves playing video games and he plays them all the time.
1209000	1212000	So is that kind of like, you know, you're lactose intolerant but you still have ice cream?
1212000	1214000	Something like that, I guess.
1214000	1216000	You know what? Ice cream is tremendous.
1216000	1224000	I know, but, you know, and I know plenty of people who are lactose intolerant, they're like, fuck it, I'll just take a lactate.
1224000	1237000	You know, it seems like this is just another person trying to get money out of big corporations and by pointing a finger and saying, you caused this, et cetera, et cetera.
1237000	1243000	Like, you know, when I threw my Wiimote at the TV and it, yeah, or the strap broke.
1243000	1249000	DJ Morpheus in chat says, so I can sue OLR for giving me the AIDS.
1249000	1251000	Well, it wasn't me that gave you AIDS.
1251000	1253000	What?
1253000	1256000	Yeah, exactly.
1256000	1257000	Okay.
1257000	1259000	See, I hate April Fool's Day. I just hate it.
1259000	1261000	Well, let's move on.
1261000	1266000	Speaking of more bullshit, okay.
1266000	1274000	There is actually research going on at the University of Bolton, one of the UK schools.
1274000	1278000	Like Michael Bolton?
1278000	1281000	Somebody had to say it, Jamie.
1281000	1282000	Rob.
1282000	1283000	Yes.
1283000	1285000	Dynamifier.
1285000	1301000	Saying that gaming addiction is over diagnosed up to 10% of the time because there are certain indicators that they were attributing to gaming addiction are actually the same as gambling addictions.
1301000	1311000	So it's actually along the same lines as a gambling addiction, not just, you know, really being addicted to gaming.
1311000	1316000	But they're saying that they like to, that basically it's just hype.
1316000	1318000	It's all this.
1318000	1322000	That they're using it as a scapegoat.
1322000	1326000	That it's just like the same type of addiction people have to gambling.
1326000	1331000	So it's kind of like, you know, the best cure for video game addiction is to grow up.
1331000	1332000	Yeah.
1332000	1334000	Is that basically what they're saying?
1334000	1336000	Or just shoot them.
1336000	1337000	All right.
1337000	1340000	Anybody have anything they want to say on gaming addiction?
1340000	1342000	An addiction is an addiction is an addiction.
1342000	1344000	It doesn't matter what it's to.
1344000	1345000	It doesn't matter what caused it.
1345000	1347000	It's an addiction.
1347000	1351000	I think there's a difference between a chemical addiction and a physical addiction.
1351000	1353000	See, I don't think so.
1353000	1365000	Then again, I actually, you know, now that you think about the biology behind activities, I would say, just like how there's people who are addicted to sex, people addicted to gaming, people addicted to gambling.
1365000	1367000	Addicted to lesbians.
1367000	1372000	People, especially people addicted to running.
1372000	1380000	You get that chemical response whenever you perform this action and people become addicted to the feeling they get when they're doing it.
1380000	1381000	And it's all chemical.
1381000	1388000	There's people who are addicted, who always have to be, you know, this is the only way I can describe it.
1388000	1396000	People who always have to be in a relationship because of the chemicals your body releases while you are, quote, in love.
1396000	1398000	And they may not be in love for real.
1398000	1402000	They have that feeling.
1402000	1405000	And so they're addicted to that feeling of being with another person.
1405000	1408000	So what you're trying to say is you're going to have to face it.
1408000	1410000	You're addicted to love.
1410000	1418000	Well, that also, though, goes a lot to explain people who keep themselves in abusive and codependent relationships, too.
1418000	1420000	Wow.
1420000	1421000	I know.
1421000	1424000	I'm like, wow, this show took an interesting turn all of a sudden.
1424000	1426000	I don't know.
1426000	1433000	I was just thinking about it because I honestly see the same type of mentality of people who are addicted, like, say, the Evercrack people.
1433000	1438000	You point out to them, well, you could be doing this, this, this, and this to improve your life.
1438000	1442000	Don't you use sort of the same type of arguments with your friends who are in abusive relationships?
1442000	1446000	Well, you know, if you left so-and-so, you could do this, this, this, and this.
1446000	1448000	Oh, but I need him.
1448000	1451000	Oh, but I need to level.
1451000	1454000	I'm thinking of addicts to online games.
1454000	1455000	You know what?
1455000	1465000	I think about, though, also, I'm someone who used to smoke, and I know you did, too, for a while, and that's something that's, you know, it's a mental and...
1465000	1466000	I smoke cigars.
1466000	1467000	There's a difference.
1467000	1468000	You don't inhale a cigar.
1468000	1469000	Oh, okay.
1469000	1470000	Well, whatever.
1470000	1471000	I thought you smoked cigarettes for a while.
1471000	1472000	I smoked cloves, like, off and on.
1472000	1473000	All right.
1473000	1475000	Well, in college, I started cigarettes for a while.
1475000	1476000	That's my voice, right?
1476000	1477000	But I quit.
1477000	1478000	Yay.
1478000	1481000	And with that, you got the nicotine addiction and the mental addiction.
1481000	1490000	So, it's kind of like, like, I could kind of see that where wow might be something similar when you get folks who are addicted to wow, because there's that addiction of, like, I need to level.
1490000	1491000	I need to see my friends.
1491000	1492000	Da-da-da.
1492000	1497000	But then there's also kind of the, like, I'm addicted to it because I don't know what else to do.
1497000	1512000	That's why you, I mean, and people, I think this also goes with the gaming addiction thing is that people are afraid of change to the point that you would rather stay in a negative situation because it's something you know.
1512000	1526000	You know, people who may have social anxiety, they use, you know, an MMO as their means of communicating with the outside world and their ways of having interaction when they're afraid of doing something a different way.
1526000	1532000	Also, one thing about it, I've done a lot of research on addiction and stuff because I've dealt with different kinds of addiction.
1532000	1534000	Nothing illegal, but yeah.
1534000	1539000	One of the things, addiction a lot of times acts as an escape from real life.
1539000	1542000	And, you know, it doesn't really matter what you're doing.
1542000	1549000	You know, if you're doing, you know, an activity repetitively, it's usually an escape from real life, whether it's video games or anything.
1549000	1551000	So, yeah.
1551000	1553000	Just something to add about addiction.
1553000	1554000	All right.
1554000	1556000	No, I agree with that too.
1556000	1562000	And I think that also kind of goes hand in hand with the whole afraid of change, afraid of things that are different.
1562000	1566000	People don't want to face their fears, so they try to avoid them one way or another.
1566000	1571000	Or could we be forgetting the one factor that really is an issue, I think.
1571000	1574000	Games are getting so fucking awesome that you can't stop playing them.
1574000	1577000	Like Earth Defense Force 2017.
1577000	1579000	It is fucking awesome.
1579000	1580000	Are you someone's payroll?
1580000	1581000	No.
1581000	1584000	I've never played that game until you mentioned it 50 times on this program.
1584000	1586000	Here's why I like that game.
1586000	1588000	It's because it was originally part of the Simple 2000 series.
1588000	1594000	And everyone remembers, you know, that is like the bottom of the barrel, you know, crap games.
1594000	1597000	Weird shit like, you know, zombies versus ambulance and stuff.
1597000	1600000	It is just like, for me, my bad movie collection.
1600000	1603000	All right, we've got to get back into the news, but real quick comments from chat.
1603000	1606000	ActDeaf says, by the way, I'm addicted to OLR.
1606000	1607000	Well...
1607000	1609000	That's a good addiction to have.
1609000	1612000	Just like being addicted to doing good deeds is a good addiction.
1612000	1614000	Being addicted to being a good Samaritan is a good addiction.
1614000	1616000	Round nose plus two!
1616000	1619000	All right, let's see what else is there.
1619000	1624000	Legend of Zaku says, whatever happened to smoking a joint, eating a Twinkie, and going to sleep?
1624000	1627000	Thank you, Dennis Leary.
1627000	1629000	Wow, good job catching that.
1629000	1632000	Can I just add my little quick quirk and then you can move on?
1632000	1634000	Sure, sure. We'll move on after this.
1634000	1641000	My only thing to say about addiction is if you're not hurting anybody and you're...
1641000	1642000	Yeah, that's my only thing.
1642000	1645000	If you're not hurting anybody else, you can do whatever the fuck you want.
1645000	1650000	Well, but, you know, a lot of folks joke with me like, oh, Rob, you're addicted to Warcraft.
1650000	1652000	You're so addicted to World of Warcraft stuff.
1652000	1655000	And I'm like, you know, I see Magsy's joking with Chris right now.
1655000	1658000	But look, Chris is outside the house right now being social with people.
1658000	1659000	You know, so am I.
1659000	1661000	So there's a difference, too, between like joking about it and like...
1661000	1665000	No, like seriously, you're fucking addicted to WoW because like, you know, you are...
1665000	1666000	And there are people...
1666000	1668000	You're having social repercussions and all that stuff.
1668000	1669000	You know what's really funny?
1669000	1670000	What?
1670000	1672000	After this, I swear, you can move on.
1672000	1677000	But if all the WoW addicts will be able to say...
1677000	1682000	Like when you're first loading into your character, you know how they got that little message for you?
1682000	1684000	When the little bar is like loading the thing?
1684000	1689000	One of the things that it said, all good things should be taken in...
1689000	1690000	Moderation?
1690000	1691000	In moderation.
1691000	1692000	Even WoW.
1692000	1693000	I thought that was hilarious.
1693000	1694000	I see that one, too.
1694000	1696000	I like how Blizzard can laugh at themselves.
1696000	1697000	Well, it's true, though.
1697000	1698000	Yeah, it's very true.
1698000	1706000	Final Fantasy XI has a big old disclaimer that comes up every time you click to log into the game that says...
1706000	1708000	The World of Anadil is an exciting place.
1708000	1713000	And I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for so long, I'd probably read the damn thing verbatim, but it says something like...
1713000	1715000	The World of Anadil is an exciting place.
1715000	1717000	However, please do not neglect your friends' work and all that stuff.
1717000	1718000	It's interesting.
1718000	1721000	Alright, we gotta keep it moving, but we do welcome your feedback.
1721000	1722000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1722000	1724000	Do you know anyone that's addicted to video games?
1724000	1726000	And what kind of effect has that had on their life?
1726000	1727000	We want to hear your emails.
1727000	1730000	And we will get to the mailbag a little later in the show, but first...
1730000	1735000	We have to feed my Castlevania addiction, because Castlevania is one of the best series in the history of video gaming.
1735000	1743000	And, well, Paul Anderson has left Castlevania to go work on his new Death Race 2000 remake.
1743000	1744000	Oh, yeah!
1744000	1753000	Or at least that's what early reports indicated, but then came out later to say that, well, it's not so much that Paul Anderson plans on ditching Castlevania,
1753000	1758000	it's just that he's having scheduling problems between the two right now, so we're not sure which is going to happen first.
1758000	1763000	Good, because Death Race 2000 needs to be out before Castlevania, because that's a fucking awesome movie.
1763000	1766000	It's so awful. I can't wait.
1766000	1771000	Alright, really quickly indulge me here, because all the gamers probably know what Castlevania is, but what is Death Race?
1771000	1774000	Death Race 2000 is basically almost like Carmageddon the movie.
1774000	1778000	It's an old-ass movie, one of the first ones that Sylvester Stallone was ever in.
1778000	1785000	It's basically David Carradine plays this guy who's in this race that you get points for killing people with your car.
1785000	1792000	And at the very end, he takes out the commissioner of this race, I guess who's the president of the world or something like that,
1792000	1796000	with his hand grenade. Pun intended.
1796000	1802000	But it's so ridiculous, though, and I can't wait to see this movie.
1802000	1805000	Definitely worth checking out, though, if you haven't seen it yet.
1805000	1808000	Death Race and Death Sport, both about the same thing.
1808000	1811000	I could just watch The Running Man.
1811000	1815000	Well, that's pretty funny.
1815000	1827000	Anyways, so Hitman is getting, of course, a film made about it, and Variety's reporting that it looks like Fox has picked it up,
1827000	1837000	and they'll be getting shooting, looks like this week, in Bulgaria's capital of Sofia.
1837000	1845000	And kind of interesting, though, it says the film's going to be filmed in South Africa, London, and Istanbul as well.
1845000	1846000	Not Constantinople?
1846000	1849000	Not Constantinople, no.
1849000	1859000	Anyways, and I guess the guy who's actually shooting this right now is Xavier Genz, who I believed...
1859000	1862000	Let's see here.
1862000	1864000	I don't really know what else he's done.
1864000	1866000	Anyways, who cares?
1866000	1874000	But it is kind of interesting, though, because they're saying that one of the stars of Desperate Housewives has actually been confirmed as one of the villains,
1874000	1879000	and I don't follow Desperate Housewives too much, but apparently a cast member...
1879000	1882000	Let's see.
1882000	1884000	I don't know.
1884000	1894000	Oh, Dougree Scott is going to play a suitor Ian Hainsworth.
1894000	1899000	Sorry, this story was putting me to sleep.
1899000	1900000	What?
1900000	1904000	Timothy Olfant will play the lead as the assassin Agent 47.
1904000	1908000	It'll just be a generic fucking action movie like all the others.
1908000	1909000	It is.
1909000	1916000	So Dougree Scott, the guy who plays the British guy in Desperate Housewives, is going to play the villain.
1916000	1925000	Alright, well, thank you for that, and we will be sure to not see that and wait for a DVD so I can Netflix it.
1925000	1926000	Just kidding.
1926000	1934000	Anyhow, one other great fucking same old thing we like to look forward to every week here is the mailbag here at orangeonshreddy.com.
1934000	1938000	People will email us, and of course that email address is mailbag at orangeonshreddy.com.
1938000	1943000	Dark Soccer likes to dive in head first into the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1943000	1944000	I do?
1944000	1948000	Well, April Fools, or so she tells me.
1948000	1950000	She likes to read them here on the air.
1950000	1952000	I do?
1952000	1954000	Don't make me shove this mic up your butt.
1954000	1962000	That's just the voice.
1962000	1972000	Anyway, anyway, hey, O.L.R., I was just listening to the last episode of O.L.R., and I heard about the youngest O.L.R. listener, a 12-year-old.
1972000	1976000	But now I declare myself the second youngest listener of O.L.R. at 13 years old.
1976000	1980000	No matter what you guys say, I'll still listen to you because you guys are great, from Ron.
1980000	1983000	Thank you, Ron.
1983000	1984000	You're so cute.
1984000	1986000	Oh, the cute little baby.
1986000	1988000	Hey, don't patronize the...
1988000	1990000	You're so cute, little baby.
1990000	1993000	Do not patronize the kid.
1993000	1994000	Anyway...
1994000	1995000	Wait.
1995000	1996000	This is from...
1996000	2001000	Oh, my God, if this kid is 13, then that means he was born in 94, right?
2001000	2003000	That's the year I graduated high school.
2003000	2005000	Oh, my God, I know, I was like a sophomore.
2005000	2006000	Oh, God.
2006000	2008000	Thank you for making me feel old, Rob.
2008000	2009000	I was in fourth grade.
2009000	2011000	When I was your age.
2011000	2013000	I was in second grade.
2013000	2014000	No, wait, I was in first grade.
2014000	2016000	Holy crap.
2016000	2017000	So, next email.
2017000	2019000	I was on the date with your mama.
2019000	2020000	Last night.
2020000	2021000	Really?
2021000	2024000	No, that was okay.
2024000	2028000	This is from Alex.
2028000	2029000	Hi, Alex.
2029000	2031000	Rondo of Blood sucked because it was on PSP.
2031000	2032000	PSP equal to evil.
2032000	2034000	Youngest OLR listener.
2034000	2035000	P.S.
2035000	2037000	My parents don't know I listen to this.
2037000	2038000	That's okay.
2038000	2040000	We're going to call them live on air.
2040000	2043000	Do you know what your kid is listening to?
2043000	2044000	Wow.
2044000	2047000	Anyway, Rondo of Blood is awesome.
2047000	2048000	Okay.
2048000	2051000	Oh, we have a joke.
2051000	2052000	We have a joke.
2052000	2053000	Oh, God, here we go.
2053000	2054000	Two jokes.
2054000	2055000	This is from...
2055000	2059000	Can someone remind me how the Orange Launch radio listeners got encouraged to send us
2059000	2060000	jokes?
2060000	2061000	Because we actually read one on air.
2061000	2065000	This is from Aris, I guess that's how it's pronounced.
2065000	2068000	All right, I got two.
2068000	2070000	What's meant to go deep and is full of semen?
2070000	2071000	A penis?
2071000	2072000	No, submarine.
2072000	2073000	A submarine.
2073000	2074000	Ha, ha, ha.
2074000	2078000	Okay, what makes people yell when you blow it?
2078000	2079000	A penis?
2079000	2080000	A whistle.
2080000	2081000	Blow my whistle.
2081000	2084000	Is this another 13-year-old listener of Orange Launch Radio?
2084000	2086000	Blow my whistle, bitch.
2086000	2089000	Anyway, this is from, I guess it's pronounced Zaid.
2089000	2091000	My name is Zaid Mohammed.
2091000	2092000	I'm from the UK.
2092000	2094000	Yes, Sky, your Brit accent is a joke.
2094000	2095000	It's funny.
2095000	2096000	Bro cracks me up.
2096000	2097000	Anyways...
2097000	2098000	Thank you for understanding me.
2098000	2099000	I really appreciate it.
2099000	2100000	Shut up, Rob.
2100000	2105000	I've been listening to your podcast since the PSP RSS feed enabled, and it's good to
2105000	2109000	listen to you guys because you work during the day and make such a great effort to do
2109000	2112000	the shows on Sunday night in your own time.
2112000	2116000	And that's an achievement for anyone.
2116000	2120000	Okay, this person uses the mixing numbers and shit with their words.
2120000	2121000	Oh, a MySpace message?
2121000	2123000	So this fucking pisses me off.
2123000	2126000	I'm going to read it because it's cool that you took the time to write us.
2126000	2130000	But next time, please actually use full words.
2130000	2133000	Spell everything out, and if in doubt, use a spell checker.
2133000	2134000	You know what's fucking awesome?
2134000	2135000	Huh?
2135000	2136000	Punctuation.
2136000	2137000	Punctuation is great.
2137000	2139000	But make sure that when you use...
2139000	2143000	Can we put that on a poster with Chris's picture, doing a big thumbs up?
2143000	2145000	You know what's fucking awesome?
2145000	2146000	Punctuation.
2146000	2149800	Make sure, though, that when you use your spell checker, the words that have been spell
2149800	2154000	checked are the right versions of the word that you want to spell check.
2154000	2156000	Remember, B-R-A-K-E.
2156000	2158000	That's in your card, dummy.
2158000	2159000	Okay, sorry.
2159000	2160000	Saw that fucking joke a mile away.
2160000	2161000	Back to the email.
2161000	2162000	Back to the email.
2162000	2163000	Back to the email.
2163000	2166000	Back to the email.
2166000	2168000	Because when I get home from work, I'm tired.
2168000	2170000	Unfortunately, I can't listen to the live show due to time zones.
2170000	2174000	Anyway, I sold my PSP, and funny enough, but you guys stuck with me.
2174000	2178000	I enjoy your show so much that I now download the podcast on my PC and listen every Mondays
2178000	2179000	and Wednesdays.
2179000	2181000	Loki PSP is fun.
2181000	2186000	Dark Alex Customs gets real boring once you kit it up to the max.
2186000	2189000	L-O-L, hence the word, sold it.
2189000	2195000	Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that you guys are doing a really great show for us
2195000	2197000	hardcore and non-hardcore gamers.
2197000	2202000	With all your efforts with keeping us updated on the gaming world, I wish you the best on
2202000	2204000	the future and more to come.
2204000	2206000	I love Rice Princess L-O-L.
2206000	2211000	Okay, I have a headache, but thank you.
2211000	2213000	I love it when listeners send us nice things.
2213000	2216000	Please don't get me wrong, but please don't email us in a hieroglyphics.
2216000	2217000	No offense.
2217000	2221000	I'm not trying to dog on you or anything, but just because you type the email on your
2221000	2225000	computer, which doesn't have access to the internet, it's still not the internet.
2225000	2228000	Please don't talk like you're on the internet.
2228000	2230000	The more you know.
2230000	2231000	Okay, next email.
2231000	2232000	Hey.
2232000	2233000	Wait, wait, wait.
2233000	2234000	I'm sorry.
2234000	2235000	I have a quick something for Chris.
2235000	2238000	It's a little bit late, but I'm sorry I'm slow because the files on my computer are
2238000	2240000	misorganized, but here you go, Chris.
2240000	2243000	Blow my whistle, baby.
2243000	2245000	Everybody dance.
2245000	2253000	Suddenly the studio's turned into a lesbian bitch disco.
2253000	2259000	This mailbag segment was ruined to you courtesy of DJ Alligator Project.
2259000	2262000	I have the vinyl, by the way.
2262000	2266000	Didn't I buy you a Guitar Wolf CD once?
2266000	2267000	Record.
2267000	2268000	Record.
2268000	2269000	You were supposed to rip that for me.
2269000	2271000	That's why I bought it for you.
2271000	2272000	No, I'm kidding.
2272000	2273000	Anyway, next one.
2273000	2274000	Hey, love your show.
2274000	2277000	I wanted to send you a message that we should all ponder about.
2277000	2280000	The actual cost of an Xbox 360.
2280000	2285000	Now that the Elite finally announced, is the 360 still the cheapest current gen hardware?
2285000	2286000	No way.
2286000	2287000	Let me explain.
2287000	2292000	Everyone complains that the PS3 is too expensive, but I believe the 360 is the biggest ripoff.
2292000	2293000	Here's why.
2293000	2299000	First of all, to get a comparable 360, you must A, buy the Elite or B, upgrade your hard
2299000	2300000	drive for $179.
2300000	2305000	Second, even if you buy the Elite for $479, it doesn't even compare to the PS3 in terms
2305000	2306000	of features.
2306000	2309000	A, to get the wireless network, you must pay $99.99.
2309000	2313000	B, to get high definition movie player, you must pay $199.99.
2313000	2316000	To play online, you must pay $59.99.
2316000	2321000	D, to charge your controllers using the console, you must pay $19.99.
2321000	2327000	So if my math is right, the consumer must pay a total of $859.95 to get a console comparable
2327000	2330000	to the features and hardware featured in the PS3.
2330000	2336000	So the old saying now should read, sorry Microsoft, but I can't buy a PS3 Nintendo Wii for the
2336000	2337000	price of one of yours.
2337000	2339000	Let me know what you guys think of this.
2339000	2340000	Thanks, Matt.
2340000	2347000	The PlayStation 3, probably about 30 games out right now.
2347000	2351000	Microsoft's Xbox 360, a lot more than that.
2351000	2355000	I understand what this person is saying and that is true.
2355000	2358000	It's that sometimes we are unfairly comparing the charges.
2358000	2362000	When I say we, I don't mean us specifically because obviously a lot of the Internet is
2362000	2363000	on the same page.
2363000	2369000	But again, when all is said and done, price be damned.
2369000	2372000	Xbox 360 has the games I want on it right now.
2372000	2377000	PlayStation 3 does not yet, but when it does, I will consider buying one.
2377000	2378000	No problem.
2378000	2380000	Home still looks pretty cool.
2380000	2383000	Little Big Planet, yes, more, more, more.
2383000	2387000	But they'll start showing the real good, Sony.
2387000	2388000	That's all.
2388000	2390000	That's basically what I want to say.
2390000	2402000	You know, PS3 may cost less apparently, but Xbox still has better games on it.
2402000	2404000	Xbox has Ublis.
2404000	2405000	It's Ublis.
2405000	2413000	I do think if Sony were to really start to threaten Microsoft's grip that they've got
2413000	2419000	going right now, which I think Sony may do in a year, I would not be surprised.
2419000	2422000	This has been rumors and rumblings already.
2422000	2427000	If Xbox drops some elements of their gold service and they give you a little more stuff
2427000	2431000	for free and the gold people get, I don't know, something else special to compensate,
2431000	2435000	they've been talking about that sort of rumor has been going around for a long time.
2435000	2441000	I think Microsoft will cut corners where they have to to compete with Sony, but until Sony
2441000	2444000	really has a lot more games, I don't know.
2444000	2447000	Anyway, I guess that's my thought.
2447000	2450000	Okay, well, we have one more email.
2450000	2451000	Yay.
2451000	2453000	One more email.
2453000	2456000	One email to rule them all.
2456000	2457000	Okay.
2457000	2462000	Okay, I have been listening to the podcast version of the show for about two to three
2462000	2463000	months now.
2463000	2467000	Well, technically it says two thirds of a month, but I think it means two to three months,
2467000	2468000	I hope.
2468000	2470000	So now I have managed to catch a couple of live shows.
2470000	2472000	I want to give you all props because the show is great.
2472000	2476000	I love Loki's insider info and the comedy of Robin Jamie's bickering like siblings.
2476000	2480000	That's because Rob's my bitch.
2480000	2481000	Whatever.
2481000	2482000	You don't know me.
2482000	2483000	Sit down.
2483000	2484000	Shut up.
2484000	2485000	I'm your mom.
2485000	2486000	Mom.
2486000	2487000	Be quiet.
2487000	2490000	That doesn't sound like my mom.
2490000	2492000	My mom is like this.
2492000	2493000	That's my mom.
2493000	2494000	Wow.
2494000	2496000	That sounds like your mom giving birth.
2496000	2499000	That's somebody else's mom.
2499000	2501000	Someone's sick and deranged mom.
2501000	2503000	This is my mom.
2503000	2504000	Rob.
2504000	2507000	Rob, why are you doing that dumb show on the internet on Sunday?
2507000	2509000	Rob, why don't you come over once in a while?
2509000	2510000	Now, this is my mom now.
2510000	2512000	When are you going to come home?
2512000	2514000	When are you going to come home?
2514000	2516000	Why did you move to California?
2516000	2520000	Actually, I think California is better for you, but you should come back and visit sometime
2520000	2522000	and bring your husband with you.
2522000	2526000	You know, your brother Matthew is being such a little ass.
2526000	2531000	Now, when I was little, it was, you need to clean your room.
2531000	2534000	I want to take your TV away.
2534000	2535000	Mom, you didn't get it for me.
2535000	2536000	Dad did.
2536000	2538000	I don't care.
2538000	2539000	Oh, my God.
2539000	2542000	Your mom was the bus driver on South Park.
2542000	2543000	Sit down.
2543000	2544000	Shut up.
2544000	2546000	What did you call me?
2546000	2548000	What did you say?
2548000	2550000	That's very true.
2550000	2551000	My mom was a screamer.
2551000	2553000	Anyway, back to the email.
2553000	2555000	Really now?
2555000	2557000	That's why I'm not breathing, okay?
2557000	2559000	I don't want to be like my mom.
2559000	2562000	Okay, now.
2562000	2568000	And that's where I learned how to drown out while people are talking to me and then repeat
2568000	2569000	everything they just said.
2569000	2571000	It also helped me pass tests when I was in high school.
2571000	2572000	Mailbag, please.
2572000	2573000	Okay.
2573000	2576000	I'm sure that you all have had this debate before, but I'm looking at finally taking
2576000	2579000	the plunge and investing my summer into an MMO.
2579000	2581000	I am at ends, however.
2581000	2586000	My brother is hardcore hooked on Final Fantasy XI and constantly comments on its wondrousness.
2586000	2590440	Like many people, I have some friends who play Final Fantasy XI and some who play World
2590440	2591440	of Warcraft.
2591440	2597480	I am torn between two much less in-depth environments of World of Warcraft and the fact that Final
2597480	2599000	Fantasy XI is Final Fantasy.
2599000	2602280	Unfortunately, I don't like any group better than the other.
2602280	2606000	So I would like you all to help me decide World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI and
2606000	2607000	why?
2607000	2610400	Some debate would actually help, too, so that it isn't a pure landslide toward World of
2610400	2611400	Warcraft.
2611400	2613800	I said that because you always seem to talk about World of Warcraft and you never really
2613800	2616520	mention Final Fantasy XI.
2616520	2624360	So, World of Warcraft versus Final Fantasy XI, keep up the good work, the show is great,
2624360	2626720	and damn Live 365 increasing fees.
2626720	2628880	That's from Boco Thet.
2628880	2631800	You can damn the government for increasing those fees.
2631800	2634200	Live 365 is just doing what they have to do to stay afloat.
2634200	2637720	If you want more information on that, live365.com slash choice.
2637720	2640000	I encourage you all to check it out.
2640000	2642560	But anyway, back to the other topic.
2642560	2644360	Final Fantasy XI is full of bitches.
2644360	2647760	Well, I did play Final Fantasy XI for two years and I realize you're a new listener
2647760	2651480	or in lounge, so you kind of missed that whole period where my gaming week every week was
2651480	2653520	Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI.
2653520	2654520	Here's the thing.
2654520	2659900	Final Fantasy XI forces you to have a social experience and be social with other people.
2659900	2665680	The problem with XI is that it's very difficult to sign on for a short period of time to just
2665680	2668400	kind of go, hey, I just want to check, you know, I just kind of want to sign on real
2668400	2669400	quick.
2669400	2670880	Especially since it takes five hours to get a fucking party.
2670880	2674480	Yeah, and sometimes you're having to really wait for a party for a long time.
2674480	2678640	Now, I know Final Fantasy XI, recently I read something about a new patch they're doing
2678640	2683720	that's addressing some of those issues to try and make smaller parties more effective,
2683720	2685480	but I don't know.
2685480	2690440	The reason why I've stuck with Warcraft is that sometimes you have to party, but there's
2690440	2695340	so much you can do solo as well that kind of keeps the game going.
2695340	2700640	The thing, though, that I think would maybe woo you over this, check out, I mean, Warcraft
2700640	2702240	does the 10-day free trial.
2702240	2706080	To my knowledge, Final Fantasy XI offers nothing similar yet, but maybe you could watch your
2706080	2709300	brother, whoever you said has it, play it for a little bit.
2709300	2711760	Get the 10-day free trial for WoW, try it out.
2711760	2715160	If you don't like it, maybe Final Fantasy XI is more your taste.
2715160	2720920	If Final Fantasy XI ever chooses to do a free trial, I would say go for that as well.
2720920	2726640	For someone who, again, is addicted to WoW, shut up.
2726640	2731760	I'm actually very antisocial when it comes to games, and the only reason I picked up
2731760	2734720	World of Warcraft is because I'm a big fan of Blizzard.
2734720	2741360	I used to play Diablo II and Diablo and whatnot, and the expansions on that, but I'm a solo
2741360	2742360	game player.
2742360	2746180	I don't like interacting with a lot of people, and then every now and then I'll want to chat
2746180	2750600	with people, but most of the time people are just stupid, so I don't want to go near them.
2750600	2752020	But WoW is actually really fun.
2752020	2756160	You can do it all by yourself, and you can only team up if you want to, and that's the
2756160	2759160	reason I like it a lot.
2759160	2763240	Any MMO is going to have some annoying little aspects of it, but I just found that WoW is
2763240	2768800	a lot more easier to deal with if you don't want to deal with other people.
2768800	2771520	Then they dance.
2771520	2778620	Well they do, but to Final Fantasy XI's credit, there is no Taru slash Panic, which does win
2778620	2779620	in Final Fantasy XI.
2779620	2782520	You just have to see it to know what I'm talking about.
2782520	2786240	You know what, our chat room is debating this too, and it looks like World of Warcraft is
2786240	2787240	winning by a landslide.
2787240	2791120	I hate to say, for those Final Fantasy XI fans who might be listening, if you want to
2791120	2794560	argue your points, send us an email, mailbag, orangehonestreader.com.
2794560	2799280	Hitstun says, objection, Final Fantasy XI is not Final Fantasy.
2799280	2802880	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, neither MMO is corrupt.
2802880	2806980	Drunami says, Final Fantasy XI is dead, Final Fantasy XI remains dead, Gill Sellers killed
2806980	2807980	it.
2807980	2812600	Yuni says, I suggest that Final Fantasy XI is not worth it, I played three years on it.
2812600	2818600	DJ Tyrant says, WoW has 90% of their content that can be soloed, Final Fantasy XI has very
2818600	2824240	little solo content.
2824240	2830400	In my honest opinion after having played them both, I've put more time into World of Warcraft
2830400	2839320	than I have Final Fantasy XI, because I could play a lot more solo if I wanted to.
2839320	2861840	To be perfectly honest though, I actually still like Ragnarok Online more, because I
2861840	2870760	am curious to hear what's keeping you in the game, because you've heard a lot of us talking
2870760	2874120	about WoW now, I'm kind of curious, because I know there's a lot of people that still
2874120	2875120	play it.
2875120	2880160	I'm just glad I can contribute something, because that's the only game I play now.
2880160	2884560	You always contribute lots of stuff to the program, whether you'd like to admit it or
2884560	2885560	not.
2885560	2891000	Moving on, Halo 2 also has a lot of folks who are addicted to it, and Microsoft has
2891000	2895400	announced they will be putting out two new maps for Halo 2.
2895400	2901340	Actually I believe they just went up, they're available for $4 to download.
2901340	2904360	No word yet if they're going to be free later on.
2904360	2913640	The maps that just came out are Hangem High and Desolation, which came over from Halo
2913640	2914640	1.
2914640	2916560	Kind of cool, if you're a Halo fan.
2916560	2917780	Yes, if you're a Halo fan.
2917780	2920940	Now bring on the Halo 3 beta.
2920940	2926560	Oh wait, and everybody thinks that each update or whatever is going to be a Halo 3 beta.
2926560	2932320	If you're not a fan of Halo, maybe you're a fan of Xbox Live's video downloads, if that's
2932320	2936920	the case, well, there's going to be some more content up there for you guys, including some
2936920	2937920	new stuff.
2937920	2942800	A few more studios have jumped on board, including Paramount Pictures.
2942800	2949160	They're going to be adding Braveheart, Team America World Police, World Trade Center,
2949160	2952240	and South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
2952240	2963640	Warner Brothers Home Entertainment is also adding Sublime and Babylon 5 The Lost Tales.
2963640	2967800	Some other stuff from TV that you're going to be getting, A&E Networks.
2967800	2975280	They're providing Dog the Bounty Hunter, King of Cars Driving Force, and Chris Angel Mind
2975280	2978440	Freak, as well as Gene Simmons Family Jewel.
2978440	2981720	Oh, that's that show they used to make fun of on the soup all the time, remember?
2981720	2982720	Mind Freak!
2982720	2983720	Remember that?
2983720	2984720	Yes.
2984720	2985720	Oh, God.
2985720	2990680	ADV Films, they're going to have some anime stuff on there, so you can check that out.
2990680	2993680	National Geographic, of course, adding some stuff there.
2993680	2998640	New Line Cinema is bringing snakes on a plane, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning, Tenacious
2998640	3008360	D, and The Pick of Destiny, plus some other top titles, including Austin Powers' The
3008360	3018600	Spy Who Shagged Me and Magnolia, and Total Vid is providing some extreme sports videos.
3018600	3022040	How about some titles we don't all already own on DVD already?
3022040	3025960	I'm looking at you, Austin Powers.
3025960	3031760	Yay for Microsoft getting more stuff on the marketplace, but how about something to compete
3031760	3033320	with the DVDs that are out there now?
3033320	3034320	Does that make sense?
3034320	3035320	I know.
3035320	3038120	Especially in the TV department, more HDTV.
3038120	3043640	Also interesting is their pricing structure has changed.
3043640	3045880	Now basically, here's how it's going to work.
3045880	3052720	The new releases now, the 720p HD movies are going to be 480 Microsoft points, or $6, while
3052720	3058200	the standard size movies are going to be $4, or 320 Microsoft points.
3058200	3059520	That went up, didn't it?
3059520	3060520	I think so.
3060520	3068760	The music films, the HD ones are going to be $4.50, or 360 Microsoft points, and $3
3068760	3073600	for the normal resolution movies, or 240 Microsoft points.
3073600	3082880	Then TV purchases, for HD it's going to be $3, and for SD it's going to be $2.
3082880	3088760	I don't know, I haven't bought anything yet, and I'm not really looking to purchase anything
3088760	3089760	anytime soon.
3089760	3095000	I got the one movie, which was cool, the hard candy or whatever, because it was an artsy
3095000	3099080	house movie that I didn't think I'd find in HD otherwise.
3099080	3103440	But now that I have the HD DVD player, and I've got some Netflix here, I got Babel on
3103440	3104440	HD DVD.
3104440	3105440	I don't know.
3105440	3108720	I'm kind of using Netflix to get my movie filled right now.
3108720	3111240	I know this is not the avenue that they want to go in.
3111240	3113480	I'm telling you, big money here.
3113480	3118560	Porn downloads, confirm with a credit card number or something like that, that you're
3118560	3121840	over 18 or something like that.
3121840	3122840	That would be fucking awesome.
3122840	3124640	I would love to see porn downloads.
3124640	3126440	Do you really think Microsoft would do that?
3126440	3127440	No.
3127440	3135040	No, because it would be horrible for PR, but they should.
3135040	3136880	Maybe there's a creative way they could do it.
3136880	3142720	Like you know, Pimps at Sea.
3142720	3144040	That's the Halo 3 alpha name.
3144040	3145040	It's a joke.
3145040	3149040	They had a movie poster for that, which looked funny.
3149040	3155280	It was a parrot with a pirate's hook for a head.
3155280	3156280	You know what?
3156280	3157280	What?
3157280	3158280	Chicken butt.
3158280	3161640	We need ninja, like more ninja stuff going on.
3161640	3168480	Anyway, because we all know that the natural enemy of the pirate is the ninja, so a pirate
3168480	3169480	ninja.
3169480	3171680	There was a pirate ninja in Weebles.
3171680	3178480	Anyway, for anyone who has been keeping up with Bullet Witch, the Xbox 360 shooting game,
3178480	3180400	there is now some downloadable content.
3180400	3183120	Who hasn't yet committed suicide.
3183120	3186080	Announced by Atari.
3186080	3189200	What's out is there is a White Witch outfit.
3189200	3194480	There's also going to be coming up a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary and Pixie outfits later
3194480	3197480	on.
3197480	3203080	Mummy slash schoolgirl comma.
3203080	3204080	We can't hear Megzi.
3204080	3208840	I was going to say a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary.
3208840	3209840	With pixie wings.
3209840	3211200	With pixie wings.
3211200	3212680	I came.
3212680	3213680	Wow.
3213680	3219560	Anyway, so also coming up, these are new missions that are 20 Microsoft points each.
3219560	3222340	The Dynamite Beauty is available now.
3222340	3230400	Coming up is Clad and Streaming and Great Spells and some other difficulty settings.
3230400	3236400	There will also be Caterpillar City, Endless One Shot Kill, Geist Search and Destroy and
3236400	3243040	enhanced additions of City of Screams, Up in Flames at 10,000 feet, Down in the Valley,
3243040	3246060	The Bound Soul and The End of Chaos.
3246060	3249960	There will also be theme packs.
3249960	3256440	For people who don't know much about the game, it's by the studio Cavia.
3256440	3262740	It's a third person action game and this witch lady has to shoot things.
3262740	3265600	Which download content will make my game not suck?
3265600	3266760	I know.
3266760	3271200	Coming out next month for 100 Microsoft points, a patch that makes the game not suck.
3271200	3275760	Here's the thing that's really ridiculous about the whole thing anyways is that for
3275760	3280400	20 Microsoft points, I think that's the equivalent of a quarter, just make it free.
3280400	3283400	I mean, seriously, you're making a quarter off this crap.
3283400	3292760	I mean, just make the goddamn content free as if, you know, sorry the game sucks so bad.
3292760	3296640	I'm going to download this by the way because I have the game, although I don't know if
3296640	3298360	I want to waste a quarter on this stuff.
3298360	3299480	I'll think about that.
3299480	3303600	I may throw it at a hobo instead, you know?
3303600	3306000	Have any of you worth, you know, a little bit more to me?
3306000	3310580	Mummy school girl pixie wings, quarter at hobo.
3310580	3312360	I don't know.
3312360	3315600	But I do know that Pcross DS is coming out in Europe pretty soon.
3315600	3317600	Do you like my transition?
3317600	3322920	Pcross DS is this kind of like picture crossword type game.
3322920	3323920	I don't know.
3323920	3324920	It kind of looks like Minesweeper to me.
3324920	3325920	I haven't played it.
3325920	3327760	But it's coming out on May 11th in Europe.
3327760	3329600	It's a part of the Touch Generations label.
3329600	3332260	Nintendo's putting it out on the DS.
3332260	3337800	Over 300 puzzles, everything from easy to the toughest upon tough.
3337800	3341420	Also multiplayer amongst the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.
3341420	3345360	So if you want to do some puzzling over Wi-Fi, here's something to check out.
3345360	3349120	The game has been getting very solid reviews, even though I don't make it sound very good.
3349120	3352720	Keep in mind I haven't actually played it, so my opinion doesn't mean shit.
3352720	3353720	Right.
3353720	3356360	It's an old Game Boy game.
3356360	3357360	Is it?
3357360	3358360	I don't remember.
3358360	3359360	Yeah, it's a very, very old game.
3359360	3360920	It was Mario's Pcross a long time ago.
3360920	3361920	Well shit.
3361920	3363480	And I like puzzle games too.
3363480	3368120	In fact, I kind of actually, for some sick side of me, kind of wants to get Honeycomb
3368120	3371760	Beat just because it was kind of fun at that show we played it at.
3371760	3372760	Oh, I don't know.
3372760	3373760	I'll hook you up.
3373760	3374760	Don't worry.
3374760	3375760	Okay.
3375760	3377760	Well, let's move on then.
3377760	3384400	Anyways, so in case you may have been under a rock for some reason, you know, it might
3384400	3385880	be nice and cool down there.
3385880	3386880	Who knows?
3386880	3392040	Well, there, Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hit the internet and the internet exploded because
3392040	3395000	I crashed a bunch of different websites.
3395000	3396000	Sounded just like that.
3396000	3400760	That was also the same sound that was in my pants after watching it, but no, seriously
3400760	3403200	though.
3403200	3404200	It was awesome.
3404200	3412220	That was also the sound Lizzie Lohan's vagina made shortly after she got out of rehab.
3412220	3413220	Never mind.
3413220	3415100	There's a joke there.
3415100	3416100	Look for it.
3416100	3420120	A few politicians are a little bit pissed off at the fact that the game takes place
3420120	3422680	in Liberty City.
3422680	3427920	Note to politicians, the game is taking place in Liberty City for about four different games
3427920	3428920	now.
3428920	3430840	Where the fuck were you?
3430840	3437440	Anyways, so now they're just like, oh, but now that it really looks like New York, we
3437440	3438440	don't like it.
3438440	3442600	And it's funny because I'm going to quote this, I think the best one I read here, sorry
3442600	3444400	about it, was on Kotaku.
3444400	3448400	They were saying, and here are some of the quotes that they picked out here, setting
3448400	3454100	Grand Theft Auto in the safest big city in America would be like setting Halo in Disneyland.
3454100	3457160	City Councilman Peter Velour.
3457160	3458480	I want to play Halo.
3458480	3463160	Halo in Disneyland might make me interested in that game a whole lot more than I already
3463160	3464160	am.
3464160	3469680	That's like the lady with the SUV, that'd be right up there with the lady on the cell
3469680	3472840	phone in the SUV.
3472840	3478320	The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing
3478320	3479320	police officers.
3479320	3482840	Jason Post, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg.
3482840	3488880	And then the best one, and probably the most uninformed, in previous incarnations, players
3488880	3493320	advanced through the game by killing cops, selling pornography to children, and killing
3493320	3494960	prostitutes.
3494960	3498000	I'm just going to take a wild guess here.
3498000	3501960	I think one of those three is not right.
3501960	3506640	Must be the killing cops part, because I don't think you sell pornography to children in
3506640	3507640	there.
3507640	3511680	There's not Grand Theft Auto child pornography.
3511680	3514720	But if they put that in Grand Theft Auto IV, that'd be a great new feature.
3514720	3517920	It'd be a cool side mission.
3517920	3519780	Either way though, they're going to bitch and moan.
3519780	3522400	It's just going to build up the hype for it.
3522400	3526080	Certain people are going to file lawsuits, and the game's going to come out and fucking
3526080	3527080	rock.
3527080	3533320	So anyway, way to go Rockstar, you know how to hype up your games.
3533320	3534960	Here comes the hype train.
3534960	3535960	Come on, rather train.
3535960	3536960	Choo choo.
3536960	3537960	Choo choo.
3537960	3538960	It did look good though.
3538960	3539960	Very good.
3539960	3540960	I can't wait to play it.
3540960	3542320	I'll tell you what I'm happy about though.
3542320	3547080	I'm happy about more Ninja Gaiden, because I need to play this demo.
3547080	3556120	I've been a big Ninja Gaiden fan forever, so coming out on the Japanese PSN, we have
3556120	3558720	the demo for Ninja Gaiden Sigma.
3558720	3560960	And it's not Gayden, it's Gaiden.
3560960	3562600	Pronounce it right, fuckers.
3562600	3563600	Ninja Gaiden?
3563600	3564600	No.
3564600	3568840	There's a joke I want to make, but I can't.
3568840	3569840	I know.
3569840	3571080	I'll make my people angry.
3571080	3572080	Sure.
3572080	3580600	No, it just, it really pisses me off, because I grew up, and I was like, I don't think that's
3580600	3582560	how it's supposed to sound.
3582560	3586160	And Gaiden, by the way, means side story, huh?
3586160	3587160	Okay, anyway.
3587160	3589640	Stop being so Gayden.
3589640	3592000	I'm going to kick your butt.
3592000	3601760	So anyway, you run around in tight leather, maybe it is a little gay.
3601760	3606640	That made Jamie's bitching all worth it, seriously.
3606640	3608800	The demo is to be out.
3608800	3617560	I don't see a date, April 27th is going to be their date, so happy birthday to me.
3617560	3627560	Alright, well, while DarkSakura is playing Ninja Gayden on her PlayStation Network, Ninja
3627560	3635100	Gaiden Dragon Sword is coming out for the DS, and it's been spotted in Famitsu Magazine.
3635100	3638560	The game is completely controlled on the touchscreen, but not blocking.
3638560	3642720	So don't expect your typical 2D Ninja Gaiden.
3642720	3646160	Great, I'm sure that controls like, awesome.
3646160	3649720	We'll see, I mean, very little is known about the game except for the fact that it's on
3649720	3650720	its way.
3650720	3653360	Unless you can read Japanese, maybe you can get some more out of that than I can, I don't
3653360	3654360	know.
3654360	3657080	I did hear that there was, this was shown during like, I think one of their gamer days
3657080	3662240	or whatever, the equivalent of a press event, and it didn't control very well.
3662240	3663240	Uh oh.
3663240	3666320	But then again, then again, the game is, you know, still early in development, and they
3666320	3669360	didn't fix that, but there were some issues.
3669360	3671360	Uh oh.
3671360	3677140	Anyways, something that makes me very happy, I might have to stop playing Earth Defense
3677140	3681840	Force 2017 for it, Crackdown is getting a new update, in fact they're going to fix the
3681840	3685720	multiplayer and lag issues, which is nice, because they need to do that.
3685720	3687840	Enable the Halo 3 Beta.
3687840	3691160	They're not going to enable the Halo 3 Beta.
3691160	3692160	Fuck.
3692160	3695360	Anyways, so some other stuff that they're going to be doing as well, they're supposed
3695360	3702920	to be possibly expanding the co-op to allow some more players, in fact one of the things
3702920	3708880	they're going to be adding a new multiplayer mode that was based off of some YouTube videos,
3708880	3715440	so that's pretty interesting, and then also rumors that they might do airborne cars as
3715440	3716440	well.
3716440	3719520	However, there is, there has been a- Wait, flying cars?
3719520	3722800	Isn't that already a patch for that?
3722800	3726840	What would you do for the flying car?
3726840	3732920	You know- Me, George Jetson, his boy, Elroy.
3732920	3739320	No I- Okay, so but there are going to be some free updates, I know there was one that was
3739320	3743380	fixing the patching stuff, there's another one that they added that's going to be increasing
3743380	3748560	the number of gang control cars that are roaming the streets for certain achievements, and
3748560	3753880	there's going to be later on I guess a free thing to reset the gang so that all the bosses
3753880	3758160	come back to their normal spot, so you can play co-op and get that co-op achievement
3758160	3762160	for finishing all the missions that we need to do.
3762160	3763160	Cool.
3763160	3764160	Have you been playing the game?
3764160	3765720	A little bit.
3765720	3769680	Strangely enough I've been playing Tetris a lot this week, so, because the achievements
3769680	3775880	are not that hard, so I'm trying to get my 1500 score by mid-April or whatever it was,
3775880	3778680	I don't have much time left and I have like 600 points to go.
3778680	3779680	You too may win Contra.
3779680	3780680	Contra.
3780680	3781680	I already have it.
3781680	3783680	I love Contra.
3783680	3791080	Well, there's something that I'd have to say, some Japanese airlines are getting contrary,
3791080	3801180	ha ha, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is banning local wireless gaming
3801180	3806640	on flights because the Wi-Fi signal allegedly interferes with the airplane's instruments,
3806640	3810720	the same, you know, cell phone thing.
3810720	3817640	Now, there's an interesting thing about that, as was indicated, and I'm going to go ahead
3817640	3825000	and quote the source of this, I think is a very good point that Joystiq made, is that
3825000	3831560	Lufthansa has been offering in-plane Wi-Fi since 2003 and haven't had any crashes because
3831560	3833240	of it.
3833240	3843160	The FAA states that Wi-Fi is safe, so I guess that maybe Japanese planes are built differently.
3843160	3844160	Maybe.
3844160	3846200	Where the hell does Lufthansa fly?
3846200	3848480	I've always seen their airline, I've never flown them.
3848480	3849720	Where do they go?
3849720	3852600	I flew in Lufthansa when I went to France.
3852600	3854480	Oh, they're like a Europe airline.
3854480	3859800	Yeah, well, I went to O'Hare to Frankfurt, to Paris.
3859800	3861520	That's why I've never flown them, because I've never been to Europe.
3861520	3862520	Well, you should go to Europe.
3862520	3864520	I want to.
3864520	3870320	Are there any listeners out there who want to send me a lot of money, so go to Europe.
3870320	3875920	Well, speaking of another place I want to go to, Australia, this is some interesting
3875920	3878720	news here.
3878720	3884520	Richie Young, who was once the Australian PlayStation 2 magazine's editor, he says he
3884520	3892160	was offered sex, money, overseas trips, and other types of gifts, all in the name of inflating
3892160	3894560	game review scores.
3894560	3900320	We all know that little handouts and freebies and all that kind of crap goes on all the
3900320	3905480	time, which we try to tell you, this is why you should support indies, because the mainstream
3905480	3909600	gaming doesn't give a shit about indies, and boy, have we learned that in a big way recently.
3909600	3911560	I have not had any offers for sex.
3911560	3912560	Exactly.
3912560	3919680	We don't get offers for sex, but anyway, very interesting, so that all kind of came to light
3919680	3925240	this week, and of course, has the internet abuzz about sex for game reviews.
3925240	3926240	So there you have it.
3926240	3931000	It's my nerd dream, the two things I love the most.
3931000	3939240	I want to review video games and fuckerkers, all while leveling my blood elf.
3939240	3942040	I want to cast a spell!
3942040	3943040	Oh, Black Wolf.
3943040	3944040	Why do you want to cast a spell?
3944040	3945040	There's nothing to attack you.
3945040	3948800	I'm attacking the darkness.
3948800	3951320	Black Wolf in chat totally wins with this comment.
3951320	3955400	OLR doesn't get offers for sex, but they do get fucked.
3955400	3958440	God, I love you, Bobby Black Wolf.
3958440	3964680	All right, Skyblind's open, 1877 Game OLR, or username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
3964680	3965680	Let's go to the phones.
3965680	3966680	They're already ringing.
3966680	3967680	Oh, Chris, real quick.
3967680	3968680	Skype, baby.
3968680	3969680	I'll make it worth your wild.
3969680	3972520	Well, how can you turn that down?
3972520	3973640	Let's go check out the phones.
3973640	3974640	They're ringing.
3974640	3975640	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3975640	3976640	Who's this?
3976640	3977640	This OLR?
3977640	3979640	Is this OLR?
3979640	3983360	Yes, this is Luigi Mario.
3983360	3984960	Hiya, Luigi Mario.
3984960	3985960	What's on your mind?
3985960	3989880	Not much, just calling and say that I love the show.
3989880	3990880	Do you, Luigi?
3990880	3992880	Yes, I do.
3992880	3993880	Yeah.
3993880	3998880	Why are you, I mean, I've never had a video game celebrity call into the show before.
3998880	4002280	I mean, you don't have anything better to do on Sunday nights, like save a princess
4002280	4003280	or whatever?
4003280	4005280	No, because she's too busy humping Mario.
4005280	4006280	What, Luigi?
4006280	4013200	Daisy's in the back playing DDR Supernova.
4013200	4015400	Daisy's playing DDR Supernova?
4015400	4017200	Why isn't she playing DDR with Mario?
4017200	4018200	Yes.
4018200	4020560	Well, she didn't like that.
4020560	4024160	She wanted something to up her game.
4024160	4025160	Okay.
4025160	4026520	Hey, I got a question.
4026520	4028880	I've always wanted to ask Luigi this question.
4028880	4033200	How does it feel to constantly get shafted with your brother getting all the attention?
4033200	4038520	Well, it doesn't bother me much because it gives me more time to relax and have a little
4038520	4039520	fun.
4039520	4044520	Because between a you and a me, I think Peach is a little bit of a whore.
4044520	4050520	Wait, so are you saying you trade off Princess Peach with your brother?
4050520	4051520	That's kind of gross.
4051520	4053640	Well, what can I say?
4053640	4056920	She keeps getting kidnapped by Bowser all the time.
4056920	4059680	My girl is at home having fun.
4059680	4061720	I have a nice accent.
4061720	4064360	I'm sorry, but I think this joke is in another castle.
4064360	4065960	I really don't know what to say.
4065960	4066960	Okay.
4066960	4067960	Wait.
4067960	4070760	Well, Luigi, I'm going to ask you, what made you decide to call into our program tonight?
4070760	4076600	Well, I just got a newer computer and someone had sent me a link to check it out, so I decided
4076600	4077600	to.
4077600	4079440	Was that Charles Martinet who sent you that link?
4079440	4081560	No, one of your listeners.
4081560	4082560	Oh.
4082560	4084680	The other guy by the name of Rama.
4084680	4085680	Oh.
4085680	4086680	I like Rama.
4086680	4087680	Rama?
4087680	4088680	Yeah, he's okay.
4088680	4092280	I didn't know why you spoke to Rama.
4092280	4094680	Rama's got a big black wee.
4094680	4097200	Is that really true?
4097200	4099340	Wait a minute.
4099340	4102960	Have you been sleeping with Rama as well as Princess Peach?
4102960	4103960	Oh, no.
4103960	4106440	I told the girl about the way.
4106440	4107440	You should.
4107440	4108440	Hey, wait.
4108440	4109440	I've always wanted to know this.
4109440	4110440	Does Toad?
4110440	4111440	What?
4111440	4113700	What do you think?
4113700	4114700	I think yes.
4114700	4115700	He's a screaming queen.
4115700	4116700	What do you think?
4116700	4120000	Look at what the hell we're at.
4120000	4121160	All right, Luigi.
4121160	4122840	Say something else before I hang up on you.
4122840	4123840	Love the show.
4123840	4124840	Keep it up.
4124840	4125840	All right?
4125840	4128840	I'll be listening to the next one week.
4128840	4129840	All right.
4129840	4131480	Thank you, Luigi, for the call.
4131480	4133480	You're so weird.
4133480	4135000	All righty.
4135000	4137760	It's something about the damn holiday today that's making everybody crazy.
4137760	4139320	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
4139320	4140320	Who's this?
4140320	4141320	Oh, it's Darth Vader on the line.
4141320	4142320	Hi.
4142320	4143320	It's Uni.
4143320	4144320	Hi, Uni.
4144320	4145320	What's on your mind?
4145320	4147760	You know, we were talking about Final Fantasy XI versus WoW earlier.
4147760	4150720	Yes, and you were a Final Fantasy XI player for a long time, right?
4150720	4151720	Oh, yeah.
4151720	4155440	I was playing it for about three years, two months.
4155440	4158800	I keep reminding everybody that.
4158800	4161080	It turned out I was playing the wrong game.
4161080	4162080	Really?
4162080	4165240	And what made you decide that you were playing the wrong game?
4165240	4170940	Because everybody kept treating me like crap, and I was only helping everybody out that
4170940	4172920	I possibly could.
4172920	4174720	You were a white mage, weren't you?
4174720	4175720	Yes.
4175720	4178120	I was a white mage, and that's why I quit.
4178120	4179120	I was also a white mage.
4179120	4181040	The white mage is the party bitch.
4181040	4182680	Oh, I know.
4182680	4183680	This is the...
4183680	4184680	I little...
4184680	4185680	Come on.
4185680	4186680	Come on.
4186680	4188960	This is where my decision to quit the game was.
4188960	4189960	I was...
4189960	4191080	And Rob has seen me play.
4191080	4193960	I did fucking macros with a controller.
4193960	4194960	I was hardcore awesome.
4194960	4196960	I did everything manually.
4196960	4197960	You did everything manually?
4197960	4198960	Yes.
4198960	4199960	Oh, my God.
4199960	4200960	You're nuts.
4200960	4201960	Well, I was patient.
4201960	4202960	Wow.
4202960	4203960	I would say...
4203960	4204960	Well, you have to be for that game.
4204960	4210200	I would call up 22nd Stino to buff to give everyone plenty of freaking time to get there,
4210200	4217080	and our team was like, oh, I'm going to go pump this log.
4217080	4221600	So when the bitch comes and we call in our thing, he's like, where's my buff?
4221600	4223440	I'm like, no, you suck.
4223440	4230120	So I let him die by going all black mage on whatever our thing was, and then he's messaging
4230120	4231600	me like, oh, you bitch, blah, blah, blah.
4231600	4235880	I'm like, no, you're the bastard who didn't show up.
4235880	4244440	I also leveled ninja and black mage, all both to 75.
4244440	4250720	My favorite class I think I ever played on Final Fantasy XI was probably when I played
4250720	4255720	Summoner, but the problem was I was so screwed because if you didn't have Fenrir, you were
4255720	4258720	like this, you were a piece of shit Summoner.
4258720	4259720	I know.
4259720	4261120	I had to deal with that too.
4261120	4268760	I did, though, have to say that I loved Monk.
4268760	4269760	Monk was pretty great.
4269760	4270760	Monk?
4270760	4275880	I was going to level that to 75, but that was before I decided to quit.
4275880	4278360	Well, Uni, one more question for you.
4278360	4283440	What is WoW giving you that Final Fantasy XI was lacking?
4283440	4292080	The rest of the EXP, a lot more better people that don't treat me like crap, and I can solo
4292080	4295880	my EXP instead of being the party's bitch.
4295880	4298920	Are you playing a priest in WoW?
4298920	4300480	I'm playing a tank.
4300480	4304560	See, well, it's a different type of character, but then again, the priests I know don't get
4304560	4307000	treated like bitches in WoW, so I don't know.
4307000	4308840	Oh, priests get treated like bitches.
4308840	4309840	It depends.
4309840	4310840	It depends.
4310840	4313640	Okay, Uni, I got to let you go so we can get to some other calls, any really quick last
4313640	4315480	messages for our listeners?
4315480	4316480	Okay.
4316480	4317480	Listen to Diana Fire.
4317480	4318480	Thank you.
4318480	4319480	All right.
4319480	4320480	Take care, Uni.
4320480	4321480	Bye.
4321480	4322480	Uni does her own show on another network.
4322480	4323480	She has a cute little picture.
4323480	4324480	Call the Diana Fire.
4324480	4325480	It is.
4325480	4326480	That's her.
4326480	4327480	That's her.
4327480	4328480	A little Skype picture.
4328480	4329480	A little Skype picture.
4329480	4330480	We like it when listeners.
4330480	4331480	One time we had a listener call us with video.
4331480	4332480	It was crazy.
4332480	4333480	Sweet.
4333480	4334480	I didn't even know Skype could do that.
4334480	4335480	I'm so behind the times.
4335480	4336480	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4336480	4337480	Who's this?
4337480	4338480	Rayden Softin.
4338480	4339480	Hi, Rayden.
4339480	4340480	Analog.
4340480	4341480	Hey, Rayden.
4341480	4342480	What's on your mind?
4342480	4343480	What's on my mind?
4343480	4344480	Two things.
4344480	4345680	Can I say actually one thing real quick?
4345680	4347760	I want to say thank you, Rayvenstaufen, and sorry.
4347760	4351520	Our original April Fool's joke for tonight was that we were going to have Rayvenstaufen
4351520	4355480	and some of our other infamous callers host the show, but unfortunately it didn't play
4355480	4356480	out that way.
4356480	4357480	Some things happened.
4357480	4361440	It was kind of easier to throw this together, but thanks, Rayvenstaufen, for being a good
4361440	4365160	sport and being ready and willing to do that.
4365160	4366160	Always, guys.
4366160	4367160	Always.
4367160	4368160	All right.
4368160	4369160	What's on your mind, buddy?
4369160	4373360	I've got two more news stories that you didn't mention, and this you didn't mention on the
4373360	4381640	other podcast two weeks ago, GameWise opening up a new... This is not bullshit.
4381640	4387220	They're opening up a new distribution center in Pittsburgh, and that's good for me because
4387220	4389760	I don't have to wait eight days for a turnaround.
4389760	4394640	I had heard of that, and that is very good news.
4394640	4398080	I think part of the thing I like about Netflix is that they have a distribution center in
4398080	4401840	West Sacramento, so I always get movies within a day.
4401840	4402840	Always.
4402840	4406160	I can imagine how frustrating that's got to be to have GameFly, and you're on the East
4406160	4409640	Coast and you're waiting so long for games because GameFly is a good idea in theory.
4409640	4413520	In fact, I really don't know why I'm not using it or something similar.
4413520	4416240	I hear there's one for games and flicks that maybe I should look into.
4416240	4417240	I don't know.
4417240	4419760	Not flicks is too good.
4419760	4421040	Are they not good?
4421040	4423720	Whatever the case is, I probably should be doing this with games, but for some reason
4423720	4424720	I keep buying.
4424720	4425720	I don't know why.
4425720	4428200	It's an addiction or something.
4428200	4429840	I don't know.
4429840	4430840	All right.
4430840	4435760	Well, congratulations on that, and let me know how the service improves for you once
4435760	4436760	that happens.
4436760	4439520	Well, I'm fine with the service already.
4439520	4444200	It's just, like I said, the turnaround time sucks.
4444200	4447200	Black Wolf agrees, by the way, that games and flicks sucks.
4447200	4449120	There you go.
4449120	4450680	Thank you, Black Wolf.
4450680	4452000	All right.
4452000	4455000	What else is on your mind?
4455000	4458280	Your resurrection hit the PlayStation 3 today.
4458280	4462160	Oh, on the PlayStation Network store?
4462160	4463160	Or yesterday.
4463160	4464160	It hit.
4464160	4465160	It hit.
4465160	4466160	So no joke, right?
4466160	4467160	No joke.
4467160	4468160	I don't know.
4468160	4469160	Well, that's cool.
4469160	4470160	How do I know that?
4470160	4471160	Because I picked it on my podcast.
4471160	4472160	Oh, I see.
4472160	4474560	Is this just a cheap plug for your own podcast?
4474560	4475560	No.
4475560	4476560	All right.
4476560	4481000	Well, have you downloaded Tekken yet?
4481000	4482400	I don't have a PlayStation 3.
4482400	4484160	That would be a problem.
4484160	4485600	I don't know why.
4485600	4488040	I'm curious.
4488040	4491960	Black Wolf says Tekken Dark resurrection came up a few weeks ago.
4491960	4496240	I thought I saw some story about it, but again, I don't have a PS3, so I've been able to check
4496240	4497720	for myself.
4497720	4502480	So Raven's talking about you might be a little late for that train.
4502480	4503480	What?
4503480	4504480	I guess where I got it was old.
4504480	4505480	All right.
4505480	4507480	I put that on the disclaimer on the thing anyway.
4507480	4508480	All right.
4508480	4509480	Well, that's okay.
4509480	4513400	Anything else on your mind, buddy?
4513400	4514400	No.
4514400	4515720	I'm not going to even plug the podcast.
4515720	4516720	You all know about it.
4516720	4517720	All right.
4517720	4519080	Take care, Raven's Dolphin.
4519080	4522080	The infamous, the one and only later.
4522080	4524080	The one and only, Raven's Dolphin.
4524080	4526360	Hi, you're on Orange Talents Radio.
4526360	4527360	Who's this?
4527360	4529360	This is Legend of Zaku.
4529360	4530360	Hey, buddy.
4530360	4531360	What's up?
4531360	4534360	Smoking a little bud.
4534360	4535360	I want some cookies.
4535360	4536360	Buddy.
4536360	4537360	Hey, buddy.
4537360	4538360	What's on your mind?
4538360	4539360	Having a little...
4539360	4540360	Just chilling out.
4540360	4541360	Having some Twinkies.
4541360	4542360	Yeah.
4542360	4543360	Yeah.
4543360	4544360	Yeah, buddy.
4544360	4545360	It's on your mind.
4545360	4546360	Anyways.
4546360	4554920	Just doing shit like going to this small time anime convention wasn't that big.
4554920	4558040	I had to chug the Ramune bottle really fast.
4558040	4559040	Nearly burned my throat.
4559040	4565000	But yeah, I also went to Nintendo World today trying to win a Wii and a Wii Play tournament.
4565000	4566000	Never made it though.
4566000	4572000	Dude, if you play Cooking Mama, it's like so much food in Cooking Mama.
4572000	4573000	It's lame.
4573000	4576000	You should have asked to borrow Radma's Big Black Wii.
4576000	4578000	Yeah, I should have.
4578000	4581000	But yeah, that's the whole point.
4581000	4582000	I mean, yeah.
4582000	4583000	I don't know.
4583000	4584000	It's just...
4584000	4585000	It wasn't really that much.
4585000	4586320	Oh, and another thing.
4586320	4591760	On behalf of New York City, I apologize with the way our elected officials react to how
4591760	4594600	GTA IV looks like our hometown.
4594600	4595600	I forgive you.
4595600	4596600	And you should...
4596600	4597600	Yeah, but it's also...
4597600	4603000	I also forget to disregard what the Daily News and New York Post spews out.
4603000	4604000	It's just...
4604000	4605000	They're sensationalists.
4605000	4606000	They're not even...
4606000	4610540	They just push junk news to our eyes.
4610540	4612280	And all they do is just...
4612280	4616760	They act like the Daily Bugle if it was run by that guy, that Jameson guy.
4616760	4619480	As in, so did you do nothing but print shit about Spiderman?
4619480	4620720	Yeah, no.
4620720	4621720	Not even that.
4621720	4624000	It's just that they report on...
4624000	4625680	They hype up everything.
4625680	4626680	They have a slant...
4626680	4627680	They're mostly slanted.
4627680	4632400	They're not as neutral as other papers like the New York Times are.
4632400	4634400	So I don't take their word...
4634400	4638360	I only take their word at face value and nothing else.
4638360	4639360	I want to go back to the...
4639360	4640360	I know it's just bullshit.
4640360	4641600	I want to go back to the Wii Play tournament.
4641600	4642600	What exactly...
4642600	4645240	Is this some tournament on Wii Play or what exactly was going on?
4645240	4646560	Yes, it was in Nintendo World.
4646560	4649100	How did you get denied entry into this contest?
4649100	4650100	Because I woke up late.
4650100	4651100	Oh.
4651100	4652100	Because I woke up late today.
4652100	4655600	Party a little too hard, huh?
4655600	4656800	Yeah, pretty much.
4656800	4662240	Dude, I didn't know you could gut your Wiimote and then smoke it.
4662240	4664040	Yeah, Wiimote.
4664040	4667280	It's a Wiimote right there.
4667280	4668400	We make an excellent bong.
4668400	4670480	I'm so trying that when I get home.
4670480	4671720	Yeah, so too.
4671720	4675560	Dude, this is the most entertaining call Zach has ever made at this program.
4675560	4676560	This is great.
4676560	4677560	All right, Zach.
4677560	4678560	He's up really late.
4678560	4680520	I'm hoping to see you when I come out to New York City in June.
4680520	4682120	Yeah, I heard about that.
4682120	4683120	I went to that too.
4683120	4684120	We'll see.
4684120	4685120	More details to come.
4685120	4686120	Bye.
4686120	4687120	All right, later, man.
4687120	4688120	Bye.
4688120	4689120	All right, later, buddy.
4689120	4690120	Smoke another bow.
4690120	4691120	Get her done.
4691120	4692120	Sorry.
4692120	4693120	Get her done.
4693120	4695640	Wow, you did that way too well.
4695640	4699120	That's why I have no voice tonight, because I keep straining my throat with those stupid
4699120	4700120	jokes.
4700120	4701120	Stop it.
4701120	4702120	All right, yes, Mommy.
4702120	4703120	All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
4703120	4706600	Thank you, boys and girls, for calling in and participating on the Skypline, because
4706600	4707600	rock.
4707600	4711680	All right, let's go around and ask if there's any last minute stories tonight.
4711680	4713240	Last minute stories.
4713240	4717000	Speaking news, I rule.
4717000	4719800	April fool.
4719800	4723520	She's okay.
4723520	4724520	Loki?
4724520	4732160	Guitar Hero 2, 360 will have Fector Pedals, because there's a port at the bottom of it.
4732160	4734200	I think we reported something like this.
4734200	4739680	There was a story like this a long time ago, but now it's confirmed, because apparently
4739680	4741280	the manual says so.
4741280	4744760	Pedals sold separately.
4744760	4749520	Now you really can't put the pedal to the metal.
4749520	4750520	Get it?
4750520	4755760	Here's my impression of Rob tonight.
4755760	4761320	This is Rob.
4761320	4763640	I do sound like a queef.
4763640	4767400	So here's something interesting.
4767400	4771080	I think someone, I don't remember if we reported on this or not, but apparently the ochreing
4771080	4776520	of time guy, the guy who was doing the 2D kind of homebrew game, I remember how he was
4776520	4781680	dead and everything, well, people aren't sure if this is an April Fool's joke or not.
4781680	4786320	It might be, but apparently they think that he's not dead because he's been active on
4786320	4791600	his MSN and Myspace accounts.
4791600	4795040	Either way, this is going to end up fucked up.
4795040	4799200	Either way you look at this story is going to end up fucked up, because if it was a big
4799200	4802460	April Fool's joke, that's fucked up.
4802460	4808680	But if he really was dead and all these people are not believing it, that's fucked up too.
4808680	4811080	So there are no winners in this scenario, only losers.
4811080	4813560	Mitch Hedberg died on April Fool's Day.
4813560	4814560	That's fucked up too.
4814560	4816080	And everyone thought it was a joke.
4816080	4820640	But seriously, if you're going to smoke 500 drugs, you got it coming.
4820640	4825400	I'm sorry to say, but Mitch Hedberg, rest in peace, but dude.
4825400	4832720	I wonder if he's like, dude, that'd be so funny if I fucking died on April Fool's Day.
4832720	4835160	You know that crossed his mind.
4835160	4840280	Alright, well, anything else, Logie?
4840280	4847000	No, I don't really have much else other than the lineup of games on Gamefly looks pretty
4847000	4848000	good.
4848000	4852120	Oh, like how you can go to Gamefly and look up all these great new games that are coming
4852120	4853120	out?
4853120	4854120	Yeah.
4854120	4858160	They haven't picked up on yet, or well, maybe some folks did, but they can't really talk
4858160	4859160	about it anymore.
4859160	4863280	So, you know, you might want to scan Gamefly, see what they got, because apparently Gamefly,
4863280	4866280	you know, they can do whatever they want because they're Gamefly.
4866280	4867280	So there you go.
4867280	4868280	That's hot.
4868280	4869280	I too made new Wallpaper.
4869280	4872480	This is what I was doing during the show, was making new Wallpaper.
4872480	4874600	Well, I'm proud of all of you.
4874600	4877000	Meanwhile, there's a radio show going on, so-
4877000	4878000	Why Wallpaper?
4878000	4882000	Why don't you put some of this stuff up on OLRPSP?
4882000	4883000	Whatever happens.
4883000	4884000	Where's the PSP site?
4884000	4885000	Where's the Wii site?
4885000	4886000	Where's the love, Loki?
4886000	4893840	PSP site's still up, just updated, and the Wii site, yeah, about that.
4893840	4895880	It's coming.
4895880	4896880	Soon.
4896880	4901720	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4901720	4905000	Chris, Meg Z, thank you guys so much for being here and helping us with our April Fool's
4905000	4906000	joke tonight.
4906000	4907000	You guys rock.
4907000	4908000	I know.
4908000	4909000	Get her done!
4909000	4910000	Get her done!
4910000	4911000	Meg Z, final thought.
4911000	4912000	Okay, I had it.
4912000	4914000	Chris, your final thought.
4914000	4920560	Well, I had a final thought, and then I forgot it.
4920560	4923880	Oh, my final thought is, fuck you, Jiranami.
4923880	4925320	Yeah, you heard me.
4925320	4926320	I said it.
4926320	4927320	Fuck you.
4927320	4928320	You know why?
4928320	4929320	You know why?
4929320	4932360	Because that one time I went into the chat room, the one time my computer was working
4932360	4936760	right with the chat room, you booted me off because I was trying to get Rob's attention.
4936760	4939500	Fuck you!
4939500	4941120	I idle in chat all the time.
4941120	4943120	So I'm using that there.
4943120	4944120	Watch!
4944120	4945120	All right.
4945120	4946120	I love you, Rob.
4946120	4950880	My final thought is, I want a hamburger too, and watching Logi put all that burger to waste
4950880	4951880	makes me a sad panda.
4951880	4952880	I'm going to throw it away.
4952880	4954880	You're going to throw it away right in front of my face.
4954880	4955880	No, I don't want it.
4955880	4958880	I don't want to eat something you have eaten, but it makes me go, I want a burger.
4958880	4959880	Final thought.
4959880	4960880	Oh, you have a real final thought, Meg Z.
4960880	4961880	I have an actual final thought.
4961880	4962880	Okay.
4962880	4967480	If any of the people in chat or any of the people listening live in the Chicago Midwest
4967480	4971960	area and are planning on going to Anime Central this year, Chris and I will both be there.
4971960	4975320	I will actually have an art table, and you should come by and see me and buy my art,
4975320	4976320	because it's awesome.
4976320	4979080	Actually, I think one of our listeners said she was going to Anime Central, so you guys
4979080	4980720	should plan an OLR meetup or something.
4980720	4981720	Yeah, we should.
4981720	4986400	Actually, I think somebody friended me from your OLR live journal, and she's going to
4986400	4991060	ASUN, so we're hopefully... Yeah, I'm going to try and see if I can do a promo thing for
4991060	4992060	you guys.
4992060	4993060	Fuck yeah.
4993060	4994060	Do it.
4994060	4995060	We'll get you some flyers or something.
4995060	4996060	Yeah.
4996060	4997060	I'll do a total promo.
4997060	5000640	I'll do a total promo with her art and the person who's going to share her art table,
5000640	5005480	which is Misa, by the way, anyone who is on DeviantArt.
5005480	5007200	If you're on DeviantArt, you know who Misa is.
5007200	5008200	Yeah.
5008200	5012480	I'm going to walk around with both of their art prints all over my body, and I'll have
5012480	5019600	some OLR flyers, and saying, buy these prints and listen to the show, or God will hate you.
5019600	5021020	All right.
5021020	5022020	But God already hates them.
5022020	5023020	We're going to Anime Central.
5023020	5024020	Get her done, Chris.
5024020	5025020	Get her done.
5025020	5026020	Get her done.
5026020	5027680	Okay, for Sakura, your final thought.
5027680	5029680	I have two.
5029680	5031280	Uno.
5031280	5035480	I'm doing my last two massages for my school, because I did graduate, but I haven't got
5035480	5039780	my diploma yet, and I'll have it after I do my massage final on Tuesday, so everybody
5039780	5042780	think good thoughts for me.
5042780	5043780	And then... Dos.
5043780	5050360	She says, you had two, uno, dos.
5050360	5058880	My other one is in regards to waking up at four in the morning tomorrow, do not want.
5058880	5060560	Low key, your final thought.
5060560	5061560	Don't worry.
5061560	5064880	The Wii site will be done soon, I promise you.
5064880	5067280	I've got 3D Realms working on it.
5067280	5071480	They promised me they have the best guys, you know, the guys working on Duke Nukem Forever,
5071480	5072480	working on the site.
5072480	5077220	It should be done very soon, I promise you.
5077220	5079440	They wouldn't let you down like that.
5079440	5083720	My roommate, Extrofer, just poked his head in here wanting to make a final thought.
5083720	5085760	I don't know if we should let him, but whatever.
5085760	5086760	Extrofer, final thought.
5086760	5090080	I was just going to say, I'm straight now.
5090080	5091080	You are not.
5091080	5092080	April Fools.
5092080	5093080	I am too.
5093080	5095440	No, not, look at my Myspace.
5095440	5097160	I'm in a date with the girls now.
5097160	5098760	Look at your Myspace, that's proof.
5098760	5101680	Yeah, because I'm really going to believe what I read on Myspace.
5101680	5103360	Myspace is proof.
5103360	5105800	You know we already did our April Fools show like two hours ago, right?
5105800	5108880	No, this is not an April, I know it's coincidence.
5108880	5109880	Coinkydink.
5109880	5114360	But I'm with the girls, I want the boobs.
5114360	5121160	Does vagina taste like pussy?
5121160	5122160	Does it taste like pizza?
5122160	5123160	No.
5123160	5126040	Okay, good, because I don't like pizza.
5126040	5127600	You know what pink stuff tastes like?
5127600	5128600	It tastes like mmm.
5128600	5129600	Oh, okay.
5129600	5144000	Mmm, ooh please, ooh please.
5144000	5146440	We hope you enjoyed the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5146440	5153000	It was fun, it was a great five years, but unfortunately I draw the line at pussy talk.
5153000	5159320	No, anyway, seriously, we'll see you next week, when we might actually talk about video
5159320	5160320	games.
5160320	5161320	Wouldn't that be great?
5161320	5162520	I can't wait.
5162520	5185160	So we'll see you then here on Orange Lounge Radio.
