487	5568	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5888	14730	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15450	19130	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19610	22991	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on Sunday, April the 1st, 2007.
23591	26512	And we already did our April Fool's joke.
26552	27952	The rest of the show is legit.
28268	29489	Chris and Megzi, the OLR Lesbians
50672	53615	Let's go to the Xbox 360.
53855	60683	Xbox 360 Elite is official, which further proves the point that all Microsoft rumors are true.
61344	62505	Except the ones that came out today.
63155	66797	April 1st, but we all knew the black Xbox 360 was coming for some time.
67158	68759	And Loki, I got to hand it to you.
69199	73702	Last week when we went over this on the show, you called it a 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.
74642	76263	You called the price down to the dollar.
76343	78184	It's not that hard.
78244	80226	It's really not, but it's still kind of impressive.
80246	84348	The premium system and the elite system are the price of the core plus the hard drive.
84448	87790	So the pro system being $399, the hard drive is $100, so 20 gig.
90942	92002	I'm bringing sexy black.
92102	92222	Wow.
119711	121892	That was not an invitation to break into song!
121952	123472	And black headsets.
145620	148481	Hooray for having a black console for Microsoft.
148541	149641	I mean, we've already had one.
149701	151662	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
152502	154463	People still buy the black console.
154563	154823	Why?
154923	160064	Because the DS Lite came out as white, and now the black one came out, and everyone's like, oh my god, I gotta get a black!
160224	160705	Or pink!
161145	161465	Pink!
161845	165566	Oh, no one wants pink, but black, you know, it's just, I don't know.
165826	167727	People are suckers for new colors.
167947	168547	Yeah, that's true.
168647	172028	It's like, one of the things you look at in marketing...
172658	174579	is the color of something.
174679	177420	As long as it's different from whatever it was before, it'll be more popular.
177780	179641	And also, it's only limited time.
179681	182622	It's going to go back to the white, so buy the black ones while you can.
184182	197347	Random thought, the low-end PlayStation 3 is $4.99, so isn't it interesting that Microsoft's kind of getting close to entering Sony's price range, especially when they have their own little back-and-forth and stuff?
197427	199288	As they would say, it's all about choices.
200217	202418	and you don't have to buy that Elite one.
203098	204878	Although if you want HDMI, you do.
205299	207499	So, hooray.
207559	212120	JeremyTodd1 wants you to know, the DS Lite is a handheld, not a console.
212320	213081	Aha, touche.
213701	214861	Okay, fine.
215501	216282	Let's see then.
216462	222063	How about... We'll look at... Well, the GameCube came in multiple colors.
222343	224444	Look at the PlayStation 2 Slim.
225414	231375	That came out in multiple colors, or PlayStation 2, the original system, came out in multiple colors in different countries.
232055	234116	I mean, who cares?
234176	234676	It doesn't matter.
234776	239537	To be honest, if you really wanted a black console, you can do it for like $60.
240117	242218	Or get some spray paint and you can do it even less.
243638	244258	I mean, seriously.
245458	250499	Ranma's in our chat room, taping live here on Sunday nights, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
251040	252940	Ranma says, I have a big black Wii.
255023	260806	And if you know Ranma, then that's funny if you're six years old.
262867	265688	Or if you're a lesbian, apparently.
267429	271711	If you hear the cackling in the background, that's the two lesbians giggling at Ranma's big black weed.
272651	274652	Isn't it cute?
274752	284297	So with the 120 gigabyte system, you're probably wondering a few things like, how are you going to put, say for example, you do have a 20 gig hard drive, how are you going to move your stuff over?
284850	296452	Well, you'll be happy to know that it is going to come with a data cable, so if you do have one of the older hard drives, you can transfer your saves using that data cable to the new hard drive.
296532	299373	However, you cannot transfer more to one hard drive.
299413	310735	And I remember previously they suggested that you get more than one hard drive for those digital downloads and stuff while you're fucked, because if you put another hard drive on there, it'll just overwrite all the data on there.
311496	312776	That also being said...
314819	320844	Well, not to sound like a cock, but it's not that hard to switch the hard drives out.
321685	328431	I mean, you know, if you could afford multiple hard drives, is it really going to kill you to switch the one out and put the other one?
328471	329551	It makes you saying yes.
329912	331933	Y'all are some lazy bitches.
334476	336637	Well, here's what I'd suggest.
336677	340841	So if you're going to run into these problems and you don't like these restrictions that they have on there,
341579	341819	Cool.
341839	341919	Cool.
371448	385256	As you probably remember before, and I kind of wonder how much of that 120 gigs is actually available to use, because you remember before on the 20 gig one, 7 gigs is for the updates and stuff, for the emulation.
385817	387478	So, logic tells me 113.
388998	393121	Well, there's been more updates since then, and that partition might be bigger.
393281	393661	Touche.
394282	399204	Anyway, so, what you're going to get, or I should say, have to delete off your hard drive...
400729	401750	are the following things.
402250	419421	For trailers, you're going to be getting the Forza 2 customization damage videos, Halo Wars, Fable 2, Halo 3 TV ad, Halo 3 trailer, Halo 3 2 Brute video, Accessories TV spot, Wireless World video, and Holiday 06 Accessories video.
419961	421822	Why the fuck do they have this stuff on there for free?
422783	426065	I don't understand because you can download it off of Live for free, so...
427080	428661	Not everybody gets on live though.
429342	434986	Oh goody, so they really probably want to see the Holiday 06 Accessories video.
435466	437188	Because I'm sure that's really exciting.
437328	445554	You know, I have to be honest, when I first bought my Xbox 360, I did watch some of the videos on there because I was like, ooh, high def videos on my HDTV, that's kind of pretty.
445574	449377	Because I didn't have an HD DVD player and I don't think the Comcast had been installed yet for the HD.
449677	450738	It was kind of fun, I don't know.
451818	452619	I deleted those.
453120	454821	Well, I've deleted them since then.
455042	478981	Other things you'll have on there, playable demos including Assault Heroes, Cloning Clyde, Geometry Wars, Marble Blast Ultra, Small Arms, Feeding Frenzy, Uno, Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Luminous Alive, Zuma, Heavy Weapon, LEGO Star Wars 2, Lost Planet, the multiplayer one, Madden 07, Fusion, Frenzy 2, and Call of Duty 3, and of course, like usual, Hexic HD will be on there, the full game.
479542	480803	Wow.
481463	482144	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
483496	491401	But then again though, from what I hear, if you do end up having to transfer your stuff over to that new hard drive, it'll wipe it all out anyway.
492902	495864	Some real quick chat comments before we get to our next story.
496504	501267	We have in chat, we have Hostile1 says, I guess they don't want people sharing downloaded games.
501988	507731	I mean, with this whole... Well, at least with that free cable, you're going to have to buy an extra tool to do that.
509132	510153	Mystic Gohan asks,
510489	513911	Does anyone know if the 360 uses USB hard drives for storage?
514232	514272	No.
514292	515132	That's a big fat no.
515152	515573	It does not.
515673	516573	Big fat no, sorry.
517854	521236	Misty Gohan also asks, who would buy a 120 gigabyte hard drive without live?
521377	522137	What would be the point?
522277	524319	Other than music, which I doubt is what someone would do.
525399	525840	Good point.
525980	526320	Good point.
526380	527301	Seems fairly pointless.
529842	531504	Some people... Megzi, what was this?
532784	534466	Well, okay, this is my first reaction.
534486	535827	It's like, ooh, it's bigger and better.
535927	536447	I must have it.
537864	538264	You know what?
538364	539024	It's a valid point.
539064	541865	There are not a lot of people, but there are a small amount of people.
541925	544906	It's like, ooh, big, new, shiny, must have.
546907	547467	No.
549868	553429	But you want to know what's funny, though, is that Sony's taking all the credit for the idea.
553449	557550	Well, they're going around saying that, you know...
558429	578677	There's actually a quote from their SVP of marketing, saying we think that every PlayStation 3 owner should have the elite experience, which is why we include an internal hard drive and HDMI output in every PS3 we sell, along with the 50 gigabytes of storage capacity on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.
579517	585139	So they're all trying to do like, oh, well, we're all hot shit, and they're trying to be like us.
587003	600029	It's getting really soap opera-y and kind of fun to watch what's going on between Microsoft and Sony because like with the UK launch where Microsoft was like crashing the party with those big Xbox 360 heart shoe signs and stuff.
600410	603051	It's kind of getting funny watching the two fight like little bitches.
603211	603751	It's great.
603771	605512	I mean, I'm eating this shit up.
605772	609274	There should be a podcast all to like dramatizing this whole thing.
610094	612255	These are the days of our gaming.
612275	614977	They should do a reality show like that.
615117	615597	All right, cool.
616781	621985	Sony released another PS3 model.
640990	643191	with an 80 gigabyte hard drive.
643251	645633	It was something that, you know, they were running it by the FCC.
645693	647354	They have to get the approval and all that stuff.
648595	649975	Could this be a whole new model?
650056	651757	Could this just be a storage upgrade?
652157	656199	I don't know, but Sony kind of was doing a little bit of damage control earlier this week with the whole thing.
656219	657180	I remember reading a little later.
657220	661362	We have no plans to do that, except we do have plans to do that.
663664	663964	I don't know.
664424	665765	No, we're not copying them.
666085	667206	We are not copying them.
668439	669940	How many times has Sony done that, though, really?
670200	681044	Like, you know, back when, I think it was E3 2004, I think, was when it was announced that the 360 was going to have two packages, and Sony just laughed at them, and then, you know, what happened with the PS3 is two packages.
681984	686285	Yes, because of hard drive size, that's why people aren't buying your console.
686646	689287	It must be because the hard drive's not 80 gigs.
689347	690087	That's why.
690487	692168	That's why you're not selling these systems.
692188	695409	Well, rumor goes around that Ken Kutaragi wants 250 gigabytes.
696701	697241	Great!
697361	700642	So the system will be... Hey, you know how many Crayolas that holds?
702563	703743	You know what I'm doing with my system?
703843	706264	And I'll tell you right now, we're loading that shit with porn.
706924	708245	I kid you not!
708585	711846	That is what we are doing with that 20 gigabytes that I have in there.
713746	714047	Maybe.
714227	717729	I do have lesbian porn in HD, so we can do that.
717929	719730	I've seen the lesbian porn in HD.
720210	721991	Wait, you have Pirates on HD DVD, don't you?
722392	723272	Oh my god, bring that shit over.
723292	724253	I have an HD DVD player.
724853	729036	Yeah, I have the highest budgeted porn in my possession that's HD.
729076	730256	It's actually pretty funny.
731237	732498	I wonder if I can get that in Blu-ray.
733738	734139	No, maybe.
737501	740783	The porn industry signed their allegiance over to HDTV.
742782	745363	Sorry guys, we forgot we were a video game show for a minute.
746464	755267	Hey, I'm talking about video games, so I'm just saying though, that's the only use I've found for the 20 gigs that I have in there right now, and I couldn't imagine if I had 250 gigs, I guess.
756067	758708	It'd be cool if you could use that as external storage or something.
758909	759729	More porn.
760929	761850	That's what I was thinking.
763710	764671	Alright, well...
765939	766359	DarkSakura.com
795438	795518	Loki.
795538	795758	I graduated!
795778	796158	I graduated!
818628	819409	Congratulations.
819589	823711	Seriously, those who have been listening to the show for a long time know you've been working hard at the massage stuff.
823731	825832	I am a fucking massage therapist now, bitches.
825853	827794	I want my happy ending!
827854	828294	No!
829675	830075	Oh, great.
830095	831696	I'm really glad to hear you've graduated.
831756	833517	Now, Jamie, I have a real sore spot right here.
833537	833517	$75.
836539	837779	Loki.
838660	839541	F you to Epson.
840161	843643	I tried refilling my printer ink, but...
844562	847523	Apparently there's some fine print that they don't like to talk about.
847803	853545	And that fine print would be that you can only use Epson cartridges for your Epson printers.
854266	858347	I have the PhotoR300 or whatever.
859307	865350	And apparently I tried buying generic brand ink because, you know, in the past for every other fucking printer I've owned, it works.
865670	870732	And, you know, I understand that maybe the quality of the ink or whatever may be the last big deal.
870792	871512	I'm willing to...
872390	875291	Spare the extra dollars for lower quality ink.
875692	876052	Whatever.
876692	880594	But when I put it in my printer, after spending, I might add, even on this cheaper ink, $60.
880814	884136	Because that's how much it costs to refill the fucking ink in this stuff.
885336	889678	It said, we've detected that this is not Epson ink.
890338	892219	And please use genuine products.
892319	893760	And it will not work.
894260	894580	At all.
894780	895901	So that's money just...
897522	898162	Thank you, Epson.
898222	900063	I will not be buying any more of your products.
900143	903043	In fact, I'm thinking about dumping my printer into the dumpster.
903103	909545	So, fuck you, and I'm writing some hate mail to you.
910625	911465	Better Business Bureau.
912585	913846	Alright, is that it?
914466	925488	Well, I was going to say, if you're looking for a printer out there, Epson, I think Canon, HP, they all have the chips inside of them that will count how many days go by or whatever, and will basically...
926095	930338	Your cartridge will stop working after so many days even if you don't print anything.
930418	934381	So just that in mind, you want to make sure you freeze them when you first get them.
934421	936403	If you get software off the internet, feel free to do that.
936883	938504	Just be careful when you're buying stuff.
938625	943688	Read up on it first.
943768	944909	More FUs of the week from me.
944989	945990	I have many tonight.
946130	947591	One FU to April Fool's Day.
947631	950454	This is my least favorite day of the year because everybody's a damn fool.
951454	954877	FU to my voice for making me sound like a 12-year-old all over again tonight.
955624	974776	and I want to say F you to folks that sometimes don't have to work for what they're given very hard and sometimes folks are kind of given things on a silver platter and it makes them a little bit ungrateful.
975016	977818	I'm talking about people who are ungrateful.
978318	979319	I'm not talking about anybody.
979559	979959	No, no, no.
980139	983581	This is something completely in another dimension.
984382	984422	Um...
985199	991720	Because there are people I know that are, you know, fortunate, but are yet humble, if that makes sense.
991860	996381	There's a big difference between that and being unhumble.
996962	1002143	So, there's certain people out there that should have to work harder for it.
1003683	1009704	And then I would also like to give a big F you to the fact that I have to pee so fucking bad right now, so I'm going to run out of the room while Chris and Megsy do their F yous.
1011085	1012445	I found something for Megsy just now.
1013533	1015454	I found an icon of Emma Frost's boobs.
1015535	1016836	It makes me happy.
1017356	1017916	I'm angsting.
1017996	1018757	I'm angsting.
1018877	1019277	Okay.
1019498	1020738	Wait, what was that?
1020819	1021239	Oh, FU.
1021259	1027323	Okay, my FU goes to the guy that was sitting behind us during TNG's Ninja Turtles, which you went to see today.
1027864	1029125	This guy sitting behind us.
1029705	1036390	First had the nerve to talk on his cell phone during the first part of the film, which was annoying, but I mean, he's like, oh, I'll call you back.
1036450	1039612	I liked his cell phone ring, which was, it's like, don't pick up the phone!
1039993	1041954	That's what his cell phone ring, don't pick up the phone!
1041994	1043375	Which was fucking annoying to begin with.
1043675	1049920	And then, after that, like maybe 20 minutes later, we hear someone kind of snoring.
1049940	1054763	So this guy starts talking on his cell phone, and then fell asleep and was snoring.
1055003	1058006	I really wish I had some popcorn so I could throw it back at him.
1059008	1062009	You should have thrown some reason at his head, then you would have given him more reason to wake up.
1062349	1066769	Hell yeah.
1066809	1077972	Well, I don't really have a big F you of the week, except for your people who cannot take a joke.
1078012	1081812	I'm not going to elaborate too much since we spent like a half an hour of me bitching about it.
1083233	1085073	So I'm not going to elaborate, but
1085649	1094413	F you to the people on April Fool's who fall for an April Fool's joke and then can't take a fucking joke, you losers.
1094433	1095914	I don't mean that.
1096334	1097594	You guys are nice, but seriously.
1098255	1098835	I mean it then.
1099055	1099855	Okay, Jamie means it.
1099875	1101196	Dude, this is the best icon ever.
1101256	1103257	It's the one where Kitty has a gun at Emma's head.
1104477	1105058	That's hot.
1106158	1106418	What was that?
1106738	1107479	Did Maisie do hers?
1107699	1107959	Yeah.
1108059	1108419	Oh.
1109239	1109940	Sorry, I was peeing.
1110000	1110340	I didn't know.
1111974	1113115	Who are you and you're peeing, Rob?
1113315	1116717	Well, look, when Mother Nature calls, I've learned you probably want to answer.
1117657	1119879	Because if you hang up on her, she's not going to like that.
1121960	1123121	Mother Nature will do that to you.
1123141	1125462	She's killing you for that shit.
1125582	1126543	Let's get back into the news.
1127723	1140771	Anyways, speaking of killing you, no, well, I'm not really dying in this case, but Sony, CR, and Vivendi, I guess, are being sued because Spyro has induced seizures in...
1141164	1142325	and Somebody's Baby.
1143807	1158360	Yes, according to GameSpot, is reporting that a mother of a child who suffered permanent disability injuries from a grand mal seizure while playing Spyro Enter the Dragonfly is filed suit in New York State Supreme Court.
1159241	1164526	And she names all those three companies and seeks unspecified damages.
1165346	1165467	And...
1166997	1170720	You might want to point out also that it is in the manual.
1171620	1178845	There is an epilepsy warning in there, and it is common practice in the video game software industry to put that stuff in there.
1178945	1181807	So I think it's our own damn fault, to be honest.
1182448	1185210	Yeah, you know, it's funny because you always see those warnings.
1185230	1191774	Like, I know I see those warnings all the time, and I always just kind of go, oh, gosh, I must really kind of, like, suck if that's, you know, you.
1191934	1194536	I mean, sometimes we take certain things for granted that, you know,
1195000	1204126	But to kind of hear that somebody's going to sue over that is kind of like, well, I mean, I know I see that thing all the time because I've thought about people who might want to be careful about that.
1204246	1204566	I don't know.
1205226	1208689	I've actually got a friend with epilepsy and he loves playing video games and he plays them all the time.
1209709	1212471	So is that kind of like, you know, you're lactose intolerant but you still love ice cream?
1212671	1214012	It's something like that, I guess.
1214052	1214632	You know what?
1215133	1216213	Ice cream is tremendous.
1216694	1220756	I know, but, you know, and I know plenty of people who are lactose intolerant.
1220776	1221677	They're like, fuck it.
1222317	1223438	I'll just take a lactate.
1224107	1227349	DJ Morpheus in chat says, so I can sue OLR for giving me the AIDS.
1227389	1229350	Well, it wasn't me that gave you AIDS.
1229370	1229450	What?
1229470	1229570	What?
1254466	1255247	Yeah, exactly.
1257588	1258649	See, I hate April Fool's Day.
1258669	1259509	I just hate it.
1259529	1260770	Well, let's move on.
1261911	1263031	Speaking of more bullshit.
1264052	1264332	Okay.
1266133	1273318	There is actually research going on at the University of Bolton, one of the UK schools.
1274098	1274999	Like Michael Bolton?
1277861	1279321	Somebody had to say it, Jamie.
1281143	1281383	Rob.
1282323	1282543	Yes?
1282563	1283344	Dine and Fire.
1284856	1300505	I'm saying that gaming addiction is over-diagnosed up to 10% of the time because certain indicators they were attributing to gaming addiction are actually the same as gambling addictions.
1301505	1308647	So, um, it's actually along the same lines as a gambling addiction, not just, you know, really being addicted to gaming.
1309567	1315088	Um, but they're saying that they like to, that basically it's just hype.
1315868	1316349	That's all it is.
1318189	1320150	That they're using it as a scapegoat.
1321930	1324931	That it's just like the same type of addiction people have to gambling.
1326571	1330492	So it's kind of like, you know, the best cure for video game addiction is to grow up.
1331687	1331947	Yeah.
1332147	1333267	Is that basically what they're saying?
1333968	1334688	Or just shoot them.
1336908	1337208	All right.
1337268	1339789	Anybody have anything they want to say on gaming addiction?
1340089	1341910	An addiction is an addiction is an addiction.
1342410	1343330	It doesn't matter what it's to.
1343350	1344730	It doesn't matter what caused it.
1344810	1345351	It's an addiction.
1346631	1350632	I think that there's a difference between a chemical addiction and a physical addiction.
1350732	1351472	See, I don't think so.
1353413	1357974	Then again, I actually, you know, now that you think about the biology behind addiction,
1358857	1365041	Activities, I would say, just like how there's people who are addicted to sex, people addicted to gaming, people addicted to gambling.
1365181	1366482	Addicted to lesbians.
1368223	1371245	People, especially people addicted to running.
1372466	1380151	You get that chemical response whenever you perform this action and people become addicted to the feeling they get when they're doing it.
1380171	1381032	And it's all chemical.
1381672	1385895	There's people who are addicted who always have to be, you know,
1388107	1394912	People who always have to be in a relationship because of the chemicals your body releases while you are, quote, in love.
1396112	1398154	And they may not be in love for real.
1398294	1401216	They have that feeling.
1402096	1404538	And so they're addicted to that feeling of being with another person.
1404958	1408161	So what you're trying to say is you're going to have to face it.
1408221	1409702	You're addicted to love.
1411063	1416046	That also, though, goes a lot to explain people who keep themselves in abusive and codependent relationships, too.
1418382	1423364	Wow, I don't... I know, I'm like, wow, this show took an interesting turn all of a sudden.
1423885	1432349	Well, no, I'm really... I was just thinking about it because I honestly see the same type of mentality of people who are addicted, like, say, the Evercrack people.
1434030	1437531	You point out to them, well, you could be doing this, this, this, and this to improve your life.
1438032	1441773	Don't you use sort of the same type of arguments with your friends who are in abusive relationships?
1442354	1445235	Well, you know, if you love so-and-so, you could do this, this, this, and this.
1445715	1446856	Oh, but I need him.
1447862	1449003	Oh, but I need to level.
1450805	1452966	Speaking of addicts to, you know, online games.
1453887	1454528	You know what?
1454568	1465477	I think about, though, like, also, like, you know, I'm someone who used to smoke, and I know you did, too, for a while, and that's something that's, you know, it's a mental and... I smoked cigars.
1465517	1466077	There's a difference.
1466097	1466898	You don't inhale a cigar.
1466938	1467178	Oh, okay.
1467218	1467619	Well, whatever.
1468239	1469300	I thought you smoked cigarettes for a while.
1469320	1470701	I smoked cloves, like, off and on.
1470922	1471142	All right.
1471162	1473824	Well, I was... In college, I started with cigarettes for a while.
1473844	1475265	I mean, that's why I'm... My voice, right?
1475305	1475846	But I quit.
1475866	1476006	Yay.
1476026	1476146	Okay.
1476793	1480757	Um, you know, but with that, you got the nicotine addiction and the mental addiction.
1481257	1495289	So, it's kind of like, like, I could kind of see that where WoW might be something similar when you get folks who are addicted to WoW, because there's that addiction of, like, I need to level, I need to see my friends, da-da-da, but then there's also kind of the, like, I'm addicted to it because I don't know what else to do.
1497311	1503417	That's why you, I mean, and people, I, I, I think this also goes with the gaming addiction thing, is that people are...
1504246	1505087	www.DarkSakura.com
1526696	1531918	Also, one thing about it, I've done a lot of research on addiction and stuff because I've dealt with different kinds of addiction.
1532519	1534840	Nothing illegal, but yeah.
1535900	1539442	One of the things, addiction a lot of times acts as an escape from real life.
1540082	1542303	And it doesn't really matter what you're doing.
1542363	1549126	If you're doing an activity repetitively, it's usually an escape from real life, whether it's video games or anything.
1549686	1551047	So, yeah.
1552027	1553328	Just something to add about addiction.
1553488	1553868	All right.
1554341	1556042	Nope, I agree with that too.
1556623	1560025	And I think that also kind of goes hand in hand with the whole afraid of change.
1560305	1560505	Yeah.
1560565	1561586	Afraid of things that are different.
1562246	1565689	People don't want to face their fears, so they try to avoid them one way or another.
1566249	1569091	Or could we be forgetting the one factor that really...
1569961	1570882	is an issue, I think.
1571343	1574326	Games are getting so fucking awesome that you can't stop playing them.
1574686	1575847	Like, Earth Defense Force 2017.
1576087	1577609	It is fucking awesome.
1577949	1579491	Are you on someone's payroll?
1579671	1579831	No.
1579951	1584456	I had never heard about that game until you mentioned it 50 times on this program.
1584476	1585677	Here's why I like that game.
1585717	1589681	It's because it was originally part of the Simple 2000 series, and everyone remembers, you know...
1590563	1596947	That is like the bottom of the barrel, you know, crap games, weird shit, like, you know, zombies versus ambulance and stuff.
1597408	1600129	It is just like, for me, my bad movie collection.
1600149	1602571	Alright, we gotta get back into the news, but real quick comments from chat.
1602651	1605173	Um, Actdeft says, by the way, I'm addicted to OLR.
1606474	1608015	Well... That's a good addiction to have.
1609035	1612037	Just like being addicted to doing good deeds is a good addiction.
1612197	1614399	Being addicted to being a good Samaritan is a good addiction.
1614419	1615400	Round nose plus two!
1615980	1618081	Alright, uh, let's see what else is there.
1618702	1618842	Um...
1619485	1623666	Legend of Zaku says, whatever happened to smoking a joint, eating a Twinkie, and going to sleep?
1624166	1625087	Thank you, Dennis Leary.
1627548	1628768	Wow, good job catching that.
1628848	1631669	Can I just add my little quick quirk and then you can move on?
1632489	1632969	Sure, sure.
1633249	1634290	We'll move on after this.
1634610	1642152	My only thing to say about addiction is if you're not hurting anybody and you're... Yeah, that's my only thing.
1642172	1644613	If you're not hurting anybody else, you can do whatever the fuck you want.
1644983	1650245	Well, but, you know, a lot of folks joke with me, like, oh, Rob, you're addicted to Warcraft.
1650265	1652006	You're so addicted to World of Warcraft stuff.
1652026	1655187	But I'm like, you know, I see Megs, he's joking with Chris right now.
1655227	1665412	But look, Chris is outside the house right now being social with people, you know, so am I. So there's a difference, too, between, like, joking about it and, like, no, like, seriously, you're fucking addicted to WoW because, like, you know, you are...
1666614	1668595	You're having social repercussions and all that stuff.
1668715	1669515	You know what's really funny?
1670876	1672057	After this, I swear, you can move on.
1672317	1684422	But if all the WoW addicts will be able to say, like, when you're first loading into your character, you know how they got that little message for you when the little bar is, like, loading the thing?
1684803	1692026	One of the things that it said, all good things should be taken in moderation, even WoW.
1692486	1693327	I thought that was hilarious.
1693507	1694327	I've seen that one, too.
1694627	1696268	I like how Blizzard can laugh at themselves.
1696727	1697448	Well, it's true, though.
1697688	1698628	Yeah, it's very true.
1699009	1701451	I'm out of the ambition if you want to sit there in your pants.
1701471	1708296	Final Fantasy XI has a big old disclaimer that comes up every time you click to log into the game that says, The world of Vanadil is an exciting place.
1709557	1714981	I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for so long I'd probably read the damn thing verbatim, but it says something like, The world of Vanadil is an exciting place.
1715021	1717503	However, please do not neglect your friends, work, and all that stuff.
1717523	1718003	It's interesting.
1718623	1721025	All right, we've got to keep it moving, but we do welcome your feedback.
1721125	1722626	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1722646	1724268	Do you know anyone that's addicted to video games?
1724688	1726109	What kind of effect has that had on their life?
1726513	1727294	We want to hear your emails.
1727814	1735221	And we will get to the mailbag a little later in the show, but first, we have to feed my Castlevania addiction, because Castlevania is one of the best series in the history of video gaming.
1735802	1743349	And, well, Paul Anderson has left Castlevania to go work on his new Death Race 2000 remake.
1743889	1744410	Oh, yeah!
1744650	1747813	Or at least, that's what early reports indicated.
1747873	1748774	But then, Good!
1751035	1751556	Death Race 2000 Death Race 2000
1771021	1799314	Death Race Death Race 2000 is basically almost like Carmageddon the movie it's an old ass movie one of the first ones that Sylvester Stallone was ever in it's basically David Carradine plays this guy who's in this race that you get points for killing people with your car and at the very end he takes out the commissioner of this race I guess who's the president of the world or something like that with his hand grenade pun intended but it's so ridiculous though and
1800359	1801799	I can't wait to see this movie.
1803260	1805340	Definitely worth checking out, though, if you haven't seen it yet.
1805520	1807781	Death Race and Death Sport, both about the same thing.
1809161	1810402	I could just watch The Running Man.
1813462	1814963	It's pretty funny.
1815103	1824085	Anyways, so Hitman is getting, of course, a film made about it, and Variety is reporting that...
1824895	1837688	Looks like Fox has picked it up, and they'll be shooting this week in Bulgaria's capital of Sofia.
1839170	1844014	Kind of interesting, though, it says the film's going to be filmed in South Africa, London, and Istanbul as well.
1845096	1846037	Not Constantinople?
1846497	1848339	Not Constantinople, no.
1849153	1860176	Anyways, and I guess the guy who's actually shooting this right now is Xavier Jens, who I believed... Let's see here.
1862277	1863497	I don't really know what else he's done.
1864457	1865398	Anyways, who cares?
1866598	1873640	But it is kind of interesting, though, because they're saying that one of the stars of Desperate Housewives has actually been confirmed as one of the villains.
1874400	1877461	And I don't follow Desperate Housewives too much, but apparently...
1878410	1879931	Cast Member... Let's see.
1882894	1883235	I don't know.
1884155	1890521	Dougry... Oh, Dougry Scott is going to play Suter Ian Hainsworth.
1894165	1896747	Yeah.
1896807	1899009	Timothy... Sorry, this story was putting me to sleep.
1899050	1899210	What?
1899630	1903153	Timothy Olfant will play the lead as the Assassin Agent 47.
1904954	1908116	It'll just be a generic fucking action movie like all the others.
1908336	1908576	It is.
1908876	1909036	It is.
1909056	1915760	Yeah, so Dougry Scott, the guy who plays, I guess, the British guy in Desperate Housewives, is going to play the villain.
1917060	1917381	All right.
1917961	1925065	Well, thank you for that, and we will be sure to not see that and wait for a DVD so I can Netflix it.
1925625	1926045	Just kidding.
1926525	1933609	Anyhow, one other great fucking same old thing we like to look forward to every week here is the mailbag here at orangeontrader.com.
1933988	1938270	People email us, and of course that email address is mailbag at orangenotesradio.com.
1938590	1942912	DarkSakura likes to dive in headfirst into the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1943092	1943412	I do.
1943432	1943852	And read them.
1944853	1947714	Well, April fools, or so she tells me.
1948774	1950095	She likes to read them here on the air.
1950415	1951015	I do.
1952156	1953436	Don't make me shove this mic up your butt.
1956438	1957258	That's Texas for Boys.
1962759	1964902	Anyway, anyway.
1966544	1967225	Hey, OLR.
1967265	1971690	I was just listening to the last episode of OLR and I heard about the youngest OLR listener, a 12-year-old.
1972070	1975354	But now I declare myself the second youngest listener of OLR at 13 years old.
1975735	1978398	No matter what you guys say, I'll still listen to you because you guys are great.
1978558	1979219	From Ron.
1980220	1980881	Thank you, Ron.
1983174	1986537	Oh my god, if this kid is 13, then that means he was born in 94, right?
1986657	1988498	Oh my god, I know, I was like a sophomore.
1988578	1988798	Oh god.
1988818	1991200	Thank you for making me feel old, Rob!
1991340	1993822	I was in 4th grade.
1994182	1995423	When I was your age!
1995443	1996324	I was in 2nd grade.
2012625	2013966	No, wait, I was in first grade.
2014026	2016467	Holy crap.
2016527	2018047	I was on a date with your mama.
2018608	2019308	Last night.
2020408	2020729	Really?
2021229	2022049	No, I wasn't.
2023770	2027051	So this is from Alex.
2028112	2028392	Hi, Alex.
2028412	2031093	I said that Rondo of Blood sucked because it was on PSP.
2031153	2032314	PSP equal to evil.
2032754	2033974	Youngest OLR listener.
2034835	2035155	P.S.
2035215	2036615	My parents don't know I listen to this.
2037416	2038056	That's okay.
2038096	2039857	We're going to call them live on air.
2040177	2042138	Do you know what your kid is listening to?
2043399	2043679	Wow.
2044580	2044860	Anyway.
2045721	2046621	Rondo of Blood is awesome.
2047702	2047982	Okay.
2048923	2049724	Oh, we have a joke.
2051365	2051965	We have a joke.
2052085	2052505	Oh, God.
2052546	2052826	Here we go.
2052846	2053286	Two jokes.
2054087	2059190	This is from... Can someone remind me how the Orange Lounge radio listeners got encouraged to send us jokes?
2059230	2060271	Because we actually read one on air.
2060791	2064774	This is from Arizth, I guess is how it's pronounced.
2065975	2066315	All right.
2066415	2066896	I got two.
2067896	2069718	What's meant to go deep and is full of semen?
2071339	2071899	A penis?
2072259	2072420	No.
2072440	2072680	A submarine.
2072700	2073000	A submarine.
2073359	2073639	Shut up, Rob.
2101485	2113679	I've been listening to your podcast and it's a PSP RSS feed enabled and it's good to listen to you guys because you work during the day and make such a great effort to do the shows on Sunday night in your own time and that's
2114668	2116209	and Achievement for Anyone.
2116329	2120111	Okay, this person uses the mixing numbers and shit with their words.
2120131	2121092	Oh, a MySpace message.
2121112	2123053	So this fucking pisses me off.
2123193	2125814	I'm going to read it because it's cool that you took the time to write us.
2126255	2129457	But next time, please actually use full words.
2129857	2132698	Spell everything out and if in doubt, use a spell checker.
2132899	2134099	You know what's fucking awesome?
2134339	2134599	Huh?
2134660	2135580	Punctuation.
2136080	2137021	Punctuation is great.
2138341	2142984	Can we put that on a poster with Chris's picture doing a big thumbs up?
2143464	2145045	You know what's fucking awesome?
2145505	2146405	Punctuation.
2146425	2153789	Make sure that when you use your spell checker, the words that have been spelled check are the right versions of the word that you want to spell check.
2154089	2155750	Remember, B-R-A-K-E.
2156010	2157571	That's in your card, dummy.
2158371	2158912	Okay, sorry.
2158952	2159812	Back to the email.
2159832	2160633	Back to the email.
2160813	2161413	Back to the email.
2165882	2167803	because when I get home from work, I'm tired.
2167923	2170484	Unfortunately, I can't listen to the live show due to time zones.
2171104	2173885	Anyway, I sold my PSP, and funny enough, but you guys stuck with me.
2174265	2178627	I enjoy your show so much that I now download the podcast on my PC and listen every Mondays and Wednesdays.
2179207	2180548	Loki PSP is fun.
2181448	2188731	Dark Alex Customs gets real boring once you kit it up to the max, LOL, hence the word sold it.
2190071	2191352	Anyways, I just wanted to tell...
2192282	2196824	Tell you that you guys are doing a really great show for us hardcore and non-hardcore gamers.
2197524	2203586	With all your efforts with keeping us updated on the gaming world, I wish you the best on the future and more to come.
2203926	2205526	I love Rice Princess LOL.
2207447	2208968	Okay, I have a headache.
2209448	2209968	But thank you!
2211420	2213121	I love it when listeners send us nice things.
2213181	2215941	Please don't get me wrong, but please don't email us.
2216281	2216762	No offense.
2216802	2224744	I'm not trying to dog on you or anything, but just because you type the email on your computer, which doesn't have access to the Internet, it's still not the Internet.
2224804	2227465	So please don't talk like you're on the Internet.
2228545	2229605	The more you know.
2230105	2231066	Okay, next email.
2231866	2232306	Wait, wait, wait.
2232386	2232666	I'm sorry.
2232686	2234147	I have a quick something for Chris.
2234507	2238088	It's a little bit late, but I'm sorry I'm slow because the files on my computer are misorganized.
2238108	2238808	But here you go, Chris.
2239963	2243786	This mailbag segment was ruined to you, courtesy of DJ Alligator Project.
2243846	2245487	I have the vinyl, by the way.
2245767	2247248	Didn't I buy you a Guitar Wolf CD once?
2247268	2247548	Record.
2266813	2268494	You were supposed to rip that for me.
2269454	2270274	That's why I bought it for you.
2270695	2271015	I'm kidding.
2271515	2273076	Anyway, next one.
2273136	2274076	Hey, love your show.
2274156	2276877	I wanted to send you a message that we should all ponder about.
2277237	2279278	The actual cost of an Xbox 360.
2280478	2285560	Now that the Elite finally announced, is the 360 still the cheapest current-gen hardware?
2285700	2286201	No way.
2286281	2287101	Let me explain.
2287641	2291843	Everyone complains that the PS3 is too expensive, but I believe the 360 is the biggest rip-off.
2292203	2292663	Here's why.
2293223	2294124	First of all, you get...
2295470	2300471	To get a comparable 360, you must A, buy the Elite, or B, upgrade your hard drive for $179.
2301192	2305873	Second, even if you buy the Elite for $479, it doesn't even compare to the PS3 in terms of features.
2306553	2308573	A, to get the wireless network, you must pay $99.99.
2310254	2312474	B, to get high-definition movie player, you must pay $199.99.
2312514	2313135	To play online, you must pay $59.99.
2313195	2314695	D, to charge your controller's
2319392	2320573	Using the console, you must pay $19.99.
2320613	2329841	So if my math is right, the consumer must pay a total of $859.95 to get a console comparable to the features and hardware featured in the PS3.
2330922	2337308	So the old saying now should read, Sorry Microsoft, but I can't buy a PS3 Nintendo Wii for the price of one of yours.
2337849	2339310	Let me know what you guys think of this.
2339410	2340091	Thanks, Matt.
2342553	2342954	PlayStation 3.
2344734	2373385	probably about 30 games out right now Microsoft's Xbox 360 a lot more than that I understand what this person is saying and that is true is that sometimes we are unfairly comparing the charges and when I say we I don't mean us specifically because you know obviously a lot of the internet is on the same page but again you know when all is said and done price be damned Xbox 360 has the games I want on it right now Playstation 3
2374414	2376054	Xbox still has better games on it.
2376074	2376695	Xbox has nobody!
2404813	2431248	I do think if Sony were to really start to threaten Microsoft's grip that they've got going right now, which I think Sony may do in a year, I would not be surprised, and this has been rumors and rumblings already, if Xbox drops some elements of their gold service and they give you a little more stuff for free and the gold people get, I don't know, something else special to compensate.
2431616	2432837	They've been talking about those.
2433177	2434959	That sort of rumor's been going around for a long time.
2435259	2439763	So I think Microsoft will cut corners where they have to to compete with Sony.
2440223	2443466	But until Sony really has a lot more games, I don't know.
2444206	2446368	But anyway, I guess that's my thought.
2447389	2447669	Okay.
2448430	2450011	Well, we have one more email.
2450251	2450551	Yay.
2451332	2453794	One more email.
2454575	2456616	One email to rule them all.
2457237	2457497	Okay.
2458371	2463053	Okay, I have been listening to the podcast version of the show for about two to three months now.
2463433	2467815	Well, technically it says two-thirds of a month, but I think it means two to three months, I hope.
2468475	2470736	So now I have managed to catch a couple of live shows.
2470796	2472777	I want to give you all props because the show is great.
2472837	2476899	I love Loki's insider info and the comedy of Rob and Jamie's bickering like siblings.
2478259	2479299	That's because Rob's my bitch.
2480160	2480700	Whatever.
2481540	2482281	You don't know me.
2482341	2482841	Sit down.
2482861	2483221	Shut up.
2483241	2483321	Mom!
2483341	2483921	Mom!
2484221	2485662	Stupid!
2485702	2487023	Be quiet!
2488407	2488887	www.DarkSakura.com
2514182	2514522	DarkSakura.com
2538280	2541161	Oh my god, your mom was the bus driver on South Park.
2542041	2543001	Sit down!
2543661	2545602	Shut up!
2546402	2547622	What did you say?
2550483	2551423	My mom was a screamer.
2551583	2552903	Anyway, back to the email.
2553083	2553783	Really now?
2555484	2557104	That's why I'm not breeding, okay?
2557124	2558604	I don't want to be like my mom.
2558664	2559525	Really now?
2562505	2565966	And that's where I learned how to drown out while people are talking to me.
2567319	2568800	and then repeat everything they just said.
2568960	2570800	It also helped me pass tests when I was in high school.
2570920	2571460	Mailbag, please.
2571720	2571920	Okay.
2572701	2579803	I'm sure that y'all have had this debate before, but I'm looking at finally taking the plunge and investing my summer into an MMO.
2580323	2581443	I am at ends, however.
2581503	2586225	My brother is hardcore hooked on Final Fantasy XI and constantly comments on its wondrousness.
2587045	2588206	Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
2615601	2617563	So, bless you.
2618083	2626229	So World of Warcraft versus Final Fantasy, and I mean that in a pagan way, versus Final Fantasy XI, keep up the good work, the show is great, and damn Life 365 increasing fees.
2626609	2627690	That's from Boko Thet.
2628310	2631753	Well, you can damn the government for increasing those fees.
2631813	2634235	Life 365 is just doing what they have to do to stay afloat.
2634535	2639679	If you want more information on that, life365.com slash choice, I encourage you all to check it out.
2639879	2642260	But, anyway, back to the other topic.
2642581	2643922	Final Fantasy XI is full of bitches.
2644202	2644382	Well,
2644998	2652961	I did play Final Fantasy XI for two years, and I realize you're a new listener to Orin Lounge, so you kind of missed that whole period where my gaming week every week was Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI.
2653321	2653861	Here's the thing.
2654422	2659243	Final Fantasy XI forces you to have a social experience and be social with other people.
2659844	2667767	The problem with XI is that it's very difficult to sign on for a short period of time to just kind of go, hey, I just want to sign on real quick.
2667807	2670688	Especially since it takes five hours to get a fucking party.
2670988	2674189	Yeah, and sometimes you're having to really wait for a party for a long time.
2674767	2682914	Now, I know Final Fantasy XI, recently I read something about a new patch they're doing that's addressing some of those issues to try and make smaller parties more effective.
2683494	2693683	But, I don't know, the reason why I've stuck with Warcraft is that sometimes you have to party, but there's so much you can do solo as well that kind of keeps the game going.
2695284	2698367	The thing, though, that I think would maybe woo you over this,
2698931	2702133	Check out, I mean, Warcraft does the 10-day free trial.
2702193	2704654	To my knowledge, Final Fantasy XI offers nothing similar yet.
2704915	2708197	But maybe you could watch your brother, whoever you said has it, play it for a little bit.
2709177	2711098	Get the 10-day free trial for WoW.
2711158	2711659	Try it out.
2711719	2714240	If you don't like it, maybe Final Fantasy XI is more your taste.
2715121	2719163	If Final Fantasy XI ever chooses to do a free trial, I would say go for that as well.
2720884	2723285	For someone who, again, is addicted to WoW.
2723886	2724506	Shut up.
2724546	2724946	Magic!
2724966	2725227	Magic!
2726784	2734751	I'm actually very antisocial when it comes to games, and the only reason I picked up World of Warcraft is because I'm a big fan of Blizzard.
2734771	2739755	I used to play Diablo 2 and Diablo and whatnot, and the expansions on that.
2740516	2741677	But I'm a solo game player.
2741757	2749564	I don't like interacting with a lot of people, and then every now and then I'll want to chat with people, but most of the time people are just stupid, so I don't want to go near them.
2750506	2751988	But WoW is actually really fun.
2752008	2757412	You can do it all by yourself, and you can only team up if you want to, and that's the reason I like it a lot.
2757953	2767741	And, I mean, any MMO is going to have some annoying little aspects of it, but I just found that WoW is a lot more easier to deal with if you don't want to deal with other people.
2768682	2769542	Then they dance.
2771424	2777329	Well, they do, but to Final Fantasy XI's credit, there is no Taru slash Panic.
2777884	2779404	which does win in Final Fantasy XI.
2779424	2781425	You just have to see it to know what I'm talking about.
2781545	2782925	Anyhow, you know what?
2782965	2787286	Our chat room is debating this too, and it looks like World of Warcraft is winning by a landslide.
2787326	2793767	I hate to say, for those Final Fantasy XI fans who might be listening, if you want to argue your point, send us an email, mailbag at orangechanneltrader.com.
2794507	2797328	Hitstun says, objection, Final Fantasy XI is not Final Fantasy.
2798668	2800909	NintendoManiac64 says, neither.
2801029	2801949	MMOs corrupt.
2802889	2804609	Drunami says, Final Fantasy XI is dead.
2804629	2806010	Final Fantasy XI remains dead.
2806050	2807050	Gil Sellers killed it.
2808031	2810592	Uni says, I suggest that Final Fantasy XI is not worth it.
2810692	2812252	I played three years on it, and gah.
2813313	2817274	DJ Tyrant says, WoW has 90% of their content that can be soloed.
2817594	2819915	Final Fantasy XI has very little solo content.
2822016	2822436	There you go.
2824216	2835960	In my honest opinion, after having played them both, I've put more time into World of Warcraft than I have Final Fantasy XI because I could play a lot more solo if I wanted to.
2837859	2846501	And to be perfectly honest, though, I actually still like Ragnarok Online more because I could just do other shit.
2846562	2847282	What the fuck?
2847302	2848502	Sorry, I'm distracting you, Pete.
2849222	2850383	Hey, boobs!
2850403	2854804	Can you make a PSP background of that or something and put it on olrpsp.com or something?
2854824	2855544	Okay, so that's all.
2856424	2857664	All right, thanks for the emails.
2858125	2860925	Mailbag at orangelandre.com if you have something you want to email us.
2861005	2863586	And I'm sure we'll have some Final Fantasy XI fans chiming in next week.
2863919	2868800	But actually, I am kind of curious to hear, those that are still playing XI, what's keeping you in the game.
2869320	2871541	Because you've heard a lot of us talking about WoW now.
2871861	2872781	You know, I'm kind of curious.
2872841	2874421	Because I know there's a lot of people that still play it.
2876722	2878922	I'm just glad I can contribute something, because that's the only game I play now.
2879323	2880023	Oh, whatever.
2880063	2883063	You always contribute lots of stuff to the program, whether you'd like to admit it or not.
2885224	2885704	Moving on.
2886444	2890025	Halo 2 also has a lot of folks who are addicted to it, and
2890416	2894479	Microsoft has announced they will be putting out two new maps for Halo 2.
2895180	2896541	Actually, I believe they just went up.
2896601	2898903	They're available for $4 to download.
2901285	2903346	No word yet if they're going to be free later on.
2904347	2910332	The maps that just came out are Hang'em High and Tombstone, which are maps that came... Oh, I'm sorry, no.
2910372	2913395	Hang'em High and Desolation, which came over from Halo 1.
2913955	2914676	So, kind of cool.
2915456	2916117	If you're a Halo fan.
2916557	2917678	Yes, if you're a Halo fan.
2917718	2918559	Now bring on the Halo 3 beta.
2920831	2921531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2947230	2951233	World Trade Center, and South Park, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
2952133	2962039	Warner Brothers, Home Entertainment is also adding, including, oh, this is going to be kind of interesting, Sublime and Babylon 5, The Lost Tales.
2963120	2975688	And some other stuff from TV that you're going to be getting, A&E Networks, they're providing Dog the Bounty Hunter, King of Cars, Driving Force, and Chris Angel Mind Freak.
2976232	2978433	as well as Gene Simmons' Family Jewel.
2978473	2980953	Oh, that's that show they used to make fun of on The Soup all the time, remember?
2981273	2982594	Mind Freak!
2982954	2983414	Remember that?
2983514	2983814	Yes.
2983874	2984594	Oh, God.
2986354	2989995	ADV Films, they're going to have some anime stuff on there, so you can check that out.
2990715	2993376	National Geographic, of course, adding some stuff there.
2993676	3000658	New Line Cinemas, Bringing Snakes on a Plane, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning, Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny.
3000998	3001258	The Pink.
3001278	3001438	The Pink.
3002113	3003474	The Pink of Destiny, yes.
3003874	3010499	No, The Pick of Destiny, plus some other top titles including Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Magnolia.
3011099	3015903	And then Total Vid is providing, I guess, some extreme sports videos.
3017544	3021947	Okay, how about some titles we don't all already own on DVD already?
3022147	3023468	I'm looking at you, Austin Powers.
3023548	3023748	I mean...
3024580	3033104	No offense, I mean, yay for Microsoft getting more stuff on the marketplace, but how about something to compete with the DVDs that are out there now?
3033204	3033764	Does that make sense?
3034504	3035905	I know.
3035925	3037806	Especially the TV department, more HDTV.
3037946	3041627	Also interesting is their pricing structure has changed.
3043628	3045369	Now, basically, here's how it's going to work.
3045856	3058202	The new releases now, the 720p HD movies are going to be 480 Microsoft points, or $6, while the standard size movies are going to be $4, or 320 Microsoft points.
3058242	3059102	Half and up, didn't it?
3059562	3060102	I think so.
3060182	3066505	Classic films, the HD ones are going to be $4.50, or 360 Microsoft points, and $3 for the normal resolution movies, or 240 Microsoft points.
3066525	3068246	Then TV purchases...
3075493	3079014	For HD, it's going to be $3, and for SD, it's going to be $2.
3082955	3083275	I don't know.
3083435	3089276	I haven't bought anything yet, and I'm not really looking to purchase anything anytime soon.
3089516	3097878	I bought the one movie, which was cool, the Hard Candy or whatever, because it was an artsy house movie that I didn't think I'd find in HD otherwise.
3098973	3104136	But now that I have the HD DVD player and I've got some Netflix here, I got Babel on HD DVD.
3104236	3104856	I don't know.
3104897	3108318	I'm kind of using Netflix to get my movie feel right now.
3108759	3110840	I know this is not the avenue that they want to go in.
3111380	3112781	I'm telling you, big money here.
3113501	3114402	Porn downloads.
3115142	3120185	Confirm with a credit card number or something like that that you're over 18 or something like that.
3121746	3122846	That would be fucking awesome.
3122886	3124307	I would love to see porn downloads.
3124607	3125988	Do you really think Microsoft would do that?
3126148	3126228	No.
3127011	3132213	No, because it would be horrible for PR, but they should.
3134855	3136635	Maybe there's a creative way they could do it.
3136775	3139257	Like, you know, Pimps at Sea.
3139277	3141978	What?
3142558	3143939	That's the Halo 3 alpha name.
3143979	3144439	It's a joke.
3145539	3147560	They had a movie poster for that, which looked funny.
3147640	3151842	It was a pirate with a pirate's hook for a head.
3155204	3155864	You know what?
3156874	3157374	Chicken Butt.
3158334	3160795	We need ninja, like, more ninja stuff going on.
3161815	3165496	Anyway, because we all know that the natural enemy of the pirate is the ninja.
3166476	3168817	So... A pirate ninja.
3169037	3170317	There was a pirate ninja in Weebles.
3171857	3182079	Anyway, for anyone who has been keeping up with Bullet Witch, the Xbox 360 shooting game, there is now some downloadable content... Who hasn't yet committed suicide.
3183100	3184300	Announced by Atari...
3185974	3188996	What's out is there is a white witch outfit.
3189056	3194821	There's also going to be coming up a mummy schoolgirl secretary and pixie outfits later on.
3197463	3200245	Mummy slash schoolgirl comma.
3203088	3203968	We can't hear Megzi.
3204289	3207811	I was going to say a mummy schoolgirl secretary.
3208772	3209553	With pixie wings.
3209593	3210814	With pixie wings.
3212235	3212575	I came.
3212835	3213056	Wow.
3213076	3213336	Anyway.
3214125	3218988	So also coming up, these are new missions that are 20 Microsoft points each.
3219529	3221590	The Dynamite Beauty is available now.
3222090	3228895	Coming up is Kladden Streaming and Great Spells and some other difficulty settings.
3229835	3245283	Um, there will also be, um, Caterpillar City, Endless, One-Shot Kill, Geist Search and Destroy, and enhanced, uh, additions of City of Screams, Up in Flames at 10,000 feet, Down in the Valley, The Bound Soul, and The End of Chaos.
3245964	3248725	There will also be theme packs, and, um,
3249931	3254794	For people who don't know much about the game, it's by the studio Kavya.
3256355	3262279	It's a third-person action game, and this witch lady has to shoot things.
3262639	3265521	Which download content will make my game not suck?
3265721	3270964	I know, I was going to say, coming out next month for 100 Microsoft points, a patch that makes the game not suck.
3271104	3278409	Here's the thing that's really ridiculous about the whole thing anyways, is that for 20 Microsoft points, I think that's the equivalent of a quarter.
3279176	3280236	Just make it free.
3280416	3283317	I mean, seriously, you're making a quarter off this crap.
3283717	3290499	I mean, just make the goddamn content free as if, you know, sorry the game sucks so bad.
3292820	3295721	I'm going to download this, by the way, because I have the game.
3296201	3298341	Although I don't know if I want to waste a quarter on this stuff.
3298441	3299302	I'll think about that.
3299982	3302002	I may throw it at a hobo instead, you know.
3303483	3305423	That might be worth a little bit more to me.
3305983	3307544	Mummy schoolgirl pixie wings?
3308581	3309421	Quarter at Hobo.
3310681	3311142	I don't know.
3312262	3315602	But I do know that P-Cross DS is coming out in Europe pretty soon.
3315622	3316463	Do you like my transition?
3317583	3322464	P-Cross DS is this kind of like picture crossword type game.
3322984	3323244	I don't know.
3323284	3324664	It kind of looks like Minesweeper to me.
3324704	3325305	I haven't played it.
3325705	3327665	But it's coming out on May 11th in Europe.
3327705	3329525	It's a part of the Touch Generations label.
3329585	3331566	Nintendo's putting it out on the DS.
3332166	3333966	Over 300 puzzles.
3334426	3337107	Everything from easy to the toughest upon tough.
3337620	3341303	Also, multiplayer amongst the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.
3341363	3345286	So if you want to do some puzzling over Wi-Fi, here's something to check out.
3345346	3348969	The game has been getting very solid reviews, even though I don't make it sound very good.
3349009	3352592	Keep in mind, I haven't actually played it, so my opinion doesn't mean shit.
3353533	3353873	Right!
3354053	3355334	It's an old Game Boy game.
3356355	3356575	Is it?
3356655	3357216	I don't remember.
3357236	3358917	Yeah, it's a very, very old game.
3358957	3360498	It was Mario's P-Cross a long time ago.
3360859	3361339	Well, shit.
3361960	3363341	And I like puzzle games, too.
3363921	3366103	In fact, I kind of actually, for some sick reason,
3366593	3371234	Side of me kind of wants to get Honeycomb Beat just because it was kind of fun at that show we played at that.
3371314	3372654	Oh, I don't know.
3372714	3373235	I'll hook you up.
3373295	3373695	Don't worry.
3374235	3374555	Okay.
3375635	3376475	Well, let's move on then.
3378656	3385438	Anyways, so in case you may have been under a rock for some reason, you know, it might be nice and cool down there.
3385538	3385878	Who knows?
3387518	3394720	The Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hit the internet and the internet exploded because I crashed a bunch of different websites.
3394760	3395520	Sounded just like that.
3395936	3398877	That was also the same sound that was in my pants after watching it.
3399257	3402518	But, no, seriously though.
3403178	3403758	It was awesome.
3403778	3412221	That was also the sound Lindsay Lohan's vagina made shortly after she got out of rehab.
3412261	3412721	Never mind.
3413721	3415401	There's a joke there, look for it.
3415501	3421003	Apparently a few politicians are a little bit pissed off at the fact that the game takes place in Liberty City.
3422674	3428159	Note to politicians, the game is taking place in Liberty City for about four different games now.
3428640	3429821	Where the fuck were you?
3431342	3437968	Anyways, so now they're just like, oh, but now that it really looks like New York, we don't like it.
3438108	3443673	And it's funny because I'm going to quote this, I think the best one I read here, story about it was on Kotaku.
3444394	3447457	They were saying, and here's some of the quotes that they picked out here.
3448172	3453696	Setting Grand Theft Auto in the safest big city in America would be like setting Halo in Disneyland.
3453897	3455978	City Councilman Peter VanLore.
3457359	3458300	I want to play Halo.
3458320	3463224	Halo in Disneyland might make me interested in that game a whole lot more than I already am.
3468187	3471270	That'd be right up there with the lady on the cell phone in the SUV game.
3472956	3479321	The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing police officers.
3479421	3482262	Jason Post, spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg.
3482743	3485865	And then the best one, and probably the most uninformed.
3487205	3494030	In previous incarnations, players advanced through the game by killing cops, selling pornography to children, and killing prostitutes.
3495130	3497952	I'm just going to take a wild guess here.
3498112	3500614	I think one of those three is not right.
3501857	3506699	Must be the killing cops part, because, you know, I don't think you sell pornography to children in there.
3506739	3510360	There's not, you know, Grand Theft Auto child pornographer.
3511541	3514802	But if they put that in Grand Theft Auto 4, that would be a great new feature.
3514822	3516663	It'd be a cool side mission.
3517983	3519664	Either way, though, they're going to bitch and moan.
3519704	3521364	It's just going to build up the hype for it.
3522165	3526466	Certain people are going to file lawsuits, and the game's going to come out and fucking rock.
3526526	3528927	So, way to go, Rockstar.
3529107	3530728	You know how to hype up your games.
3533271	3534431	Here comes the hype train.
3534792	3535272	Choo-choo.
3535292	3535972	Choo-choo.
3536232	3537353	It did look good, though.
3537633	3538033	Very good.
3538053	3539133	I can't wait to play it.
3539873	3541254	I'll tell you what I'm happy about, though.
3542394	3543855	I'm happy about more Ninja Gaiden.
3544555	3546056	Because I need to play this demo.
3547156	3549257	I've been a big Ninja Gaiden fan, like, forever.
3549797	3558280	So coming out on the Japanese PSN, we have the demo for Ninja Gaiden Sigma.
3558661	3560861	And it is not Gaiden, it's Gaiden.
3560901	3562442	Pronounce it right, fuckers.
3566411	3567892	There's a joke I want to make, but I can't.
3569472	3570632	I'll make my people angry.
3572913	3581875	No, it just really pisses me off because I grew up and I was like, I don't think that's how it's supposed to sound.
3582456	3584816	And Gaiden, by the way, means side story.
3585957	3586537	Okay, anyway.
3587237	3588997	Stop being so Gaiden.
3589658	3590838	I'm going to kick your butt.
3591924	3595707	So anyway, you run around in tight leather.
3596187	3597167	Maybe it is a little gay.
3601630	3606113	That made Jamie's bitching all worth it, seriously.
3606133	3608514	But the demo is to be out.
3608875	3610215	I don't see a date.
3610656	3613137	April 27th is going to be their date.
3613778	3615279	So happy birthday to me.
3618741	3619041	All right.
3619574	3634501	Well, while DarkSakura's playing Ninja Gaiden on her PlayStation Network heart, Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is coming out for the DS, and it's been spotted in Famitsu Magazine.
3635082	3642725	The game is completely controlled on the touchscreen, but not blocking, so don't expect your typical 2D Ninja Gaiden.
3643506	3645847	Great, I'm sure that controls like awesome.
3646977	3647377	We'll see.
3647457	3650080	I mean, very little is known about the game except for the fact it's on its way.
3650440	3653123	Unless you can read Japanese, maybe you can get some more out of that than I can.
3653143	3663152	I did hear that this was shown during, I think, one of their gamer days or whatever, the equivalent of a press event, and it didn't control very well.
3663352	3668757	Then again, the game is still early in development, and they can fix that, but there were some issues.
3669498	3670159	Uh-oh.
3670179	3671059	Uh-oh.
3671460	3672040	Anyways...
3673871	3674531	Enable the Halo 3 Beta
3702067	3707030	In fact, one of the things they're going to be adding a new multiplayer mode that was based off of some YouTube videos.
3708812	3709972	So that's pretty interesting.
3710513	3715756	And then, also rumors that they might do airborne cars as well.
3716116	3719618	However, there is, there has been a... Wait, flying cars?
3721299	3722660	Isn't there already a patch for that?
3723501	3724842	What would you do for the flying car?
3726763	3730105	You know... Meet George Jetson, his boy Elroy.
3732876	3738320	No, I mean... Okay, but there are going to be some free updates.
3738360	3740782	I know there was one that was fixing the patching stuff.
3740802	3747427	There's another one that they added that's going to be increasing the number of gang-controlled cars that are roaming the streets for certain achievements.
3748028	3755173	And there's going to be, later on, I guess, a free thing to reset the gangs so that all the bosses come back to their normal spot.
3755514	3760938	So you can play co-op and get that co-op achievement for finishing all the missions that we need to do.
3762997	3763798	Have you been playing the game?
3764198	3764658	A little bit.
3765619	3767620	Strangely enough, I've been playing Tetris a lot this week.
3768581	3775865	Because the achievements are not that hard, so I'm trying to get my 1500 score by mid-April or whatever it was.
3776165	3778266	I don't have much time left, and I have like 600 points to go.
3778626	3779747	You two may win Contra.
3780667	3780968	Contra.
3781008	3781508	I already have it.
3781748	3782509	I love Contra.
3784149	3788572	Well, there's something that I'd have to say.
3788632	3790973	Some Japanese airlines are getting contrary.
3791214	3791734	Ha ha.
3792743	3808235	Um, Japan's Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport, um, is, uh, banning, uh, local, uh, wireless gaming on flights because the Wi-Fi signal, um, allegedly interferes with the airplane's instruments, the same, you know, cell phone thing.
3809396	3819684	Um, now, there's, uh, an interesting thing about that, as was indicated, and I'm going to go ahead and quote the, uh, the, uh,
3820934	3831836	Source of this, I think is a very good point that Joystick made, is that Lufthansa has been offering in-plane Wi-Fi since 2003 and haven't had any crashes because of it.
3833236	3842838	The FAA states that Wi-Fi is safe, so I guess that maybe Japanese planes are built differently?
3844338	3844458	Maybe?
3844478	3846078	Where the hell does Lufthansa fly?
3846258	3848119	I've always seen their airline, I've never flown them.
3848819	3849339	Where do they go?
3849835	3852336	I flew in Lufthansa when I went to France.
3853156	3854337	Oh, they're like a Europe airline.
3854377	3857598	Yeah, well, I went to O'Hare to Frankfurt.
3858138	3858619	Oh, okay.
3859119	3859499	Paris.
3859639	3861340	That's why I've never flown them because I've never been to Europe.
3861380	3862200	Well, you should go to Europe.
3862460	3862920	I want to.
3864421	3866782	Are there any listeners out there who want to send me a lot of money so I can go to Europe?
3868142	3868402	All right.
3870123	3873585	Well, speaking of another place I want to go to, Australia.
3874725	3876766	This is some interesting news here.
3878630	3883172	Richie Young, who was once the Australian PlayStation 2 magazine's editor.
3883773	3893557	He says he was offered sex, money, overseas trips, and other types of gifts, all in the name of inflating game review scores.
3894278	3907584	Now, we all know that, you know, like little handouts and freebies and all that kind of crap goes on all the time, which, you know, we try to tell you, this is why you should support indies, because the mainstream gaming doesn't give a shit about indies, and...
3908015	3909575	Boy, have we learned that in a big way recently.
3909595	3911236	I have not had any offers for sex.
3911296	3911936	Exactly.
3912196	3914917	We don't get offers for sex, but... I know.
3915617	3918378	But anyway, very interesting.
3918418	3923819	So that all kind of came to light this week, and of course has the internet abuzz about, you know, sex for game reviews.
3923839	3925960	So, there you have it.
3926940	3928681	It's my nerd dream.
3928701	3931241	The two things I love the most.
3931261	3933222	I want to review video games and fuck cookers.
3934762	3936623	All while leveling my blood elf.
3939283	3940864	I want to cast a spell.
3942265	3943086	Oh, BlackWolf.
3943146	3944167	Why do you want to cast a spell?
3944187	3945107	There's nothing to attack you.
3945508	3946888	I'm attacking the darkness.
3948810	3950851	BlackWolf in chat totally wins with this comment.
3951271	3954434	OLR doesn't get offers for sex, but they do get fucked.
3956975	3958176	God, I love you, Bobby BlackWolf.
3958456	3958776	All right.
3959477	3961478	Skyblind's open.
3961498	3964520	1-877-GAME-OLR or username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
3964580	3965261	Let's go to the phones.
3965281	3965941	They're already ringing.
3966261	3967002	Oh, Chris, real quick.
3967725	3969386	Okay, baby, I'll make it worth your while.
3970267	3971648	Well, how can you turn that down?
3972409	3973470	Let's go check out the phones.
3973510	3974091	They're ringing.
3974131	3975332	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3975352	3975732	Who's this?
3976733	3977373	It's OLR.
3978234	3979135	It is OLR.
3980276	3982478	Yes, this is Luigi Mario.
3983319	3984760	Hiya, Luigi Mario.
3984820	3985541	What's on your mind?
3986461	3986882	Not much.
3986902	3988703	Just calling and saying that I love the show.
3989864	3991105	Do you, Luigi?
3991366	3991746	Yes, I do.
3993791	3998854	Why are you, uh, I mean, I've never had a video game celebrity call into the show before.
3998894	4002636	I mean, you don't have anything better to do on Sunday nights, like save a princess or whatever?
4003276	4004997	No, because she's too busy humping Mario.
4005958	4006458	What, Luigi?
4009520	4012042	Daisy's in the back playing DDR Supernova.
4013162	4015304	Daisy's playing DDR Supernova?
4015364	4017065	Why isn't she playing DDR with Mario?
4019046	4020327	Well, she didn't like that.
4020527	4022628	She wanted something to up her game.
4024204	4025245	Okay.
4025545	4026346	Hey, I got a question.
4026586	4028427	I've always wanted to ask Luigi this question.
4028827	4033010	How does it feel to constantly get shafted with your brother getting all the attention?
4034311	4038494	Well, it doesn't bother me much because it gives me more time to relax and have a little fun.
4039075	4042638	Between you and me, I think Peach is a little bit of a whore.
4046540	4050343	Wait, so are you saying you trade off Princess Peach with your brother?
4050383	4051084	That's kind of gross.
4051104	4051404	Yeah.
4055797	4064263	I'm sorry, but I think this joke is in another castle.
4064644	4065624	I really don't know what to say.
4066105	4067386	Okay, wait.
4067426	4070568	Luigi, I'm going to ask you, what made you decide to call into our program tonight?
4071329	4074531	Was that Charles Martinet who sent you that link?
4080422	4081943	Uh, no, one of your listeners.
4082283	4083764	The very hard guy named Ranma.
4084885	4086186	Oh, Ranma?
4086626	4087727	Yeah, yeah, he's okay.
4088208	4091130	Uh, I didn't, I didn't know why you spoke to Ranma.
4092331	4094652	Ranma's got a big black wee.
4096313	4097194	Is that the really true?
4098595	4102858	Wait a minute, have you been, have you been, uh, sleeping with Ranma as well as, uh, Princess Peach?
4103899	4105700	Oh, no, I told the girl that the way.
4106440	4107001	You did?
4107281	4109262	Oh, but, hey, wait, I've always wanted to know this.
4109403	4109663	Does Toad...
4112008	4112829	What do you think?
4113830	4115311	I think yes, he's a screaming queen.
4115351	4115911	What do you think?
4115931	4118654	Look at what the hell we're doing.
4120375	4122457	All right, Luigi, say something else before I hang up on you.
4123778	4124319	Stop the show.
4124359	4125199	Keep it up, all right?
4125379	4126560	I'll be listening the next week.
4128722	4129003	All right.
4129923	4131324	Thank you, Luigi, for the call.
4131625	4132425	You're so weird.
4132906	4133286	All right.
4134928	4137630	It's something about the damn holiday today that's making everybody crazy.
4138089	4139230	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4139270	4139630	Who's this?
4139710	4140751	Oh, it's Darth Vader on the line.
4140911	4141192	Hi.
4141392	4142253	It's Uni.
4142653	4143153	Hi, Uni.
4143173	4143714	What's on your mind?
4144615	4147957	You know, you were talking about Final Fantasy XI versus WoW earlier.
4148097	4150459	Yes, and you were a Final Fantasy XI player for a long time, right?
4150920	4151841	Oh, yeah.
4152982	4155424	I was playing it for about three years, two months.
4155484	4156945	I keep reminding everybody that.
4158786	4160668	It turned out I was playing the wrong game.
4161949	4162269	Really?
4162309	4164071	And what made you decide that you were playing the wrong game?
4164791	4165272	Because...
4166129	4172052	Everybody kept treating me like crap, and I was only helping everybody out that I possibly could.
4172833	4174213	You were a white mage, weren't you?
4174734	4175034	Yes.
4175534	4177395	I was a white mage, and that's why I quit.
4177535	4179176	I was also a white mage.
4179196	4180797	The white mage is the party bitch.
4181617	4182238	Oh, I know.
4182578	4185139	That dropped to 75, come on.
4185539	4188321	This is where my decision to quit the game was.
4189582	4191042	And Rob has seen me play.
4191142	4193043	I did fucking macros with a controller.
4194044	4195725	I did everything manually.
4196943	4198243	You did everything manually?
4198763	4199003	Yes.
4199123	4200284	Oh my god, you're nuts.
4200864	4201944	Well, I was patient.
4202804	4203024	Wow.
4203164	4204864	I would say... Well, you have to be for that game.
4205044	4209725	I would call up 20 seconds to buff to give everyone plenty of freaking time to get there.
4210145	4214646	And our team was like, I'm going to go pump this log.
4216407	4221587	So when the bitch comes and we call in our thing and say, where's my buff?
4221627	4223368	I'm like, no, you suck.
4223408	4224288	So I let him die.
4225049	4228210	by going all Black Mage on whatever our thing was.
4228490	4234452	And then he's messaging me like, I'm like, no, you're the bastard who didn't show up.
4236092	4242394	I also leveled Ninja and Black Mage, all both to 75.
4244414	4250036	My favorite class I think I ever played on Final Fantasy XI was probably when I
4250549	4252310	I did, though, have to say that I loved Monk.
4252330	4253530	Monk was pretty great.
4253910	4256351	I was going to level that to 75, but that was before I decided to quit.
4276297	4278017	Well, Uni, one more question for you.
4278177	4281978	What is WoW giving you that Final Fantasy XI was lacking?
4283419	4294501	Rested EXP, a lot more better people that don't treat me like crap, and I can solo my EXP instead of being the party's bitch.
4295841	4298302	Are you playing a priest in WoW?
4299002	4300282	Uh-uh, I'm playing a tank.
4300562	4303003	See, well, it's a different type of character, but then again,
4303510	4306493	The priests I know don't get treated like bitches in WoW, so I don't know.
4306773	4308615	Oh, priests get treated like bitches.
4308775	4309336	It depends.
4309616	4310036	It depends.
4310657	4312559	All right, Uni, I've got to let you go so we can get to some other calls.
4312619	4314541	Any really quick last messages for our listeners?
4315261	4315501	Okay.
4316202	4317203	Listen to Die in a Fire.
4317403	4317744	Thank you.
4318544	4318825	All right.
4318885	4319505	Take care, Uni.
4319525	4320967	Bye.
4321027	4324029	She has a cute little picture on her phone.
4324230	4324550	It is.
4324570	4324990	That's her.
4325030	4325391	That's her.
4325511	4326332	A little Skype picture.
4326352	4327152	A little Skype picture.
4327172	4327773	We like it when listeners...
4328015	4328375	Raven's Dolphin
4354508	4355509	All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
4355529	4355709	Right.
4378272	4384934	Gamefly is opening up a new, this is not bullshit, they're opening up a new distribution center in Pittsburgh.
4385234	4389496	And that's good for me because I don't have to wait eight days for a turnaround.
4389956	4391957	I had heard of that and that is very good news.
4391997	4398979	And I think we'll really, you know, I think part of the thing I like about Netflix is that they have a distribution center in West Sacramento.
4399299	4401860	So I always get movies within a day, always.
4402360	4407682	And so I can imagine how frustrating that's got to be to have Gamefly and you're on the East Coast and you're waiting so long for games.
4408178	4409638	GameFly is a good idea in theory.
4409878	4413319	In fact, I really don't know why I'm not using it or something similar.
4413419	4416039	I hear there's one for games and flicks that maybe I should look into.
4416439	4416800	I don't know.
4419740	4420340	Are they not good?
4420860	4424481	Whatever the case is, I probably should be doing this with games, but for some reason I keep buying.
4425541	4426061	I don't know why.
4426141	4427641	It's an addiction or something.
4427681	4430762	I don't know.
4431502	4432902	Congratulations on that.
4433002	4436203	Let me know how the service improves for you once that happens.
4437742	4439303	Well, I'm fine with the service already.
4439423	4442804	It's just, like I said, the turnaround time sucks.
4444185	4446706	BlackWolf agrees, by the way, that games and flicks sucks.
4448966	4449747	Thank you, BlackWolf.
4450987	4452588	Alright, what else is on your mind?
4454769	4457570	Dark Resurrection hit the PlayStation 3 today.
4458910	4460551	Oh, on the PlayStation Network store?
4462112	4462712	Or yesterday.
4462732	4463492	It hit.
4464153	4465253	So, no joke, right?
4466755	4467215	No joke.
4467736	4468276	Well, that's cool.
4468336	4469037	How do I know that?
4469097	4470678	Because I've said that on my podcast.
4471738	4472139	Oh, I see.
4472199	4474220	Is this just a cheap plug for your own podcast?
4475501	4475681	No.
4476081	4476341	All right.
4477122	4479443	Well, have you downloaded Tekken yet?
4480985	4481825	I don't have a PlayStation 3.
4481865	4483946	That would be a problem.
4484387	4485147	I don't know why.
4485688	4486488	I'm curious.
4487869	4490591	BlackWolf says Tekken Dark Resurrection came up a few weeks ago.
4492734	4496715	I thought I saw some story about it, but again, I don't have a PS3, so I've been able to check for myself.
4497655	4500416	So, Raven's Dolphin might have been a little late for that train.
4501376	4501556	What?
4501576	4504337	I guess where I got it was old.
4504757	4506957	I put that on the disclaimer on the thing anyway.
4507437	4507717	All right.
4508497	4509958	Well, that's okay.
4510018	4510838	Anything else on your mind, buddy?
4513338	4515639	No, I'm not going to even plug the podcast.
4515659	4516379	You all know about it.
4516759	4517039	All right.
4517319	4518399	Take care, Raven's Dolphin.
4519040	4520320	The infamous, the one and only.
4520960	4521160	Later.
4522025	4523486	The One and Only, Raven's Dolphin
4549981	4553903	Dude, if you play Cookin' Mama, there's like so much food in Cookin' Mama.
4553943	4556904	You should have asked to borrow Ranma's big black leaf.
4576778	4580020	Yeah, I should have, but... Yeah, that's the whole point.
4580660	4584263	I mean, yeah, I don't know, it's just... It wasn't really that much.
4584443	4585463	Oh, and another thing.
4586324	4594289	On behalf of New York City, I apologize for the way our elected officials react to how GTA 4 looks like our hometown.
4594669	4595690	I forgive you.
4595850	4602314	Yeah, but it's also, you know, also forget the... Disregard what the Daily News and New York Post spews out
4603641	4606282	They're sensationalists.
4606702	4609623	They just push junk news to our eyes.
4610483	4616105	And all they do is just... They act like the Daily Bugle, if it was run by that guy, that Jameson guy.
4616725	4619065	As in, so you do nothing but print shit about Spider-Man?
4619846	4621186	Yeah, no, not even that.
4621266	4625067	It's just that they hype up everything.
4626748	4627768	They're mostly slanted.
4627788	4631769	They're not as neutral as other papers like the New York Times are.
4633175	4637719	So I don't take their word, I only take their word at face value and nothing else.
4638539	4641481	I want to go back to the Wii Play tournament.
4641501	4645244	What exactly, is this some tournament on Wii Play or what exactly was going on?
4645264	4646365	Yes, it was a Nintendo World.
4646485	4648707	How did you get denied entry into this contest?
4648907	4650008	Because I woke up late.
4650748	4653270	Because I woke up late today.
4653370	4654911	Party a little too hard, huh?
4655652	4656632	Yeah, pretty much.
4656813	4661336	Dude, I didn't know you could like gut your Wiimote and then smoke it.
4663353	4664054	Get her done!
4664074	4664474	Get her done!
4692601	4693142	April Fool
4723021	4723581	She's okay.
4724821	4725502	Loki?
4726102	4732143	Guitar Hero 2 for 360 will have vector pedals because there's a port at the bottom of it.
4732223	4734044	I think we reported something like this.
4734064	4740725	There was a story like this a long time ago, but now it's confirmed because of the apparently the manual says so.
4742486	4743586	Pedals sold separately.
4744706	4746487	Now you really can't put the pedal to the metal.
4749327	4750328	Get it?
4750768	4752028	Here's my impression of Rob tonight.
4758485	4759747	This is Rob.
4778399	4781140	People aren't sure if this is an April Fool's joke or not.
4781640	4790282	It might be, but apparently they think that he's not dead because he's been active on his MSN and MySpace accounts.
4791422	4794463	Either way, this is going to end up fucked up.
4794883	4797704	Either way you look at this story is going to end up fucked up.
4798224	4801304	Because if it was a big April Fool's joke, that's fucked up.
4802345	4807766	But if he really was dead and all these people are not believing it, that's fucked up too.
4808627	4810988	So there are no winners in this scenario, only losers.
4811028	4812348	Mitch Hedberg died on April Fool's Day.
4813388	4814368	That's fucked up too.
4814969	4815969	And everyone thought it was a joke.
4816029	4819390	But seriously, if you're going to smoke like 500 drugs, you got it coming.
4819490	4825271	I mean, I'm sorry to say, but Mitch Hedberg, rest in peace, but dude.
4825291	4831253	I wonder if he's like, dude, that'd be so funny if I fucking died on April Fool's Day.
4832633	4833953	You know that crossed his mind.
4837223	4838844	Uh, alright, well, anything else, Loki?
4841225	4847349	Uh, no, I don't really have much else other than, um, the lineup of games on Gamefly looks pretty good.
4848809	4852451	Oh, like how you can go to Gamefly and look up all these great new games that are coming out?
4852652	4852872	Yeah.
4853232	4859195	A lot of people haven't picked up on yet, or, well, you know, maybe some folks did, but they can't really talk about it anymore.
4860056	4865819	So, you know, you might want to scan Gamefly, see what they got, because apparently Gamefly, you know, they can do whatever they want, because they're Gamefly.
4866239	4866339	So.
4866670	4867691	That's hot!
4867731	4868612	I too made new wallpaper.
4868632	4870093	This is what I was doing during the show.
4871454	4872255	Making new wallpaper.
4872675	4874136	Well, I'm proud of all of you.
4874997	4876658	Meanwhile, there's a radio show going on.
4876758	4877799	My wallpaper.
4877959	4881762	Why don't you put some of this stuff up on OLR PSP?
4882523	4883584	Where's the PSP site?
4883604	4884504	Where's the Wii site?
4884564	4885885	Where's the love, Loki?
4886006	4888748	PSP site's still up, just un-updated.
4889448	4890169	And the Wii site?
4891250	4892030	Yeah.
4892411	4893071	About that.
4894893	4895293	It's comin'.
4896670	4897050	Soon.
4898491	4898791	Alright.
4900092	4901572	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4901652	4905455	Chris, Magzy, thank you guys so much for being here and helping us with our April Fool's joke tonight.
4905495	4906195	You guys rock.
4906695	4907376	Get her done!
4907396	4908536	Get her done!
4908596	4909957	Magzy, final thought.
4912779	4913239	Okay, I had it.
4915080	4916301	Chris, your final thought.
4918162	4920003	Well, I had a final thought and then I forgot it.
4920763	4923585	Oh, my final thought is fuck you, DrewNami!
4924346	4925267	Yeah, you heard me.
4925367	4925907	I said it.
4926087	4926648	Fuck you.
4926728	4927348	You know why?
4927589	4928069	You know why?
4928089	4935755	Because that one time I went into the chat room, the one time my computer was working right with the chat room, you booted me off because I was trying to get Rob's attention.
4938157	4938937	Fuck you.
4939598	4941980	I don't chat all the time, so I'm usually not there.
4942020	4942640	Watch!
4942660	4944502	All right.
4944682	4945823	I love you, Rob.
4945943	4951807	My final thought is I want a hamburger, too, and watching Loki put all that burger to waste makes me a sad panda.
4951827	4952648	Get out of the way.
4953429	4954835	You're going to throw it away right in front of my face.
4954855	4955377	No, I don't want it.
4955417	4956703	I don't want to eat something you've half eaten.
4957025	4958591	But it makes me go, I want a burger.
4959531	4960631	Oh, you have a real final thought, Macy.
4960651	4961692	I have an actual final thought.
4961752	4962192	Okay.
4962392	4971776	If any of the people in chat or any of the people listening live in the Chicago Midwest area and are planning on going to Anime Central this year, Chris and I will both be there.
4972076	4975617	I will actually have an art table, and you should come by and see me and buy my art because it's awesome.
4976178	4980559	Actually, I think one of our listeners said she was going to Anime Central, so you guys should plan an OLR meetup or something.
4980579	4980980	Yeah, we should.
4981360	4986882	Actually, I think somebody friended me from your OLR live journal because it mentioned, and she's going to ASUN, so.
4987332	4987812	We're hopeful.
4987832	4991494	Yeah, I'm going to try and see if I can do a promo thing for you guys.
4991534	4992395	Fuck yeah, do it.
4992595	4994616	We'll get you some flyers or something.
4994796	4996257	Yeah, I'll do a total promo.
4996277	5002161	I'm going to walk around with her art and the person who's going to share her art table, which is Misa, by the way.
5002361	5004402	Anyone who is on DeviantArt.
5005482	5006943	If you're on DeviantArt, you know who Misa is.
5007744	5011626	And I'm going to walk around with both of their art prints all over my body.
5012099	5019104	and I'll have some oral flyers and saying, buy these prints and listen to the show or God will hate you.
5020565	5020905	All right.
5020965	5021925	But God already hates them.
5022106	5023106	Get her done, Chris.
5023366	5023887	Get her done.
5024067	5025068	Get her done.
5025908	5026849	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5027749	5028290	I have two.
5029190	5029390	Uno.
5031372	5040698	I'm doing my last two massages for my school because I did graduate but I haven't got my diploma yet and I'll have it after I do my massage final on Tuesday so everybody think good thoughts for me.
5042716	5043436	and then... Dos.
5045437	5046018	He says he had two.
5046498	5046718	Dos.
5050320	5055583	My other one is in regards to waking up at four in the morning tomorrow.
5055964	5056904	Do not want!
5058945	5059866	Loki, your final thought.
5060390	5060950	Don't worry.
5061431	5063652	The Wii site will be done soon.
5063812	5064573	I promise you.
5065013	5067195	I've got 3D Realms working on it.
5067255	5072278	They promised me they have the best guys, you know, the guys working on Duke Nukem Forever, working on the site.
5072458	5074580	It should be done very soon.
5075060	5075720	I promise you.
5077181	5078502	They wouldn't let you down like that.
5079423	5083166	My roommate, Extrofer, just poked his head in here wanting to make a final thought.
5083866	5085507	I don't know if we should let him, but whatever.
5085607	5086868	Extrofer, final thought.
5086888	5089510	I was just going to say, I'm straight now.
5090723	5092463	April Fools.
5092663	5092904	No!
5093404	5094544	Look at my MySpace.
5095484	5096904	I'm in a date with the girls now.
5096924	5097885	Look at your MySpace.
5097905	5098685	That's proof.
5098705	5101586	Yeah, because I'm really going to believe what I read on MySpace.
5101666	5103026	MySpace is proof.
5103306	5105607	You know we already did our April Fools show like two hours ago, right?
5105687	5108647	No, this is not an April... I know it's coincidence.
5109567	5110428	Coinkydink.
5111628	5112768	But I'm with the girls.
5112908	5113668	I want the boobs.
5114189	5114509	And the...
5117811	5120712	Does, um, does, does vagina taste like pussy?
5120832	5122372	I mean, does it taste like pizza?
5122392	5122432	No.
5123332	5124372	Okay, good, because I don't like pizza.
5125993	5127253	You know what pink stuff tastes like?
5127573	5128673	It tastes like mmm.
5132534	5133174	Oh, okay.
5133334	5138695	I get the look out of my own face right now.
5139756	5139876	Mmm.
5140276	5140376	Mmm.
5141436	5141796	Oh, please.
5142416	5143116	Oh, please.
