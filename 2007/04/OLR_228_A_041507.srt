[SPEAKER_00]: And would you mount for a mount?

[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's what I just spent a whole bunch of.

[SPEAKER_05]: Well, can I have a loan?

00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:23,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?

23
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I need food, I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet Angry Loki needs food badly I'm not angry, I'm just hungry

24
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:34,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't shoot food.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:36,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

26
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:37,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's into my mouth.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Angry Loki is about to die.

28
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Gauntlet.

29
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, they overdid Gauntlet.

30
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:46,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.

31
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:50,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet.

32
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet.

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had, you know, it was overdone.

34
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.

35
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have been like Gauntlet Legends and, you know,

36
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:00,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome.

37
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.

38
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:05,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.

39
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:05,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

40
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:07,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, anyway.

41
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:13,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week.

42
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:17,379
[SPEAKER_05]: We tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

43
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:21,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday.

44
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be heading into your sixth year.

45
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:26,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Our fifth birthday is coming up in June.

46
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be exciting.

47
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to have a big show for that one.

48
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:38,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.

49
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:40,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make a suggestion.

50
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over the floor.

51
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably got enough for a corpse.

52
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:52,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lingerie kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.

53
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:58,363
[SPEAKER_05]: and as much as I'd like to have like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.

54
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:12,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like somewhere else, like at Golfland or I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese, I don't give a shit.

55
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a grill at my house.

56
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:14,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not here.

57
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to go to your house, have a barbecue?

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a barbecue at my house.

59
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Barbecue?

60
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do an Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.

61
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't care if strangers come to your house?

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

64
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Hide Shermie.

65
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:29,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie will hide herself.

66
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:30,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

67
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so more details on that to come.

68
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming up in a couple months.

69
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to it.

70
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,664
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off with how was your gaming week?

71
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

72
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:44,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.

73
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:49,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually... I played a lot of Cooking Mama while waiting at the bank.

74
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Things I do for us.

75
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:53,954
[SPEAKER_03]: The sacrifices I make.

76
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:56,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to make tonkatsu.

77
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you not played Cooking Mama on the Wii yet?

78
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:00,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm broke.

79
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:02,000
[SPEAKER_05]: You really should at some point.

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.

81
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.

82
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

83
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:08,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuck.

84
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait.

85
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil, then Cooking Mama.

86
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that is not Chris's blood.

87
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,115
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.

88
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:22,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

89
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:25,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you?

90
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

91
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.

92
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where the hell that... The Resident Evil porn thing.

93
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:36,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, somebody sent me that.

94
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,543
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a Resident Evil voice acting.

95
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent it to you.

96
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:41,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.

97
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch.

98
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.

99
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.

100
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to have a big pink button.

101
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,122
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

102
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I send you awesome.

103
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:54,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that it?

104
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooking Mom, what was your gaming week?

105
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:00,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that and damn let the PSP battery die.

106
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't find the charger.

107
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, poo on him.

108
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a game you didn't play.

109
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well done, Jamie.

110
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:12,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up!

111
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you just got back from a road trip, right?

112
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry drivers driving?

113
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,895
[SPEAKER_05]: just stupid people alright, that's what I thought alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

114
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:47,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Earth Defense Force 2017 per usual so that was fun I played briefly Guitar Hero 2 and that was about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not going to be playing much of it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though I haven't really played much DDR either played Boom Boom Rocket

115
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,153
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

116
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:56,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was doing pretty good on some of the songs, but they got pretty hard.

117
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the achievements are actually pretty easy.

118
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I unlocked five after playing the first song or something.

119
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:02,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weird.

120
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:16,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played Gnarly Golf, which that's an old Apple IIGS game that I played through an Apple IIGS emulator on the internet, and

121
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss that game, except it's really crappy now.

122
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Why that game of all games?

123
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's a game I used to play a long time ago.

124
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:24,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

125
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I remembered it being a lot more fun.

126
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:30,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But the emulator didn't work right, so you never lose lives.

127
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I beat the whole game, and I was like, this is dumb.

128
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, let's see, what else did I play?

129
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Super Paper Mario.

130
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has way too much dialogue.

131
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:49,325
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 minutes of fucking dialogue before I can play the game.

132
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:50,645
[SPEAKER_06]: That's retarded.

133
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But, it's okay so far.

134
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,270
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I play?

135
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's about it, I think.

136
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

137
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:04,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

138
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

139
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:06,556
[SPEAKER_05]: My Game of Week.

140
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I also play Super Paper Mario a lot.

141
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

142
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's an awesome game.

143
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:18,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the whole old school side scroller thing mixed with the role playing elements.

144
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that 3D thing is freaking brilliant.

145
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:24,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fact that you can hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3D world.

146
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:47,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

148
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree with you, Loki.

149
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the dialogue is cool.

150
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:18,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the dialogue was cool, it's just I didn't really care for 20 minutes of it right in the beginning of the game, you know what I mean?

151
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't you just skip the opening wedding thing?

152
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted to know the story, because obviously it's there if it's important.

153
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:34,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so, I just wish they would have, like, you know, paraphrased or maybe broken it up a little bit, you know, instead of...

154
00:08:34,690 --> 00:09:02,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, you get to play a little bit Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah So That's like any Final Fantasy game, seriously Final Fantasy has less fucking dialogue than this goddamn game This game just beats everything out I mean, seriously, Final Fantasy At least there's dialogue, but there's stuff happening Instead of just Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, look, it's, you know It's like the start of Final Fantasy 7 It's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Okay, run here

155
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

156
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, run here.

157
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, at least I get to fucking control my character within the first 20 minutes of the game.

158
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:15,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?

159
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:22,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the Chaos Heart.

160
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

161
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think of that.

162
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

163
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

164
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:29,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll play the game.

165
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be awesome.

166
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, but it's just...

167
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, you need to space up the dialogue a little bit more.

168
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.

169
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:44,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?

170
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.

171
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:54,280
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote the goddamn Super Paper Mario.

172
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

173
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And Luigi came, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

174
00:09:57,285 --> 00:10:03,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Stephen King just writes about nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.

175
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:12,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden, my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm going to go down the street and find out what goes down there.

176
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.

177
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:15,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

178
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:16,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid.

179
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:17,833
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's all right.

180
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:21,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.

181
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:22,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Just need super...

182
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario RPG to come to Virtual Console and we'll be all good.

183
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought that for $3.

184
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:30,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the original cartridge, right?

185
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:30,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

186
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:31,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you find that?

187
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.

188
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:35,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lucky you.

189
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:38,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that'll be out... You think that'll come out on Virtual Console?

190
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:43,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario... Well, actually, or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.

191
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the game's awesome.

192
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:47,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to Loki's rants.

193
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tolerable.

194
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say it wasn't awesome, I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.

195
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:52,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, great.

196
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:56,629
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.

197
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:57,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to read.

198
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.

199
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:10,394
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I think is going to be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't really see it as being the type of game I'm going to go back through and play again a lot.

200
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,375
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.

201
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:18,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever...

202
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:19,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

203
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of see it as something I'm going to play once and be done with.

204
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:23,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

205
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:23,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

206
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask me again when I get there.

207
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.

208
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.

209
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:40,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.

210
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:47,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should have taken a picture of it because, you know, hey, it makes my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 of the leaderboards.

211
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard, and I was like, number five, one day.

212
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and I know you might be thinking, well, medium, well, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?

213
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:06,852
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all ten medium songs, so I was just playing, and I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main Blades page comes from.

214
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:12,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100% perfects on all the songs.

215
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, whatever.

216
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:14,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, um...

217
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.

218
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:25,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.

219
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.

220
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:37,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest of the songs, I won't want to play again.

221
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked actually some of them.

222
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.

223
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:42,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

224
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:49,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad because, to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?

225
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:51,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck this shit.

226
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:52,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I should just put a pad in there.

227
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,700
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad.

228
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure, I haven't tried it.

229
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can.

230
00:12:59,082 --> 00:12:59,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't you?

231
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:02,283
[SPEAKER_05]: The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.

232
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,465
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason you couldn't do it.

233
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad or the buttons.

234
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is actually how I do it.

235
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I use both.

236
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I use left on the D-pad and then the other three I use the buttons.

237
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that allows me to have the triggers as well.

238
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.

239
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do all direction or don't do all buttons.

240
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:20,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Do like...

241
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,694
[SPEAKER_05]: One or two of the arrows on the direction pad and then the other two on the buttons.

242
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.

243
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:32,659
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.

244
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:34,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, um, okay.

246
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.

247
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was up, up, and left, left.

248
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:43,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

249
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:46,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you probably, yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there.

250
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit left on D-pad and left on the button.

251
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:49,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I...

252
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.

253
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I only played the game really for one night.

254
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it hardcore one night.

255
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it for hours.

256
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But the songs just aren't replayable for me.

257
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:03,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and DDR or Beatmania.

258
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:06,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take Beatmania, which obviously this game is hugely inspired by.

259
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again.

260
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And Konami obviously has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.

261
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, they license stuff.

262
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:22,793
[SPEAKER_05]: but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care about anyway.

263
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, maybe a little bit.

264
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:25,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.

265
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,075
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of it is forgettable, right?

266
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,036
[SPEAKER_05]: But the original in-house stuff is great.

267
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:34,717
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.

268
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:40,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable of creating music.

269
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.

270
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:46,321
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Tracks.

271
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,241
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Tracks.

272
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

273
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?

274
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?

275
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:53,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

276
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because there's downloadable packs later.

277
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:56,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

278
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:05,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are, you know, not even going to be that great, I'm sure.

279
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.

280
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,270
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that later.

281
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:37,368
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose SSJ100Matt says fucking Avril DarkShy says no insult J-pop it's not all bad but come on some of it's pretty forgettable I like Mflow they're pretty cool third style for life alright anyhow let's get into some housekeeping for tonight if everyone's done with their gaming week

282
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:39,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.

283
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:51,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games community site, which is something we've kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.

284
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like MySpace, but without the cam bots and whores and stuff.

285
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's people talking about video games.

286
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:58,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

287
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:02,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.

288
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on there, DarkSakura's on there, Matt's on there.

289
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:12,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd actually like you to check out, if you have a chance, I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time.

290
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:17,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational tide pool game.

291
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:19,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of got me thinking this week.

292
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,683
[SPEAKER_05]: What are my favorite edutainment games from yesteryear?

293
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, number one is The Oregon Trail.

294
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.

295
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:28,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

296
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck.

297
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:57,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Timeworks Inc.

298
00:16:57,757 --> 00:16:58,858
[SPEAKER_05]: made this for the Commodore 64.

299
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:36,958
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically you went around this cave and you had to jump over rocks and you were collecting crystals and you had to avoid bats and rocks and if you messed up then you lost a bandaid well randomly in this like flash of light like like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound effects this little wizard would appear and he'd go spell

300
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:41,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Anti-disestablishmentarianism or whatever word, because it used the voice chip in there, right?

301
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:45,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have to spell it out and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind of sucked.

302
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a competition.

303
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be like, now... It's Tricky Otomy Man!

304
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:55,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Now spell... Uh-oh.

305
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you got it right, he would give you a band-aid.

306
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:02,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker.

307
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd take flashlight power from you.

308
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,831
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, do you guys ever post to your blogs?

309
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:07,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen Loki post a few things.

310
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:07,952
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

311
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:09,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I put pictures of my cat up there.

312
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this week, but

313
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,014
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

314
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,363
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo ran out of trees?

316
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:28,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

317
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible to find this stuff, and the controllers and all that stuff.

318
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't understand why these controllers are any harder to make than, say, I don't know, the classic controller or whatnot.

319
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:01,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not that complicated of a piece of equipment.

320
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't understand why it's taking them so long.

321
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't need those cards anyway.

322
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:06,698
[SPEAKER_05]: The cards are pointless.

323
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:08,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You get charged tax on those cards.

324
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy them online.

325
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

326
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on it.

327
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:17,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but, you know, there's... Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.

328
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people like the cards, you know, for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards or stuff like that.

329
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Allowance bonus thing.

330
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:26,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal your mommy's wallet.

331
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:40,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just, this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold out of right now, you know, something that should be able, and so if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.

332
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,459
[SPEAKER_06]: These things should be fucking easy to make.

333
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:43,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the controllers.

334
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,140
[SPEAKER_06]: The controllers aren't that complicated.

335
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:56,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, even the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts in it that weren't in, say, the GameCube or something like that.

336
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:59,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The GameCube controllers, why the fuck can't they make more of them?

337
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're made from magic trees.

338
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:03,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, well there you go.

339
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,339
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, magic trees.

340
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.

341
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,990
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're going to have in Animal Crossing.

342
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,593
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out of.

343
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:20,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.

344
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:21,958
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just recycle.

345
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.

347
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:27,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

348
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what probably happened.

349
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:36,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.

350
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,434
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

351
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:05,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I hate to derail here, but Miklatov has joined us, and he's come in the room, and he's laughing his ass off.

352
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you guys are playing video games out there.

353
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:12,887
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, like, Miklatov, Extifer, and RicePrincess are all here, but none of them wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.

354
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.

355
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:17,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's distracting.

356
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,854
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to do a show in here.

357
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Christopher is playing Marble Mania.

358
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:24,830
[SPEAKER_04]: and Coro Impa.

359
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,613
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in test at my office.

360
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:27,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I saw it.

361
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:28,015
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really fun game.

362
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really fun.

363
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:30,158
[SPEAKER_04]: He picked the panda.

364
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:37,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel, and if people don't know about this game, every time the marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.

365
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:39,156
[SPEAKER_04]: The panda sounds like it's farting.

366
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:44,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing ever.

367
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing so hard.

368
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:51,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are laughing at fart noises.

369
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's derailing this entire show.

370
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:58,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.

371
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:04,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't die!

372
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:05,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all that eucalyptus, you know.

373
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:07,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gassy shit.

374
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:12,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!

375
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:17,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is what I get for not reading.

376
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Bamboo, whatever!

377
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:21,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gassy.

378
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:26,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.

379
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:29,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's your problem.

380
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,133
[SPEAKER_05]: You're feeding the panda eucalyptus.

381
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:35,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank God I don't work at a zoo.

382
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,294
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be dead.

383
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:40,056
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom is asking if it's... Koala Panda!

384
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:43,757
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 420 this week?

385
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:44,777
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not.

386
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,438
[SPEAKER_05]: We're role models for the young kids.

387
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,118
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.

388
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:53,779
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only... Or what is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?

389
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Winners don't use drugs.

390
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that, boys and girls.

391
00:23:57,718 --> 00:24:06,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera browser to check out the internet with.

392
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: The final version has gone online this week.

393
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:15,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because, you know, when the blue light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.

394
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,309
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this case, it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.

395
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So the full version of the internet channel is there.

396
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:27,173
[SPEAKER_05]: The new features is, thank God, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto-hide.

397
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:30,875
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that so you can have your YouTube's full screen.

398
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:32,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also just hit one and it'll hide it.

399
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:33,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

400
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:36,919
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also zoom in and out at a lot.

401
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:43,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.

402
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:49,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to worry about trying to get it full screen and da-da-da and all that stuff.

403
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:55,157
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also do www.com at a click of a button because all that's in there.

404
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover as well.

405
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to run a little faster, although I don't know.

406
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:06,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up or the Wi-Fi, but Internet Channel is slow.

407
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So slow.

408
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.

409
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's faster to browse the internet on, you know, obviously a computer.

410
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:18,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.

411
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.

412
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it just not have the power to handle or what?

413
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:29,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel or forecast channel or whatever.

414
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:32,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of the channels, it takes fucking forever to load up.

415
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just slow.

416
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I supposed to, like, I don't know, enable some port in my router?

417
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:50,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know how for some file share programs you're supposed to open up certain ports in your router, right, and direct them directly to one of the, you know, things that is connected to the router?

418
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,569
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

419
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii to make it run faster.

420
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:54,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

421
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:55,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh.

422
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:00,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.

423
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.

424
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:05,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves and turn it into a koala.

425
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:06,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

426
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some... Whatever.

427
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:12,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit about fucking koalas.

428
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:14,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Koalas are cute.

429
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,725
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.

430
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.

431
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:31,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have their wheeze and are keeping up with virtual console releases, there is a...

432
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:37,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on a virtual console.

433
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:40,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We love some ActRaiser, don't we?

434
00:26:40,764 --> 00:26:41,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in this country.

435
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:43,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's exactly it.

436
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in the UK.

437
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:48,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually has 800 Wii Points.

438
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where you walk around and you're God.

439
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:56,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I like walking around as God.

440
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:57,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that every day.

441
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:01,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Actraiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.

442
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:05,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay.

443
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:09,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I like smiting my enemies.

444
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:15,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii Points.

445
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonk's Revenge for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii Points.

446
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:23,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.

447
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:24,289
[SPEAKER_05]: All I heard was Actraiser.

448
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

449
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,096
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

450
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:51,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because you can play Pac-Man on everything.

451
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.

452
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, 2600.

453
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the 2600 version is like... Crap!

454
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Pac-Man barf.

455
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:02,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not real Pac-Man.

456
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:04,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.

457
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Diet Pac-Man.

458
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:07,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways...

459
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:15,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So, other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force.

460
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:22,459
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out probably Monday.

461
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:29,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.

462
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:34,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Prince is in chat and says, Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.

463
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, maybe that's a good sign that...

464
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this, uh, um, Actraiser, or the, the UK release will mirror the release that we get.

465
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:43,860
[SPEAKER_05]: But we already got Pac-Man, right?

466
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we already got Pac-Man.

467
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, not, not that I really care, because I'm not gonna go down.

468
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:49,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe we'll get Ms.

469
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man or some bullshit.

470
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:52,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care, I just want Actraiser.

471
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:53,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the fucking original games.

472
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?

473
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally made games?

474
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:58,506
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'll see.

475
00:28:58,686 --> 00:28:59,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

476
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:01,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

477
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:05,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see, also, uh, speaking about Nintendo, oh, you're gonna love this story, Loki.

478
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:08,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you love piracy, but Nintendo does not.

479
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:12,259
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know that recently in the news, the U.S.

480
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,560
[SPEAKER_05]: has complained to the World Trade Organization about China.

481
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.

482
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:27,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support this.

483
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.

484
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here.

485
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:38,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, Nintendo will continue to work with the U.S.

486
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:42,376
[SPEAKER_05]: government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo products in China.

487
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:43,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pleased the U.S.

488
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:50,040
[SPEAKER_05]: government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.

489
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,102
[SPEAKER_05]: That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.

490
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,224
[SPEAKER_05]: What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that, you know,

491
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:03,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Their ROMs and their old shit still run rampant throughout the internet.

492
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:05,087
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.

493
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:08,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.

494
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,451
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.

495
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:13,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, there's that one site where you can play all the video games online.

496
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

497
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.

498
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:19,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play them all right there in your browser.

499
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo certainly has an interest in old games because they're making five bucks off of every one they can sell to a virtual console user.

500
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:28,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

501
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in chat says, ROM sites don't really exist anymore, it's mostly torrents.

502
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, somebody's hosting the torrents, right?

503
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:52,961
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to host a seat file somewhere.

504
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on where it's legal or illegal.

505
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.

506
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirate Bay just says back and go, you guys are stupid.

507
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:03,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.

508
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.

509
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:15,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.

510
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:17,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The company, Daytel, has...

511
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: A program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter your Mii avatar for your PC.

512
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:35,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually £14.99 and $19.99 in the US.

513
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can download it off of their site.

514
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:40,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Code Junkies.

515
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And the website is...

516
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:45,374
[SPEAKER_03]: WII Mod WII.com

517
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,640
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

518
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:27,938
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

519
00:32:56,854 --> 00:33:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there was going to be some type of functionality.

520
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:10,340
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, thanks to the magic of radio, I just ran out to the living room real quick, and I saw them playing Korowimpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking funny.

521
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is funny.

522
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:17,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

523
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:19,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that, where it just farting noises all the time?

524
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:22,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

525
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:22,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you never seen Labyrinth?

526
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,184
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rods of Eternal Stench!

527
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

528
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:27,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So bad!

529
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,568
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I saw it, I was like eight.

530
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:31,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a couple months old.

531
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:32,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to fix that!

532
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:33,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

533
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:35,233
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Megzy hasn't seen Labyrinth.

534
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:44,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.

535
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:46,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically...

536
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:59,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super Paper Mario is not in the store street date by 2 p.m., then you get $20 in a gift card.

537
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:04,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the problem was someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario was sold out.

538
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:12,115
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, the thing was they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore they don't get $20.

539
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like, well, we had it.

540
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:15,695
[SPEAKER_05]: But you just weren't here.

541
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,916
[SPEAKER_05]: What was to stop them from telling everybody that?

542
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:19,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

543
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing at all.

544
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Aha!

545
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:25,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a scam.

546
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:26,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

547
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he call the Better Business Bureau or did he just post his angry... Angry?

548
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm thinking about the farting panda.

549
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he posting his angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it?

550
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.

551
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:44,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau instead of dig...

552
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft and Charmus is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.

553
00:35:13,717 --> 00:35:16,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?

554
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know any better walking into the store.

555
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, Oh, well, we sold out.

556
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,346
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a line.

557
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:29,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

558
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:32,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, no gift card for you.

559
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:38,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?

560
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:47,976
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements, there's a little bit of small print that you gotta read, and that's, you know, the offers can change, you know, without notice, so... Ha!

561
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:52,298
[SPEAKER_06]: They can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super Paper Mario.

562
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:53,759
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to, you know, follow that.

563
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,280
[SPEAKER_06]: They can just say, fuck you, bitch.

564
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't doing shit.

565
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So, could we post a big ad...

566
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:05,011
[SPEAKER_05]: on the internet somewhere that says, Orange Lounge Radio gives free blowjobs.

567
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, in little fine print, lie.

568
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:09,634
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lie.

569
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Rice Princess?

570
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be true on your behalf.

571
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:13,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

572
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:13,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

573
00:36:13,978 --> 00:36:18,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our... But on your behalf.

574
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,161
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your slut.

575
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:20,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

576
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:21,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hi.

577
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:26,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo-chugga-chugga-choo.

578
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,529
[SPEAKER_05]: This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.

579
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:28,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

580
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:29,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, shut up.

581
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for ruining our program.

582
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go now.

583
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hi, everyone, and bye.

584
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:35,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

585
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:36,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

586
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:40,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.

587
00:36:45,196 --> 00:36:47,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.

588
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:48,717
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have heard what she yelled.

589
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

590
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:50,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

591
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:51,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me simulate it.

592
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:52,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what?

593
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:53,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

594
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that?

595
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.

596
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.

597
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,802
[SPEAKER_05]: A little less angry next time, though.

598
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?

599
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th, and it was this woman making a post there saying, Hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.

600
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,364
[SPEAKER_05]: In return, you can mount me.

601
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:35,731
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000 gold before we do anything.

602
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.

603
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:45,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 Night Elf Druid and would prefer someone who is into roleplaying.

604
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a costume.

605
00:37:47,355 --> 00:38:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal So other words Prostitution Short translation I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much And I don't even know where to go with this It's prostitution Pretty much

606
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But she gets away with it because, A, it's on the Internet.

607
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming she doesn't live in Nevada.

608
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:20,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on, but I don't think it was Vegas.

609
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyway, it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.

610
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:32,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was probably illegal, but she gets away with it because it's the Internet and it's not real money.

611
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's offering sex for services.

612
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:38,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you give amount for amount?

613
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:40,389
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob.

614
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:54,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman, and, you know, obviously her picture was all over the Internet because, you know, you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you know, you kind of see her and, you know, she ain't all that.

615
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:56,859
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.

616
00:38:57,939 --> 00:38:59,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but this is the thing.

617
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple days later, there was a follow-up post.

618
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:09,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'd just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my picture all over the Internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.

619
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my epic mount in about an hour.

620
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:18,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very enjoyable for both parties, while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds of hours farming for yours or don't even have them.

621
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:24,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't be revealing my name or his, but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll be killing you 280% faster.

622
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:27,168
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little wow joke there.

623
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:33,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

624
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:36,910
[SPEAKER_05]: She said it twice and capitalized it both times, so I was reading it that way.

625
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:39,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

626
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:42,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm planning to meet him again later this week.

627
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,863
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting double value for his gold.

628
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So talk all the trash you want.

629
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:52,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can ever hope for.

630
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:54,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she does make a point.

631
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,616
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as she's got a good attitude about it.

632
00:39:58,117 --> 00:39:58,998
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

633
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:25,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about, 5,000 gold I think equals about $600 in real money.

634
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:31,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that route.

635
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.

636
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.

637
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You okay with it?

638
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.

639
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

640
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:43,101
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.

641
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got a 20 in my wallet.

642
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:46,802
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

643
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:46,862
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

644
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

645
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:11,728
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

646
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:41,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know, I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy, you know, I don't care, but yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my finger on it.

647
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:45,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you just kind of, like, go, eh, that's just not right.

648
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,311
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not right.

649
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:49,152
[SPEAKER_05]: To put out for WoW?

650
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:50,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad.

651
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:51,633
[SPEAKER_06]: For WoW, Jamie.

652
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,894
[SPEAKER_06]: People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii's, so...

653
00:41:56,994 --> 00:42:08,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that it's sad, I think, that someone is desperate enough, but honestly, more power to her.

654
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:16,298
[SPEAKER_03]: If she says, you know what, I have no problem with giving it up a little bit for a mountain.

655
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:23,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.

656
00:42:24,113 --> 00:42:29,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would think that... I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything to actually earn it.

657
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:29,898
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

658
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, in-game, like everybody else does.

659
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:38,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But... But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG-type websites and all that.

660
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:38,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

661
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

662
00:42:40,527 --> 00:42:41,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much the same thing.

663
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:46,806
[SPEAKER_06]: For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.

664
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:52,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.

665
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?

666
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:55,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

667
00:42:55,689 --> 00:43:02,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter, though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly older chick, and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair.

668
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, hey, great.

669
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:07,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview.

670
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:07,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so much for that.

671
00:43:07,993 --> 00:43:08,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki ruined those chances.

672
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

673
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:10,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to her.

674
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.

675
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?

676
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:24,218
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's enjoying it.

677
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:26,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.

678
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.

679
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:31,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do it for free, whores get paid.

680
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:32,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was being a whore.

681
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,374
[SPEAKER_05]: She was being a whore.

682
00:43:33,434 --> 00:43:35,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a world of whorecraft.

683
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:37,055
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't a slut, she was a whore, big difference.

684
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:43,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But again... I don't know if GSCC might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone care?

685
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: There's male prostitutes, they're whores.

686
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know that.

687
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,621
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who give up the butt love for money.

688
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?

689
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:51,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that!

690
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:54,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.

691
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:57,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it for free, okay?

692
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:05,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with Sauce over AIM, which I'm not on.

693
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:06,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody IM me.

694
00:44:06,673 --> 00:44:06,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

695
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:10,855
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

696
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if not this, then what?

697
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:35,732
[SPEAKER_05]: She could have been a stripper.

698
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,152
[SPEAKER_05]: She would have stripped for cash.

699
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Just use the cash to buy the gold from IGE.

700
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:40,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

701
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:42,334
[SPEAKER_05]: All she's doing, she's cutting out the middleman.

702
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going straight from stripping to her mount.

703
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same difference of saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help me get my mount.

704
00:44:51,537 --> 00:44:52,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an exchange of services.

705
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just bringing it from... Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.

706
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:58,919
[SPEAKER_05]: She could have done stripping.

707
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

708
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I say it was her choice to do it.

709
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:10,715
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone's going to judge her, look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can afford to judge somebody else.

710
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:11,315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I say.

711
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:12,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, put it this way.

712
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me lay it out to you straight here.

713
00:45:15,317 --> 00:45:20,959
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.

714
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:22,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So is she.

715
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:25,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.

716
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,040
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your point?

717
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you don't have sex with...

718
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:31,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.

719
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she has sex with Dan, and he buys her games.

720
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Yeah, but I married him.

721
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:42,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Jamie has... Wait!

722
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:43,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not 31 yet.

723
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:46,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.

724
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:48,084
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

725
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:49,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

726
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:50,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, there's a big difference.

727
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:51,925
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's wrong.

728
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:52,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it is.

729
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:53,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not 31 yet, by the way.

730
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:55,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, there you go.

731
00:45:55,406 --> 00:45:56,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I have four days!

732
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:57,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it!

733
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 2 a.m.

734
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:01,602
[SPEAKER_03]: on Thursday, so just be nice to me.

735
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this chick's got, like, fucking kids and stuff.

736
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:06,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because... Mommy, what are you doing?

737
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:08,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.

738
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:11,110
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I got my mouth.

739
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this topic's gone on way too long.

740
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We can bring it up in Skype line again later.

741
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:17,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.

742
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:17,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

743
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,656
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you've been eating all the fucking Pocky.

744
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:21,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

745
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

746
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:25,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's a cookies and cream.

747
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:26,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway...

748
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:33,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?

749
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

750
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,300
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

751
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.

752
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like it.

753
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:47,325
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.

754
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 500 points.

755
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,828
[SPEAKER_03]: The three packs, or pack one is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of Spades.

756
00:46:54,622 --> 00:47:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar Which for me, the top of all of those was Pack 1 for me You know, at least two good songs in there But you're basically playing about two bucks a song And the interesting thing that was You know, they're going to keep having these packs on here If they're going to be that much, you're going to end up actually spending a whole lot of money To get some of these extra songs for packs of three

757
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:27,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?

758
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

759
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:30,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is bullshit!

760
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?

761
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?

762
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:38,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar and game?

763
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:39,633
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe 69, I don't remember.

764
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:40,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was pretty expensive.

765
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, it was not $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the songpacks at this price, you will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.

766
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:52,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

767
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:56,480
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.

768
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they know it's going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloadable backs.

769
00:48:22,153 --> 00:48:22,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

770
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're really just jumping ship.

771
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:27,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean.

772
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:35,844
[SPEAKER_06]: They're totally not going to milk the franchise by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for it.

773
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:37,545
[SPEAKER_05]: This works for Harmonix, though.

774
00:48:37,826 --> 00:48:41,368
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, Loki, they ripped themselves off with Guitar Freaks.

775
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:42,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks is what?

776
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Amplitude with a guitar controller.

777
00:48:45,752 --> 00:48:46,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

778
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:48,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero, yeah.

779
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:18,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and they're easy to copy over.

780
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:19,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then they should be cheap.

781
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:25,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges like 99 cents a song.

782
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:27,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And those songs are way better produced.

783
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:32,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

784
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:37,448
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, for $2, I know you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.

785
00:49:38,536 --> 00:49:42,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.

786
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:45,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't you throw some of those?

787
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:47,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw a classic pack up.

788
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:49,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Why even do the packs at all?

789
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:51,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those songs kind of suck, and I don't want them.

790
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

791
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're doing packs.

792
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.

793
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:56,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

794
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:57,962
[SPEAKER_06]: The Red Hot Chili Peppers one, it's...

795
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:26,644
[SPEAKER_06]: or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.

796
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:29,346
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD is making some interesting points in our chat.

797
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:33,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.Orangelandradio.com I think that rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.

798
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,491
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not much you can do about it.

799
00:50:36,731 --> 00:50:38,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you can innovate a guitar.

800
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:39,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Tony Hawk syndrome.

801
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:43,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but in a way, in a way...

802
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:48,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as the Guitar Freaks guitar.

803
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And you sort of saw it coming.

804
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:52,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games a long time.

805
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:57,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks, because what did they do before they made games?

806
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: They were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income off of music games, like Konami's Beatmania series and all the songs there.

807
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons.

808
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:13,755
[SPEAKER_05]: and everybody always asks, why did they put five?

809
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:15,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Guitar Freaks only has three.

810
00:51:15,476 --> 00:51:17,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?

811
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:17,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

812
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:27,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody speculated, oh, Guitar Freaks, like Super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation 2, their Super Duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows that.

813
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:29,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.

814
00:51:30,383 --> 00:51:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed off about.

815
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:40,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if, some people may have seen this in the forums, and I mentioned a little on top of the show, how I built my own

816
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:44,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero effects pedal.

817
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:51,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically the thing, which is going to be yet another purchase, is just a fucking push-button switch.

818
00:51:52,268 --> 00:52:02,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something very simple that, I mean, shit, I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're going to have to buy, and that's going to be in addition to the guitar and everything.

819
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:06,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So say they sell it for ten bucks, there's another ten bucks you're paying for a fucking button!

820
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: for something that, granted, is probably not necessary, but here are the songpacks.

821
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:13,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet it's something extra that you're going to be buying.

822
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

823
00:52:16,914 --> 00:52:17,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

824
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:21,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game.

825
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:22,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But it works.

826
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that for a fact.

827
00:52:26,964 --> 00:52:30,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree that other music game series are becoming stagnant as well.

828
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,468
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love DDR.

829
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:32,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

830
00:52:32,642 --> 00:52:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

831
00:52:48,695 --> 00:52:52,779
[SPEAKER_05]: A while ago, my idea, and granted, you don't have to use this idea, this is just an idea.

832
00:52:53,159 --> 00:53:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole Dance Magic mode from DDR Disney and Battle Mode in Supernova.

833
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle Mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.

834
00:53:04,691 --> 00:53:07,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever.

835
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And in The Groove, same thing.

836
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a similar mode in there.

837
00:53:11,237 --> 00:53:12,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of an afterthought.

838
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select and, you know, I don't know, this whole, like, you got served kind of atmosphere there.

839
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And there could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive.

840
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a way you could innovate DDR.

841
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:29,141
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

842
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:34,506
[SPEAKER_05]: If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, what DDR Supernova was one of the top 25 selling games last year.

843
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess why bother innovating?

844
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It costs money to innovate.

845
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:42,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

846
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:44,955
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

847
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:11,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake 3 Quake 3 Quake 3

848
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.

849
00:54:34,158 --> 00:54:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'll actually literally throw up on you.

850
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:38,340
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you get the motion sickness thing.

851
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,161
[SPEAKER_05]: How long can you play before you start getting sick?

852
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:44,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.

853
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?

854
00:54:47,064 --> 00:54:47,664
[SPEAKER_03]: About five minutes.

855
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:48,604
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, good.

856
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Five minutes, I can get five frags on you at least.

857
00:54:50,505 --> 00:54:51,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really good at Quake.

858
00:54:51,546 --> 00:54:52,046
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well.

859
00:54:52,966 --> 00:54:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a pro at Gatchaman Quake.

860
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:56,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatchaman Quake?

861
00:54:56,888 --> 00:54:57,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

862
00:54:57,568 --> 00:54:58,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can actually play the...

863
00:54:59,955 --> 00:55:01,576
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:34,131
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3 logically is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?

865
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

866
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:41,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.

867
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:43,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the only thing that was thought before.

868
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Downloadable mods would be great.

869
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would be awesome.

870
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool if when they release this, they put downloadable mods.

871
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.

872
00:55:56,507 --> 00:55:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...

873
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: You only have a few more months for that.

874
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:03,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some other news, though.

875
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:14,536
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will be available in Europe and America in June.

876
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not giving too many details as far as when it will actually be available in Europe, though.

877
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:41,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels.

878
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

879
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:48,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the thing about this is that it's...

880
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying, that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.

881
00:56:57,212 --> 00:56:58,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that may be console, though.

882
00:56:59,094 --> 00:57:00,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so is Gears of War.

883
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:03,862
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.

884
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo is exclusive.

885
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:08,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got that on the PC as well.

886
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:10,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exclusive to just be released.

887
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:13,640
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exclusive to Microsoft's empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever.

888
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their IP.

889
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:15,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that does make sense.

890
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:21,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still a Microsoft product.

891
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:22,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that makes sense.

892
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:23,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.

893
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:28,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.

894
00:57:28,632 --> 00:57:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really referring to PCs.

895
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:33,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think they don't really generally...

896
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:34,716
[SPEAKER_06]: PC Gamers and Console Gamers

897
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:06,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

898
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:34,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they're going to be doing the O2 Jam thing where you can buy costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing.

899
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently you're going to be able to actually win signed stuff from actually playing the game.

900
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be kind of neat.

901
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like that.

902
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

903
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:54,753
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good that it's free because I played the beta a few months ago and I'll be honest, I don't really remember it.

904
00:58:54,813 --> 00:58:56,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I reviewed it on this show but I couldn't tell you when.

905
00:58:58,158 --> 00:58:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was not something I would have paid for.

906
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:01,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free.

907
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, this whole pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that.

908
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:06,721
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll make money from it.

909
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Advertising, sure, what the hell.

910
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:12,703
[SPEAKER_05]: How about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?

911
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing.

912
00:59:15,004 --> 00:59:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

913
00:59:15,624 --> 00:59:16,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

914
00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:19,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero?

915
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:22,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Have stuff sponsored by different things.

916
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.

917
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:30,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who want to get out there and exposed.

918
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

919
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:34,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still early, though.

920
00:59:34,856 --> 00:59:35,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... It is.

921
00:59:36,097 --> 00:59:40,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2.

922
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:43,523
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.

923
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere.

924
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:48,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was calling this Red Octane's Horse Armor.

925
00:59:48,587 --> 00:59:49,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see that.

926
00:59:50,468 --> 00:59:52,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly Oblivion... Actually, you know, I'll give it this...

927
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

928
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:54,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

929
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:54,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

930
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.

931
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:35,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but now what you think, it's the type of keyboard that actually plugs into your controller.

932
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's that typical, um, Cordy is what they call it.

933
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:44,848
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cordy keyboard, um, that actually plugs into the bottom of your controller so you can have it all right there in your hand.

934
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:45,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Now,

935
01:00:46,024 --> 01:00:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you might be thinking, is this is what I thought, is that, you know, well, why the hell do you need one of these?

936
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:57,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.

937
01:00:57,147 --> 01:00:57,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

938
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:07,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something, put the, you know, keyboard back down.

939
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,751
[SPEAKER_06]: This would actually be pretty quick for me.

940
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since it was basically ported from the PC version and PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play the game completely on the keyboard.

941
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going to be built to do that.

942
01:01:25,618 --> 01:01:28,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might need something like this in order to do that.

943
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:36,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just typing something up in a chat window or something like that.

944
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:40,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's completely different to me, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.

945
01:01:41,185 --> 01:01:43,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's nice.

946
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,628
[SPEAKER_06]: That way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.

947
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:50,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.

948
01:01:50,971 --> 01:02:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope it's not more than $20, because honestly, well, you know, we'll get into the reason this is coming out very soon, but, you know, it's just...

949
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:03,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hostile1 says, that looks useless to me.

950
01:02:03,892 --> 01:02:05,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaded suggests a keyboard mouse combo.

951
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:38,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale says in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too long.

952
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, SSJ100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.

953
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:47,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd pay to have the advantage or the mini-bosses in Guitar Hero.

954
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:51,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad most of their songs are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.

955
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:56,193
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?

956
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:59,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.

957
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:00,486
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

958
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's on tap this week?

959
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:34,470
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a bunch of crap.

960
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

961
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:42,215
[SPEAKER_03]: First email actually is a link from Heon.

962
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:50,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters.

963
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

964
01:03:52,581 --> 01:03:55,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point that I wanted to say was actually in the email it says,

965
01:03:55,885 --> 01:03:56,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanted to let you know about it.

966
01:03:56,926 --> 01:03:58,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki probably already knew.

967
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:00,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show, but it needs more lesbians.

968
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:04,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

969
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:05,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that in our show role later on?

970
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:06,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

971
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,493
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.

972
01:04:10,753 --> 01:04:12,054
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't announced.

973
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:13,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It was found on Gamefly.

974
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:14,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

975
01:04:14,575 --> 01:04:15,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

976
01:04:15,396 --> 01:04:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

977
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:19,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like... It was officially leaked on Gamefly.

978
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:19,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

979
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:24,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So... That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.

980
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder...

981
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:29,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what tips him off.

982
01:04:29,594 --> 01:04:31,835
[SPEAKER_06]: People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.

983
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:32,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's true.

984
01:04:35,797 --> 01:04:40,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we also have, actually, our friend Rob with 2B's.

985
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:41,554
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment?

986
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:41,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um... Um...

987
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:11,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Game System R

988
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:33,887
[SPEAKER_05]: PG-13, PG-13, PG-13, PG-13

989
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:07,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the fuck word is used, like, you know, Janine Garofalo's in it, end of story.

990
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:08,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Janine Garofalo.

991
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:08,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't?

992
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:12,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is, is that, you know, those are very different kinds of movies.

993
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:16,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, okay?

994
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:19,783
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple little, you know, fucks isn't gonna kill him.

995
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:21,444
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

996
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:24,205
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the word fuck and you suddenly want to kill people.

997
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:28,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but, you know, I would not let them watch, you know, Terminator 2.

998
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:30,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I would.

999
01:06:30,828 --> 01:06:32,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you and I are different.

1000
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I saw Terminator 2 in the theater.

1001
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1002
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:37,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next email.

1003
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, Seisha here.

1004
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:45,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft and whether it will really matter to them.

1005
01:06:45,963 --> 01:06:58,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce games these days, so going multi-platform solves that problem.

1006
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:03,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.

1007
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that I heard and it makes sense.

1008
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:14,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multi-platform, do you think this would really affect the sales of the PS3 or would it not really matter?

1009
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure myself and thought I'd ask you guys.

1010
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:20,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in.

1011
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:22,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big shout to Irene.

1012
01:07:23,445 --> 01:07:23,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart.

1013
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:25,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

1014
01:07:25,866 --> 01:07:26,666
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good timing.

1015
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:28,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she just walked in the room.

1016
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:29,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, people.

1017
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:30,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay fooking epic.

1018
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:31,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Love, Stacia.

1019
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:34,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.

1020
01:07:34,729 --> 01:07:35,290
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

1021
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Stacia.

1022
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hot.

1023
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:38,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go now.

1024
01:07:39,211 --> 01:07:39,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1025
01:07:40,952 --> 01:07:42,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So, answer?

1026
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:50,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it does come to the 360 since more people have a 360.

1027
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:53,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I mean, I don't know.

1028
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:58,359
[SPEAKER_06]: If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that would be a

1029
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:24,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Big blow to Sony because it would give people, you know, yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3 because it's like, you know, if you don't have any exclusive games, no one's really going to want, I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive games with Microsoft and, you know, may not be something that everybody wants, but, you know, it's a lot less exclusive games than say Sony has right now and I don't know.

1030
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes perfect sense to go multi-platform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track record, though.

1031
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,489
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely ones for exclusive content.

1032
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

1033
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:43,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to be like that, but see now, with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're releasing games on a bunch of different systems.

1034
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:54,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation 3 version, since they're going to make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.

1035
01:08:56,038 --> 01:09:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: why I don't know but because they haven't milked it enough yet I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple sequel thing like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy 7 although even though I think Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 5 is my favorite of the series but Final Fantasy 6 was I think their most epic but Final Fantasy 7 is the fan favorite I think that they're just trying to say let's make this the next Final Fantasy 7 and beat it into the ground probably

1036
01:09:25,251 --> 01:09:26,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.

1037
01:09:27,473 --> 01:09:28,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So, next email, huh?

1038
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:33,637
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is from Sakura Max, I guess.

1039
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:41,022
[SPEAKER_03]: By now, I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff, and I am now dead.

1040
01:09:41,363 --> 01:09:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two requests.

1041
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.

1042
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.

1043
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously am a dead tauren, and I will be served medium rare...

1044
01:09:54,485 --> 01:09:57,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter of days.

1045
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:03,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakuramax in Dethika server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters' names?

1046
01:10:04,052 --> 01:10:08,356
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to find out the character names, go check out... Yeah, go on the forums.

1047
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:09,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha, cheap plug.

1048
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:18,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.

1049
01:10:18,483 --> 01:10:20,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if someone happens to, you know,

1050
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:23,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat.

1051
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:23,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1052
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:24,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one day.

1053
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:28,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube vid.

1054
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:31,964
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools.

1055
01:10:32,004 --> 01:10:32,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check that out.

1056
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little clips.

1057
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:40,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro.

1058
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:41,587
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the song we use for the outro.

1059
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permissions.

1060
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:45,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, copyright issues, blah, blah, blah.

1061
01:10:46,248 --> 01:10:48,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.

1062
01:10:49,269 --> 01:10:50,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, next email, shall I?

1063
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:51,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1064
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR, it's me, Neki.

1065
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:54,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1066
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Neki's on my MySpace now.

1067
01:10:57,223 --> 01:11:05,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.

1068
01:11:05,407 --> 01:11:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.

1069
01:11:07,148 --> 01:11:07,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

1070
01:11:08,608 --> 01:11:14,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week, and I will have my diploma by the weekend.

1071
01:11:14,751 --> 01:11:15,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

1072
01:11:15,251 --> 01:11:15,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

1073
01:11:16,032 --> 01:11:18,573
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.

1074
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:19,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1075
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:20,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar hero.

1076
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the email!

1077
01:11:24,596 --> 01:11:26,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Match Game, coming soon to mobile phones.

1078
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:34,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they should listen to this show when you weren't there, Jamie.

1079
01:11:34,804 --> 01:11:35,064
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1080
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:40,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news that week.

1081
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:41,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that every week?

1082
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:42,830
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just being lazy that week.

1083
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:48,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week, because here's the deal.

1084
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1085
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:22,644
[SPEAKER_05]: B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.

1086
01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:23,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't matter.

1087
01:12:23,765 --> 01:12:24,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.

1088
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:26,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.

1089
01:12:27,146 --> 01:12:27,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be good.

1090
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following gaming news next week.

1091
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:34,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be the Loki show.

1092
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:39,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.

1093
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:42,090
[SPEAKER_03]: As you love pinball and like Lego, here's a great match.

1094
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's apparently a pinball match.

1095
01:12:44,892 --> 01:12:46,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360 Regional Compatibility Guide

1096
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:08,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that was possible.

1097
01:13:08,696 --> 01:13:16,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The website is at xbox-sky.com slash xbox360 underscore regional underscore compatibility underscore guide.

1098
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:26,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on like, are they talking about like all regions or just compatible games?

1099
01:13:26,564 --> 01:13:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.

1100
01:13:30,946 --> 01:13:33,828
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all region.

1101
01:13:35,169 --> 01:13:35,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty interesting stuff.

1102
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:38,958
[SPEAKER_03]: A few games are multi-region.

1103
01:13:39,038 --> 01:13:40,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry works on both.

1104
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:42,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear works on all three.

1105
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It even goes as far as listing the PAL ones as well.

1106
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:47,602
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1107
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks for the link.

1108
01:13:51,324 --> 01:13:52,305
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

1109
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:53,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.

1110
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:54,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of weird.

1111
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:58,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room.

1112
01:13:58,708 --> 01:13:59,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, Rob, you want to do it for me?

1113
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:00,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

1114
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:00,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1115
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:00,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1116
01:14:01,224 --> 01:14:03,346
[SPEAKER_03]: R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.

1117
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:28,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into it, and the USNTSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website I aforementioned.

1118
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:35,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making a 20 gigabyte and the announced 120 gigabyte.

1119
01:14:36,228 --> 01:14:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.

1120
01:14:43,169 --> 01:14:47,271
[SPEAKER_03]: My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced.

1121
01:14:48,111 --> 01:14:50,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the phrase, being serviced.

1122
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will be up, quote, soon.

1123
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:56,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice plug, by the way.

1124
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,496
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying, yeah, I got my site in.

1125
01:14:59,216 --> 01:15:00,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, bye, Neki.

1126
01:15:02,038 --> 01:15:04,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.

1127
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1128
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:05,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Neki.

1129
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:06,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Neki's cool.

1130
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email.

1131
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun, dun, dun.

1132
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered, I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school, work, convention, or at a concert, simply, how many people do you estimate listen to your show?

1133
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:28,454
[SPEAKER_03]: End of sentence.

1134
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1135
01:15:30,976 --> 01:15:32,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurt somebody, who am I going to say the last name?

1136
01:15:34,799 --> 01:15:35,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1137
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say real quick, looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan of, you know,

1138
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:43,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer or football.

1139
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:47,525
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.

1140
01:15:47,906 --> 01:15:49,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Both will work on the U.S.

1141
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360s.

1142
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:52,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

1143
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it's in PAL.

1144
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:56,072
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm sure if you're TV, you know.

1145
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't HD standard?

1146
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, HD is pretty standard.

1147
01:16:01,617 --> 01:16:05,140
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest.

1148
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,961
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't track it very well.

1149
01:16:08,242 --> 01:16:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed.

1150
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:14,328
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1151
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:42,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.

1152
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:44,280
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean, though.

1153
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an excuse in the end.

1154
01:16:47,643 --> 01:16:48,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart, heart, heart.

1155
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:51,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1156
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I do need a good excuse to hang out with Loki.

1157
01:16:55,008 --> 01:16:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.

1158
01:16:59,192 --> 01:17:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to lowball it.

1159
01:17:01,814 --> 01:17:04,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1160
01:17:04,276 --> 01:17:05,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird.

1161
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:07,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we should say.

1162
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not important.

1163
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:11,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really important?

1164
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:12,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it is.

1165
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:13,249
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1166
01:17:14,049 --> 01:17:15,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say this.

1167
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: It's four digits.

1168
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:20,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.

1169
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:23,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll leave it there on the lower end.

1170
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:24,512
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's it.

1171
01:17:24,592 --> 01:17:25,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for the emails.

1172
01:17:26,532 --> 01:17:26,852
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1173
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:28,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1174
01:17:29,093 --> 01:17:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned it last week a little bit,

1175
01:17:36,812 --> 01:18:04,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Spring Update is going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360 including instant messaging via Windows Messenger and that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller but you're going to be able to message people while playing games and also while watching movies and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list as well which is kind of nifty and

1176
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:22,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for some different video codecs, like MPEG-4, H.264, and Play For Sure, which is kind of neat.

1177
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:27,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but no Xvid and DivX support yet.

1178
01:18:28,376 --> 01:18:32,377
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and that's awesome.

1179
01:18:32,577 --> 01:18:34,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that they're adding stuff instead of...

1180
01:18:40,385 --> 01:18:46,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message people on MSN?

1181
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I won't.

1182
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.

1183
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.

1184
01:18:57,597 --> 01:19:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.

1185
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:03,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually that takes concentration, you know?

1186
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: How about this, Rob?

1187
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:08,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.

1188
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:14,173
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do Letterboxd, Zoom, Stretch, and Native since you've lost your remote.

1189
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:15,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't lose the remote.

1190
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:19,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody lost their remote, but it wasn't me because it happened while I was on vacation.

1191
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:20,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But we won't go there.

1192
01:19:24,202 --> 01:19:25,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else.

1193
01:19:26,685 --> 01:19:26,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1194
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:29,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is kind of cool.

1195
01:19:29,257 --> 01:19:39,465
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole downloading stuff, while you can download in the background, you can also set your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in a low-power mode.

1196
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:41,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a PC.

1197
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:56,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, a new option in auto-downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.

1198
01:19:57,618 --> 01:19:58,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of nifty.

1199
01:20:00,606 --> 01:20:00,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1200
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:06,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rob Dean chant is taunting me because I always decline his hold'em invites.

1201
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:08,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad.

1202
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:08,951
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's kind of cool.

1203
01:20:09,612 --> 01:20:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they can boast about their achievement scores.

1204
01:20:25,462 --> 01:20:26,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.

1205
01:20:27,825 --> 01:20:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.

1206
01:20:31,808 --> 01:20:32,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

1207
01:20:35,751 --> 01:20:36,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be fun.

1208
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:39,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... yeah.

1209
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:41,836
[SPEAKER_05]: God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.

1210
01:20:42,857 --> 01:20:44,158
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not an ass, Rob.

1211
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes play Texas Hold'em with us.

1212
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that.

1213
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:53,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it you guys play on, like, what, Friday and Saturday night?

1214
01:20:54,206 --> 01:20:55,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's clubbing night.

1215
01:20:56,308 --> 01:20:57,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go clubbing anymore.

1216
01:20:58,266 --> 01:20:59,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a great while, I do.

1217
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:00,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go.

1218
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:02,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can sometime.

1219
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1220
01:21:06,132 --> 01:21:06,572
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this?

1221
01:21:06,973 --> 01:21:10,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?

1222
01:21:11,976 --> 01:21:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

1223
01:21:12,537 --> 01:21:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.

1224
01:21:13,918 --> 01:21:14,338
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

1225
01:21:14,598 --> 01:21:15,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do.

1226
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:16,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, back to games.

1227
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.

1228
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:20,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be fun?

1229
01:21:20,763 --> 01:21:22,724
[SPEAKER_05]: People would so laugh at you.

1230
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:23,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, talk about looking like an ass.

1231
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:31,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, last week on the show I ranted and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar was broken.

1232
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:33,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, well, you know, it did work.

1233
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:34,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It would play the game.

1234
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:37,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.

1235
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:39,174
[SPEAKER_06]: You could fix them, by the way.

1236
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but here's the thing.

1237
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you don't have to.

1238
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.

1239
01:21:44,898 --> 01:21:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m.

1240
01:21:47,795 --> 01:21:53,138
[SPEAKER_05]: That will resolve the situation where input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.

1241
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:54,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.

1242
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what else it does?

1243
01:21:57,641 --> 01:21:59,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It bricks consoles, supposedly.

1244
01:21:59,362 --> 01:22:00,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It freezes your game, yay!

1245
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:05,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, there's reports on the internet, something's hit and dig, like all these people's consoles are getting bricked.

1246
01:22:06,345 --> 01:22:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence, or if the patch did something.

1247
01:22:10,668 --> 01:22:13,409
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is calibration, that's what it was.

1248
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I mean...

1249
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:43,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing they put hot glue in the screws so I can't I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy bar to adjust it thank you very much you bastards how dare they well here's something that we started asking why they dare since a lot of people are not too very fond of the first one although I thought it was cool

1250
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:50,054
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.

1251
01:22:51,315 --> 01:23:04,005
[SPEAKER_03]: In the May edition of the official Xbox magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually in progress.

1252
01:23:04,885 --> 01:23:07,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it.

1253
01:23:07,628 --> 01:23:09,449
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it's rumor mill fodder.

1254
01:23:09,749 --> 01:23:10,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Book tie-ins?

1255
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:11,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Joy.

1256
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:11,951
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of books.

1257
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, wait, what game's getting a sequel?

1258
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:15,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect Dark Zero.

1259
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:19,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Dork.

1260
01:23:20,021 --> 01:23:21,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

1261
01:23:22,442 --> 01:23:25,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.

1262
01:23:25,162 --> 01:23:26,563
[SPEAKER_05]: This show needs a soundboard.

1263
01:23:26,963 --> 01:23:32,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where you actually have normal jumps.

1264
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the super jumps.

1265
01:23:35,725 --> 01:23:36,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I like being able to fly.

1266
01:23:36,786 --> 01:23:37,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I like jumping!

1267
01:23:38,506 --> 01:23:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, jumping!

1268
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:39,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1269
01:23:41,107 --> 01:23:41,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

1270
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:49,292
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, Capcom has had their Gamers Day, although we weren't invited.

1271
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:56,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And they announced a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.

1272
01:23:56,988 --> 01:24:07,130
[SPEAKER_06]: including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about including Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix which is a fucking long-ass name and stupid.

1273
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:10,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter 2 game with a longer title.

1274
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's the joke.

1275
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:13,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's seriously a joke.

1276
01:24:14,252 --> 01:24:16,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter 2 game name.

1277
01:24:17,632 --> 01:24:21,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max extreme.

1278
01:24:21,553 --> 01:24:21,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

1279
01:24:21,993 --> 01:24:22,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's lame.

1280
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:24,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame, lame, lame.

1281
01:24:24,949 --> 01:24:26,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

1282
01:24:53,863 --> 01:24:55,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that in our match game a couple weeks ago?

1283
01:24:55,564 --> 01:25:00,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we do a match game just like three weeks ago here on the show about what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came up?

1284
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:00,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

1285
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:03,287
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.

1286
01:25:04,548 --> 01:25:05,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want Puzzle Fighter.

1287
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1288
01:25:06,108 --> 01:25:06,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy it.

1289
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1290
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

1291
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard they're adding new modes and stuff, too.

1292
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:14,712
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.

1293
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:16,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

1294
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo, actually, now that I think about it.

1295
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:22,676
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also the other game, Panel de Pon, which I think...

1296
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:27,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle the Pawn is Bustamove Puzzle the Pawn is exactly the same game

1297
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure somebody in chat is correcting us right now.

1298
01:25:49,161 --> 01:25:55,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have a version of... I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to... I'll be damned, he's right.

1299
01:25:55,786 --> 01:25:58,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.

1300
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:00,789
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it was paneled upon.

1301
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:01,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it paneled upon?

1302
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzled upon.

1303
01:26:03,331 --> 01:26:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1304
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to play this game all the time.

1305
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:09,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what game I would love them to bring out a version of over here?

1306
01:26:09,795 --> 01:26:10,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Puzzling Desu.

1307
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:11,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's paneled upon.

1308
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be this game.

1309
01:26:13,578 --> 01:26:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes much more sense.

1310
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:15,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Tetris Attack...

1311
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:16,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Puzzle League.

1312
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:17,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That game makes more sense.

1313
01:26:18,302 --> 01:26:19,843
[SPEAKER_05]: That game makes more sense to have in there.

1314
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:21,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's paneled upon.

1315
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:21,904
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1316
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:24,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want Puzzle and Descent.

1317
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:31,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, one last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Exos of Evil, and Talisman.

1318
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:35,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's basically, you know, this universe that they've created.

1319
01:26:35,831 --> 01:26:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar, like, Robotron crossed with, they were saying, um,

1320
01:26:41,246 --> 01:26:42,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Geometry Wars.

1321
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:44,528
[SPEAKER_06]: They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays.

1322
01:26:44,588 --> 01:26:46,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, it's going to be a top-down shooter game.

1323
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up.

1324
01:26:52,892 --> 01:26:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So, awesome!

1325
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:57,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1326
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:06,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed at Capcom Gamers Day.

1327
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:09,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations.

1328
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:12,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's a little trailer that goes with it that you can see on the internet.

1329
01:27:12,889 --> 01:27:14,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.

1330
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a little glimpse of it.

1331
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:18,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe it goes back to one time.

1332
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:23,536
[SPEAKER_05]: The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court.

1333
01:27:23,936 --> 01:27:25,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

1334
01:27:25,837 --> 01:27:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there.

1335
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:28,439
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be very happy about this.

1336
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:28,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I still...

1337
01:27:29,497 --> 01:27:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have somehow missed the first games.

1338
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:40,284
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those series like, you know how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?

1339
01:27:40,824 --> 01:27:41,745
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those games.

1340
01:27:41,765 --> 01:27:42,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, question for you.

1341
01:27:42,805 --> 01:27:43,006
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1342
01:27:43,206 --> 01:27:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it, you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?

1343
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:52,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I hope so.

1344
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:57,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you can't get enough Attorney games, hey, wait for this.

1345
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:03,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP.

1346
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not the new stuff, but, you know, the old console's feeling a little loved there.

1347
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:25,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and, you know, he defends famous cartoon characters, so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to get other licenses to get, like, you know... But I guess they just won't have any of the other

1348
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:28,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Nami, ThePhoenixRightFan

1349
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:57,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Young Phoenix Wright being on trial for murder with his teacher Mia Fey defending him

1350
01:29:16,557 --> 01:29:20,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys listening to the podcast, just have to wait a couple days because we like to space it out.

1351
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you get a lot of Orange Lounge Radio all week long.

1352
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:26,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll get Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Those of you guys that are listening live, stay tuned.

1353
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back after this.

1354
01:29:29,251 --> 01:29:34,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1355
01:29:34,696 --> 01:29:39,001
