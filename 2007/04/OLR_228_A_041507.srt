00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, April 15th, 2007, 360 is set to get a new keyboard for its spring update.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's Parappa the Rappa set to get another sequel, and would you mount for a mount?

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The answer is no, but we'll get to that later in the show.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Money.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's what I want.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No, that's what I just spent a whole bunch of.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Really, on what?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
On one of our giggling lesbians.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I see. Alright. Well, can I have a loan?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ask my accountant.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Alright. Uncle Scrooge, is Uncle Scrooge your accountant?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good. So far.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So far?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I need food. I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Angry Loki needs food badly.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not angry, I'm just hungry.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't shoot food.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Exactly. Unless it's into my mouth.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Not Angry Loki is about to die.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I love Gauntlet, but seriously, they overdid Gauntlet. Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet, then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet, then we had, you know, it was overdone.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It should have been, like, Gauntlet Legends, and, you know...

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome. I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright. Well, anyway.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week, we tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday, so I would be heading into your sixth year.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Our fifth birthday is coming up in June. That's going to be exciting.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, we're hoping to have a big show for that one.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I would make a suggestion.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's that?

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's all over the floor.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well...

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You've probably got enough for a corpse.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lounge Radio kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And, as much as I'd like to have, like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like, somewhere else.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Like, at Golf Land or, I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese. I don't give a shit.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a grill at my house.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not here. Want to go to your house? Have a barbecue?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We can have a barbecue at my house.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Orange Lounge Barbecue?

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's do the Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, you don't care if strangers come to your house?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright, there you go. Hide Shermy. Because somebody might try to kill her.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shermy will hide herself.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alright. Anyhow, so more details on that to come. That'll be coming up in a couple months.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Alright, let's get to it. We'll start off with How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Soccer.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Um, I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And, uh, that's actually, you know, I played a lot of Cookie Mama while waiting at the bank.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Things I do for us.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The sacrifices I make.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I learned how to make Tonkatsu.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Have you not played Cookie Mama on the Wii yet?

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I'm broke.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You really should at some point. Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game. Ever.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yuck.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, wait. Resident Evil, then Cookie Mama.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I hope that is not Chris's blood.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Anyway.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Or do you?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Gotta...

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Perf.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't even know where the hell that...

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Resident Evil prone...

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, somebody sent me that on me three times. It was like Resident Evil voice acting...

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I sent it to you!

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Bitch.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No I don't.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So I have a big pink button.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No I don't.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I send you awesome.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So, is that it? Cookie Mama, what you gave me a week?

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, that and then let the PSP battery die.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,040
and I couldn't find the charger so poo on him so that was a game you didn't

99
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:14,480
play very well done Jamie ah shut up also Joe you just got back from a road

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,400
trip right so yes angry angry drivers driving just stupid people that's why I

101
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
thought all right Loki how was your gaming week I played earth defense force

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:34,740
2017 per usual so that's fun I played briefly guitar hero 2 and that was

103
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,600
about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not gonna play much of

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,840
it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,600
haven't really played much DDR either play boom boom rocket that was fun

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,040
actually it's doing pretty good on some of the songs but I don't they get pretty

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,240
hard and some of the achievements are actually pretty easy like unlocked five

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,280
after playing like the first song or something is weird and then I played

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,980
gnarly golf which that's an old Apple to GS game that I played through an Apple

110
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,800
to GS emulator on the internet and I miss that game except it's really crappy

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,440
now why that game of all games I don't know it's a game I used to play a long

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,640
time ago and it was fun I remembered it being a lot more fun but the emulator

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,240
didn't work right right so you never lose lives so I beat the whole game and

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,360
I was like this dumb uh then let's see what else did I play I played Super

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:48,320
Paper Mario and it has way too much dialogue 20 minutes of fucking dialogue

116
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:56,600
before I can play the game that's retarded but it's okay so far what else

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:06,760
did they play that's about it I think yeah all right let's see I Mikey movie I

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,680
also play Super Paper Mario a lot I think it's great I think it's an awesome

119
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,240
game I like the whole old-school side scroller thing mixed with like the

120
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,600
role-playing elements and I think that 3d thing is freaking brilliant I love

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,000
the fact that you can you know hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3d

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
world and you really have to kind of explore and dig around and then like the

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,000
fact that the other characters have their abilities to see I have to juggle

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,800
it it's really like imagine if Super Mario Brothers were like a puzzle game

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,320
in some regards like practice for the game feels like sometimes there's fetch

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,800
quests and everything it's fun but I'm unlike Loki I thought the dialogue was

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,720
kind of fun I mean yeah it has a long opening to the game but you know they're

128
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
just trying to set the stage because you know they couldn't have just done

129
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,680
another you know princess gets kidnapped story although well to some extent that

130
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,320
is what they did but it's much deeper than that this time so when they

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,120
introduced new characters and you know there's that quirky sense of humor that

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,040
comes with a lot of the Mario role-playing games like definitely

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,520
reminds me the Mario and Luigi series series the sense of humor that's in the

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,960
game so I disagree with you look yeah I think I think the dialogue is cool well

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,100
it didn't have the dialogue was cool it's just I didn't really care for 20

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,480
minutes of it right in the beginning of the game you know to me why just why

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,080
didn't you skip the opening wedding because I wanted to know the story

138
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,920
because that obviously it's there if it's important I mean so I just wish

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,280
they would have liked you know paraphrased or maybe broken it up a

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,040
little bit you know instead of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

141
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,440
blah blah blah blah play a little bit Oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

142
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,720
Seriously though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?

143
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,120
I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the chaos

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
heart.

145
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I mean, come on!

146
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I didn't think of that.

147
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,720
It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
So whatever.

149
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I'll play the game.

150
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
It's gonna be awesome.

151
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,760
No, don't get me wrong, but it's just, seriously, they could've spaced out the dialogue a little

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
bit more.

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Gotta love our chat room.

154
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,920
OrangeLawnTradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.

155
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,440
Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?

156
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.

157
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,440
It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote goddamn Super Paper Mario.

158
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,040
It's like, and Luigi came, buh buh buh buh buh, I mean, Stephen King just writes about

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,840
nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.

160
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,680
It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden

161
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,600
my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm gonna go down the street and find

162
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
out what goes down there.

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,480
And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.

164
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Exactly.

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Stupid.

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
But that's right.

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,320
I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.

168
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Just need Super Mario RPG to come to virtual console and we'll be all good.

169
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
The game is great.

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I just bought that!

171
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
For three dollars.

172
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh, the original cartridge, right?

173
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Yep.

174
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Where'd you find that?

175
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
Stephen traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.

176
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Well, lucky you.

177
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm sure that'll be awesome.

178
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,120
You think that'll come out on virtual console?

179
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,680
I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario,

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.

181
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,760
Anyway, the game's awesome.

182
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't listen to Loki's rants.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's tolerable.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't say it wasn't awesome.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,880
I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.

186
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,820
Alright, well, great.

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,800
If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.

188
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
You just have to read.

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,080
I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.

190
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Alright.

191
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,800
The only thing I think is gonna be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't

192
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,840
really see it as being the type of game I'm gonna go back through and play again a lot.

193
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.

194
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
I don't know.

195
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper

196
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever, I don't know.

197
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
I kinda see it as something I'm gonna play once and be done with.

198
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
But we'll see.

199
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
We'll see.

200
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,380
Ask me again when I get there.

201
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,800
But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.

202
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,080
Also my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.

203
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,360
That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.

204
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,320
I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should've taken a picture of it, because, hey, it makes

205
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,840
my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 on the leaderboard.

206
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard.

207
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,440
I was number five one day.

208
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,080
And I know you might be thinking, well, medium, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,800
I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all 10 medium songs.

210
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,600
And I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,280
Blades page comes from.

212
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,680
So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100%

213
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
perfects on all the songs.

214
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
So I don't know, whatever.

215
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,900
I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long

216
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,480
to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.

217
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,160
It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.

218
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.

219
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,000
It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,160
of the songs I won't want to play again.

221
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
I liked actually some of them.

222
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,180
There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.

223
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,300
I don't know.

224
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,320
I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad, because to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't

225
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,800
that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?

226
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,880
I'm all, fuck this shit, I should just put a pad in there.

227
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,200
Somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad, and I'm

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
sure, I haven't tried it.

229
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I think you can.

230
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm sure, why couldn't you?

231
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.

232
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,640
There's no reason you couldn't do it, because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad

233
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,680
or the buttons, which is actually how I do it.

234
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,080
I use both.

235
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,640
I use left on the D-pad, and then the other three I use the buttons, because that allows

236
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,100
me to have the triggers as well.

237
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,400
It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.

238
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Don't do all direction, or don't do all buttons.

239
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,840
Do like one or two of the arrows on the direction pad, and then the other two on the buttons,

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,960
and if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.

241
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,900
There is one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.

242
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
So I was like, um, okay.

243
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,080
Well you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.

244
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,560
Well it was up, up, and left, left.

245
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,040
Well then yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there, hit left on D-pad

246
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
and left on the button.

247
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
I don't know.

248
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,240
I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.

249
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Um, because I haven't played the game really for one night, just like I played it hardcore

250
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
like one night.

251
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,720
I played it for hours, but the songs just aren't replayable for me.

252
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,680
That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and like DDR, or Beatmania.

253
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,560
Let's say Beatmania, which you know, obviously this game is hugely inspired by.

254
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,180
Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again, and Konami obviously

255
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,880
has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.

256
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,200
Granted they license stuff, but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care

257
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
about anyway.

258
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,760
Well okay, maybe a little bit.

259
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,480
Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.

260
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,400
But most of it is forgettable, right?

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,160
But the original in-house stuff is great.

262
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,780
You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.

263
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,880
So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable

264
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
of creating music.

265
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,440
Unless they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.

266
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
EA tracks.

267
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
EA tracks.

268
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Exactly.

269
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,640
Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?

270
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?

271
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
It's because there's downloadable packs later.

272
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Oh great.

273
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,540
So you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are not

274
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,840
even going to be that great I'm sure.

275
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,480
And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.

276
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,600
We'll get into that later.

277
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,360
Dark Tetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose.

278
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,240
SSJ100 Matt says fucking Avril.

279
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,820
Dark Shy says no insult J-Pop.

280
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,700
It's not all bad, but come on.

281
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,000
Some of it's pretty forgettable.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Some of it's not.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I like M-Flow.

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
They're pretty cool.

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,800
Third style for life.

286
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,160
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.

287
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,920
If everyone's done with their gaming week, tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.

288
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,200
I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games Community site, which is something we've

289
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,680
kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.

290
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,500
It's kind of like Myspace, but without the cam bots and horrors and stuff.

291
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,760
And it's people talking about video games.

292
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
It's pretty awesome.

293
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,800
So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.

294
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm on there.

295
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
DarkSakura's on there.

296
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Matt's on there.

297
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,480
I'd like you to check out if you have a chance.

298
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,920
I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time, because you

299
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational

300
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
tide pool game.

301
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,040
And it kind of got me thinking this week, what are my favorite edutainment games from

302
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
yesteryear?

303
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
And of course, number one's The Oregon Trail.

304
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,800
But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.

305
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,160
And actually, I was looking at some of the comments, and I thought this was interesting

306
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,800
because the Rob D. already commented on my post, he says, this is probably just a generational

307
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,360
gap considering that anything more than five years constitutes a gap for edutainment.

308
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,280
But no learning company games other than Carmen Sandiego?

309
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,480
And he kind of goes on to name some of his favorites.

310
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,240
And yeah, I'm looking at my list again.

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,480
I was kind of old.

312
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,520
Like a lot of my titles are really old, like Apple IIe, like Rocky's Boots, and some of

313
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
that stuff.

314
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Oh, fuck.

315
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
What?

316
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I don't remember that.

317
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,400
You know, I had to get really obscure for some of these.

318
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,960
But these were games I played.

319
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,520
And I think the one like frickin' probably no one has heard of is Cave of the Word Wizard.

320
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,040
But seriously, that game was scary as hell.

321
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
I've heard of it.

322
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Have you?

323
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
For the Commodore 64?

324
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Yeah.

325
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,220
Dude, it's freaky because this game is about who made this?

326
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,860
TimeWorks Inc. made this for the Commodore 64.

327
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,400
And basically, you went around this cave, and you had to jump over rocks, and you were

328
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
collecting crystals.

329
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,320
And you had to avoid bats and rocks.

330
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,000
And if you messed up, then you lost a Band-Aid.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,120
Well, randomly, in this like flash of light, like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound

332
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,440
effects, this little wizard would appear, and he'd go, spell anti-disestablishmentarianism,

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
or whatever word.

334
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Because he used the voice chip in there, right?

335
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,160
So you'd have to spell it out, and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind

336
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
of sucked.

337
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
It was a Commodore 64.

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah, it would be like, now spell.

339
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,680
And if you got it right, he would give you a Band-Aid.

340
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,760
But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker, and he'd take flashlight power from

341
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
you.

342
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,360
And so you were left to die in this cave, because of this horrible wizard who wanted

343
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,600
to punish people who couldn't spell.

344
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,520
But obviously, if you've ever read my live journal, you'll see this game actually taught

345
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
me nothing.

346
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Anyway, check it out, community.allgames.com, look for my blog.

347
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,560
DarkSockerLoki, do you guys ever post your blogs?

348
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,760
I've seen Logie post a few things.

349
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
No.

350
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,960
I've seen pictures of my cat up there.

351
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,040
Logie posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this

352
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,800
week, but we'll leave you to find out what that is.

353
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,360
Let's get on with the real show, shall we, Logie?

354
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
Yes, shall.

355
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,080
Anyways, so not a big surprise, but Perrin Kaplan, open her big fat mouth again, and

356
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,120
is talking about Nintendo Wii shortages.

357
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,080
And basically saying they're doing everything in their power to make sure that the systems

358
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,800
are out there, but it's just a supply and demand situation, and there's nothing more

359
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
that it can do.

360
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,240
They're at maximum production.

361
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,740
I have a hard time believing that, but that's what they're saying, so I guess that's what

362
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,360
we've got to go off of.

363
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,240
But here's why I don't believe that.

364
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,960
You don't see any accessories or any systems or anything, well, I mean, not very much hitting

365
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
the retail markets and stuff.

366
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,200
Okay now, explain this to me.

367
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,540
Those stupid point cards, it's fucking cardboard.

368
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,640
Why the fuck aren't there billions of these things out there, I mean, it's cardboard.

369
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,760
It's not some fucking fancy chip, it's a piece of cardboard.

370
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,240
So that's why I don't believe this stuff, because it's fucking impossible to find this

371
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
stuff.

372
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,760
I don't know about the controllers and all that stuff, but I don't understand why these

373
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,760
controllers are any harder to make than, say, the classic controller or whatnot.

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,600
It's not that complicated of a piece of equipment, so I don't understand why it's taking them

375
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
so long.

376
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,760
Well, you don't need those cards anyway.

377
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
The cards are pointless.

378
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,320
You get charged tax on those cards.

379
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Buy them online.

380
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I understand.

381
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on

382
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
it.

383
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Sorry, folks.

384
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I understand that, but there's...

385
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,080
Some people like the cards for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards

387
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
or stuff like that.

388
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,520
Allowance bonus thing.

389
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,160
Steal your mommy's wallet.

390
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,600
But this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold

391
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,920
out of right now, something that should be able...

392
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,960
So if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.

393
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
These things should be fucking easy to make.

394
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Same with the controllers.

395
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,160
The controllers aren't that complicated.

396
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean, hell, even, you know, the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts

397
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,560
in it that weren't in, like, say, the GameCube or something like that.

398
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,780
Like, the GameCube controllers.

399
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,260
Why the fuck can't they make more of them?

400
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,800
Maybe they're made from magic trees.

401
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Oh, okay.

402
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,920
Well, there you go.

403
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,280
You know, magic trees.

404
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,480
Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.

405
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,840
That's what they're gonna have in Animal Crossing.

406
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,440
They'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out

407
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
of.

408
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,680
They can just shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.

409
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,760
They could just recycle.

410
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.

411
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.

412
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Yes!

413
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
That's what probably happened.

414
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,240
You know, someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce

415
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,400
these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.

416
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,280
So yeah, if you're looking for a Wii, you're not gonna find them for a while, unless, you

417
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,920
know, whether it's something that Nintendo's doing on purpose, which would make no sense,

418
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,880
or if it's just, you know, that they can't make enough, whatever.

419
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
Either way, it's gonna be, you know, hard to find them.

420
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,440
But hey, if it's any consolation, there aren't really that many games that are major that

421
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,160
are coming out between now and Christmas.

422
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,040
Okay, I hate to derail here, but Mikolatov has joined us and he's come in the room and

423
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,340
he's laughing his ass off, and I know you guys are playing video games out there.

424
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,800
By the way, like, Mikolatov, X-Differ, and Rice Princess are all here, but none of them

425
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,360
wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.

426
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,920
But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.

427
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
It's distracting!

428
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,560
We're trying to do a show in here!

429
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Oh, okay.

430
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,000
So, Christopher is playing Marble Mania, and that was in my office, and you know, I saw

431
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
it.

432
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I thought it was a really fun game.

433
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It is really fun.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,420
But he picked the panda marble, and if people don't know about this game, every time the

435
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,760
marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.

436
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,640
The panda sounds like it's farting, and it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing

437
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,600
ever, and I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing

438
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,760
so hard.

439
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,920
So you guys are laughing at fart noises, and that's what's derailing this entire show.

440
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:03,600
It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.

441
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Don't die!

442
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,320
It's all that eucalyptus, you know.

443
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
It's Cassie shit.

444
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!

445
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
Oh, my mistake.

446
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Hey, this is what I get for not reading.

447
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,520
Bamboo, whatever!

448
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
It's Cassie!

449
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.

450
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,760
Maybe that's your problem, you're feeding the panda eucalyptus.

451
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,640
Well thank god I don't work at a zoo.

452
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,880
They'd be dead.

453
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,440
The chat room is asking if it's for...

454
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Koala Panda!

455
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,080
DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 4.20 this week?

456
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,800
No, we're not.

457
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,560
We're role models for the young kids.

458
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,800
We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.

459
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,320
What is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?

460
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,120
Winners don't use drugs, remember that, boys and girls.

461
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,320
Winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera

462
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,280
browser to check out the internet with.

463
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,920
The final version has gone online this week.

464
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,340
You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because when the blue

465
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,360
light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.

466
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
But in this case it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.

467
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,620
So the full version of the internet channel is there.

468
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,760
The new features is, thank god, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto

469
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
hide.

470
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,120
You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that, so you can have your

471
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
YouTube's full screen.

472
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,400
You can just hit one, and it will hide it.

473
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Awesome.

474
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,520
You can also zoom in and out at a lot.

475
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,760
I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.

476
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,840
So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to

477
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,880
worry about trying to get it full screen, and da-da-da, and all that stuff.

478
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,120
You can also do www.com at a click of a button, because all that's in there.

479
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,960
They just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover, so it was supposed to run

480
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
a little faster.

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,280
Although, I don't know.

482
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,440
I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up, or the Wi-Fi,

483
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,560
but internet channel is slow.

484
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,200
So slow.

485
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,100
It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.

486
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,800
It's faster to browse the internet on, obviously, a computer.

487
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,600
But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.

488
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,960
I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.

489
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,080
Does it just not have the power to handle, or what?

490
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,440
Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel, or forecast channel,

491
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
whatever.

492
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Any of the channels.

493
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,200
It takes fucking forever to load up, so it's just slow.

494
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Am I supposed to enable some port in my router?

495
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,480
You know how for some file share programs, you're supposed to open up certain ports in

496
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,200
your router, and direct them directly to one of the things that is connected to the router?

497
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,800
You know what I mean?

498
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,840
Maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii, to make it run faster.

499
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Who knows?

500
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Eh.

501
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,560
Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.

502
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,120
Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.

503
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,280
Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves, and turn it into a koala.

504
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Well, here's some-

505
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Whatever.

506
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,860
I don't give a shit if fucking koalas.

507
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
It would be more- Koalas are cute.

508
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,120
It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.

509
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,160
Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.

510
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,320
Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have

511
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,840
their Wiis and are keeping up with Virtual Console releases, there is a, I don't know

512
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,820
if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on Virtual Console.

513
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,920
We love some ActRaiser, don't we?

514
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Not in this country.

515
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,520
Well, that's exactly it, it's out in the UK.

516
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:53,840
It actually has 800 Wii points, and basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where

517
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,680
you walk around and you're God.

518
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,920
I like walking around as God, I do that every day.

519
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I love that.

520
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,120
ActRaiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.

521
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,640
Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay, it's-

522
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,320
Ah!

523
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,760
I like smiting my enemies.

524
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:18,560
Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii points, Bonk's Revenge

525
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,600
for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii points.

526
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,240
Blah, blah, blah, all I heard was ActRaiser, honestly.

527
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,800
When do we get it?

528
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm hoping that's a good sign we get it on Monday, except for the fact that I'm going

529
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
to be out of town all week.

530
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Poor baby.

531
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I know, poor me.

532
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Should we go to Disneyland?

533
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Yeah, that's true.

534
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
I'm going to Disneyland.

535
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,840
ActRaiser or Disneyland?

536
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I don't know.

537
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
We can bring the Wii with us.

538
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
That's a good idea.

539
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Let's bring a Wii.

540
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Yeah, we should.

541
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Okay.

542
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,320
Yeah, the only thing I would be wondering is, now Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because

543
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,520
Pac-Man is, you can play Pac-Man on everything.

544
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,120
Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.

545
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I'm sorry, 2600.

546
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Oh, yeah.

547
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,760
The 2600 version is like...

548
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Crap!

549
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Yeah, no.

550
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
It's like Pac-Man barf.

551
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
It's not real Pac-Man.

552
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,720
It's, I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.

553
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
It's Diet Pac-Man.

554
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:16,000
Anyways, so other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force, they've

555
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,200
been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out, probably Monday.

556
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,600
So you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually

557
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,880
a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.

558
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,960
Ooh, Rice Prince is in chat and says Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.

559
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,800
Hey, maybe that's a good sign that, you know, this Actraiser, or the UK release will mirror

560
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
the release that we get.

561
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
But we already got Pac-Man, right?

562
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
I think we already got Pac-Man.

563
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I know.

564
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,760
Not that I really care, because I'm not going to go down.

565
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,480
Maybe we'll get Ms. Pac-Man or some bullshit.

566
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I don't care.

567
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I just want Actraiser.

568
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
It's like an original game.

569
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,720
That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?

570
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Originally made games?

571
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Yeah, we'll see.

572
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Someday.

573
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Alright.

574
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Let's see.

575
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Also, speaking about Nintendo.

576
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,920
Oh, you're going to love this story, Loki, because I know you love piracy, but Nintendo

577
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
does not.

578
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,840
You might know that recently in the news, the US has complained to the World Trade Organization

579
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:21,880
about China, and it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.

580
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,600
Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support

581
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
this.

582
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,320
Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.

583
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,600
What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here, quote, Nintendo

584
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,440
will continue to work with the US government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo

585
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,000
products in China.

586
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,800
We're pleased the US government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments

587
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,160
in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.

588
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,720
That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America's Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.

589
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,640
What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that their ROMs and their old shit still

590
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,280
run rampant throughout the internet.

591
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,400
They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.

592
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,840
Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.

593
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.

594
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,520
Hell, there's that one site where you could play all the video games online, or I don't

595
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,720
remember, it's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.

596
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,320
You can play them all right there in your browser, and Nintendo certainly has an interest

597
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,120
in old games because they're making five bucks off of everyone they can sell to a virtual

598
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
console user.

599
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I don't know.

600
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Great.

601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
That's not China's problem.

602
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
That's happening right here.

603
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm glad they hate piracy.

604
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm glad they're blaming China.

605
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:43,520
It's not like, because America, no one here pirates anything ever, never ever.

606
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,360
The Rob D in chat says ROM sites don't really exist anymore.

607
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,840
It's mostly torrents.

608
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,600
Yeah, that's true.

609
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,280
But still somebody's hosting the torrents, right?

610
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,880
You got to host the seed file somewhere.

611
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,400
Depends on where it's legal or illegal.

612
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,600
You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.

613
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,320
Pirate Bay just says back in Go, you guys are stupid.

614
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,560
Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.

615
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,760
So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.

616
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,840
Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.

617
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,720
The company, Datel, has a program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter

618
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,360
your Mii avatar for your PC.

619
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:39,320
It's actually 1,499 pounds and $1,999 in the US, but you can download it off of their site.

620
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,640
It's at Code Junkies.

621
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,480
And the website is, just go to codejunkies.com and look it up.

622
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
It's actually pretty cool.

623
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,960
And I'll be posting the link in the chat room.

624
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,720
I believe there's actually some free stuff that's out there that does the exact same

625
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
thing.

626
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,760
In fact, website wemodwe.com, and that's W-I-I mod W-I-I dot com.

627
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,320
And they have kind of something similar where you can exchange stuff.

628
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,600
You just basically have to have some sort of Bluetooth adapter or Bluetooth in your

629
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,320
laptop or computer or whatever, and it does it for free.

630
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,720
But to be honest, though, why the fuck is Datel releasing a PC editing program for Miis?

631
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,240
I thought the Wii already had that.

632
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,480
You can just do it on your Wii.

633
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,200
Isn't it funner to do it on your computer?

634
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't know.

635
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
You know what?

636
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,440
I just like that I have a Bluetooth device, and I like that it's called a dongle, because

637
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
that's a funny word.

638
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,760
Why don't they have that for, I don't know, say, the DS?

639
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
That'd be kind of neat.

640
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
That would be kind of cool.

641
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,240
It would be cheesy and stupid and useless, but neat.

642
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,740
You know, I did find that DS in Super Paper Mario, and it is pretty deceiving.

643
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,800
I totally thought at first, before I remembered that story that was on the internet, I totally

644
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,840
thought at first, I was like, wait, it's saying connectivity, looking for connectivity?

645
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
What a tease!

646
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,720
What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there

647
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,220
was going to be some type of functionality.

648
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,640
By the way, thanks to the Magica Radio, I had just run out to the living room real quick,

649
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,980
and I saw them playing a Korowinpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking

650
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
funny.

651
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,980
It really is funny.

652
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,480
It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

653
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Remember that?

654
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,800
Where it's just farting noises all the time.

655
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

656
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
You've never seen Labyrinth?

657
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
The Bog of Eternal Stench?

658
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Yeah, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

659
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Oh, god.

660
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,100
So bad!

661
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,480
The last time I saw it, I was like eight.

662
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,360
Mine was a couple months ago.

663
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,120
We need to fix that!

664
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
I guess so.

665
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,000
You know, Megsy hasn't seen Labyrinth.

666
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,120
Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.

667
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,340
Basically, their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super

668
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,560
Paper Mario is not in the store or street date by 2pm, then you get $20 in a gift card.

669
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,960
Well, the problem was that someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario

670
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,360
was sold out, but the thing was, they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore

671
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
they don't get $20.

672
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,280
It's kind of like, well, we had it, but you just weren't here.

673
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,000
What was to stop them from telling everybody that?

674
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Nothing.

675
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
Nothing at all.

676
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,480
Aha!

677
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
So it was a scam.

678
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Yes.

679
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:35,640
Did he call the Better Business Bureau, or did he just post his angry rant on the internet

680
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
and telling everyone to dig it?

681
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,000
Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.

682
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau

683
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,440
instead of dig probably would have been a little more effective, because I don't think

684
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,880
the Better Business Bureau reads Joystik, Kotaku, and Destructoid.

685
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,720
Or even better, maybe, I don't know, let's flashback to say when the Wii came out, and

686
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,240
I think there were similar situations with bundling and stuff like that.

687
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,680
So are we surprised?

688
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
No.

689
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Who cares?

690
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
It's Super Paper Mario.

691
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
It's like everywhere.

692
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,040
If you don't get it, you know, it's...

693
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,480
Act Deft and Chad is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.

694
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?

695
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,560
You don't know any better walking into the store.

696
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:26,440
You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, oh, we sold

697
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
out.

698
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,960
There was a line.

699
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,440
It's crazy.

700
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Yep.

701
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
No gift card for you.

702
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,160
Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?

703
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,880
The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements there's a little bit of small

704
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,160
print that you got to read and that's, you know, the offers can change without notice.

705
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,520
So ha, they can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super

706
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Paper Mario.

707
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,920
They don't have to, you know, follow that.

708
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,680
They can just say, fuck you, bitch, I ain't doing shit.

709
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,580
So could we post a big ad on the internet somewhere that says Orange Lounge Radio gives

710
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,000
free blowjobs and then like in little fine print lie.

711
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
This is a lie.

712
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
What, Rice Princess?

713
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,480
But that would be true on your behalf.

714
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm sorry.

715
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,440
Rice Princess, it actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our.

716
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
But on your behalf.

717
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
It's your slut.

718
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Oops.

719
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
I mean, hi.

720
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,720
This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.

721
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Thank you.

722
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Shut up.

723
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Thank you for ruining our program.

724
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Uh-huh.

725
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm going to go now.

726
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
So hi everyone and bye.

727
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
All right.

728
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Wow.

729
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:45,280
Raven's dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.

730
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,800
Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.

731
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
You should have heard what she yelled.

732
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Anyhow.

733
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Wait, wait, wait.

734
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Let me, let me simulate it.

735
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh, what?

736
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Ew!

737
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
How was that?

738
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
That was good.

739
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
That was good.

740
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,040
A little less angry next time though.

741
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,640
Well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?

742
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:12,040
Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week

743
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,760
on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th and it was this woman making

744
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:24,340
a post there saying, hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.

745
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,520
In return, you can mount me.

746
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,720
You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000, excuse me, I want the

747
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,100
5,000 gold before we do anything.

748
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,400
We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.

749
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,680
So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 night elf druid and would prefer

750
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
someone who is into role playing.

751
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,440
I have a costume.

752
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,600
But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold.

753
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,680
I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold.

754
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,620
Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal.

755
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:10,520
So other words, short translation, I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much and I don't even

756
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
know where to go with this.

757
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,640
It's prostitution.

758
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,940
Pretty much.

759
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,080
But she gets away with it because A, it's on the internet, I'm assuming she doesn't

760
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
live in Nevada.

761
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,680
I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on but I don't think it was Vegas and anyway,

762
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,460
it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.

763
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,720
So it was probably illegal but she gets away with it because it's the internet and it's

764
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,640
not real money.

765
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Would you...

766
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,720
It's offering sex for services so...

767
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,800
Would you give amount for amount?

768
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,200
No, Rob.

769
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,160
Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman and obviously her picture

770
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,840
was all over the internet because you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you

771
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,240
kind of see her and she ain't all that.

772
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,360
No, not at all.

773
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
But this is the thing.

774
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,280
Just a couple days later, there was a follow up post.

775
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,920
Hi, I just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my

776
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,600
picture all over the internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.

777
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,280
I got my epic mount in about an hour.

778
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,120
That was very enjoyable for both parties while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds

779
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,680
of hours farming for years or don't even have them.

780
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,880
I won't be revealing my name or his but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll

781
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,280
be killing you 280% faster.

782
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,640
That's a little WoW joke there.

783
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:34,200
Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

784
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,640
She said it twice and capitalized it both times so I was reading it that way.

785
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,560
Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

786
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
I'm planning to meet him again later this week.

787
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,380
He's getting double value for his gold.

788
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,800
So talk all the trash you want.

789
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,960
I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can

790
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
ever hope for.

791
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,200
Well, she does make a point.

792
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,880
As long as she's got a good attitude about it.

793
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,840
As long as she gets her epic mount, that way she can defend herself from the ugly sick

794
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,000
because it looks like she's been beat down with it a few thousand times.

795
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Okay, wait, wait.

796
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,840
Away from the personal attacks for a minute.

797
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:17,640
Let's say this had been a very Angelina Jolie but blonde, big, big titties posting this.

798
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,960
That still doesn't make it right.

799
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,240
Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about 5,000

800
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,320
gold I think equals about $600 in real money.

801
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,800
Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that

802
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
route.

803
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,280
Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.

804
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,240
Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.

805
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
You okay with it?

806
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.

807
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
Seriously.

808
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Well.

809
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.

810
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,600
I think I got a 20 in my wallet.

811
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
No.

812
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,640
Can I prostitute you to clean my kitchen?

813
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Fuck you.

814
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,960
No, but I think, you know, and I'm saying this, and, you know, it's also not just because

815
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,720
I watched the prostitution episode of bullshit last night either.

816
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:13,380
But I believe that, you know, if done in a, I'm trying to think about how to say this.

817
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,120
If you are taking the proper precautions to stay clean, to protect yourself from unwanted

818
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,440
pregnancy and STDs, and you're getting something out of it.

819
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
It's your choice.

820
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,680
Who has the right to tell you what to do with your body?

821
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,040
That's what I say.

822
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
But I don't know.

823
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,280
I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed

824
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy.

825
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
You know, I don't care.

826
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,120
But yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my

827
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,760
finger on it.

828
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,640
Like you just kind of like, ah, that's just not right.

829
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
That's not right.

830
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,280
I'm trying to put out for wow.

831
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
It is sad.

832
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
For wow, Jamie.

833
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,440
People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii, so.

834
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,540
You know, I'm not saying that it's sad.

835
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,260
I think that someone is desperate enough.

836
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,840
But honestly, more power to her, you know.

837
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,480
If she says, you know what, I have no problem with, you know, giving it up a little bit

838
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
for a mountain.

839
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:24,040
You know, I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.

840
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,240
I mean, I would think that, I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything

841
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,680
to actually earn it, you know.

842
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,640
Like in game, like everybody else does.

843
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
But at the same time.

844
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,680
But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG type websites and all

845
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
that, anyway.

846
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Right?

847
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,080
It's pretty much, it's pretty much the same thing.

848
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,160
For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.

849
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,320
It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.

850
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,160
Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?

851
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I don't know.

852
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,560
Well, no, it doesn't matter though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly, older

853
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,320
chick and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair, ooh.

854
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,040
But anyways, hey, great.

855
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,440
I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview, well, so much for that, Loki ruined

856
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
those chances.

857
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
That's fine, I'll talk to her.

858
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,560
Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.

859
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,760
I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?

860
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,240
GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's joining.

861
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.

862
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,280
No, no, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.

863
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,640
Sluts do it for free, whores get paid.

864
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
That's true.

865
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
So she was being a whore.

866
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
She was being a whore.

867
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
World of Warcraft.

868
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
She wasn't a slut, she was a whore.

869
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Big difference.

870
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
But you, but again.

871
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,200
Is he, I don't know if GS68 might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone have

872
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
cared?

873
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Men can be, there's male prostitutes.

874
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
They're whores.

875
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Well, I know that.

876
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,680
There's people who give up the butt love for money.

877
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,560
I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?

878
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
I know that.

879
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,040
I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.

880
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,600
I get it for free, okay?

881
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,880
I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with sauce over

882
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,440
AIM, which I'm not on.

883
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Nobody IM me.

884
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,400
Um, just that, you know, because it's legal in Nevada, and it's actually a good source

885
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,400
of income, and it's safe and clean.

886
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,800
I don't even have letters on this one.

887
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,600
To be honest, I mean, seriously, this stuff happens all the time in fucking Second Life

888
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,640
and shit like that, and no one, it just happens so often now that no one really gives a shit.

889
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
This, I mean...

890
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,600
In a way, all she did was cut out the middle man.

891
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I mean, really.

892
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,760
I mean, if not this, then what?

893
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
She could have been a stripper.

894
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,960
She would have stripped for cash, just used the cash to buy the gold for my GE.

895
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
There you go.

896
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,460
All she's doing, she's cutting out the middle man.

897
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,000
She's going straight from stripping to her mount.

898
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,380
It's the same difference as saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help

899
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,600
me get my mount.

900
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,400
It's an exchange of services.

901
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,840
It's just bringing it from...

902
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,920
Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.

903
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,720
She couldn't have done stripping.

904
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
Uh-uh.

905
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,680
I, I say it was her choice to do it, you know, if anyone's going to judge her, you know,

906
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,000
look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can, you can afford to judge

907
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
somebody else.

908
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's what I say.

909
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Okay, put it this way.

910
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,440
Let me lay it out to you straight here.

911
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,640
She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.

912
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
So is she.

913
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,480
I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.

914
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
What's your point?

915
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,440
Yeah, but you don't have sex with fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.

916
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,640
Well, she has sex with Dan and he buys her games.

917
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
I mean...

918
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,920
Yeah, but I married him.

919
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
That's why Jamie has...

920
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Wait!

921
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,040
I'm not, I'm not 31 yet.

922
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,800
That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.

923
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
No.

924
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I'm just teasing.

925
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Obviously, there's a big difference.

926
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
No, that's wrong.

927
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
I know it is.

928
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
I'm not 31 yet, by the way.

929
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Okay, well there you go.

930
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Four days!

931
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Stop it!

932
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,760
I have, I have 2 AM on Thursday, so just be nice to me.

933
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,080
What if this chick's got like fucking kids and stuff?

934
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,080
I mean, because...

935
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,400
Mommy, what are you doing?

936
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,320
Oh yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.

937
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
At least I got my mount.

938
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,840
All right, this topic's gone on way too long.

939
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
We can bring it up in Skype.

940
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
I'm learning it later.

941
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,400
Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.

942
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Please.

943
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
I've even eaten all the fucking Pocky.

944
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
It's good.

945
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,440
I know, I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's cookies and cream.

946
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Anyway.

947
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,600
So, all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?

948
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Right?

949
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,240
No, actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.

950
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
I really like it.

951
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:48,200
Well, you can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.

952
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,160
So it's 500 points, the three packs are Pack 1 is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of

953
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Spades.

954
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,600
Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein.

955
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,440
Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar, which for me, at the top of all of those was

956
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,120
you know, Pack 1 for me.

957
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,880
You know, at least two good songs in there.

958
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,240
But you're basically playing about two bucks a song.

959
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,160
And the interesting thing that was, you know, they're gonna keep having these packs on here.

960
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,480
If they're gonna be that much, you're gonna end up actually spending a lot of money to

961
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,880
get some of these extra songs for packs of three.

962
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,680
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?

963
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,280
Go ahead.

964
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,540
This is bullshit!

965
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,800
Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?

966
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,880
Like 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?

967
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
Guitar and game?

968
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,880
No, maybe 69.

969
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
I don't remember.

970
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Yeah, it was pretty expensive.

971
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,160
It was $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the song packs at this price, you

972
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,720
will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.

973
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,720
That's hot.

974
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,720
No, it's not.

975
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:02,280
It's stupid, and the sad thing is, I am so tempted to still buy one of these packs, because

976
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,760
I do kind of want to play the songs on the Xbox 360, and like, I hate myself for it.

977
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,280
And Red Octane knows that they can get away with charging it.

978
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,960
This is the milking of the franchise that's going to lead to its death.

979
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,040
This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.

980
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,320
Because they know this is going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloaded

981
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
pullbacks.

982
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Right.

983
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:30,020
Yeah, they're really just jumping ship because they're totally not going to milk the franchise

984
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,720
by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for

985
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
it.

986
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,880
This works for Harmonix, though.

987
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,640
If you think about it, Loki, they rip themselves off with Guitar Freaks.

988
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
Guitar Freaks is what?

989
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,840
It's amplitude with a guitar controller.

990
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Kinda.

991
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Right?

992
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Guitar Hero?

993
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Yeah.

994
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,320
Or did I say Guitar Freaks?

995
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Yeah.

996
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Whatever.

997
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Well, hell, there's that too.

998
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,240
Guitar Freaks plus amplitude equals Guitar Hero, pretty much.

999
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
Right?

1000
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,240
Am I right?

1001
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Yeah.

1002
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
All right.

1003
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
There you go.

1004
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,340
But what I don't understand is that why, if we're going to pay this kind of money for

1005
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,440
these songs, why not give us new songs?

1006
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,380
I bet people may not have complained so much if you would have given new songs.

1007
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,340
I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and

1008
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,560
they're easy to copy over.

1009
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,640
Well, then they should be cheap.

1010
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,840
Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges

1011
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,360
like 99 cents a song and those songs are way better produced.

1012
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,120
Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital

1013
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,480
distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but still for $2, I know

1014
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,760
you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.

1015
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,240
Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.

1016
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,760
Why can't you, you know, throw some of those?

1017
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
Throw a classic pack up.

1018
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Why even do the packs at all?

1019
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,040
Some of those songs kind of suck and I don't want them.

1020
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,040
Exactly.

1021
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,040
That's why they're doing that.

1022
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,080
Like I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.

1023
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,960
I want the Red Hot Chili Peppers one.

1024
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
It's ah.

1025
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
You have to buy all of them.

1026
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Now, here's what I say, you can put the packs up, but make it, you know, some sort of discount

1027
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,520
over like say buying each song individually.

1028
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,480
Say if you want to buy, make each song, you know, buck 25 or something like that, you

1029
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
know, then that's not so bad.

1030
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,000
It's still bad, but it's not so bad.

1031
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,960
And then that way you save a little bit of money buying, you know, you know, one song

1032
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,360
over or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.

1033
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,160
The Rob D is making some interesting points in our chat, chat.ornisandrea.com.

1034
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,920
I think the rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.

1035
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,800
There's just not much you can do about it.

1036
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,640
It's not like you can innovate a guitar.

1037
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,400
It's Tony Hawk syndrome.

1038
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,240
Well, but in a way, in a way, Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as

1039
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,100
the Guitar Freaks guitar.

1040
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,220
And you sort of saw it coming, like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games

1041
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,220
a long time.

1042
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:57,340
Remember Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks because what did they do before they made

1043
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
games?

1044
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,400
They were, they were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income

1045
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,440
off of music games, economy's beat mania series and all the, all the songs there.

1046
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,040
They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons and everybody always asks,

1047
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
why did they put five?

1048
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,880
Because Guitar Freaks only has three and everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?

1049
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Why?

1050
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,520
And everybody speculated, Oh, Guitar Freaks, like super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation two,

1051
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,120
they're super duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows

1052
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
that.

1053
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,280
Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.

1054
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,600
Well, here's, here's the, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed

1055
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
off about.

1056
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,640
I don't know if some people may have seen this in the forums, how, and I mentioned a

1057
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,480
little on top of the show, how I built my own Guitar Hero effects pedal.

1058
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,920
Basically the thing, which is going to be a yet another purchase is just a fucking push

1059
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,360
button switch.

1060
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,480
It's something very simple that, I mean, should I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're

1061
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,640
going to have to buy.

1062
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,180
And that's going to be in addition to, you know, the guitar and everything.

1063
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,080
So they say they sell for 10 bucks.

1064
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,480
There's another 10 bucks you're paying for a fucking button for something that, and granted

1065
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,480
it's probably not necessary, but near are the song packs and yet it's something extra

1066
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,680
that you're going to be buying.

1067
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,280
So there you go.

1068
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Wonderful.

1069
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,160
And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game,

1070
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,160
but it works.

1071
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,000
I know that for a fact.

1072
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,400
I do agree that other music game series have become stagnant as well.

1073
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,640
I love DDR, I really do, but it is starting to get kind of old.

1074
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,720
I really feel like, you know, obviously it's inevitable there's going to be more DDR games

1075
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
this year.

1076
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,920
It's just a question of what, and I just feel like I'm not that excited about it anymore

1077
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,040
because like I've said on this program a while ago, my idea, and you know, granted you don't

1078
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,200
have to use this idea, this is just an idea.

1079
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,440
You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole dance magic

1080
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,120
mode from DDR Disney and battle mode in Supernova.

1081
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,680
Battle mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.

1082
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,320
It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever, and it was in the groove,

1083
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
same thing.

1084
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
It had a similar mode in there.

1085
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,360
It was just kind of an afterthought.

1086
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,880
Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select

1087
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,420
and, you know, I don't know, this whole like you got served kind of atmosphere there.

1088
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,080
There could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive, and that's

1089
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,400
a way you could innovate DDR, but I don't know.

1090
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,880
If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, well, DDR Supernova was one of

1091
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,600
the top 25 selling games last year.

1092
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,120
If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess

1093
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,840
why bother innovating?

1094
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Cost money to innovate.

1095
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,920
Anyways, speaking of- Our topics are taking too long tonight, my bad.

1096
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
Sorry.

1097
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,800
Well, also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Super Contra, and this is according to the ESRB.

1098
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,280
They have a rating now for it for the 360, so yay.

1099
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,520
I think this was one that was announced, I want to say, at E3 last year.

1100
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:07,360
I could have sworn it was announced, but yeah, now it's coming, so no big surprise.

1101
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:13,200
I want to say that when we saw that arcade montage, that there was Super Contra mixed

1102
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,080
in with regular Contra or something.

1103
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Yeah.

1104
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Is it super regular?

1105
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,440
Does it take Metamucil?

1106
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,440
Shut up.

1107
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,520
This is a game, after that little comment, I will want to play Jamie with her on Xbox

1108
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
Live Arcade.

1109
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
Quake 3.

1110
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Who?

1111
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,320
Because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.

1112
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,320
No.

1113
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
I'll actually literally throw up on you because of the motion.

1114
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
That's it.

1115
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,960
How long can you play before you start getting sick?

1116
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,760
Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.

1117
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,840
Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?

1118
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
About five minutes.

1119
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
All right.

1120
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Well, good.

1121
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Five minutes.

1122
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
I can get five frags on you at least.

1123
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
I'm really good at Quake.

1124
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
All right.

1125
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,840
Well, we'll put that to the test.

1126
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,840
I was a pro at Gotchum on Quake.

1127
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Gotchum on Quake?

1128
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Yep.

1129
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I don't even want to know.

1130
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
And I can actually play the...

1131
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
I don't even want to know.

1132
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,280
But anyway, so what am I talking about?

1133
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,080
The ESRB has recently leaked a rating for Quake 3 Team Arena with a rating of M, of

1134
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,080
course.

1135
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,680
But for the Xbox 360, now seeing as Quake 4 has already been released, it's a regular

1136
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,800
game and it wasn't that great.

1137
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,400
Quake 2 was already on there too.

1138
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,320
And Quake 2 was on the disc as well.

1139
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
Where does Quake 3 fit?

1140
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,320
And Quake...

1141
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,080
Well, I guess the original Quake hasn't been released yet, but Doom did and Doom had a

1142
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,220
lot of success.

1143
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,960
So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3, logically, is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?

1144
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,560
So we'll see.

1145
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,040
I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.

1146
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,040
It's probably the only thing that was possible before.

1147
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
No, downloadable mods would be great.

1148
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,600
Oh, that would be awesome.

1149
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,280
That would be cool if, like, when they released this, they put downloadable mods.

1150
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,560
They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.

1151
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,760
Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...

1152
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Well...

1153
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,400
You only have a few more months for that.

1154
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,640
Well, here's some other news, though.

1155
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,560
For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will

1156
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:17,800
be available in Europe and America in June.

1157
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:24,680
They were not giving too much, too many details as far as when it will actually be available

1158
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,080
in Europe, though.

1159
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:35,360
But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to

1160
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:46,200
go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels, so that's pretty cool.

1161
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:53,700
But also, the thing about this is that it's sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying

1162
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,240
that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.

1163
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,880
Yeah, but that may be console, though.

1164
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,400
Yeah, so is Gears of War.

1165
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.

1166
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,040
And Halo is exclusive.

1167
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,560
Yeah, we got that on PC as well.

1168
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,400
It's exclusive to just be released.

1169
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,160
It's exclusive to Microsoft's Empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever, it's their

1170
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,160
IP.

1171
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Yeah, that does make sense.

1172
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,640
I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still

1173
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,440
a Microsoft product, so yeah, that makes sense.

1174
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,240
Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.

1175
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,720
Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.

1176
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,120
They're not really referring to PCs, because I think they don't really generally kind of

1177
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,240
compete with PCs as far as platforms, I would think.

1178
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,280
PC gamers and console gamers are usually very different types.

1179
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,000
I mean, like, say me, I definitely consider myself a console gamer, but I do play PC games

1180
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
now and again.

1181
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,600
You know, obviously World of Warcraft, but besides, outside of that, I play an occasional

1182
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,960
PC game, and I think most hardcore PC gamers kind of feel the same way, like, yeah, I play

1183
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,120
mostly PC games, but I'll try out a console once in a while.

1184
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,600
You know, I have a PlayStation, you know, I play games on once in a while.

1185
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Yeah.

1186
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:10,760
Well, one PC game, and I actually tried playing this this week, but Dance Online, it's claims

1187
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,160
new kind of DDR multiplayer online game.

1188
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,000
You know, think Ota Jam, something like that.

1189
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,800
Anyways, it's free to play, and it's available online, I believe it's acclaimed.com slash

1190
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,600
dance, and you can actually check it out.

1191
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,160
I don't know if they're going to be doing kind of the Ota Jam thing where you can buy

1192
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,800
costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing, but apparently you're

1193
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:43,000
going to be able to actually win signed, you know, stuff from actually playing the game,

1194
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,400
so that might be kind of neat, or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like

1195
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,080
that, so I don't know.

1196
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,720
That's good that it's free, because I played the beta a few months ago, and I'll be honest,

1197
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,800
I don't really remember it.

1198
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,080
I reviewed it on the show, but I couldn't tell you when, and it was not something I

1199
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,200
would have paid for, so I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free, and sure, this whole,

1200
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,360
you know, pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that, they'll make money

1201
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
from it.

1202
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Advertising, sure, what the hell.

1203
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,720
You know, how about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?

1204
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,680
I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing, something like that.

1205
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
Why not?

1206
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,800
Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero, like have stuff, you know, sponsored by different

1207
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
things?

1208
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,280
Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.

1209
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,200
You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who

1210
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,280
want to get out there and exposed.

1211
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,000
I don't know.

1212
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It's still early, though.

1213
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I mean...

1214
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It is.

1215
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,280
I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2, and you know, they

1216
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,560
haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.

1217
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,320
I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere, somebody was calling this Red Octane's

1218
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,520
Horse Armor, and I could see that.

1219
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,880
And certainly Oblivion, actually, you know, I'll give it this, Oblivion got torn into

1220
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,040
a new one across the internet for the whole Horse Armor thing, and they fixed it in a

1221
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,040
big way.

1222
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,200
I mean, and honestly, Oblivion has the best downloadable content of any title.

1223
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,480
It's the most supported in the realm of downloadable content.

1224
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,480
I mean, wouldn't you agree?

1225
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Yeah.

1226
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,920
There's so much extra that's out there available for the game.

1227
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,120
So they did make right, eventually.

1228
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:22,040
So hopefully, Red Octane will follow in their footsteps and all will be forgiven.

1229
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,040
Hopefully.

1230
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,440
Hopefully.

1231
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,440
Hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.

1232
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,680
It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but I want you to think, it's a type of keyboard that

1233
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,740
actually plugs into your controller.

1234
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,120
It's that typical QWERTY, is what they call it, the QWERTY keyboard, that actually plugs

1235
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,200
into the bottom of your controller, so you can have it all right there in your hand.

1236
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,760
Now, I know what you might be thinking is, this is what I thought, is that, you know,

1237
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,040
well, why the hell do you need one of these?

1238
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,280
Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because

1239
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,080
I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.

1240
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,080
It was fine.

1241
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,840
Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a

1242
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,840
pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something,

1243
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,520
put the keyboard back down.

1244
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,120
This would actually be pretty quick for me.

1245
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,800
Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it, because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since

1246
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,680
it was basically ported from the PC version, PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play

1247
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,340
the game completely on the keyboard.

1248
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,520
The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going

1249
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,560
to be built to do that, so you might need something like this in order to do that.

1250
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:33,440
And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just

1251
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,400
typing something up in a chat window or something like that.

1252
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,320
That's completely different, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.

1253
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:46,600
But it's nice, that way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.

1254
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,880
I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.

1255
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,480
I just hope it's not more than 20 bucks, because honestly, we'll get into the reason this is

1256
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:04,640
coming out very soon, but it's not going to be worth it.

1257
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,040
I think Microsoft's pretty smart on their pricing for stuff, and it doesn't look like

1258
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,040
it's that...

1259
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,920
I'd say maybe $15, $20, $17.99 maybe, that's going to be my guess.

1260
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,580
We'll see.

1261
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:23,320
Going to the chat and seeing what the folks in chat are saying.

1262
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:30,800
Hostile One says, that looks useless to me, Jaded suggests a keyboard-mouse combo.

1263
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,640
Bonnie Dale says, in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's

1264
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,320
too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too

1265
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,320
long.

1266
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,400
Oh, SSG100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.

1267
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,180
I'd pay to have the Advantage or the minibosses in Guitar Hero, too bad most of their songs

1268
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,520
are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.

1269
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:58,160
What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?

1270
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,320
Maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.

1271
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,720
Maybe around the time we start getting more Halo news, like the beta or the game, maybe

1272
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,640
that'll be a downloadable song later on for free.

1273
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,680
Who knows?

1274
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,220
We shall see.

1275
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,040
We shall also see right now what is waiting for us in the mailbag, because you kids can

1276
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,480
email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1277
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,400
And DarkSakura likes to jump into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite

1278
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,680
emails to read with you folks here on air.

1279
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,600
So here we go, let's go into the mailbag.

1280
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:33,400
DarkSakura, who's on tap this week?

1281
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,800
We got a bunch of crap, really.

1282
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:47,200
First email actually is a link from Heon.

1283
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,920
It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters, I'm not sure, but the point that I wanted to say

1284
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,380
was actually in the email, it says, wanted to let you know about it, look, you probably

1285
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:04,680
already knew, love the show, but it needs more lesbians.

1286
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,040
Is that in our show role later on?

1287
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,040
I don't remember.

1288
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,720
No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.

1289
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,080
No, it wasn't announced.

1290
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,120
It was found on Gamefly.

1291
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,200
Oh, okay.

1292
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,120
It was officially leaked on Gamefly.

1293
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,120
I see.

1294
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,680
That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.

1295
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,840
I wonder what tipped them off.

1296
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,320
People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.

1297
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
That's true.

1298
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:42,640
Anyway, we also have, actually our friend Rob with two Bs sent an email saying that

1299
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:49,960
the FTC had provided evidence that the current self-regulation by the ESRB has significantly

1300
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,040
improved and is better than other media.

1301
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:59,520
I'm going to link for the chat room an article from Ars Technica that goes into that.

1302
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,400
It's really long, but I thought it was pretty cool.

1303
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,600
They said that they're basically doing a better job than we are.

1304
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,040
Oops.

1305
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,960
No comment?

1306
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,960
I don't know.

1307
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,160
I like to think the game industry is doing a better job than most people give them credit

1308
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,160
for.

1309
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Yeah, I would agree with someone saying that.

1310
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,680
The rating system is broken.

1311
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,840
We all know that.

1312
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,040
We all know the rating system is broken, but the video game system somewhat seems to work.

1313
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,040
M for Mature and T for Teens.

1314
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,080
There's a good distinction there, whereas in the movie world, we have R. Granted, there's

1315
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,720
PG-13, but you can get away with a lot.

1316
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,000
PG and PG-13, it's like it complies together.

1317
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's the same thing.

1318
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,960
Yeah, and R, there's such a vast difference between what is considered R. You have movies

1319
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,920
like what's a really frickin' violent movie that's come out in the past few years?

1320
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,880
I haven't seen it, but I imagine Grindhouse is pretty violent, right?

1321
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,000
So you have Grindhouse on one end of the spectrum, and you have Romy and Michelle's High School

1322
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,440
Reunion is also rated R, because the F word is used a couple times in it.

1323
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,440
Like fuck?

1324
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,600
Yeah, the fuck word is used, like Janine Garofalo is in it.

1325
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
End of story.

1326
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,600
I love Janine Garofalo.

1327
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,600
Who doesn't?

1328
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,160
But the point is that those are very different kinds of movies.

1329
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,800
I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, okay?

1330
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,480
A couple little fucks isn't going to kill them.

1331
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,480
No!

1332
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,840
You hear the word fuck, and you suddenly want to kill people!

1333
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,600
Yeah, but I would not let them watch Terminator 2.

1334
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,600
I would.

1335
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,320
Well, you and I are different.

1336
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,880
Did I saw Terminator 2 in the theater?

1337
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,880
That was awesome.

1338
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,280
Anyway, next email.

1339
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,400
Hey guys, Sesha here.

1340
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,600
I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft, and whether

1341
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,760
it will really matter to them.

1342
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,920
I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may

1343
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,560
be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce

1344
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,320
games these days, so going multiplatform solves that problem.

1345
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,480
Excuse me.

1346
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,120
I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.

1347
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,720
It's just something that I heard, and it makes sense.

1348
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,240
But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multiplatform, do you think this would really affect the

1349
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,520
sales of the PS3, or would it not really matter?

1350
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,240
I'm not so sure myself, and thought I'd ask you guys.

1351
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,720
Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in, and a big shout

1352
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
to Irene.

1353
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,720
Heart.

1354
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
Oh, thank you.

1355
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,720
That was good timing.

1356
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,720
Yeah, she just watched in the room.

1357
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Take care, people.

1358
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,720
Stay fukin' epic.

1359
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,720
Love, Sesha.

1360
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,720
Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.

1361
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,720
No, I'm kidding.

1362
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,720
Hi, Sesha.

1363
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,720
You're hot.

1364
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
I'm gonna go now.

1365
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,720
Bye.

1366
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,720
So?

1367
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,720
Answer?

1368
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:46,600
Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

1369
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:51,080
if it does come to the 360, since more people have a 360.

1370
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,480
But then again, I mean, I don't know.

1371
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:01,760
If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that'd be a big blow to Sony, because it would give

1372
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:09,640
people yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3, because it's like, if you don't have any

1373
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,400
exclusive games, no one's really gonna want- I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive

1374
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:20,600
games with Microsoft, and it may not be something that everybody wants, but it's a lot less

1375
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,240
exclusive games than, say, Sony has right now, and I don't know.

1376
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:31,040
I think it makes perfect sense to go multiplatform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track

1377
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,600
record, though.

1378
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,680
They're definitely ones for exclusive content.

1379
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,680
Not necessarily.

1380
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,920
They used to be like that, but see, now with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're

1381
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,120
releasing games on a bunch of different systems.

1382
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,960
Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation

1383
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,880
3 version, since they're gonna make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.

1384
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,880
Why?

1385
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,820
I don't know, because they haven't milked it enough yet.

1386
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:03,520
I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple-sequel thing

1387
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,840
like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy VII, although even though I think

1388
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:14,560
Final Fantasy V is my favorite of the series, but Final Fantasy VI was, I think, their most

1389
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,240
epic, but Final Fantasy VII is the fan favorite, I think that they're just trying to say, let's

1390
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,040
make this the next Final Fantasy VII and beat it into the ground.

1391
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,280
Probably.

1392
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,540
It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.

1393
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,460
So next email, huh?

1394
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:35,080
This one is from SakuraMaxx, I guess.

1395
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:40,000
By now I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff

1396
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and I am now dead.

1397
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,120
I have two requests.

1398
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,480
Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.

1399
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,320
While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.

1400
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:56,560
I seriously am a dead Tauren and I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter

1401
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,400
of days.

1402
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,920
SakuraMaxx in Deathicus Server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters

1403
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,920
names?

1404
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,400
If you want to find out the character names, go check out-

1405
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Get on forums.

1406
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,680
Yeah, go on the forums, cheat plug.

1407
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:18,480
Also as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.

1408
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,040
I don't know, if someone happens to have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat, who knows,

1409
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,440
maybe one day, but I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube

1410
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,440
vid.

1411
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,400
There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools, go check that out.

1412
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,480
As far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little

1413
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,200
clips and you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro, that's the song we use for the

1414
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,200
outro.

1415
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,360
We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permission, copyright issues,

1416
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,360
blah, blah, blah.

1417
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,360
Then we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.

1418
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,200
Well next email, shall I?

1419
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,200
Sure.

1420
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,200
I have an OLR, it's me, Neki.

1421
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Excuse me.

1422
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Neki's on my Myspace now.

1423
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,840
I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like

1424
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,480
to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.

1425
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,160
Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.

1426
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Oh, thank you.

1427
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,920
I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week and I will have my diploma by the

1428
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,920
weekend.

1429
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,920
Congrats.

1430
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Rad.

1431
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,920
We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.

1432
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,920
Okay.

1433
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,600
Let me read the email.

1434
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,560
Orange Lounge match game coming soon to mobile phones.

1435
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,520
And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they

1436
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,120
should listen to the show when you weren't there, Jamie.

1437
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,120
What?

1438
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,860
Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news

1439
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,860
that week.

1440
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,860
Isn't that every week?

1441
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,240
He was just being lazy that week.

1442
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:48,480
Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week because here's the deal.

1443
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm flying out to Burbank at eight o'clock in the morning, which is why I'm running out

1444
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,240
of the room so much because I'm trying to get my packing done, like laundry and stuff,

1445
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,080
like because I'm literally driving over to get taken to the airport in the morning and

1446
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,080
everything.

1447
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,960
So I'm going to be gone Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then out of some weird twist of fate,

1448
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:11,120
I fly back here on Wednesday just so Thursday I can drive back down to LA with dark soccer

1449
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,120
again.

1450
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,080
And you might be thinking, why didn't you just stay in LA, you dumb ass?

1451
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,120
And truth be told, A, I don't want to pay for a hotel.

1452
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,120
B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found

1453
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,280
out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.

1454
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,280
But it doesn't matter.

1455
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,280
It is what it is.

1456
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,120
I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.

1457
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,120
So it'll be good.

1458
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,600
But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following

1459
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,920
gaming news next week.

1460
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,720
So it's going to be the low-key show.

1461
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,640
Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.

1462
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,200
As you love pinball and Lego, here's a great match, okay?

1463
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,200
There's apparently a pinball.

1464
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,200
Yeah, one that someone made.

1465
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,200
I think there's a logo.

1466
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,200
Oh yeah, the logo pinball.

1467
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,200
The logo pinball.

1468
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
The logo pinball.

1469
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Yeah, we talked about that one.

1470
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,440
That's great.

1471
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:58,600
Maybe it isn't accurate, but as damn useful as it is, and then this is Xbox 360 Regional

1472
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,080
Compatibility Guide.

1473
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,120
So these are games that work on either or both systems.

1474
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,120
That's interesting.

1475
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,740
I didn't even know that was possible.

1476
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:17,600
The website is at xbox-sky.com-xbox360-regional-compatibility-guide.

1477
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,360
And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on, are they talking about

1478
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,360
all regions?

1479
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:31,080
Or just compatible games, because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.

1480
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,880
These are all region.

1481
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
Oh.

1482
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,440
Pretty interesting stuff.

1483
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,160
Maybe a few games are multi-region.

1484
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,800
Far Cry works on both.

1485
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,080
F.E.A.R. works on all three.

1486
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,120
It even is going so far as listing the PAL ones as well.

1487
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,120
That's pretty cool.

1488
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Anyway.

1489
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,120
Thanks for the link.

1490
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,120
That was pretty fun.

1491
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,120
That's weird.

1492
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,840
Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.

1493
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,840
That's kind of weird.

1494
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,600
I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room, unless Rob, you want to do it for

1495
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,600
me?

1496
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,600
Sure, why not?

1497
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Okay.

1498
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,600
R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.

1499
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,360
Okay, he has an HD, but it has some nifty little features.

1500
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:12,440
And this is something on Gizmodo, which I'm not going to link.

1501
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,120
It's a projector that looks like R2-D2, hooray.

1502
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,960
Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into

1503
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,040
it, and the USNCSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website

1504
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,040
I aforementioned.

1505
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,560
I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making

1506
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,400
it 20 gigabyte, and they announced one 20 gigabyte.

1507
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:43,200
Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.

1508
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:50,040
My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced, slash having, I love the phrase

1509
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,520
being serviced, having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will

1510
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,120
be up, quote, soon.

1511
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Nice plug, by the way.

1512
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,400
Yeah, he's saying, yeah, I got my site in.

1513
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,960
Anyways, bye, Necky.

1514
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,040
I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.

1515
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,040
No.

1516
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,040
I like Necky.

1517
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,040
Cool.

1518
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Last email.

1519
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Dun, dun, dun.

1520
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,040
Hey, guys.

1521
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,400
Love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered,

1522
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,320
I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety

1523
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,000
of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school,

1524
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,360
work, convention, or at a concert, simply how many people do you estimate listen to

1525
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,360
your show?

1526
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
End of sentence.

1527
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
Thank you very much.

1528
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Kurt Peters.

1529
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Kurt's somebody who I'm not going to say the last name.

1530
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:39,720
Sorry, I was going to say real quick, it looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan

1531
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:48,040
of, you know, soccer or football, but you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.

1532
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,960
Both will work on the U.S. Xbox 360s.

1533
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,960
That's kind of neat.

1534
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Huh.

1535
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,960
Except it's in PAL.

1536
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,400
But I'm sure if your TV, you know, is an HD standard?

1537
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,600
Yeah, HD's pretty standard, so.

1538
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,140
As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest, we don't track

1539
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,280
it very well.

1540
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,840
We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed, but we've never really

1541
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,320
been about the numbers, because honestly, during the first, you know, couple of years

1542
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,320
of Orange and L'Andrea, for a long time, I'll say the very first show we did for 12 people,

1543
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,680
13 people, and you couldn't download the show.

1544
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,920
And most of us were in the same room, ha ha.

1545
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,920
Yeah, ha ha.

1546
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,600
So that was mostly it, but we did the show back then and continue to do the show now,

1547
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,360
even now, even though, you know, we got bigger thanks to podcasting, just because, you know,

1548
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,480
Dark Soccer, Loki and I need an excuse to hang out every week, and, you know, this is

1549
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,480
fun.

1550
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,920
I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.

1551
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,240
You know what I mean, though.

1552
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,040
You know, it is an excuse in the end.

1553
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,040
Yeah, yeah.

1554
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,040
Heart, heart, heart.

1555
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
Making little hearts.

1556
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,040
So, I don't know.

1557
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,060
Do you need a good excuse to hang out with Loki?

1558
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:59,820
So in the beginning, in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.

1559
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,680
I would, I'm going to lowball it.

1560
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,320
I don't, I don't know.

1561
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,320
It's kind of weird.

1562
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:10,920
Like, you know, I don't know if we should say, it's kind of, it's just, it's not important.

1563
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,920
Is it really important?

1564
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,920
I don't think it is.

1565
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,920
No.

1566
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:14,920
No, no.

1567
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,920
I'll say this.

1568
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:16,920
It's, it's, it's four digits.

1569
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,600
It's somewhere, it's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.

1570
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,520
We'll leave it there.

1571
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,520
On the lower end.

1572
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,520
All right.

1573
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
That's it for the emails.

1574
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
All right.

1575
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,520
Yay.

1576
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:35,040
Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned

1577
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,840
it last week a little bit.

1578
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:42,840
Spring Update's going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360, including instant messaging

1579
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,040
via Windows Messenger.

1580
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,440
And that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller.

1581
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:55,760
But you're going to be able to message people while playing games, and also while watching

1582
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,680
movies, and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list

1583
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,920
as well, which is kind of nifty.

1584
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:11,960
And some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for

1585
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:22,720
some different video codecs, like MPEG4, H.264, and Play for Sure, which is kind of neat.

1586
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:28,440
Yeah, but no XVID and DivX support yet, so.

1587
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,520
But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and you know, that's awesome.

1588
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,880
I like that they're adding stuff instead of, I don't know, removing functionality.

1589
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,320
Like back groups compatibility in PlayStation 3.

1590
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,040
Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message

1591
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,400
people on MSN?

1592
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,620
I know I won't.

1593
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,360
I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.

1594
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:57,800
You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.

1595
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,440
But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.

1596
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,280
Usually that takes concentration, you know?

1597
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,440
How about this, Rob, switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.

1598
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,160
You can do letterbox, zoom, stretch, and native, since you've lost your time.

1599
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,320
I didn't lose the remote.

1600
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,480
Somebody lost the remote, but it wasn't me, because it happened while I was on vacation.

1601
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,080
But we won't go there.

1602
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,880
Let's see, what else?

1603
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,280
Oh, this is kind of cool.

1604
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,440
The whole downloading stuff, where you can download in the background, you can also set

1605
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:38,560
your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in like

1606
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,320
a low power mode.

1607
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,840
Like a PC.

1608
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:52,440
It says, a new option in auto downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access

1609
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,600
to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.

1610
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,480
That's kind of nifty.

1611
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,920
The Rob Dean chant is taunting me, because I always decline his Hold'em invites.

1612
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,360
I feel bad.

1613
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,640
This one's kind of cool.

1614
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,640
Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games

1615
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:19,680
their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they

1616
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,880
can boast about their achievement scores.

1617
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,680
Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.

1618
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,840
I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.

1619
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,840
Hooray.

1620
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,600
That's going to be fun.

1621
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
That's...

1622
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,600
Yeah.

1623
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,960
God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.

1624
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,400
You're not an ass, Rob.

1625
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,960
I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes to play Texas Hold'em with us.

1626
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:53,000
GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that you guys play on Friday

1627
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,360
and Saturday night.

1628
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
That's clubbing night.

1629
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,320
You don't go clubbing anymore.

1630
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,000
Once in a great while, I do.

1631
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,720
I want to go.

1632
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,280
Well, we can sometime.

1633
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,280
Okay.

1634
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,120
Well, how about this?

1635
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,960
We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?

1636
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,960
I'm just teasing.

1637
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,960
We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.

1638
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,960
That'll be fun.

1639
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,960
Yeah, we do.

1640
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,240
Anyhow, back to games.

1641
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,800
You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.

1642
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Wouldn't that be fun?

1643
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,280
People would still laugh at you.

1644
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,280
I would, yeah.

1645
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,280
Talk about looking like an ass.

1646
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,800
Anyway, last week on the show, I rammed and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar

1647
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,800
was broken.

1648
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,720
Although, well, you know, it did work.

1649
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
It would play the game.

1650
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,880
I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.

1651
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,400
You could fix them, by the way.

1652
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Yeah, but here's the thing.

1653
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,600
Now you don't have to.

1654
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,880
Apparently, Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.

1655
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,720
They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m. that will resolve the situation where

1656
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,080
input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.

1657
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,400
Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.

1658
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,680
And guess what else it does?

1659
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,680
It breaks consoles, supposedly.

1660
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,680
It freezes your game.

1661
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,680
I don't know.

1662
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,980
There's reports on the internet, something to sit and dig, like all these people's consoles

1663
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:09,400
are getting bricked and don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence or if the patch

1664
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
did something.

1665
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
Uh-oh.

1666
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,400
It really is calibration.

1667
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,120
That's what it was.

1668
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:19,880
And I mean, I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing.

1669
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,360
They put hot glue in the screws.

1670
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,320
So I can't, I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy

1671
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,720
bar to adjust it.

1672
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,520
Thank you very much.

1673
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,840
You bastards.

1674
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
How dare they?

1675
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,840
Well, here's something that we started asking why they dare, since a lot of people are not

1676
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,200
too very fond of the first one, although I thought it was cool.

1677
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:51,320
There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.

1678
01:22:51,320 --> 01:23:03,240
In the May edition of the official Xbox Magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually

1679
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:08,760
in progress and that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it, but right now it's rumor

1680
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,920
mill fodder.

1681
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:10,920
Book tie-ins?

1682
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,920
Joy.

1683
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,920
I'm sorry.

1684
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,160
Wait, what game's getting a sequel?

1685
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,160
Perfect Dark Zero.

1686
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,160
Dark.

1687
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:22,080
Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

1688
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,280
I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.

1689
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,800
This show needs a sound board.

1690
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,920
Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where

1691
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,240
we actually have normal jumps.

1692
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,640
I like the super jumps.

1693
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,640
I like being able to fly.

1694
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,640
I like jumping!

1695
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,640
Yay, jumping!

1696
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:50,680
This week, Capcom has had their Gamers' Day, although we weren't invited, and they announced

1697
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,560
a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the

1698
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,840
PlayStation Network, including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about,

1699
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:06,240
including Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, which is a fucking long-ass name and

1700
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
stupid.

1701
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,240
Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter II game with a longer title.

1702
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,400
I mean, I think that's the joke.

1703
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:17,800
I think that's seriously a joke, like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter II game name.

1704
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,960
Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max!

1705
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,960
Extreme!

1706
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,960
Lame.

1707
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,960
Okay, that's lame.

1708
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,100
Lame, lame, lame.

1709
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:32,000
But anyways, it is coming eventually to both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade,

1710
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,480
and yeah.

1711
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,840
Hooray.

1712
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:41,200
Another thing that's getting an even longer title, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

1713
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,800
Now that's cool.

1714
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,800
It's cool, but it's still a ret-

1715
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,800
For matching service?

1716
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,280
Just call it Puzzle Fighter, god damn it.

1717
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,400
Don't need the Super Puzzle Fighter II Remix HD Super Duper.

1718
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,400
It's Capcom.

1719
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,800
Wasn't that in our match game a couple, like didn't we do a match game like just like three

1720
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,000
weeks ago here on the show about like what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came

1721
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
up?

1722
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Yeah, probably.

1723
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,400
That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.

1724
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,680
I do want Puzzle Fighter.

1725
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,680
That's awesome.

1726
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,680
I'll buy it.

1727
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,680
It's awesome.

1728
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,680
Hell yeah.

1729
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,680
I heard they're adding new modes and stuff too.

1730
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,280
That they're going to have like a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.

1731
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,280
Well the better-

1732
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,280
Wait a minute.

1733
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,800
The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo actually, think about it.

1734
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,680
There was also, what was the other game, Panel de Pawn, which I think-

1735
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,680
Puzzle de Pawn.

1736
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,240
Oh, Puzzle de Pawn, which is, I think is Pokemon Puzzle League, if I remember right.

1737
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,240
Nope.

1738
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,240
It's basically that game.

1739
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,240
Is it?

1740
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,240
Puzzle de Pawn is Bust the Move.

1741
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,240
What?

1742
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,600
That's Puzzle Bobble.

1743
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,600
No?

1744
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,600
Puzzle Bobble.

1745
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,120
Yeah, Panda's a eucalyptus.

1746
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,120
I believe her.

1747
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,320
Puzzle Bobble is Bust the Move.

1748
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,640
Well, I will look it up right now.

1749
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,640
I know my title.

1750
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,920
Puzzle de Pawn is exactly the same game.

1751
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,080
I'm sure somebody in chat is correct with us right now.

1752
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,080
I want to have a version of-

1753
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,620
I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to-

1754
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,620
I'll be damned.

1755
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,620
He's right.

1756
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,760
It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.

1757
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,840
No, but it was Panel de Pawn.

1758
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,840
Is it Panel de Pawn?

1759
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,400
It's Puzzle de Pawn.

1760
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
Who cares?

1761
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,000
I used to play this game all the time when I was-

1762
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,840
You know what game I would love to bring out a version of over here?

1763
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:10,840
It's Puzzle and Desu.

1764
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,840
It's Panel de Pawn.

1765
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,720
It's got to be this game.

1766
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,800
That makes much more sense.

1767
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,040
It's Tetris Attack, Pokemon Puzzle League.

1768
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,440
That game makes more sense.

1769
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,240
That game makes more sense to have in there.

1770
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,240
All right.

1771
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,240
It's Panel de Pawn.

1772
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,240
My bad.

1773
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,600
I still want Puzzle and Desu.

1774
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:32,760
One last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Axis of Evil, and Talisman.

1775
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,960
It's basically this universe that they've created.

1776
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:42,760
It's very similar, like Robotron crossed with, they were saying, Geometry Wars.

1777
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,560
They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays, but anyways, it's going to be a

1778
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,440
top-down shooter game.

1779
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up,

1780
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,960
so awesome.

1781
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,800
Let's come in Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1782
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:05,480
Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed

1783
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,000
at Capcom Gamer's Day.

1784
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,720
It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, and of course, there's a little trailer that

1785
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,880
goes with it that you can see on the internet.

1786
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,480
Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.

1787
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,000
I saw a little glimpse of it, and I believe it goes back to one time.

1788
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,040
The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court, so whatever.

1789
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,480
There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there that'll be very happy about this.

1790
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,760
I still have somehow missed the first game, so this is one of those series, like you know

1791
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,920
how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't

1792
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,940
have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?

1793
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,940
This is one of those games.

1794
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:42,940
Okay, question for you.

1795
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:43,940
What?

1796
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:48,740
How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it,

1797
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,120
you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?

1798
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,080
Dude, I hope so.

1799
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,240
Also, if you can't get enough attorney games, hey, wait for this.

1800
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:05,400
Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP, so not the new

1801
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,800
stuff, but the old console's feeling a little love there.

1802
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,840
Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and he defends famous cartoon characters,

1803
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,720
so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to

1804
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:25,640
get other licenses to get like, you know, but I guess they just won't have any of the

1805
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,680
other cartoon characters in the game.

1806
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,720
They'll just have his own stuff, original stuff.

1807
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,720
I don't know.

1808
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,960
Either way, fans of Adult Swim will be very happy.

1809
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,160
And of course, other stuff that they were showing, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, and

1810
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:45,160
Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which I heard was pretty lame.

1811
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,720
Drunami being the Phoenix Wright fan, well, he hasn't been on the show in a while.

1812
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,720
What the hell gives Drunami?

1813
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,000
Do you not love us anymore?

1814

1822
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,240
We tape here live on Sunday night, and we have to give ourselves a little break.

1823
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,340
We got to stretch, go to the bathroom, all that good stuff.

1824
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,500
So while we take a break here, you guys listening to the podcast just have to wait a couple

1825
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,200
days because we like to space it out.

1826
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,960
That way you get a lot of Orange Lawn's Radio all week long.
