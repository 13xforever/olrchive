Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April 15, 2007.
Happy Tax Day to you.
And if you're thinking, gosh, my taxes were long due.
I'm actually listening on the 19th, the 20th.
That's because you've downloaded probably our audio archive, also known as podcasting.
Well, Lauren's Launch Radio, we tape here live on Sunday nights and roll out our show in two parts.
Or if you want to hear it, you know, even before it's on the podcast, you want to hear parts A and B together, you can always listen to our syndicated run on allgames.com.
Monday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, or actually 5.30, usually though they run late into 6 o'clock.
So just kind of be listening around 5.30.
Pacific Standard Time, or 9 a.m.
on Tuesdays, Pacific Time.
You can hear parts A and B back-to-back through our buddies at allgames.com.
All right, let's get into some gaming news to talk about.
So, let's start it off.
We need our Death March to play, Rob.
Why?
We need it playing.
That's all I got.
Although, for a moment, I thought you were going to play the Imperial March from Star Wars.
That was kind of cool.
Anyway... Unfortunately, I only have the one... No, I don't even have that.
I have...
Death to PlayStation 3.
The 20 gigabyte model is kaput.
It will no longer be offered to retailers for sale in North America, so saith Sony.
Basically, the consumer market said, we like the 60 gigabyte one because the 20 gig one just completely blows my ass.
So, they are not putting any more effort into the 20.
However, I don't know if that's going to make it all this special thing.
So, it lasted six months.
Loki, you own one of these, right?
Yes, I do.
And it's just as good as the fucking 60 gig because there's nothing on their download store to actually put on there.
And it's not very easy to get videos on there.
And do I really need wireless internet when it's sitting less than two feet away from a router?
Probably not.
It has a 60.
Well, Loki has like a collector's item now because, you know, those 20 gigs are going to be super rare now.
And do I need the fucking silver, you know, the silver, like,
Molding or whatever the fuck you want to call it on there.
A little pinstripe, whatever.
Now that's the rare one now.
I'm fucking awesome, yeah.
Suck that, folks.
It's more like they're admitting that the 20 gig is no longer available.
It hasn't been available for months now.
This was something that happened I want to say around January.
Well, since you all found out you can't order one
It's nice that they're finally copping to that stuff.
Anyways, so some other fun stuff.
Let's see here.
Sony is trying to get in on the wireless kind of handheld input devices, very similar to the Wii now.
And not exactly copying the Wii, but it's a little similar to, say, the Power Glove.
They are patenting a handheld computer interactive device, which does look very similar to a power glove.
And it's supposed to have tactile feedback as well as being used for, I don't know, games and stuff.
Virtual objects where you can pick stuff up and whatnot.
I don't know.
I think it looks kind of cool.
And I don't really give a crap if it's a rip-off of Nintendo or whatever.
At this point, who cares?
Just make it...
Long as it doesn't suck like the eye toy did, I'm all for it.
So it's a glove?
Yeah, it's like a little... So like the power glove?
It's not really like the power glove.
It looks like a glove that you put on and you have little finger spots and a spot for your thumb.
And in the middle, there's like... I don't know if it's something that'll cause it to tighten up or rumble or something, but supposedly allowing you to kind of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That thing was awesome.
Yeah, but it would actually feel like there was one where you were knocking the pool balls together and it actually felt like you were kind of knocking the pool balls together.
So it kind of sounds like that to me, like Sony ripped that off.
Well, here's what it's also going to allow you to do.
It says they're going to allow you to capture hand movements through use of an external input device configured by the user, capturing other movements including the degree of bending figures.
So you can flip off the thing and it will know that.
I think it'd be kind of cool to be able to use that to wave at people at home and stuff.
Means for transmitting the captured hand movements to a device, blah blah blah.
Tactile feedback.
And means for displaying graphic images associated with commands.
So yeah, it's basically going to be like VR gloves.
Hooray.
I have one thing to say about that.
What?
It's so bad.
Anyhow, I don't know if this is bad or good or what, but the semi-official blog Three Speech from Sony has talked about some upcoming PlayStation 3 games.
Sounds like a lot of them are pegged for September.
Quote, that's when we'll see Heavenly Sword, the ultra-responsive arena-based sword fighting game, innovative dragon fighting game Lair, and the air, foot, and vehicle combat game Warhawk, which is still looking likely to be released over the PlayStation Network rather than the shops.
First-person shooter Killzone 2 should also surface in September.
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
and Sony has confirmed that the only game on the list that has a confirmed US date is Lair.
That's set for July.
So the Three Speech blog may be talking about things from the Europe's perspective, but not necessarily ours.
Lair, I know that's been talked about as a July title.
Same with Warhawk.
Warhawk's been a July title for a while.
But then again, it's kind of morphed into really different things than before, so who knows when that's coming out.
I hope they don't wait that long, because they don't have any exclusives between now and September, if that's the case.
Well, it should also be noted that 3 Speech said something about Bioshock on the PlayStation 3, but that was actually taken down with a notice put up saying, there is currently no indication that Bioshock will come out on the PlayStation 3.
Oops, we're talking out of our ass.
Well, talk out of your ass, everything sounds like a... What was the quote from...
Clerks and Oral Bowel Movement.
I really don't know.
Well, I have some good news.
At least this is good for me.
They have announced LocoRoco for PS3.
I think that's great because LocoRoco is pretty damn fun.
The tentative sale date is June 23, 2007.
And there actually is a notice saying that the...
Sony Europe site's supposed to already be up.
So I'm going to personally think of it as rumor, because it didn't really do all that great in Japan on PSP, but if it's coming out over here, oh hell yeah, I love LocoRoco.
The game is just fucked up.
Of course they're going to jump on an opportunity to actually
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's coming out anyways.
So, starting off on PlayStation 2.
Raiden 3 is finally making its way out.
And that's, of course, the arcade shooter game.
Tokyo Extreme Racer Drift 2.
I know the first one really blew.
Hopefully this one's not so bad.
PC port of the plan.
And that's coming to PlayStation 2 as well.
It didn't look very good.
Eureka 7 Vol.
2, the new wave.
I believe that's the new wave.
Anyways, Eureka 7 Volume 2, RPG game, looks okay.
Red Star, that old acclaimed game that's been in development forever, and now it's finally making its way out on PlayStation 2.
On the PSP, we have Halo Knights, finally making its way out.
As well as Pocket Pool, that semi-porn billiards game.
And let's see here.
Nothing on the 360 at all, so hooray.
Nothing on PlayStation 3.
And let's see here, as far as PC stuff goes, a game called Tropics.
And let's see here, Mission Blackhawk and Mission Combat Force.
And a game called Made Man, which got horrible reviews.
Finally, on the Wii, we've got Bust a Move Bash, a pretty neat puzzle game.
Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario
FateStayNight
Rialta Nua
Coco Host Boo is coming out in Japan.
That's an anime, Iran High School Club something.
Little Roses and little girly men.
Yeah, it's a really fucked up little anime.
Alright, well, if you want the little fucked up game that goes with it, it's coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week.
Also on the Nintendo DS, let's see, what are you getting over there?
Gouken Alice, Waku Waku Happy Friends.
Wifi Tau, Senkai No Dare Demo PSP
Final Fantasy 5 Advance for GBA Good game.
God of War 2 on PlayStation 2.
We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP.
The Red Star.
You know, I'm actually, I'm really thinking I'm going to get that game.
After playing it at E3 a while back, I thought it was pretty fun.
Capcom Puzzle World on PSP.
Cube on PSP.
Diddy Kong Racing DS.
Free Running on PSP.
Hard Rock Casino PlayStation 2 on PSP.
SOCOM US Navy SEALS Fireteam Bravo 2 PSP.
And Tony Hawk's Project 8 on PSP.
Sweet.
Yep.
Anyways, back into the news here.
Of course, we've got some interesting stuff, I know, coming out.
And, of course, one thing that's been confirmed to be coming out, and I'm sure this is not a surprise to anybody, but according to Red Octane's site, there was a response to, I believe, an inquiry, and they were talking about PlayStation 3.
And it says...
Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 3 is headed for the Playstation 2 Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii and it's supposed to be coming out fall 2007 so there you go, yet another release and interesting and according to apparently there was it's been removed from the website as well because we didn't realize that there's another Guitar Hero game coming out this year
After all, there are some... Was it the 80s edition coming out later this year?
Who knows what else they'll throw in there.
Not a big surprise.
It's funny we haven't heard much on Guitar Hero 80s edition besides that little tidbit you found a couple weeks ago.
It's weird.
You don't think we would have heard more about it by now?
No.
You think they might push it back?
Yeah.
I already know that.
Oh, okay.
Alright then.
Let's see, moving on.
If you're a fan of music games, then you probably like Owen Don as well.
So we know he hears Elite Beat Agents.
And Owen Don 2.
is coming out in Japan on May 17th, is what the Rumblings are saying, is that the game's coming out quite possibly that soon.
Some early song lists are leaking out there on the internet.
Shonen Heart, Bang Bang, I Believe, Real Life, Real Heart, Zenryoku Shonen, Oh My Julia, Go My Way, Popstar, and somebody actually, I think Shane made us watch this YouTube, the artist is Hiraiken Popstar.
It's, um, one of the cheesiest songs I've ever heard in my life.
So, but it'll probably make for a fun song on Elite Beat Agents, or as they know it in Japan, Oh and Don.
So, those of you import game fans are probably looking forward to that one.
I actually think that, uh, I might definitely pick that one up, except I haven't, you know, picked up the other one either.
But anyway.
Now this makes me, um, also particularly happy.
Excuse me.
Sorry, allergies.
Anyway, um, there is, um, uh,
Talk that there may be a second Parappa the Rapper.
Well, not second, because there's already a second, but one sequel to Parappa the Rapper 2.
Nanon Shah has been quoted saying, we're also working on the next in the series of our hit game for all the family.
And they said, yeah, that one.
So they're apparently talking about Parappa.
I like Parappa.
Am I the only one that's not excited about this?
I think this is kind of retarded.
I'm not excited.
Exactly, someone that can eat glass or something like that, or like, throw baby a mile or something like that.
Genetic oddities, those are great.
That is something, that's a record, you know, but somebody that's like, I have the high score DDR, and you know that's gonna be in there.
Isn't that what leaderboards are for?
I thought this is what fucking Twin Galaxies is for.
Twin Galaxies has the fucking bizarre one, though.
So, I don't know, it's kind of lame.
Eternal Sonata Eternal Sonata is what they're calling it over here
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's great.
Way to go.
Yeah, with an RPG.
I'm just going to play it all the way through in one sitting.
Leave the system on.
That's awesome.
I didn't even catch that.
There's no, oh my god, no hard drive and no memory card.
Brilliant.
Good job.
That's lovely.
Well, what else is brilliant is DarkSakura surfing the internet all week long at work, actually.
That's all she does.
No, but she finds her favorite websites and she comes on this program and shares them with you.
And it's a little segment we call DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
And where should the boys and girls be pointing their browsers to this week, DarkSakura?
The Website of the Week is IkenHouseCheeseburger.com, which is like a Saturday site.
I just, I love it.
I visited the site, I didn't get it.
I thought it was cute.
It's I can has cheese and cheeseburgers spelled C-H-E-E-Z-B-U-R-G-E-R.
I can has cheeseburger.com.
The first one is a delightful little piece of a small dinosaur held by a string over a kitten with the caption, Do not want.
There's also one of a, it looks like a chihuahua wearing a Dolphy wig.
It says, I love scotch.
Here it goes down, down into my bellies.
I was just like, hooray, another cat sight from Jamie.
No, there's dogs on here, too.
But I love Catterday, so... There's a little puppy making us sad faces.
Ate all the cheeseburger.
Frowning face.
DarkTetsuya is posting his favorite.
DarkTetsuya is posting from I Can Ask Cheeseburger, the entry on April 13th.
Princess in another castle.
Sorry.
I guess the cat's worried.
There's one of the cat with a Wiimote in his lap saying, I can please has walkthrough.
So, they don't.
iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com iCanHasCheeseburger.com Alright, check it out, boys and girls.
The official Dark Sakura stamp of approval.
Okay.
Some interesting stuff.
If you're looking to try some games out, there's been some demos that have come out on live recently.
Some that you might not be excited about, some that are kind of cool, including Shrek the Third, which just came out.
Hooray.
One that actually looked kind of interesting and I haven't gotten to play it yet, Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia is now out on Xbox Live, and Lil Birdie is also telling me that Command & Conquer 3 is supposed to be out on Tuesday, so that'll be pretty awesome as well.
Look for it.
Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Prince of Persia, if a German rating site is to be believed.
Sort of like we have the ESRB, they have the USK, and apparently they are looking at Prince of Persia Classic.
For the record, it got a 12 plus years age rating.
But that would be, you know, since there's new Prince of Persia, isn't there a new game coming out somewhat soon?
and Not Too Distant Future.
Yeah, they're supposed to be doing one for like the 360 or something.
So it would kind of make sense since, you know, they want to probably do this as a tie-in.
By the way, speaking of Prince of Persia, I was tipped off in chat, TigerClaw sent me a PM and let me know that apparently the Prince of Persia movie we've earlier spoken about on this show now has a director attached, Michael Bay.
So as long as he doesn't screw up Transformers, I suppose we'll be looking forward to Prince of Persia.
But if he does screw up Transformers, Brimstone and Fire will rain down upon him.
Yes.
Fire and Brimstone, two of my favorite, favorite things ever.
Speaking of fiery things, you know, dragons do a lot of fire, and this isn't, though, about a dragon.
Anyway, Panzer Dragoon, though, is going on to GameTap.
GameTap can do Saturn games.
Isn't that great?
But it's actually, also, in addition to Panzer Dragoon, we get Panzer Dragoon's Vi heading out.
Now, I'm sorry, as awesome as those are, we need Panzer Dragoon RPG.
Or as it was called, God, why can't I, because Panzer Dragoon Orto was the Dreamcast one.
It's a start, Jamie, Jesus.
I know, but Panzer Dragoon RPG was just, like, fucking beautiful.
You know, I have that game on Saturn.
Here, have a cheeseburger.
I have that game.
You have a cheeseburger game?
No.
Bite my butt.
I have a... I actually do have BurgerTime.
Does that count?
Dude, BurgerTime's awesome.
They have BurgerTime on GameTap.
That's all you need.
The Panzer Dragoon RPG is just like... And, and, and, and, and... Super BurgerTime on GameTap.
I know.
I didn't even fucking know there was a Super BurgerTime until I logged into GameTap once, and I was like, they have Super BurgerTime?
What is this?
We have Sega Love now.
What is this?
Sega...
Sega and GameTap are kind of in bed together a little bit.
Good, they can keep fucking all they want to as long as I reap the benefits.
Alright, so be it.
You don't want to talk about that.
Do not want!
Exactly.
You might want, though, Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta.
It's coming out now, May 16th.
And it will be live for three weeks, ending on June 6th.
To which the entire internet responded,
3 WEEKS!
WEEE!
and let's see what else.
New guns, vehicles, gameplay features including the mysterious X button which by the way has been spoiled and it's just an equipment button.
So no magical shit, it just drops like a bubble shield or mine or something like that.
Who fucking cares?
Whatever.
Anyways, some other features, new grenade types, different classes of weapons, yadda yadda yadda.
So, bye Crackdown, if you haven't yet
TripMinds.
It's going to be interesting.
It's going to add a whole new element to the game.
But they swear it will not be something that's exploitable.
It's something that's going to be limited.
All that functionality.
So we'll see.
Lord knows I could use a shield when I'm playing Halo because I get shot in the face all the time when I'm playing Halo.
I don't like it.
Shot in the face is fun.
Not really.
Not if it's you.
It's getting shot.
I don't get shot in the face.
But...
Pac-Man vs. is going to the Nintendo DS by way of the Namco Museum.
Isn't that cool?
For anyone who doesn't know, Pac-Man vs. was where you played on your portable systems as the ghosts hunting down Pac-Man.
while you had your Pac-Man controller playing on the main screen.
I thought it was the other way around.
I thought it was that the ghosts were split on the screen and the one person had Pac-Man on the Game Boy Advance.
I never played it.
The ghosts were split on the screen, that's right.
It was Pac-Man that was on the Game Boy.
You know what I meant.
Pac-Man could see everything going on.
But I thought it was funny because it was actually really loud when people would play it at my house.
Was it fun?
Yeah, it's fun.
It's pretty fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Do you get to play Wi-Fi over the internet?
That would be kind of funny if you could play Pac-Man versus on Wi-Fi.
Probably not.
All right.
Well, we're starting to get late into the show, and we still have not done this segment.
And I don't know.
For some reason, putting this segment after a story about the Namco Arcade Collection seemed appropriate.
So it's time to bring on the pain in our FUs of the week.
DarkSakura, what's your bitch this week?
Um, I have a rash.
That's it.
That's it?
F you to your rash?
F you to my rash.
Where is your rash?
Is it in a private place?
Or is it in a place where I can see it?
No questions asked.
It's on my back.
Ah, on her back.
Okay, well that works.
But, um, it's obviously an allergic reaction or something.
because whenever I have a rash that's an allergic reaction, it gets bloody.
Ew.
So yeah, I'm going to the dermatologist hopefully next week.
That'll be fun.
Loki!
Uh... God, I had an FU earlier.
I don't know.
Got nothing that really fits off that.
I'm hungry.
FU to hunger?
FU to world hunger?
No, it's my hunger.
Uh...
I'm going to say I also F you to the fact that I ate all that Pocky.
That's going to make me fat.
F you to the freaking aquarium.
If you listen to the bonus segment live tonight or on all games, it doesn't go to the podcast.
You're going to be talking about my aquarium I bought.
And it killed one of my fish.
So F you to the filter on the aquarium that killed my fish not even eight hours after I bought it.
Bastard filter.
Bastard aquarium.
Bastard meme for probably buying the wrong type of fish for it, but the guy at PetSmart said it would work.
So F you to PetSmart.
That's it.
Those were nice short FUs this week.
Yes.
Good times.
We will open up the Skype line very soon, but we have one more story here from Loki.
Yes, and this kind of ties into something we were making fun of last week or joking around about.
I don't even remember what the hell the conversation was, but apparently there is...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Help comes in the form of makeup.
In-game currency is used to purchase goods at a cosmetic store.
The heroine is even able to consult with the shop staff.
There are many games in which a would-be queen can win currency to buy makeup.
A Wi-Fi connection can be enabled so the items can be exchanged with friends and players and so you can do each other's makeup.
I want this game because it sounds so stupid.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'll get you a miniature koi.
Ah, we'll see.
Let's get Rob a piranha.
That'd be cool.
Let's see.
TheRobD says, of course, if this is Japanese made, this will sell like hotcakes in Japan.
Talking about the makeup game.
GamingNerd says, this sounds like a Sky game.
LOL.
What?
Because I'm gay?
Dude, I don't do makeup and stuff.
That's gay.
Rocky's different.
That's theater.
I don't even really do makeup at Rocky.
Let's see.
Gaming Nerd also goes on to say, Makeup games sell more copies than even GTA.
Oh my god, video games are no longer violent.
Interesting.
Hi, we can hear you.
Let's see.
Bandit in chat says, As long as Saved by the Bell is never remade again, then we all win.
There we go.
And Zach liked fatties.
Sigh.
I like to smoke them.
All right, let's open up the Skype line.
If you would like to call our little program and chat with us, we have a lot of time tonight.
We have extra time.
We should have done a game tonight.
I don't have anything prepped, though.
Oh, well.
We'll take extra calls, I guess, if there's folks that actually want to call us.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Good evening, this is DMN Yes
I actually think that Nintendo, to try to put a marketing spin on the Wii to improve the demand for it, is purposefully holding back those Wiis.
So they're purposefully holding back, you think?
I do.
The big talk around wherever I am is, where's the Wiis?
Where's the Wiis?
Nintendo's trying to create that spin so when they come out, people will want to get them even more.
And if that
I think it's stupid.
They should be having those readily available to the public because if they want to win that console war, they need to sell more systems.
Especially financially, they need to sell two systems for every one of Sony's PS3s.
and they need to sell three systems to every two, I believe, for the Xbox 360.
Yeah, but that's not necessarily true because they're making a profit off each system whereas everybody else is in the hole when they sell systems.
That is true.
Owned by Loki.
And also with the release of Super Paper Mario, which has been a highly anticipated title, I'm surprised Nintendo, you know, has released this game and, you know, the Wii's are still not readily available.
Well, I mean, I don't know.
I would think that there's no point to making a shortage now.
You don't hear about people going on shopping crazes during the spring or the summer.
I don't know.
Usually you hear this kind of stuff around Christmas.
But even then it would be stupid to do it around Christmas because then that's when you make your most money.
So I don't get the point of a forced shortage.
I just don't understand it.
Maybe I don't know enough about economics.
My economics teacher from high school needs to call in and explain this to me.
What?
That's just my defense on the matter.
All right.
Anything else?
What's up on STFU this week?
We didn't have a show last week and the week before I wasn't on, so everybody has to suffer because I'm back this week.
Congrats.
What are you giggling about?
Why are there giggling girls over there?
I forget a safe word.
I don't get it.
Bye.
Oh, oh.
Oh, I thought it was a nice safe word.
It's a couple of cats wrapped up in cords and it says, I forget it's a safe word.
Um, yeah.
Hi, John.
Hi, Jamie.
No, that was Rice Princess that just tipped in here to say hi.
Oh, hi, Irene.
She's running out of the room crying.
Alright, they gotta go anyway.
Oh, I better go call her and comfort her then.
Oh, ooh, really now?
Um, gotta go, bye.
You're always going on trips to some DDR tournament somewhere.
What was going on at 8 on the break?
Was there a tourney or something?
No, a massive mid-Atlantic meetup and a pretty large in-the-group tournament as well.
But yeah, I just hoard up 2DX and whatnot.
But yeah, I don't get why Activision does, you know, does wonderful things to your 360, case in point, breaking it after, with that new Guitar Hero 2 patch that just came out.
So basically, if you want the, I mean, I don't get it, if you want the whammy bar fixed, you're gonna have to go through an arm and a leg, and what, almost $100 more just to get your 360 repaired after breaking it.
I am afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 again.
Luckily, I won't have to for a week, so maybe it'll give time for this whole thing to get resolved because I'm going to be gone for a while.
But I'm afraid to play Guitar Hero 2 because of my 360 bricks.
I'm going to be so mad because I know when I call Microsoft, now they want you to pay to get it fixed.
I'm going to go off the deep end on some poor customer service rep who doesn't deserve it.
Think about it, Ren.
Yeah, I understand that, but you know it's like 9 out of every 10 Xbox 360s got bricked after the update?
That's a staggering number.
Nine out of every ten?
Yeah, that's bullshit.
Yeah, somebody's pointing that out here.
A 90% brick rate, though.
It says something about a 90% brick rate.
A 90% brick rate?
Come on, if that were happening, it would be on the NBC nightly news.
No, but only for the people who actually download it who have Guitar Hero 2, which is probably not... It doesn't represent the entire user base at all.
Yeah, that's bullshit.
I'm telling you, those leaderboards for Guitar Hero 2 have like hundreds of thousands of people on them right now.
Thank you for watching!
Oh, I'm sure it was.
Or was it way long into development, even before the release of the first one?
I want to know.
How the fuck does a calibration-changing patch brick one 360, let alone 10% or whatever the actual number is, 1%?
How does it brick one 360?
I have no idea.
All I know is that, I mean, it could happen any time.
It's basically like death.
It's completely unrelated.
is like, you know, the odds of dying in a car accident.
Okay.
You know, they're much higher than actually dying of terrorism.
What?
Okay, shut up.
Knock it off.
Listen, here's why this crap is going on.
Because people are fucking stupid when it comes to this shit.
That's why you get people saying, oh, 90% of the consoles are breaking after.
No, it's because people are ill-informed and because their system crashes after this update.
That's why I have a 360 form, though, so you can't blame me for that.
No, it might be that your system died.
Alright, I just saw it on the 360 forums that, you know, from other people are experiencing the same issue.
Yeah, but one person... Having to shell out hundreds of dollars to replace it.
Yeah, but one person has their system crashed and then another person's like, well, mine is crashed recently too.
It must be because of Guitar Hero.
And then other people, my friend's system crashed too.
I dropped my Xbox 360 in the bathtub and now it's broken and it's all because of Guitar Hero.
Well, that
I just want to take a bath in my 360.
I don't either.
and so on.
Well, people are saying that their fucking system is still bricking after they've uninstalled the update and when they're going into the dashboard, which wouldn't even be running the game at all and wouldn't have anything to do with the fucking update.
So it's not related and people are retarded.
This conversation is giving me a migraine.
Oh, well, I think we'll leave it at that.
All right, Zaku, thanks for the call and hope Guitar Hero 2 doesn't kill your family, okay?
All right.
All right, take care.
The Guitar Hero 2 patch is giving kids heroin and it's killing grandmas across the nation.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
Hi, what's on your mind?
Who's this?
This is the Rob D. Why are you dodging me and hold him?
Hello, the Rob D. I'm not dodging you and hold him.
I'm just messing with you.
I understand.
You guys play on a bad night.
God.
Play on like a Monday night.
Nothing happens on Monday.
Oh, fuck.
Heroes is back next week.
Never mind.
But actually, as a college student...
Weeknights would be worse, but either way, that's not why I called in.
Alright, what's on your mind?
Well, I know you guys talked about the Guitar Hero pricing earlier on, the downloadable content.
What to you would be a better solution?
The iTunes model of buying one song apiece, or actually, what's the more egregious offense?
The three song packs or the cost per song, which to me is also pretty bad.
What if those songs end up costing $2 a song?
About $2.10 per piece.
Okay, I think they should be priced.
I think DDR, even though there's a whole other can of worms there because of the fact that the songs were already on the disc and people were mad about that, but that aside...
I think the pricing scheme over there was somewhat fair.
It was 100 points a song, so it worked out to be $1.25 or something.
So it was 100 points a song, and then if you bought a pack of 10, you got a discount, so it only ended up being $1 a song.
I like that.
Yeah, $1 per song would be fine with me, especially if you could pick which song you can download, because I don't want to download every Guitar Hero song.
Right, and same thing with DDR.
Maybe I don't want Candy, because Candy's been in every freaking DDR game lately.
So maybe I want to skip that one, but I have that option.
Or I could just download the Mega Pack and it's kind of included.
It depends how many of the songs I want.
But here's the other difference between the DDR packs, is that not only are they cheaper because it's $1.25 a song, but they are new songs, mostly, to the series.
Now about, let's say, three quarters of them are new.
Right?
So... Yeah, I think paying that much, and the fact that it adds up to like $98 if you would buy all the songs theoretically from Guitar Hero 1, or I don't remember how much, I think it was about $90.
Then that's ridiculous.
What do you think?
Do you think Red Octane is going to change their tune?
Do you think they're going to listen to all this rabble, rabble, rabble going on on the internet?
Or do you think, you know, hey, if some sucker's going to buy it, let's keep cranking it out.
If enough people buy them, not a chance.
I guess it all depends.
So if you feel strongly that this is wrong, don't buy it.
Exactly.
And honestly, I think maybe even $2 for a song as long as I can pick each song individually.
I think that might even be fine because, you know, then I don't have to download every song.
But if they're going to put them in three packs, no way.
I might be okay with that because at least, even with the $2, you know, at least Guitar Hero songs are kind of long.
You know, DDR songs are short.
They're like, what, a minute and a half, minute 45?
So you could use that argument that, you know, Guitar Hero songs are like the full songs.
So they could be more.
You're right.
I'd almost be okay with that as long as I could pick the individual song.
But none of this PAX stuff.
I don't like that.
Yeah, I think it's almost a double offense in their case.
All right.
Another game I want to play though is the Phoenix Wright, or not the Phoenix Wright game, the Harvey Birdman game.
I think that's a perfect license for Capcom.
Do you think they're going to kind of model it after Phoenix Wright, or what do you think it's going to be like?
I don't think they could avoid it, honestly.
I think that they'd be almost remiss not to do that.
Objection!
I guess we'll see.
I'll take the case.
Do you think Phoenix Wright is popular enough that enough people would get it?
Like there'd be enough cross-interests between the two franchises, Phoenix Wright and Harvey Birdman?
Maybe it'd be almost better because it would introduce people to that style of play.
I guess that's true.
All right.
Well, Rob... Because it depends how they'll do it.
Rob D., anything else on your mind?
No, that's about it at all.
You guys take some more calls.
All right.
Sounds good.
And hey, I'll give your podcast a cheap plug over on allgames.com.
You do this show called This Day in Gaming, right?
Five times a week?
It's a lot of fun.
All right.
Monday to Friday.
It's so much fun.
All right.
Thanks a lot.
See you guys later.
No problem.
See ya.
Let's go to another call.
We'll take this call here.
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Raven Stauffen.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited tonight.
Why is that?
Because you picked up my call.
Well, here you are.
I mean, you get in almost every week you call.
Very rare do you not seem to get in.
We have to be ultra busy.
Surprisingly enough, even though I say we have all this time for calls tonight, there's not a lot of folks calling in.
The phones are dead except for you right now.
I think we've got all the other calls.
What's on your mind?
What's on my mind?
Yeah.
Oh, what was... Okay.
Salmon Max is on my mind.
Culture Shock and all the rest.
It's last season's coming out this month, and I'm so sad.
Have you been playing Salmon Max?
I didn't realize you've been playing Salmon Max.
Oh, I've been playing Salmon Max since it first came out.
How is it for those folks that haven't really been playing the series?
Why should we be looking over at that series and getting into that game?
Dude, you should be playing this game because it's kind of like a text adventure, and you go around places, and the characters are so lovable.
Like, Sam is so funny.
He'll go like, holy fish, based on a dance talker.
We're on it, chief.
And he'll hang up the phones like, what's wrong, Sap?
We have to sabotage the president.
He's doing something wrong.
And it has, like, funny dialogue.
and you go around places and you ask questions and you click on things it's a text event again I know you say you're sad because the series is ending and I think we've all heard the last episode for now is coming out but don't you think that the series has been popular enough that we haven't seen the end of it yet I think season 2 has got to be imminent but I don't know when well I guess that's true and the question is could it come out for Xbox Live
PhoenixRide.com
Oh my god, I was just running around, just screaming my head off, going like, it's Phoenix Wright 3, they're finally gonna bring it out!
I've been like, holy shit, I hope it comes out soon, because after Akaku Sabin 2, aka Phoenix Wright, Justice for All, I've been just going, just itching for another one.
Are you afraid that Phoenix Wright might jump the shark?
Because it seems like they're really starting to crank these out.
Oh no, I want this as fast as possible.
If it comes out tomorrow, I'm there.
TheRobD is in chat and says, I could envision Raven's Dolphin seeing the news, getting up, screaming, and running around.
Do you have a video on YouTube of this?
I should.
That's what you should do.
I should just go, oh my god, it's Phoenix Wright!
Exactly.
Alright, anything else on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
One more thing, as usual.
Of course.
I did listen to your show last week on my cell phone through the Skype line.
Through the Skype line or through that other service?
No, no, no.
No, all live through the Skype line.
How is that?
Did somebody patch the show into you or something?
No, no.
I actually did something ingenious if you have time.
Just give me one minute to just tell me, to tell you.
Okay.
Now, you got me curious.
What is that?
Okay.
My phone has three weekends, so what I did is I called my cell phone.
and Rob D showed me how to input the sound card just through the thing, through the computer and that works great and I can hear you.
While I was traveling out of town, I could hear the whole show through the phone.
So you had your computer sound running on Skype and then you called your own computer.
No, I called my cell phone.
Oh, you called your cell phone on Skype.
Oh my gosh.
Wow, that's hardcore, Ravens.
He had the audio out from his computer going into the in on his cell phone and had it automatically pick up.
I think I get it now.
But that's pretty hardcore.
You're pretty hardcore.
A big nerd.
Yeah, a big nerd.
Hey, I have to get my OLR fixed.
Well, thank you.
We take it as a compliment.
But you're crazy.
You do know this.
I know this, but that's okay.
All right, Ravensoft, we've got to let you go.
Take more calls.
It's fine.
Bye.
Enjoy, and hopefully they'll put up a new cell tower in your area or something to accommodate for all the calls you're making.
Okay.
All right.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, you happy people.
Hey, I can barely hear you.
Get a little closer to your mic.
Try again.
Hello, you happy people.
Hey, who's this?
This is Dark Knight.
Hey, Dark Knight, what's on your mind, buddy?
Nothing much.
Just...
Hearing so much about 360 bricks and whatnot just makes me not convinced to still not get one.
So you are not a 360 owner right now, right?
I am not a next-gen owner at all.
At all.
You're still in the ancient times.
Well, not really.
I mean, PS2's still got a lot of love going for it with God of War and everything.
The other two systems are pretty much dead, though.
Yeah.
But do you play handhelds at all?
I still own a DS, that's the only thing I got.
Well, hey, DS is probably the most popular system out there right now, so there you go.
Yeah.
So, yeah, do you want to get an Xbox 360 for some of the games that are on it?
I was thinking about it a while back, but like I say, hearing the brick situation and everything just makes me change my mind every time.
It is a little bit, you know, it is very discouraging to read on the internet about all these people bricked.
And, you know, I always said, I'm like, oh, you know, you always read about the poor suckers on the internet who have to send their consoles back.
You always kind of go, oh, that won't happen to me.
And then it, like, did happen to me.
And I remember ranting about it on the show.
I got a brick 360 back in, like, February.
My first 360 bricked after, like, a week.
I was so pissed.
And, yeah, I can't, it's weird that it hasn't really damaged Microsoft's reputation.
You know what I mean?
Especially now they want to charge the repairs.
What's that?
I mean, it's still Bill Gates' company.
As long as the name is still attached to that company, they look at it as like, oh, Bill Gates got this, ain't nothing wrong with it.
But yet the darn thing's still bricked, I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, it happens a lot.
Well, I don't know.
I'd like to think it's not related to the patch, but it is a little weird, you know.
People don't just show up out of the woodwork, you know, suddenly a handful of people all have their consoles go kaput at the same time.
I think this is just as bad as going to a foreign community like Phantasy Star Universe and hearing people saying, My room got hacked!
My room got hacked!
My room got hacked!
Every 20 minutes.
What's up with Phantasy Star Universe?
Right now it's leveled off.
Not much hacking going on anymore.
Just basically money problems in the game and whatnot.
Plus they updated the lobby again recently.
Have they added a lot of new quests or things to do once you visit all the planets and do all those basic quests?
Yeah, we're doing S2 missions now.
And most people now are hanging out at the high payout ones and whatnot like...
Some areas where you get a higher payout than other areas and whatnot.
And what else?
Then we got new clothes and whatnot and bonus drops.
That's all.
Sounds pretty cool.
And then all of a sudden, of course, being that the expansion is coming around the corner.
Oh, that's right.
There's that expansion pack coming out.
When's that supposed to be released?
Japan is going to get it first, of course, but everybody is saying that the U.S.
might see it in December.
I guess that's better than never.
Yeah, so I'm definitely waiting on that to find out.
And so far, from what inside information I got from when the chat regular was here, it looks pretty interesting with the expansion.
We'll spread the gospel of OLR throughout Phantasy Star Universe for us.
Make it so.
We don't have enough time to play it ourselves.
I'm doing it enough times as it is.
All right, we appreciate it.
All right, thanks so much for the call.
We've got to take some more calls, but have a great night.
All right, light up.
Mystic Gohan in chat, seeming to echo the sentiments of Dark Knight on the phone.
Oh man, I'm scared of buying Guitar Hero 2 now that I've heard of crashes.
I'd be a little scared too.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, my name's Billy.
Hi, Billy.
How old are you, Billy?
I'm eight.
You're eight, huh?
And what are you doing listening to this program?
My daddy said I could.
Your daddy said you could, huh?
Are we babysitting you tonight, Billy?
Yeah.
What kind of video games do you play, Billy?
The Mario one.
You play the Mario one?
Well, there's like 50,000 Mario games, Billy.
Which Mario game is your favorite?
The one on the Wii.
The one on the Wii?
You play Super Paper Mario?
Or do you play the rip-off virtual console games?
I don't know what a virtual console is.
You don't know what a virtual console is?
No.
Okay.
Well, what did you want to call in and share with us tonight, Billy?
My daddy broke his Xbox 360 with the Guitar Hero thing.
It, like, didn't work.
And he threw it out the window and...
Did he throw the Xbox 360 out the window?
Or did he throw the guitar out the window?
He threw the entire Xbox out the window.
Did he hit any of your friends or any small animals when he did it?
Really?
Really?
Yeah, but there was a flat sound.
Well, I thought since you're babysitting me that you could help me.
What do you want us to do to help?
Loki, they think it's you calling in, by the way, but you're right here, right?
I'm not calling in.
I'm right here.
He's right there.
My voice does not sound like that.
All right.
My dad, my daddy thinks Loki's stupid.
Why is Loki stupid?
Because my daddy loves Max.
Your daddy loves men?
No, Max.
Oh, Max.
Oh, your daddy loves Max.
Okay.
No.
DarkSakura.com
Baby's cool.
DarkSakura is cool.
Thank you.
That definitely certifies that he's not in Mensa.
Hey!
I'm great.
Okay, let's see.
I guess since we're babysitting you tonight, what would you like us to do to entertain you?
Can we watch The Lion King?
Sure you can.
Yes, we'll watch Lion King through the magic of radio.
I will actually sing Lion King songs for you here on the show.
It's the circle of life.
I'm scared.
I think I'm going to hang up now.
All right, you do that.
Okay, bye.
Thank you, bye.
Which of our callers was that crank calling us?
Do you think that was DMN?
I can't say.
They blocked the number, so I can't see the phone number.
So, whatever kid that was knew how to block their phone number.
You know who that was, DarkSakura?
You're a jerk.
Was it you, DarkSakura, somehow calling us?
Excuse me, I was here with the microphone set down, looking at fucking Saturday pictures.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Uh-oh, call dropped.
Try again.
1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always call us on Skype.
Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
Misty in chat says, God, were we this desperate for a Skype call?
I suppose yes, because now we finally broke in an hour, so I guess we can end the segment now.
Did you lose a sock?
Says, who was it?
That was funny.
And let's see.
GS191 says, I think it's one of the lesbians.
Gaming Nerd says, Sky loves swearing to 8-year-olds.
Misty says, if we're this hard up for a phone call, I could fucking call in and bitch about that makeup.
Well, maybe you should, but we have another call coming in, so let's take it.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Zappy.
Hey, our match game champion.
Zappy, what's on your mind?
Well, since you brought Potpourri up, you brought this upon yourself.
How awesome was Doctor Who this week, Jamie?
It would be nice if people would stop fucking rubbing it into my face.
What happened?
Because I haven't been able to get a single one of the five downloads I've tried to work.
Oh, I didn't have no idea.
I didn't really mean to be an asshole.
No, it's okay.
Well, you should send her the link that you used to see the show.
No, it's my computer's dying.
Oh.
The VAIO is dying, and I hear audio is what I get.
Do you want me to find it and burn it to a DVD for you?
I do not burn it into a DivX or X video format.
I need MPEGs.
I don't know how to do that.
I don't want it burned as a DVD playing file.
I want it as just data.
With that extra crap on it.
I think I can do that.
MPEG.
MPEG is better.
Did you at least get to see last week's?
No, I didn't.
Oh, you're behind on the whole season.
Yes.
But think of it.
You'll get to have a whole marathon day.
Ooh, Anger Rising here in the Orange Lounge Radio Room.
Good job, Zappy, getting us all mad.
No, I'm just kidding.
What games have you been playing this week, Zappy?
Nothing since I broke my PSP and I've been too busy to play anything else.
You broke your PSP?
Yeah.
How'd you do that?
I dropped my laptop on the screen.
Ouch.
So what, you have a cracked screen now and you can't even see anything?
I got a new one, but then I botched the repair.
Oh, that's great.
What were you playing on the PSP before you smashed it into a million pieces?
Call of Duty and Ratchet & Clank.
A lot of people give the PSP a hard time.
I actually like it.
What games do you think that people are overlooking that they should be playing on the PSP?
Let's see.
There's obviously Medal of Honor, but I don't think that's been overlooked.
What's the name of that stuff game?
It completely slipped my mind.
Not Metal Gear Solid, but... Subsistence?
Uh, no.
Or wait, no, are that what, Acid?
Or what was the other Metal Gear one?
It's not Metal Gear, it's another one that's on the PlayStation platform.
It starts with an S. Oh, Cyclone Filter.
Oh, okay.
That's a pretty good one.
Cool.
Also, there's Daxter, that's good.
Alright, there's some good... Are you looking forward to Rondo of Blood?
Uh, no, I'm not really... Rondo of Blood!
Two people in the chatroom did agree with Metal Gear Portable Ops being a must-own game, so there you go.
And YYZ gives us the mandatory Rondo of Blood!
There you go.
Alright, well, Zappy, thank you so much for the phone call and for angering my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.
I'll do my best.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
See, he should have to send you an MPEG DVD or whatever it is you want.
He should do that for you.
Honestly, I don't have a problem with really any format.
It's just that my laptop, for some reason, chokes up on... And I don't know what's wrong, because Dan took out one of my sticks of memory, because he had put in an extra gig in my laptop, and then he took it out when he was rebuilding his laptop.
And so since then, I've actually had a problem with...
The DivX stuff.
Alright, one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is DJ Kibbles and Bits.
Hey, DJ Kibbles and Bits and Bits and Bits.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Nothing much, man.
It's my first time calling.
I've been actually a long-time listener the past two years now, so I really don't have time.
I've never actually gotten on, so it's my first time actually getting on to a live show.
Wow, congratulations.
Geez, you've been listening for three years and you've never gotten on the show.
Well, there you go.
What the hell?
Our line doesn't get hammered that much.
Well, that's all right.
Well, I'm glad you made it on the program.
What did you want to talk to us about tonight?
Well, you know how everybody's bitching about how Nintendo is delaying shipments of Wii's and all that other good stuff.
Of course, yeah.
Well, I just wanted to raise a good point that at the end of the day, you really can't blame Nintendo for a lot of the shipments that are going down, like all the supply issues.
Because if anything, there's one company that you need to look at and blame everything on, whether it's Nintendo, whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Sony...
and so on.
Any of the shipping problems that you hear about or whatever, it's all based on the fact that IBM can't get out enough chips.
And it happened before with, I'm not sure if you know that Apple, Apple uses PowerPC chips as well.
That's why they switched from the PowerPC to the Intel chips.
And Apple was like, well, fuck you guys, you can't get enough supply, so we're going to move on to Intel.
and now you kind of see the problem happening with these video game consoles as well.
You know, that's an interesting point because a lot of us are very quick to blame the game companies for all the shortages, but sometimes we forget that there's all these components that go into the system.
And for instance, isn't that what caused the massive Xbox 360 delays previously was that there was like a component?
It wasn't so much... I don't think at that time it was the IBM chip.
One of these systems got so slowed down because the factory couldn't produce enough of it.
It was the PlayStation 3 and it was the Blu-ray diode, but it's not really...
IBM's fault either it's the fact that Nintendo's retarded it only has one factory building these fucking systems instead of like four factories or even more building systems that's why you don't have any shortages with 360s or PlayStation 3s or anything like that right now despite the fact that their chips may still come from IBM it's because they're retarded still and they only have one factory producing them despite the fact that most of the components in it are
were stuff that was in the GameCube and that they should have tons of and should be really easy to manufacture.
Yeah, but one... That's a good point.
Yeah, that's a good point.
I mean, Nintendo definitely should up their ante as far as, you know, getting enough factories out there to make these damn systems.
But, I mean, at the same time, though, you do have to look at the fact that the chips, the actual PowerPC chip that IBM is making for the three consoles, you kind of have to look at it this way.
IBM only has one factory, two.
So, in a sense, it's like, hmm, who do you really look at in this situation?
All in all, it's a really fucked up situation when you're looking at the overall picture.
There's no winners.
The rumor is that they're supposed to be looking at adding another factory to build Wii's because Microsoft's now cut off one of the factories that they had for the 360s.
DJ Kibbles and Bits
Shit, I got that shit the first day it came out, so I'm all set.
Exactly, you know what, that's my thoughts now is that, you know, fuck all y'all who waited too long to get the system.
You know what?
Who cares if there's shortages?
It's your fault for waiting too damn long to buy the thing, so you can just sit there and wait.
But you know what's fucked up about the whole thing, though, is that now, you know, with this whole, like, hey, we're giving away free stuff until June.
Well, sucks to be you if you can't get a Wii before June, then you don't get...
DarkSakura.com
Other End of Things, too.
So, whatever.
It's a catch-22 at the end of the day.
Yeah, but they still haven't given me a real reason why I need 120 gigs of hard drive space on my 360.
Until they sell porn.
Good point.
Oh, God.
Please let it be their big E3 announcement this year.
HD porn!
Oh, my God.
Sales of 360 would go through the roof.
Seriously, they would whoop the Wii's ass.
I mean, think about dads across America going to buy a system for their children.
Would they want to buy, hey, I'm going to buy the system that my kid can play and have fun with, or I'm going to buy the system that gives me porn in high def?
Porn wins, always.
Well, Beyonce, PlayStation 3 makes that the easiest since you can put video files on there pretty simple.
Baby Formula or WoW Epic Mount?
Baby Formula, WoW Epic Mount.
I just can't choose.
DJ Kibbles and Bits, really good first call, really good point.
Anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up?
Oh, no, that's it, man.
That's it.
It's a pleasure.
It's a pleasure.
Well, no problem.
Thanks so much for calling.
Anytime.
Call back.
All right.
Take care, guys.
Later.
All right.
Well, that was a good Skype line tonight.
Lots of people we got to hear from there.
And, of course, our chat room going along there.
Let's see.
I think they're talking about Doctor Who now.
DarkSakura, is there a Doctor Who debate here?
Ignoring.
Ignoring.
I see.
I don't think everyone's posting spoilers, but... Exterminate!
Legend of Zaku says, Remember this lesson in life.
When trying to get a Wii, there will always be at least ten diehard fanboys and profiteers in front of you at any given store that sells it.
eBay profiteers.
Have a special place in hell waiting for them.
Alright, any last minute stories, boys and girls, before we finish up this program?
Yes, but Loki can go first.
Alright.
Okay.
Anyways, I'm going to talk about a few things real quick.
One, there was a rumor that Phantom Hourglass, the Zelda game for the DS, was going to have voice chat.
Not true.
Let's see here.
DarkAlex has released the custom firmware 3.30 OE, so that's available now.
So that's pretty awesome.
Ben Heck created a Playstation 3 controller that looks like a 360 controller.
Don't care.
Virtual consoles for Monday.
Apparently the rumor is Virtua Fighter 2, Punch-Out, Bonk's Revenge.
So that'd be kind of neat for the U.S.
Where's my Actraiser?
Doesn't matter, I'm out of town next week.
There's a new game coming to the PlayStation Network that looks exactly like... I cannot remember the damn name.
It's on the 360... whatever.
What do you think?
What that game is?
Yeah, it's that one that we've played before.
I don't know.
It looks like another fucking game that was on the 360.
Boom Boom Rocket?
It's not Boom Boom Rocket.
Geometry Wars?
I don't know.
No, not Geometry Wars.
The other one.
Like Mutant Storm Reloaded.
That's what it was.
Is that in Mutant Storm Reloaded?
Yeah, it looks exactly like Mutant Storm Reloaded.
For more Dragon Ball Z stuff, there's Dragon Ball Z Source for the Half-Life engine.
Who cares?
Oh, this is stupid.
Red PS3 sells for $12,100 on eBay.
Makes me want to paint... Was it spray-painted red?
Yes, it was, more or less.
People are retarded.
And then the one that I'm most excited about, Vigilante 8 is rumored to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I loved this game when it was on the PlayStation.
So I hope that is true.
Alright.
Well, here is something that was actually linked to me by our good friend Brad from PodCulture.
Yay, Brad!
This is not really news, but it's something that's really cool.
It's from TechBlog.
Sorry, I should say TechEblog, I should say.
The top ten strangest custom gaming systems.
And number ten is the ColecoVision Portable.
The NES Station, which is basically Nintendo done up to look like a PS2.
Just a mod.
There's the N-Pod, which runs NES games.
It's interesting.
It actually looks kind of cool.
I want one.
There's the portable Sega CDX, which actually looks like someone just chopped up a Nomad and then attached a CD player to it.
The GameCube2Go, which, yeah, whatever.
That one's kind of bizarre.
But neat at the same time.
The NES Plus Sega.
That's a machine that plays Genesis and NES games.
The handheld Atari Jaguar.
Next!
Only good game on that was Tempest.
Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini.
Yeah, whatever.
Dreamcast Portable.
That's kind of cool.
And PlayStation 2 Portable.
I had a friend, though, who built a portable Atari 2600.
Hmm.
He brought it over.
It worked.
It was pretty cool.
I think that this is cool.
I still want a GameX.
What?
A GameX.
What the hell is that?
Let me find a picture of it.
It's another handheld chopped-up system.
But there's no time.
That was it.
We're out of stories.
We're out of steam.
We're out of time.
So that's it.
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Was that your last story?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I'm trying to pull the thing.
It's a portable NES player.
And Game Gear.
And stuff.
Anyway.
Rob!
Let's go around and give everyone's... What?
What?
I will kill you.
Can I have some cheeseburger, please?
That's it.
Let's go around and give everybody's final thought.
Next week's show, by the way, will be very interesting.
What's that?
Tuesday.
Yeah?
I have class.
No pump up the volume.
There may not be guys on the show Wednesday because of my trips.
So it's going to be a very quiet week on Orange Lingerie.
But at least you have new STFU, new Travis Donovan live this week.
And I'm going to learn how to rub people a different way.
Interesting.
All right.
Also, next week's show should be very interesting because DarkSakura and I will be at Disneyland Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
Not Sunday.
We're coming back on Sunday, but we are driving Thursday.
On Sunday.
Anyway, too confusing.
So we'll be pulling into town just when the show is about to start.
So next week could very well be the Loki show with hilarious commentary from DarkSakura and Skye.
So won't that be fun, Loki?
I still think Loki should come with us.
I know.
I wish Loki would come with us.
Don't you want to ride a teacup, Loki?
No.
You make me sad.
Don't you want to ride Rockin' California Screamin'?
No.
All right.
Boring.
He's so boring.
He just wants to stay home and have sex with his wife.
I guess I can't say I blame him.
Play games.
All right.
Let's go ahead and get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought.
Once I finish with Earth Defense Force 2017, I'm going to be playing Earth Defense Force 2 on Blade Season 2.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
I have the best wallpaper ever.
I just posted links to it in the chatroom.
My final thought is penguins!
And fuck my aquarium for killing Kelly Kapowski.
You're a dick.
That's it.
