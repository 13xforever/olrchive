Tonight, April 1st, 2007, it's no joke that Sonic and Mario are teaming up for an Olympic game.
The Xbox 360 Elite gets officially unveiled, and we talk about who is already upset with the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week, no really this time, of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that internet podcast dedicated to video game culture, the gaming lifestyle, and what you, the gamer, really want to know about.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How you doing, Jamie?
My nose is full of goo.
Gross.
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
I'm doing good.
Alright, we have some special guests in the studio tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There you have it.
Chris is here tonight, everybody.
Hi, Rob.
And she is a lesbian, but not the giggling type.
No, I'm not.
Well, once in a while, if I tell a funny joke, she might giggle.
Yeah, laugh like a hyena is more like it.
All right.
And joining us all the way from Wisconsin, say hello to Meg Z. Hi.
How you doing, Meg Z?
I'm okay.
Thanks for your help with the show earlier.
Appreciate it.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something.
Yeah, I'm looking at porn.
Hot.
Are you downloading lesbian porn on my Mac?
Hells yeah.
Hot.
All right.
Well, anyway, again, you know, our April Fool's joke was all in good fun.
If you don't know what it is yet, go back in the podcast archive and check it out.
But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight.
Just a little bit of a disclaimer first, though, because we want to say.
Um, um,
I really didn't get a pinbot.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
Pinbot sounds awesome, though.
I know.
I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one.
You know, you weren't here last week.
We missed you.
I had the plague.
I know.
The disease.
But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino, and I totally thought of you, and I wish I could have stole it for you.
I has played one.
At California Extreme or whatever they call it?
Yep.
I want to go to that this year.
Sounds hot.
It was great.
Anything you wanted to add, Loki?
I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters.
It's kind of cool.
It's like a shoot-em-up game, I guess.
I don't know.
It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard.
But it's fun, so we're checking it out.
It's a free download.
I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing, so if you want the link to it, check that out.
But you've got to be a friend.
Community.allgames.com Yeah, you've got to be one of my friends in order to be able to get the links.
So there you go.
Because there's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here.
So you should check it out.
It's just an awesome game.
That's right.
That's all I meant.
Of course.
All right.
My gaming week.
What I really played.
I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit.
But with a listener of the program.
Not a stupid boy.
We were cracking each other up.
But I also played a lot of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
Just trying to make my way through that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think it's a good, like, 80s arcade type game.
It's just that instead of getting the same old root beer, tapper, joust, those type of games, it's like something you may not have played before.
And it's kind of fun.
I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet, though, so I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game.
But for five bucks, honestly, so far, it's not a bad deal.
And I apologize about my voice and to the chatters in our chat room at chat.orangelandsradio.com.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and I'll see you next time.
and their high def pretty videos although you can't randomize them which is kind of weird and they do have music included but I've actually found the way I enjoy listening to the game is I use the XB stream program to grab podcasts and I'll play Tetris while listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack as a podcast like I don't know either our show if I want to kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major Nelson or something or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those and it's kind of fun so
Um, yeah, $30, not a bad deal, but I think it'll be in your bargain bin soon.
Um, Chris, maybe anything you guys want to add?
I've played Animal Crossing.
Animal Crossing on DS?
Yeah, on the plane.
On the plane?
How was that?
Oh, you didn't use the Wi-Fi, though, on the plane, did you?
Of course not.
That's good.
No, but, um, I haven't played for, like, three months, and everybody in my village was like, Bitch, I invited you to tea, like, five months ago!
And I'm like, I'm sorry, and there was, like, a gajillion weeds, and I had a bunch of mail, and it was a mess.
But I cleaned it up all the way from Madison to
So it took you that long to clean up your village?
Kind of, and then make everybody not mad at me anymore.
Alright, well good times.
I wonder if there's still, I guess there probably still is a real active Animal Crossing community online, because I was thinking, wow, if I just got the game now, like most people I know quit playing that a long time ago, so there'd be nobody left to visit my village, but I guess there's still a pretty active community online somewhere, huh?
Chris, anything you wanted to add?
Well, I actually really did play World of Warcraft, because that's the only game.
Fuck you.
Fuck!
Shut up.
I had to spend a lot of time waiting for Megzi to get here, so I did that by playing WoW.
Although, I did it more as an experiment.
I have found if you go to any of the major areas where there are lots of people in traffic, and you have a girl character, and you start making her dance, watch how many guys decide to join in.
It's very funny.
It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not.
Not when you're a tauren, I'm finding out, because nobody wants to dance with a cow.
I like to dance with a cow.
It works well with the elves and sometimes the humans, just because there's a lot of traffic.
But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you.
It is, especially when you're sitting there knowing, wow, these guys have no clue.
Yeah, really.
Some guy asked me ASL, and I said male.
I said male, 42, Arizona.
No.
And he walked away.
Awesome.
It was very funny.
Uni's in our chat saying, I'm going to make a Draenei.
Dude, the Draenei chicks are hot.
They are.
Draenei.
Oh, my God.
I'd bang those if I could.
You know, I might be gay and all, but even if I think the Draenei chicks are hot, what can I say?
I just like their accent.
Yeah.
That's hot, too.
Not enough rage.
All right.
So there it is.
Conclusion of our gaming weeks.
So...
Let's do some real brief housekeeping here.
I have to keep this a little bit vague.
We were going to say a little more about it, but I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to.
Obviously, it pains us, journalistically, to have to go back and remove something that used to be there before.
Trust me, we did not enjoy doing that.
We didn't want to do it, but as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand, we kind of had to do it.
Um, unfortunately, Orange Lounge Radio is a hobby for us, and it doesn't pay the bills.
So when push comes to shove, um, things gotta change.
But, um, we also believe in karma.
What goes around comes around.
And, uh, I think what we do here is really great for the community, and we give a lot of publicity to a lot of, um, great up-and-coming games.
We don't get paid for it.
They don't pay for us to talk about their games.
And, uh, I guess the only impression we can kind of take away from this is that, um,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
GameStop had their financial conference call, I guess, their investor conference call, and the COO, Dan D'Amato, I think that's how you pronounce his name, was talking a little bit about the crippling Wii shortage that's been kind of happening ever since the system came out, and particularly bad with this month, or I should say last month, March,
He was quoted saying, I don't think it's going to be an issue going forward.
I think this is just my opinion, but I think Nintendo intentionally dried up the supply because they made their numbers for the year.
The new year starts April 1st, and I think we're going to see the supply flowing.
Now, it's interesting, of course, Nintendo responded to that saying, no, that's not true.
They never intended for a shortage to actually happen, and
and so on and so forth.
Of course, my opinion on that is, if they're really drying up the sources on purpose, they're not going to go, yeah, we're holding them back because we hit our numbers for the year, so sorry if you can't get one.
That's just going to piss people off.
Anyways,
Long story short, I don't know, I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers, but I know that the systems haven't been in stores for a long time, and I know at least distribution as a whole hasn't been able to get a hold of them for the month of March.
I mean, they pretty much allocated everything to retail, so what little there was in retail, I don't know if it's because they did it intentionally, or if it was just they were
Really behind and really can't make enough, you know, either way.
Hopefully it'll start getting better in April.
And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario.
April fools.
No, just kidding.
What I'm wondering, though, is, and this is something I've been kind of wondering about this week, is that I seem to remember last year, obviously Xbox 360 had some real shortage problems as well.
And we were pretty harsh with the Xbox 360 and Microsoft and, you know, why the F aren't there more systems out there and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
It seems like we've been a little more forgiving of Nintendo through all this.
I'm trying to figure out why that is.
Is that because they have more consoles out there on the market so that those of us diehards that really wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier?
Or is that because we were smarter about it this time when we all camped out and got them or did whatever we did?
I think we're just a little bit smarter about it and also the fact that, I mean, the 360 was kind of the first next-gen console so it was something you really had to have it.
A lot of times now it's like,
Well, the Wii's not out.
Oh, well, I'll just play my 360 or I'll just play my PlayStation 2 or something like that until it comes out.
There's really... And also, it'd be a little different if Super Mario Galaxy was out there now versus, you know, later or Smash Bros.
Brawl or something like that.
If that stuff was out there now, you know, that would be a little bit different.
But I mean, personally, I don't... But to be honest, Perfect Dark Zero was nothing to get that excited about for me.
I mean, and the Xbox launch games were nothing like, oh, I gotta have it.
True.
And...
I just wanted the system as a whole, you know, I don't know, the download, the live, I don't know, I just wanted the damn thing a year ago, you know, and I was frustrated when I couldn't get one.
I would think it'd be pretty dumb even if they are hitting their numbers to, you know, intentionally drive the market.
I don't think that's even, I mean, I just think they just can't produce enough of these.
I mean, it's even the issue with their accessories.
I mean, that's kind of a good, you know, point right there that they just don't have enough accessories out there even to, you know,
I guess I'm just wondering aloud here, are we being fair to Nintendo?
Are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft the same way?
Fuck no, they should be getting more systems out there because it's built on goddamn technology.
It's been out forever.
I mean, with the goddamn GameCube.
Produce more fucking systems.
And Duscap in our chatroom agrees with you.
Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube version 2?
SSJ on 100 Mount wants to know, how long did the 360 shortage last?
I got mine in February, but I think it was resolved in April, May.
It was May, yeah.
I work at GameStop.
It lasted until about mid-March, April.
You could walk into a store.
I think I saw the first available one around the end of January.
But seriously, though, they need to get on top of at least the systems out there.
I mean, okay, great.
They want to keep the demand up or something like that.
I think the demand's up there.
People want to buy this thing.
And if it's any kind of indicator, you basically show your friends this thing.
Game System.
If they don't have it yet, after playing with it for a little bit, they're just like, God, I gotta get one of my own.
I would think you would want as many systems out there as possible to get as many impressions as possible to sell even more systems, which in turn, you sell more software, make more money.
So, I don't think they're doing it on purpose.
And, I mean, everyone's kind of running with this, you know, before because it's the CEO, it's his opinion.
And that's it.
I mean, it's as valid as my opinion.
So, I don't know.
We don't know, you can only speculate.
All that matters is, it's April now, more systems in stores.
Well, at least we do have some good news, and this is no joke.
Nintendo and Sega have both stated that Miyamoto is going to be part of the development of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
So...
They're actually talking specifically that there are going to be, not just that there's a number of different titles, from what I'm seeing anyway, but the game is being created by Sega with work by Miyamoto.
I'm sorry, when it comes down to the 500 meter dash or whatever the hell it is, Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario.
Mario's a big fat plumber.
He's going to tear his ass open.
Who lives on a diet of mushrooms.
Megsie's pointing at her shirt getting upset because she's wearing Flying Mario.
Okay, but in defense, Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to the high jump and shit like that because he's got hops.
But fucking Sonic will beat him.
What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?
Yeah.
Well, Sonic can go faster than the goddamn speed of sound, so there.
I think Mario will also have Sonic beat in the ability to make a good next-gen game competition.
But you know who will win?
Nintendo and Sega, because they have tricked you into buying a goddamn Olympics game.
If history has shown you anything, Olympics games suck really bad.
So...
You know, personally, I don't know.
If this gets you interested in the Olympics, hooray.
I'm not falling for it.
I ain't buying this shit.
Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.
FunnyDL had a really quick comment on the last story.
People, Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now and fans keep buying their bullshit.
Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage or the Nintendo 64 shortages?
No, you must be old.
No, I'm just kidding.
I wasn't really following gaming back then as closely as I am now.
I mean, a little bit, but, you know, I was much younger and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
This games magazine, Game Reactor, put this image up on the internet.
And then, of course, it caught wildfire.
They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image of Knights.
But there it is, a world exclusive on Knights.
And I'm sure they just beat the punch to some American publication that's going to have the same thing.
Well, actually, we learned about that previously in the teaser thing.
And I was going to say, there's also been screenshots out there now, too.
So it looks kind of cool.
Now here's a question, though.
You know, Sonic games as of late, ever since the Dreamcast, have not been that great.
So is this Sega's chance to redeem themselves, or should we just prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment?
I want another Clockwork Knights.
DarkSakura, I know you've been a longtime Sonic fan.
What are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii?
Do you think they can make a good one?
Happy.
Happy.
Happy.
What if it turns out like Sonic on 360 and PS3?
It can't.
It's on the Wii.
You think that'll be at Saving Grace?
Wii!
To be honest, though, I mean, it's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog, so control issues won't be that big of a problem, I'm hoping.
I hope.
We'll see.
Well, there it is.
Nights is confirmed and coming out.
Not to say told you so, but... But yeah.
Megzi, wait, wait, before we get into the next story, Megzi, you're squeeing over there.
I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie.
As a Knights fangirl, I mean, Sega's kind of done a lot of misfires lately.
What's going to stop them from misfiring this one?
Because it's Knights.
But Sonic was cool, and Sonic on PlayStation 3 and 360 was not fun.
Okay, that's Sonic.
Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.
You know what?
It will be good because it is nights, period.
But, okay, Mario is Missing had Mario in it, and it wasn't that much fun.
Mario is Missing was the shit.
You're just easy to please.
I don't know.
I don't know what else to think.
I have no idea.
Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?
I said you have no idea.
Ooh la la.
Any who hates...
and that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it.
The E3 event or E3-like event that you can go to because it's open to the public.
God help us all.
Anyways, so one reason you're probably going to want to go there other than the fact that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of...
Huge lineup.
Hopefully by that time we'll see the big Super Mario Galaxy and Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.
But it should be interesting.
I know, especially if they're on board, then it's likely other people will jump on board as well.
So anyways, E for Everyone or E for All.
It's going to be coming October in LA.
Same place as the original E3.
And only $100 to get in.
and there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.
Wow, that's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.
I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there?
You know what?
I have to admit, I'm interested.
I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.
I think I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.
200,000 people in half the exhibition space.
Yeah, that's going to be very uncomfortable.
I don't know.
But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.
I don't know.
That is a very lofty goal.
But E3 was crowded as it is.
I mean, I don't know.
But I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because we did not feel the love.
Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some reason it didn't happen.
I don't know what possibly went wrong there.
But, yeah, we're not going to E3.
Well, I'm not.
Loki's not.
I am!
You know when E3 started going down?
You know what was the mark of it starting to go down?
It was that they got rid of the booth babes.
No, no, no.
The mark of it going down was having to fight my way around a crowd that's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.
That's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark.
When Paris Hilton was getting those kinds of lines at E3, I was like,
What's wrong with this picture?
But the booth babes?
Well, there'll be booth babes at E4ALL, I'm sure.
There you go.
Are you going to go to E4ALL, maybe?
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
I don't know.
I want to know a little more about it.
I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be the must-have?
Seriously, am I going to pay $100 to wait?
5 hours to play a game I mean seriously there's 200,000 if 200,000 people actually are first off I don't know that that could actually work especially with like fire codes and stuff but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000 people in there as it was last year with E3 70,000 people I believe and it was fucking crowded and now you have half the space and more than double the people fuck that
JV Mon says $200,000 could be a typo.
Maybe they meant to say $20,000.
$20,000 is not bad.
I'll do $20,000.
And that's not a bad showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.
If they can pull off $20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first year out the gate.
So, well, we'll see.
Best of luck to E4ALL.
And I think I'm going to go.
I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it.
I want to go.
I want to go to E3, though.
Well, we don't always get what we want, sadly.
Like I said, we give free publicity games on this show, so if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your work cut out for you, Jamie.
Hey, I'm amazing.
You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?
Like we did last year?
Chirp.
So guess what's not live?
Zombies.
They're in Resident Evil.
My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.
That's okay, your face looks like one too.
Hey!
So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?
It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, is going to be at 480p, progressive scan, 16 to 9 widescreen.
Isn't that great?
Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this or whatever.
I mean, hooray for, you know...
Doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.
It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.
There will be after the Capcom Gamers Day thing, which I think that's in the next couple weeks here.
There's been mumblings that that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers Day.
Because they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?
Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.
That's true.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter 2 Turbo is going to be making its way to Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter 2 just came out not that long ago.
It's kind of like, obviously Street Fighter 2 Turbo was the superior game.
I don't know why anyone would want to have both.
You know, at least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between the games.
But now it's kind of like, sucker.
And you still can't play it online.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Final Fight Arcade I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console but these are a little more exciting other Virtual Console releases because Hudson updated an official list so we know these will be happening for sure Bonk's Revenge which I assume comes as a surprise to no one will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console also Bravo Man Shock Man and Battle Lode Runner which is kind of cool because Lode Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love
And I have to be honest, I'm not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting very excited over this game, so it must be good.
You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.
Do you know Battle of Lode Runner?
Actually, no.
Interesting.
Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week.
And we've got some good stuff coming out in the U.S.
It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2, we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.
It's kind of a good kids game, I guess.
If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones, or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.
I have a random question.
Can you use a karaoke revolution mic with these games?
No.
No.
Bastards!
But hey, you know, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of them, and it's the normal price of, like, Karaoke Revolution, so.
Well, I know.
I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but, you know.
Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.
Anyways.
I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.
Yeah.
Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that
PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Pimp My Ride, Rappala Trophies, on the 360, on the Playstation 3, Enchanted Arms,
Same damn game as before.
I believe they added maybe a few things to it.
And, see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia, Rival Sword.
I already said that.
Let's see.
Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out.
Also a port of the GameCube game.
Let's see.
On PC, um... The Sims 2 Celebration.
That looks kind of neat.
And a bunch of other crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way.
And, um...
I thought you were getting my copy early.
What happened?
It comes out Wednesday.
I still miss... I'm working on it.
Pull through for me.
I have to be the coolest kid on the block and have it before anyone else.
What do you mean you have it?
You're a liar.
April Fools.
Megzy.
Full of lies and loos.
Alright, just get hard.
Love ya.
Alright, well let's move on to more release dates.
How about the U.K. ?
Well, here's what we've got coming out.
On the 5th, we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords.
We also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360.
On the 6th, we have Frontline Fields of Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and The Red Star on PS2.
I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.
What's that about?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have a ball.
PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.
Netsu Chu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachislot Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love your pachinko.
It looks like some sexy ladies there.
Gambling Sim with Sexy Ladies
I have no fucking clue.
But you played it?
I was in Japan and they told me, like, you gotta play pachinko because it's like one of those Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.
And so I went to this pachinko parlor and put like $10 in and it ate my $10.
I didn't know what to do.
It's basic, okay.
I don't know the basics of the game, I'm sure somebody... It's legalized gambling.
It's pretty much legalized gambling.
You sit there, you put...
You put these little metal balls in certain spots.
I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little metal balls.
I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.
And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes... Yeah, shut up!
This game sounds fucking hot!
You can exchange those for prizes or you can usually go around the corner and get money for them.
Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and what not and it gives you money.
But Rob makes me too gross.
I've collected a lot of balls over the years.
Where's my prize?
I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.
You have your own set of balls.
Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.
That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant, very similar to the ones that would serve Rocky Mountain Oysters, you know?
Rack of lamb?
Rack of balls?
Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.
Do you even care what's coming out on Nintendo DS in Japan?
Sure you do.
Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.
and of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover but I assume that this is like a simulation game that teaches you manners because you can pick A, B, C and it looks like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever so this is interesting to say the least.
Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.
Isn't that series ever going to die?
I like that.
Probably never.
Yab is old.
And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam games.
Rengo vs. ZAFT Portable.
There you have it, Japanese release dates.
Aren't we happy?
We are happy.
One thing, though, that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting yet another firmware, 3.30.
And what will it give you?
Well, some interesting stuff.
For example...
you can have some brand new video sizes including full screen video now at 480x272 the native resolution of the PSP somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution for which is actually DVD resolution that's 480p I don't know how the hell that's going to fit since there's not that many pixels on the damn screen but okay sure
Um, and then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, um, which I believe is the T-Mobile hotspots and you get like 60 days, uh, like a trial for that or something.
Um, it will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there.
So, you know, you may want to wait a little bit because, um, let's see.
because there's some good news and that is that like most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.
And yeah, it's been cracked already and actually the rumor is that Dark Galaxy is working on a custom firmware for 3.30.
So I would say give it a couple more weeks and you'll probably see this on the internet.
Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a...
was a TA-82 PSP motherboard in there.
And you have the custom firmware already on there.
If you try to upgrade to this, it may break your PSP.
So you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have the custom firmware in there.
So just be careful.
Well, better hope that people heed that, right?
Yes.
Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's really surprised by this.
David Hader, Blood Elves, World of Warcraft
He's awesome.
He also, like, wrote the first X-Men movie, too.
Really?
The first two movies.
He wrote it?
Yes.
I did not know that about him.
I'm so sorry, guys.
My voice is giving out so bad tonight.
Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.
Oh, I didn't realize that's what he did.
You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know.
And he also did Applebee's commercials.
I found his voice real.
I want my baby back, baby back.
Oh, Drew Nami says, no, David Hayter did not do the Blood Elves.
Well, somebody pulled an April Fool's joke on me then.
Bastards.
I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.
My bad.
Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I think, for the game.
Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?
But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.
Oh, cool.
They still have to do the translations.
I guess that's true.
The game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.
Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.
They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than Talladega Nights was.
That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.
But
They were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network and then the first 20,000 were going to get their movie.
But nobody's gotten it yet.
Casino Royale is fucking awesome.
I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.
It's so good.
I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.
It's not all I freaking talk about.
Have you seen the new Bond movie?
It's freaking hot.
Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie because it's really good and you should see it too.
I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either and it was really good.
No, I hate fucking Bond.
You know, this just isn't working out.
I love it when lesbians fight on this program.
Let's see.
Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember, you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets mailed to you.
Ouch.
Perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.
Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation 3.
It was bundled in there.
Well, it was bundled in and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?
That's true.
It was like a real special something, huh?
Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.
You're special ed.
You're special ed.
Last night... So you may be waiting a while to get your
Copy of Casino Royale.
Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation 3.
According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.
And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful platform and developing technology and products for
and their plan on developing technology and products for this console says however we believe that the install base will be high enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year so not only do you have to wait until 2008 you have to wait until the second half of 2008 which fiscal year for most companies is from I believe April to April I want to say or March to March or something like that so second half would actually be fall of 2008 no Tomb Raider on Playstation 3 for you
You know what, I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises could this affect?
Juice X?
I'm trying to remember.
Eidos, recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.
They were doing, like, Battle Stations, Midway.
I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.
Thief, Hitman.
Hitman, yeah.
Oh, that's a pretty big series.
Okay, there you go.
Huh.
Well, I don't know, none of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted to try, Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and I just, I haven't, you know, so many games, so little time.
And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there, too.
That's true, that's true, it looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain, too, forgot about that.
Alright, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008.
DarkSakura.com
Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random.
And it's transmission.org.
It's t-r-a-n-s-mission.org.
And it's a UK website for the club scene for transvestites.
So I'm done.
Did you actually browse the website?
I mean, what kind of... I was looking for shoes.
You were looking for...
Wait a minute.
I was looking for shoes.
Stop the damn music for a minute.
How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual clubs in Britain?
Because there's a link on here, on their links page, there's a shops link and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.
These shoes are $300.
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.
Let's get them!
So, yeah.
You started it wrong.
You started it wrong.
I guess I, I don't know.
I guess I deserve that.
I don't know.
Let me borrow that top.
Well, Kelly is a pretty, pretty famous transit.
You want the rest of my water bottle for now?
I'm not sick.
Okay.
Let me go, let me go bribe people.
All right.
Chris is going to go bribe people, try to get us some drinks.
I'm going to give people some blowjobs.
All right.
Anyhow.
Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NC Soft and ArenaNet because they are putting out
Guild Wars 2 is coming out in the second half of 2008 officially announced
And they are going to follow what worked for them with Guild Wars.
No monthly subscription fee.
But the world will always be available just like the original Guild Wars.
So that's kind of cool, especially for those folks in the Guild Wars.
But what I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?
I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.
EverQuest 2...
didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got because people didn't want to leave their characters behind.
So I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate or if because, eh, I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there'll be some extra incentive.
I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2 just to, you know, make people buy everything they want.
So there you go.
Gotta collect them all!
Gotta get them all!
And her article this week was, Lady, get off the road.
And it's basically talking about, Men say women are bad drivers.
This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license photo to prove it.
I take my on-road duties seriously.
And basically her complaint is,
I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?
But she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.
No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.
She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper-to-bumper trying to go across the Bay Bridge.
Text messaging while driving.
You can't text message break up!
You can't text message break up!
So, yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.
True story, I am not shitting you.
That takes a special kind of loser.
This is why you women get a bad rap.
Exactly!
You wanna know why men get a bad rap?
Sure.
Small penis cars.
Bring it, bring it.
Every single fucking time I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.
What the hell is that car called?
What is that car?
It's like a Ford...
I don't know, it's one of the new little beamers I've got.
So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that they've got a bigger cock than I do.
I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.
Now what you boys don't know is that Chris has a very big cock in her top dresser drawer.
Exactly, and it vibrates.
Beat that motherfucker.
Not as big as mine.
That's right.
Hers is detachable, though.
So... Shut up, Rob.
But, yeah, you men are just as bad.
Lesbian sex.
Men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that, Kurt.
Okay, and maybe... Okay, so... Sorry, do you want to finish the article?
Yeah, yeah, I want to finish.
Anyways, so they go on to complain, basically, that men, you know, are, you know, driving fast and they're breaking...
And they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.
They're all, just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.
Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.
They've got awful driving written all over them.
Yeah, I don't think games are reality.
Duh.
You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!
I get extra points for that!
No, I'm not a retard, okay?
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's the difference.
Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?
That's why, you know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great.
Then we can go out there and play that, and you'll have something to play.
But, and I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are, you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that.
But usually I let them pass me, no problem.
But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway, talking on her cell phone, swerving all over the place, not using her signal.
And, you know, goddamn, might as well stop and back up on the freeway.
And I have seen that, by the way, before.
That's what pisses me off.
And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples.
Actually, a lot, a lot, a lot of bad apples out there, too.
Kind of spoiled a bunch, and...
You know, women should just get pissed off at these stupid people who drive... It's really SUV drivers.
I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.
I actually have to agree with you.
Those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with fire.
And you know what?
The guys that speed out there, they end up crashing anyway.
So it's all bad drivers.
I'm sorry, I missed something.
What the fuck does this have to do with games?
It doesn't have to do anything with games.
Why the fuck did you bring this story up then?
Because it was on Joystick, and because it was... And because it's basically, they're talking about Need for Speed, Excite Truck, and Burnout, and stuff like that.
Kind of blaming, I guess... So what, is that how the article reads?
Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop texting, blah, blah, blah.
That's what I read.
Excite Truck, Burnout, okay, thanks.
Is that it?
That's what I read.
That's how my guy filter went through that.
You know, that's basically...
It's like, squawk, squawk, squawk.
Meds suck.
Squawk, squawk, squawk.
I thought that was your wife talking to you.
Oh, no.
Or me.
Or me.
Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.
That's right, that's right.
I'm going 120 miles on the freeway wondering why somebody going 80 is in my way.
Okay, I'm going to go find people.
Next!
Okay.
Wow.
Oh, by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills at racing since because they need to practice.
Women, they're already such good drivers that they could squander their free time on destruction.
So, SmackDown.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you politely commenting for a reason here?
Because anytime there's a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it.
But tonight, strangely quiet.
I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in or if you just
I don't know.
I'm trying to get a feel.
What is going through Jamie's mind?
Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective.
Moving forward.
Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.
What does that have to do with anything?
It has to do with bad driving and good driving.
So how about Smackdown, right?
There's going to be some Smackdown in here pretty soon.
on a new Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 edition to be on the PS3, Wii, DS, also a bunch of other shit.
So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system, you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff.
and some of the fan requested updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience, out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff.
But I just think SmackDown vs. Raw is funny because it's like, you know, wrestling is like soap opera for guys.
Well, can you retire... Not this guy.
Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start your own reality show that appears on VH1?
You know, stuff like that.
Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan, though, he comes back a year later.
It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right?
Or whatever?
I'm so gay, obviously.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Alright, well...
I, uh, you like the last SmackDown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up, DarkSakura?
Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.
And, um, who puts the SmackDown when you and Dan do battle in SmackDown?
Um, I just make characters and make him use them.
I see.
I usually make really kick-ass characters, though.
Like, on the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was, like, this really pretty boy in Degeneration X, and then we just let him play in, um, in, uh,
On Watch Mode, where you could just watch all the matches, and he won every single match, had all the belts.
We even put him in a women's match.
That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game.
But still, he had all the belts.
He was fucking awesome.
All right.
I just remember because he was pretty.
Pretty Boy.
Was that his wrestling name, Pretty Boy?
No, he had some cool name, but he was just... I think his name was actually just Mr. X. How original.
All right.
Macy, what, you had something to say?
Macy has a joke about wrestling.
Sure, why not?
We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with a joke.
The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.
How's that?
Just watch professional wrestling and then watch some gay porn.
Not much difference.
All right.
Some advice from Macy there.
All right.
Well, we are going to take a quick break here.
Hey, the lesbians saw boobies.
What are you looking at here?
I'm on Destructoid, and I'm just scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore69, Celebrity Boobs, and Nakedness, etc.
And they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller on there.
Is it like an April Fool's joke or something?
I don't know.
I'm just scrolling down.
They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.
I do like that site.
It's a lot of fun.
Alright, um...
I guess that's going to do it though for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
And if you're thinking, gosh, this was a little short, well, you know, don't forget we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was a separate show.
But we will be back for your full Part B right after a quick little segment here.
And coming up in Part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite because there's a lot on that.
We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers, Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.
Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
