Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We're here on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 29th of 2007, continuing on with episode number 229 of our show.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
If you are just tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the very first time, hi, how are you?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
But you're listening to the second part of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
If you want to go back in our audio archive and listen to the first part, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
All the details are there or whatever program you use to get this program like maybe iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
There should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
And, of course, our chat room is over at www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
And we always like to read your comments.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
And, of course, the Skype line will be open in the show a little later.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
The iToy is no more as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out and it's called just the Eye, not the iToy because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
And the camera will now instead of taking 320 by, or no, I think before like the camera was only taking like what, 300 by 200, I mean it was really small.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
That's not bad.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It's not HD, but that's not bad.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Or 320 at twice that.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye, but I guess so.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
So there you go.

01:50.000 --> 02:01.000
It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.

02:01.000 --> 02:13.000
You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself, dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Enjoy.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Does this have anything to do with the exclusive release Loki got word about for The Brown Eye of Judgment some months ago?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I have no idea. Possibly.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't know, Loki. How about The Brown Eye of Judgment?

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Speaking of The Brown Eye of Judgment, it's a sisterly game or brotherly game, whatever.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
The Eye of Judgment has been dated for the very specific date of fall, and that's for Japan, of course.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
Anyways, it is going to use the eye camera, and it's going to be a card game.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hurrah.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like 80 bucks if this game is bundled in there.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
To be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Looks exactly the same to me.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff, have they?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Let me put it this way.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Granted, the camera is better than the last camera.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
But let's just look at the examples here, and I'm not just saying that the eye toys suck.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Because to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks as well.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special...

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
If that's actually what it can do, then great.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And according to this, I think you can.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But if it does suck, I'm going to be fucking pissed again.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But I'm not buying it.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I was going to say, are you actually buying this to try it out?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Don't buy it, exactly.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera,

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That was very fucking lame.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
I wanted that game to be so good, and then it required the camera,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and I said, screw it.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
but I don't want to use it.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
It's useless.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I seriously don't even want to play it.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Apparently in multiplayer, you get to see other people playing the game,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
which might be kind of funny.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I would play it just so I could play it.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
maybe somebody in chat can clarify,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
but if that's true, then you can play that by waving your arms,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and we could all have a laugh.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That might be a good use of the...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You can already do that with DDR, though.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That might be a good use of the Xbox 360.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I did show him the orange bat, by the way.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
All right, anyway.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh, yes, the bat.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That's old.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I saw the bat.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Did you go to her house and play pinball?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
March soccer invited me over, and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
and then Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was great.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
The only PS3 game I've ever played, but it was tons of fun.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Cool. All right. Good job.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I played Deadpool the whole time. It was great.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, she did. Nerd.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
She was kicking ass.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, who are you playing?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I played Thor, and then I played Iron Man.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I played a lot of Iron Man, and I was like, dude...

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Dude, he has a freaking rocket kick. It's great.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
All right. No Wonder Woman still.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It's Marvel!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That's my new favorite joke on this show.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's not a very good joke.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
It's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
You can play Spider Woman.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Uh, my word.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Anyway.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Pinball's awesome.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
So, moving forward, shall I?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.

06:27.000 --> 06:38.000
Hasbro, actually, is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
God, why?

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, no.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Our card crack!

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Me too.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I started playing Magic again.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I had my black bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books,

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I just gave them away because they were my...

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Why don't you sell half of it?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
No, but...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I sold what I could out of it, like my Moxes.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No, I go outdoors.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I sold my Moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert, nerd alert!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, anyway.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
This show has reached maximum nerd levels.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get money for or I can see naked chicks.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And obviously Magic has neither of those.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I used to play the Illuminati game.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Oh, was that good?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
That was really fun.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert!

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Anyway, so yeah, Hasbro's bringing out cards for piece of shit the game.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Piece of shit the game?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
No, what's kind of funny though is they're still producing these cards,

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
but you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
because the camera doesn't know any different.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
It's a fucking camera, it's a card, and boom, works!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I was going to ask you about this.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, in fact, it's really complicated to play the game,

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
because otherwise they'll just recast the card,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
because the game doesn't know.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
It's very fucking complicated to play,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and when I ask them, I'm like,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
What's the point of this game?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
See, it's just retarded.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It's a fucking tech demo.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
but the problem is it's thinking a little too far outside of the box.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
It's one thing to think outside the box if the box is made out of cardboard.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
All it's really going to do is supplement.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
Say, for example, if you want to take this and make an official Magic of the Gathering game,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
The Judgment or something like that,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
and actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and it just enhances that.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
you can place them down,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
To be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't think anyone's going to give a shit,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
like any other iToy game that's out on the market right now

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
because they're frustrating and don't work properly.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I will give a shit when you can hack that thing like people have hacked other games

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
so we can get our OLR game going

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
and we can see a little dancing Rob whenever we put his card down.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Oh, hooray.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I am so excited. I just can't hide it.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That will go on YouTube.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Sony is creating a service called iVEO.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
It's a video sharing site in Japan,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
and of course it's something that's going to hopefully,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
if PlayStation gets their way in,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Sony will compete against YouTube.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
What's interesting about it is that you can actually download

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
There will be a mobile version of this service as well,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
which is kind of funny.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So there it is.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation i,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
you'll also be able to upload those to the service,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
and then so you can hopefully someday download

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
My Humps, My Humps, My Humps.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And it's definitely not in slow motion.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Come on, just My Lovely Lady Humps.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Come on, Loki.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So retarded.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Anyways, so some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
They've actually put out a new patent.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
James Patrick in chat says,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
How is it a good idea? Just go to YouTube.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Zing.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Sorry, Loki.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Anyways, so they have a brand new patent,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And what this basically is, in layman's terms,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
is it will actually use your console to have,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
communicate with other devices, like handheld devices.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So say for example, I have a Playstation 3,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
although this isn't a Microsoft thing,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
but say I had a Playstation 3, and they have this thing in it,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
but at the same time, my game system is communicating to my PSP

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
So this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to,

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
I guess, speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out more polygons and whatnot.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Or fold proteins.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Goody, goody, goody.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Fuck that shit.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I am damn well not wasting my console resources,

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
So this is like the original design for the cell processor,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
except that it works with things that aren't Sony branded.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, something like that.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That's right.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Wait, is this Microsoft?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
This is Microsoft, right?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, this is Microsoft.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
It says basically in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
and consoles in a way that increases the processing power

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
of all the connected devices.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
The more gaming components in the network,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
the more computing power is generated.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
So can you imagine?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
So it's Voltron, right?

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
No, it's not gay, and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
No, it's Voltron.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I like vehicle Voltron.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Microsoft has just patented Voltron.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
That's what it is. It's Voltron.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It doesn't have theme music. It isn't Voltron.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I like vehicle Voltron.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I like vehicle Voltron.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Hey, guess what?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
What?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
A lot cooler.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Yes, Star Soccer. A lot cooler.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Tron.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Tron.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
That's like Voltron without a mole.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
You can't make Voltron without Tron.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Great minds.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Rob, three words for you.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Great minds think like me.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
End of line.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Anyway.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Four words for you. Die in a fire.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
For people who don't know,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
which I have on laserdisc and DVD.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I have like the Uber, Uber laserdisc that's like,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
you know, this big fat box of Tron.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
This reminds me of something, if I may, real quick.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
No, Dark Soccer, trust me.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
This will have your blessing.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
What?

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
What does that have to do with Tron?

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
F you to Disney for not having the people mover.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I know.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
All because that stupid grad jumped off of it.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Because the people mover.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Most graduate high school and jump off the people mover.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Tron ride at Disneyland.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Because you could go through like Tron,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
which is the coolest thing ever.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And I believe Tim Curry narrated it,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
which makes it just double cool.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You know what they could do though?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
And so, you know,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
if they should do instead of the people movers,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
actually just do the things together,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
like a little track ride and have it enclosed.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yes.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It was called the Rocket Rods.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Also someone died on that one and they removed that as well.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
and I rode on it in the back.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some games.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
because it was like the people movers,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Same track.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
It went through the Tron thing too.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It was just like pew, real fast.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
No narration.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Tron.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Tron.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Anyway, although Disney Interactive has not confirmed this yet,

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
the ESRB is actually reviewing a rating for the discs of Tron.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
And also it says there's another one supposed to be coming out,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
but they were talking about a...

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
IGN actually was saying that they received a package

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
that included a DVD of Tron

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
and a note that says, SARC is ready, are you?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And so we're getting...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, sorry.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Another note to that was,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
two classics return this summer to the arcade.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
More data to be downloaded soon.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
That is so frickin' rad, I can't even contain myself.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I found the Discs of Tron machine.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
That was an excellent game.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
The light cycles, that little cone thing.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Did you ever play Tron 2.0?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
No, I never did.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
There's something that Dan downloaded a while back,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
and it was pretty fun.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It's actually just a light cycle game.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I was about to say, the online one?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, the online light cycle game.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That was pretty cool.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
That Tron 2.0 though was supposed to be like a big play-through game.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Because you're a nerd.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
No, Dan was using my laptop last and...

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
God.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Anyway.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Tron is one letter off from Pron.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
That's true.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Do you know how everyone misspells porn?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Pron.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Tron.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
T-R-0-N.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Discs of Pron.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh no, that's what Dark Sakura denies having, is hard discs of Pron.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
What?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
End of line.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh wait, no, I pointed...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Loki's like sitting here going,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Are you going to cut her off yet with the next story?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
And I'm going,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Come on, Loki, get into your story.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Oops, it's my turn.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Hi.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Rob.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No, I just wanted to try that one time.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
It doesn't work for you, it works for her.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
It's actually kind of fun.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
No, it's not.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
the way.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
Now, it's one step above a rumor because harmonics fans seemed to call the first set of arcade

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
packs before they came out, so this looks like it could be pretty true, is that there

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Pack one will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
and The Black Hearts and Cochise by Audioslave.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Content pack two will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
And content pack three will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
then fail.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Although, I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had these one packs that cost 200 points and these

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
other packs that cost 100 points?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
That would look kind of stupid, so I think they're going to be the same price like it

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
or not.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Everybody bought them.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
The market sustains it.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Exactly.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Ditto.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
That's kind of rad.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That was the one pack I really didn't want.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I didn't enjoy any of those songs nearly as much as the others.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
Anyways, there's a rumor that the BioWare sci-fi role-playing game, you know, this phenomenal

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
So, it's rumor mill and yada, yada, yada.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
It's actually moved.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
What, what, what?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Nothing.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I didn't say anything.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Did you say it's actually true?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Probably.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
And how would you know this?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Because I heard about it before.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh, right.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
But it's probably true.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
It's not done.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Let me put it this way.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
It's not coming out, you know, right now, but definitely later.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So September until you get your Mass Effect.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Sorry.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
East.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
At least.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at Too Human, delayed to like next year.

19:49.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
their games division is actually reporting a lower sales by 21%.

20:05.000 --> 20:17.000
Basically, they've had a drop from 402 million for this quarter last year to 315 million.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
So that's quite a bit.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
They're basically saying the revenues were actually down by $1.2 billion.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
So.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
Of course, it's not surprising, you know, they've lost a lot of money before with their

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
product.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
2003.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
See, there's that shipped again.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
It's not sold, it's shipped.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Shipped equals sitting on store shelves collecting dust.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And they're up, you know, but also during the same time, their operating losses fell

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
by 20%.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
So maybe it's going to balance.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
They'll pull through.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
They have the resources.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
It's Microsoft.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
They have the power of gates because he's tainted them.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
It'll be fine.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
They'll be fine.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Halo 3 is on its way.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Halo Wars.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
They'll be fine.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I see their parachutes.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
All right.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
This is not going to help their situation though much.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Sorry.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
have any sort of idea what's coming out the list mass effect for September as well.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
So, you know, you heard it from Gamefly.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
It's September because they were, they were listing some other weird title called like

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out ever.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Didn't some little internet radio sites somewhere mentioned that one once?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
No, we disavow all knowledge of that.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Look, he's afraid of getting NAMM code by nine Microsoft.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
NAMM code is a verb now.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Some site somewhere.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Some, something we wish would get NAMM code is this, although I don't see how that's possible.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
But, look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox live marketplace recently and what

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
they are is they're 100 MS point videos.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Basically all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
of War.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And they have one of these videos for each chapter.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
So, basically you could spend, what about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
That's awesome except for the facts that YouTube and game FAQs and many other gaming sites

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
So, Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
strategy guides.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
So, you know, should they stop publishing strategy guides since game FAQs are out there?

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
that you can't really get online.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
And they make great coffee table books for the gamer.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
They really do.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
But a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of like cool

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
art and stuff.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, you know, I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Same thing with strategy guides.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't know about these videos though.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay because if there are suckers out

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're going to sell it and that's

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
just going to motivate them to make more.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
I'm just going to say a preemptive F.U. to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy type videos for free.

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
Well, apparently, Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kane & Lynch

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
and Crossfire.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't know, news to me, but they are now coming out on both systems.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
I don't know why this is a big surprise because, I mean, how many games like before came out

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Who gives a fuck anyways?

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
So, you know, heavenly sword.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
So, you know, whatever.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing the

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
exclusive things.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
So, you know, there's been a lot of ra-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Cry is coming out on 360, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
working the other way.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I don't know.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I think it's just really, it's not surprising, though.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
I mean, that's just, why would you publish something for one system, only one system,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
unless, I don't know.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't know why you would just do that.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I mean, more people, even if it is only a few million more, more is better.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
So, I don't know.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
Ravenstaufen is in our chat room and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It's like, I do not give a shit.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I thought we were like that every week.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I really don't some weeks.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Let's see, and Kiki's in our chat room.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
That's a new name.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Hi, Kiki.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Says, Rob, Rob, Rob.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
That sounds awesome.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
All right.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Deakman says, announcement of the podcast.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
My girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Wow.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Congratulations.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Oh, what's that?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh, my.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
No.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Really, Dark Sakura?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
No.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
You're not Deakman's baby?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
No.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You're not Mary Deakman's baby?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Hi, Mary.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't even carry my own husband.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
We kid.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
We kid.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
We kid.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
I wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 AM by

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
a cesarean.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 AM.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
He is six pounds eight ounces.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
How come you have it at 6.66 AM?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah, Rob, duh.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
It's a joke, people.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It's a joke.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
But his name is Julian Donald.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
He just did not want to come out, anyway.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
So, I did want to share that, though, with everyone because I'm very...

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
I feel what that baby's going through, not wanting to come out.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
Seriously, though, this is my friend's first baby, and I'm very excited for her.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Congratulations to her.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Thank you.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
And to Deakman.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
See, we have someone nice in the room, Rob.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
God of War.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
How about a decapitated goat?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
No.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It's an offering.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
I think it's great, though, because his parents are both Trekkies.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
They didn't name the kid Spock, did they?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
His name is Julian.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Okay.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Wait a minute.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Wasn't that Picard's real name or something?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I don't know.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I forget it.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Jean-Luc?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Patrick Stewart.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I swear I read that in some dig article this week.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
It was supposed to be Julian Picard, and they changed it last minute.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Guess what, Rob?

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
I think we have another segment to do.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
Every week, you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and I'm so excited.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
The Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
emails for you to read.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Let's start the mailbag segment.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Hooray.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
You can read them with that attitude.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
Anyway, first email is from Ariz...

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Should I get an Xbox 360?

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
I have a high death monitor that can support 360 VGA.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Is it worth it?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
No, get a Wii.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
No, you should get a 360.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
live.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I have live and I don't play games over it.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
Although I do like to download some arcade games, but you'd be fine without it.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Get a Wii.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
So I've got live silver and I play on a monitor, which looks fine.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I'd say a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Yes.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
So what games do you want to play?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
You can play mature games, so there's nothing really good out.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Anyway.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Oh, that's true.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Sorry, I stepped out of the room, but Warrior Bob sounded like he was on target.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
What game was that?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Test Drive.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
That is not a mature game and it is awesome.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I love it.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Next email comes from AZHP.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad dirty jokes that people have been coming

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
up with.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I'm here to save you guys.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Let me pull up the ad.

29:15.000 --> 29:22.000
Oh God, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
share with our chat room right now.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
There you go, everybody.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual in the windows in

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
it.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
It's very small for me to read.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I use a higher resolution, obviously.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Anyway, here it is.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
The text says this and this is no joke.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Please have this read in the slightest voice you can find in the studio.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Well, fuck that.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm going to use my regular voice.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night and you're warm and safe in your living

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Killing vampires goes great with friends and the closest ones you have here are helping

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
you through a tough level.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
You pause.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
There are monsters up ahead and you're unsure of how to proceed.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Perhaps it's something in the juice.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Perhaps it's the high from the intense side scrolling action that only NES can deliver,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
which is a lie because the Genesis had it, too, and so did the Master System.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
But there seems to soar around the two of you.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
You don't look away.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
You can't.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
It scares you, yet you must have it.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Your gaze never breaks.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Neither does his.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions and fantasy lands.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Tonight there will be a new adventure.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Nintendo, now you're playing with power.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
What did you see in his eyes?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You saw blast processing.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Game power.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
In the U.S.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Or Japan or whatever.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Oh really?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
That's where it's at.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Korea?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Alright.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I wonder about that.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, you're right.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Anyway, next email, shall I?

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
week.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Can I say it real fast?

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
Unlike the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck, I actually like your

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
show.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Can I continue please?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Alright, sorry.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Week after week, I listen to the cowardly beat around the bush responses, Apple sucks,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Apple blows.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well thought out, valid response

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
to that argument.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Is it because you can't run Windows?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Oh wait, yes you can.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Is it because you can't play the Sims?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance, oh wait, yes you can.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Would you feel better if they called it a Zune cast?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I guess because me and Chris bought him a Zune.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Hi.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Weren't you listening to this?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got him

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
a Zune.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Hi.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
And sure, you did just out of spite.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Have you tried to install Vista yet?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I believe if you did, you'll notice it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total rip off of the

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh, and this was by, God, I'm sorry I closed the email.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
God wrote that email?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Oh my gosh, you are fucked, Loki.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I closed your email, I'm sorry person.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh wait, here it is.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
It's by JG2000.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Oh, not God, one of those.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
Phew, I was going to say, God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I'm not fucked.

32:58.000 --> 33:05.000
No, but seriously though, I mean, let's talk about what they're doing to basically advertise

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
the iMac right now.

33:07.000 --> 33:15.000
They're talking about how, oh yes, programs are so hard to install, but with Apple you

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
don't have to do anything because they're all preloaded on there for you.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
Well that's good that you've preloaded the software that will actually run on a Mac versus

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
we're not talking about Doom 2 or stuff like that.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
Oh goody, Prey plays on there, wonderful.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
based on colors or flavors as I should put it.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Who cares what color the damn system is?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
If I can't fucking install-

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Nintendo DS.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
That's retarded that they even sell it by colors.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
But to be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
I really don't.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
It sucks, I'm not going to buy one, and you know what?

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
But you know what?

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
But whenever I guess the next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out, Mac's definitely not

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
going to be able to play it.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Eh, I still like being bi with computers.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop, works great.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's just two emails, it's quick.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh well the iDVD, it's so awesome, you know.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
There's programs out there that use, they're on everything.

34:54.000 --> 35:01.000
Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
all the programs are there for you, and you don't need to download any extra stuff.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
But you know what?

35:07.000 --> 35:13.000
People like me, who aren't super basic with computers, like to have that option to customize

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
things, and you know, I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So shall I move on to the next email then?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Yes, please.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Okay, hi guys.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Hey, boobs please, thank you.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm just writing to let you know.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
It was me saying that because he said guys, and I'm like, no.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
No.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
BPC, thank you.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I thought that was a request.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I'm like, well if you really want, I'll just.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Rob, no, I don't need that.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
Anyway, I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
No, thank you.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
I'm studying abroad from my junior year of high school in Italy right now.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Lucky.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
They never fail to disappoint.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
And they never fail to disappoint.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
What?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Okay.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
They never.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Anyway.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I don't think that was what they meant.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
I don't think that's what they meant.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Chirp, chirp, chirp.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Everything else is all positive.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
What?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Anyway.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
here and you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I haven't put a review up yet.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I should do that.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Could you do that?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Could you put a five.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
OLR never fails to disappoint.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Thank you.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
I saw that.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
That was beautiful.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Okay, anyway.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer and more specifically a

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Bimani fan care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn,

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
the vagina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I won't say last name unless he wants me to.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
P.S.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.400
I challenge Guy's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to

37:22.400 --> 37:25.000
duel to the death over said throne at any time.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky unwashed toilet.

37:29.000 --> 37:40.200
Okay, I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at

37:40.200 --> 37:41.200
Halo 2.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.000
But what if you fail to disappoint?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Then you lose.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
So hey, I'm really curious.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Matthew, was that the name?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Matthew, you're in Italy and that's okay.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
That's pretty awesome.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
First of all, listener base is international.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Rock.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan and I'm curious.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
What is the Bimani and arcade scene like over there?

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
heard this confirmed.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Not Japan.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Well, yeah, not Japan.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Well, unless you count Ticket Games and Pachinko.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Anyway.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Japan has tons of arcades.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Which I do.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.440
Anyway, the last email tonight.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.000
This is from Sakura Max.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.960
Anime was created because we killed ourself because hot anime chicks don't exist in real

38:25.960 --> 38:26.960
life.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.960
Okay.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.060
I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.

38:30.060 --> 38:35.600
I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth two weeks

38:35.600 --> 38:37.480
ago reference to my email.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
Rita Dracer.

38:38.480 --> 38:43.880
I recommend any MMOs, I already played Maplestory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy

38:43.880 --> 38:47.040
Online, Fly FF, Gunbound, GunZ, and Ragnarok.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.200
I think that's it.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.520
Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.400
Those guys' emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.680
Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like...

38:59.680 --> 39:01.680
I can't say I have.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.120
Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.120
No, seriously.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
No, no, seriously.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.280
I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is the side

39:09.280 --> 39:10.280
I love.

39:10.280 --> 39:16.720
But if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, World Peace,

39:16.720 --> 39:20.520
I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, all these random things.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
What's this guy saying?

39:21.520 --> 39:27.300
He's like, I was once served in a tavern medium rare.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.600
It's like poetry practically.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.480
I love the signature best on this though.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.280
Let me read this to you.

39:34.280 --> 39:38.920
Zachary Maxx, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.

39:38.920 --> 39:43.200
You get a gold star just for your closing to that email.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.200
You can play Loki's game.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.200
Done.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.760
Next, please.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.160
All right.

39:49.160 --> 39:54.600
Well, then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.640
Meanwhile, more news, and we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.320
I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.240
There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.880
Robert Garcia, the man who brought us is Dan Hideki.

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
Right.

40:08.880 --> 40:09.880
Yee-hoo!

40:09.880 --> 40:10.880
I get that joke.

40:10.880 --> 40:15.800
Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.120
I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2, and this is, again, thanks

40:19.120 --> 40:25.400
to the ESRB, who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.

40:25.400 --> 40:29.040
The ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.

40:29.040 --> 40:35.600
Of course, the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally

40:35.600 --> 40:37.000
came out on the Neo Geo.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Awesome.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.480
You know what else it does?

40:39.480 --> 40:45.840
It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.

40:45.840 --> 40:51.320
They've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.760
They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.800
Make something new.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.760
Weren't Neo Geo games supposed to come to Virtual Console anyway?

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
That's not new.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.240
That's old shit, again.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.280
There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.040
That was new, and it was really good.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.000
Oh, well, one game.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.480
I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.

41:17.480 --> 41:24.280
All right, well, anyway, so that's an Art of Fighting.

41:24.280 --> 41:30.040
Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to

41:30.040 --> 41:31.040
the DS.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.920
Yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on that screen.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.920
Yay.

41:35.920 --> 41:39.160
Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.280
Exactly.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.440
Don't die.

41:41.440 --> 41:47.440
It's going to feature wonderful tracks like the Super Mario Brothers theme, as well as

41:47.440 --> 41:55.560
classical tunes like Flight of the Bumblebee, and let's see, some J-pop songs like Dance

41:55.560 --> 42:00.760
2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.800
Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that

42:04.800 --> 42:07.600
song that goes, I don't want to work.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.760
I just want to bang on Z-Drum all day.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.760
You know that song?

42:11.760 --> 42:13.040
No.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.880
Never mind.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.120
We'll just clip that out of the audio archive.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.840
We'll just make that an edit.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.160
No.

42:22.160 --> 42:25.760
Well, I don't know.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.320
Is there any fun peripheral to come with it, or are they just doing the Leap Beat Agents

42:29.320 --> 42:30.760
thing where you just tap on the thing?

42:30.760 --> 42:33.200
The Leap Beat Agents thing.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.240
It's kind of boring to me.

42:36.240 --> 42:41.020
Well, there is actually something that might not be so boring, because I think this is

42:41.020 --> 42:42.800
really cool.

42:42.800 --> 42:52.040
There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious, about a person jailed for

42:52.040 --> 42:58.320
the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack.

42:58.320 --> 43:06.580
So it's a shooter that's like House of the Dead, and what's that other one?

43:06.580 --> 43:09.320
Like the Ghost Squad.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.320
Like a light gun shooter.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.800
Yeah, it's a light gun shooter, but you're using your stylus.

43:13.800 --> 43:18.880
So you shoot zombies dead with the power of tapping.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.760
Like point blank on the DS, right?

43:20.760 --> 43:22.440
Yeah, like that.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.760
And you also have multiple possible endings depending on which way you do it, so that's

43:25.760 --> 43:26.920
pretty cool.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.280
I like Killing the Undead.

43:29.280 --> 43:34.560
You know, there's a new game, and I'm thinking it's probably the same thing.

43:34.560 --> 43:43.240
It's actually coming out in June called Touch the Dead, which I think may be the US version

43:43.240 --> 43:45.920
of Dead and Furious.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.120
They will have to change that name.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
Touch the Dead.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.800
Yes, that is the actual name.

43:50.800 --> 43:54.400
That's actually what Sony was inviting everyone to do at their God of War II press conference,

43:54.400 --> 43:55.400
to Touch the Dead.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
They asked you to eat stuff out of it.

43:56.400 --> 44:02.680
Apparently, the goat was emptied out, and they had some fake stuff, or some sort of

44:02.680 --> 44:05.440
dish I guess that's like intestines in there.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.440
Awful.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.440
It's so disgusting.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.160
Apparently, it came from a butcher making that okay, because it's from a butcher.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.880
Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?

44:14.880 --> 44:17.680
Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.760
Well, you can actually buy horse meat on the market.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.860
They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.

44:23.860 --> 44:26.280
They sell horse meat for international consumption.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.480
I know, and I really want some.

44:28.480 --> 44:34.880
Anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have, and they were doing all the jokes.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.120
This really gets my goat.

44:36.120 --> 44:41.080
This is nothing to lose your head over.

44:41.080 --> 44:44.560
Gotta love the internet.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.680
The Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly

44:48.680 --> 44:51.160
because they open it up and free and all that stuff.

44:51.160 --> 44:54.200
One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put

44:54.200 --> 44:55.880
gay marriage in the game.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.520
They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.

44:58.520 --> 45:02.440
In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're

45:02.440 --> 45:03.840
not going to have marriage in the game at all.

45:03.840 --> 45:04.840
It's stupid.

45:04.840 --> 45:05.840
Why would you want marriage in the game?

45:05.840 --> 45:07.520
In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.280
It was completely pointless.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.360
You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.360
This is stupid.

45:14.360 --> 45:17.720
I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.360
You actually could share your hit points.

45:20.360 --> 45:24.320
You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.

45:24.320 --> 45:28.480
There are also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody

45:28.480 --> 45:30.040
else.

45:30.040 --> 45:34.620
On the private server I played on, the mods that actually have it were in the game.

45:34.620 --> 45:40.240
It was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.

45:40.240 --> 45:45.720
If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you could marry anything, including

45:45.720 --> 45:48.600
the villains and creatures that you're fighting.

45:48.600 --> 45:51.320
You would cast a spell and you'd be like- I married a zombie.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
I married the rabbit.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.680
No, I'm going to kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.560
No, it's like the end of Shaun of the Dead.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.440
But I still have the ring.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.440
He's my husband.

46:01.440 --> 46:02.440
Wow.

46:02.440 --> 46:08.080
Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that the Lords of the Ring Online, they

46:08.080 --> 46:10.840
decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the

46:10.840 --> 46:12.940
original books.

46:12.940 --> 46:19.020
Although they had some inter-special dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were

46:19.020 --> 46:20.160
going to have that.

46:20.160 --> 46:25.400
There was no mention in the books ever of two males or two females marrying, so they

46:25.400 --> 46:26.400
weren't going to put it in the game.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.720
You know the elves are doing it.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.720
But who knows?

46:29.720 --> 46:33.120
They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull

46:33.120 --> 46:34.840
the marriage option all together.

46:34.840 --> 46:39.320
And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining the Lords of the Ring Online,

46:39.320 --> 46:42.800
you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game because the game

46:42.800 --> 46:46.300
sucks a lot.

46:46.300 --> 46:49.320
If you want to play Lords of the Ring Online, just go play World of Warcraft, seriously.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.360
Did you say Lords of the Ring?

46:51.360 --> 46:52.360
I don't know.

46:52.360 --> 46:53.360
It's the Lord of the Rings.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.360
You've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.540
Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.

46:56.540 --> 46:57.540
That's their problem.

46:57.540 --> 47:00.680
It's a load balancing issue.

47:00.680 --> 47:06.760
Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever

47:06.760 --> 47:08.440
you want in the game.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.640
Actually we have another announcement speaking of marriages.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.340
Okay.

47:13.340 --> 47:17.080
This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.600
His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today and she said yes, and they're getting

47:20.600 --> 47:21.880
married in an anime con.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.120
Are they listening to the show?

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
I believe so.

47:25.120 --> 47:30.000
Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.640
This is don't give a shit night.

47:32.640 --> 47:40.240
I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards, especially Loki.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.200
I just got us on a PM, just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
dump right now.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.840
Did he get married to him?

47:49.840 --> 47:51.400
This is about marriage right now.

47:51.400 --> 47:57.920
Oh my God, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.

47:57.920 --> 48:02.020
Does this show cause people to want to release or something?

48:02.020 --> 48:03.020
It's possible.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.020
Okay.

48:04.020 --> 48:07.360
Congratulations to Ranma's friend because that's awesome.

48:07.360 --> 48:13.760
And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still horse from California screaming.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.920
And congratulations to your other friend's pals.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.920
That's amazing.

48:16.920 --> 48:17.920
Awesome.

48:17.920 --> 48:24.600
Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version because

48:24.600 --> 48:29.560
the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created causing the

48:29.560 --> 48:33.080
game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.

48:33.080 --> 48:39.000
But as you're probably listening to this podcast now or tomorrow if you're listening to it

48:39.000 --> 48:41.160
live, there will be a patch.

48:41.160 --> 48:48.440
So yay, your expansion will work as it should have when you first downloaded it.

48:48.440 --> 48:51.600
Had they tested the damn game, tested the game.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
That's very important.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.680
Don't just release his shit and patch it later.

48:55.680 --> 49:00.160
That's all I got.

49:00.160 --> 49:02.040
All right.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.040
Anyway.

49:03.040 --> 49:10.360
Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about because what?

49:10.360 --> 49:11.440
It's the theme.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
It really is.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.800
Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.

49:13.800 --> 49:20.400
Well, just because I hate Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, because I know people, I had an ex who

49:20.400 --> 49:27.040
would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.

49:27.040 --> 49:30.520
And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.240
And I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.

49:32.240 --> 49:36.920
But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like

49:36.920 --> 49:40.360
five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.

49:40.360 --> 49:46.960
So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed in the US and in Europe until

49:46.960 --> 49:50.600
first quarter of 2008.

49:50.600 --> 49:51.600
So yeah.

49:51.600 --> 49:58.840
And in other news, RicePrinceOfAllCosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.320
You guys are so freaking mature.

50:00.320 --> 50:03.720
I was just picking that up.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.720
Mature.

50:05.720 --> 50:15.920
Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.

50:15.920 --> 50:16.920
Dear God, why?

50:16.920 --> 50:18.240
That game is shit on ice.

50:18.240 --> 50:19.640
I actually like that game.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.040
Exactly why I used that transition.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.

50:23.040 --> 50:26.440
Well, I think, okay, because I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind

50:26.440 --> 50:28.920
of loose and just you running around.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Damn it.

50:29.920 --> 50:32.040
Loose like the bowels?

50:32.040 --> 50:34.360
I should have thought that up before I said that.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.080
They were not terrible, okay.

50:37.080 --> 50:41.240
There was not much there but battle system and so I grew to like it because I played

50:41.240 --> 50:42.240
it too much.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.240
So now I like the universe.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.240
I think I remember correctly.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.480
I don't know if it was something limited or whatever, but I think that you can get this

50:46.480 --> 50:50.040
game for like 20 bucks now, which I mean for that price is not that bad.

50:50.040 --> 50:54.600
I mean, especially when you consider it does have a single player game portion of it.

50:54.600 --> 51:00.080
I mean, so you are getting an actual RPG, which for 20 bucks, that's not bad at all.

51:00.080 --> 51:07.640
And this is what you do in said RPG, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y.

51:07.640 --> 51:08.880
That batch of monsters is dead.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.880
Let's go to the next zone.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
Just like every other bow I've ever played.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.200
X, X, Y, X, X, Y.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.960
It's like all you did in the whole game.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
That's three buttons.

51:17.960 --> 51:20.960
Most RPGs have one attack.

51:20.960 --> 51:24.960
So Phantasy Star universe is getting an expansion, it's called Ambition of the Illuminous and

51:24.960 --> 51:28.500
I have to confess the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said abortion

51:28.500 --> 51:30.000
of the illuminous.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.120
Like I said, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.120
I actually read that.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.640
I was like, what?

51:34.640 --> 51:35.840
Abortion of the illuminous?

51:35.840 --> 51:43.240
And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous and yeah, that's the title and there's going

51:43.240 --> 51:47.960
to be some new weapon types, Medug, Shadug and Whip.

51:47.960 --> 51:53.320
And also there'll be new photon arts and yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's going

51:53.320 --> 51:54.320
to be new planets as well.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.380
I don't see how there couldn't be.

51:56.380 --> 52:00.440
If you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.320
If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're going to have to buy a new disc, which

52:04.320 --> 52:07.160
seems weird because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.

52:07.160 --> 52:11.420
I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello, oh well.

52:11.420 --> 52:15.440
So there it is, abortion of the illuminous coming soon.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.440
Abortion of the illuminous.

52:16.440 --> 52:24.720
That's so wrong, but anyways, now the brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today

52:24.720 --> 52:32.520
and if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard

52:32.520 --> 52:40.000
drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could of course hack your current drive

52:40.000 --> 52:44.680
for say about $80 and get 120GB as well.

52:44.680 --> 52:51.960
And this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program

52:51.960 --> 52:58.760
of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things, you can create your

52:58.760 --> 53:04.200
own 120GB drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.

53:04.200 --> 53:09.600
I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there

53:09.600 --> 53:14.100
without having to hack the whole drive apart, which I'm sure someone can create if it's

53:14.100 --> 53:17.100
not already available, to just do that.

53:17.100 --> 53:19.560
Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.

53:19.560 --> 53:25.120
Why they don't have that anyways is beyond me.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.740
But there you go, save $100.

53:26.740 --> 53:30.000
If you're not going to buy an Elite system and just want a larger hard drive, might as

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
well.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.200
All right, hacking and cracking.

53:34.200 --> 53:38.560
Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the

53:38.560 --> 53:41.720
internet and sometimes she stumbles upon to a website that she wants to share with all

53:41.720 --> 53:42.860
of you.

53:42.860 --> 53:54.680
It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.

53:54.680 --> 54:04.920
The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.

54:04.920 --> 54:12.320
It's a real life comics and from what I understand, he used to I think buy comics from my husband

54:12.320 --> 54:13.320
at the GameStop.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.440
He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.

54:15.440 --> 54:20.880
Yeah, okay, well he was local then, but it's a pretty cool webcomic as you check it out.

54:20.880 --> 54:28.800
The URL is reallifecomics.com, so it's funny, it's good.

54:28.800 --> 54:31.520
All right.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.920
I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
Yeah, cool.

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
Over in Folsom.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.920
Really?

54:36.920 --> 54:38.600
Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time and then I saw a picture of him on his site

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
like whoa, that guy.

54:40.600 --> 54:43.120
Did we ever run into each other playing DDR back in the day?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.840
Did you play at Folsom?

54:44.840 --> 54:47.520
We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
Jeez.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.520
Years ago.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.520
I wondered, do I know you?

54:51.520 --> 54:54.800
2001, did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?

54:54.800 --> 54:55.800
Back in the day, yeah.

54:55.800 --> 54:56.800
Wasn't that Scat?

54:56.800 --> 54:57.800
That was Scat.

54:57.800 --> 54:58.800
Sacramento's cosplaying tournament.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.800
Oh, God.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.800
Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.

55:00.800 --> 55:04.600
I started playing in 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.

55:04.600 --> 55:05.760
Oh, funny.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.760
Small world.

55:06.760 --> 55:07.760
Small world, jeez.

55:07.760 --> 55:08.760
Yeah, exactly.

55:08.760 --> 55:12.480
Small is my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives

55:12.480 --> 55:16.840
down my street, also happens to be in Denmark.

55:16.840 --> 55:17.840
Very strange.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.840
And they meet and have lunch.

55:18.840 --> 55:22.680
All right, well, it is a small world and we want to open up the world to call our show

55:22.680 --> 55:25.080
right now on the Skype line.

55:25.080 --> 55:29.000
If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always

55:29.000 --> 55:31.480
give us a call on the old telephone.

55:31.480 --> 55:40.320
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll take our calls on Skype.

55:40.320 --> 55:44.800
And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, you always go, why is it the same

55:44.800 --> 55:47.200
people calling into the show every week?

55:47.200 --> 55:51.000
Well, hey, it's an open line, all I got to do is give us a call Sunday.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.400
I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific time, you

55:54.400 --> 55:58.120
can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.560
So there you have it, 8.30 Pacific time.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

56:01.560 --> 56:02.560
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.560
Who's this?

56:03.560 --> 56:04.560
Hello.

56:04.560 --> 56:09.200
This is the dead goat from the God of War story.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.640
Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.720
Dead goat, do you have a name?

56:16.720 --> 56:18.200
My name's Bill.

56:18.200 --> 56:22.160
Well, hi, Bill, I'm really sorry to hear about this.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.780
I mean, gosh, what are your thoughts on being used as a dead carcass to promote God of War

56:26.780 --> 56:28.640
II?

56:28.640 --> 56:29.640
I don't know.

56:29.640 --> 56:37.480
Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.

56:37.480 --> 56:42.300
But I mean, some goats just get milked and are turned into goat milk, and some goats

56:42.300 --> 56:48.040
get turned into burgers in some countries, but you get to be a promotional icon for God

56:48.040 --> 56:49.040
of War II.

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
So that's kind of awesome, isn't it?

56:51.040 --> 56:56.320
Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.400
I thought that was kind of gross.

56:59.400 --> 57:03.640
But you got to hang out with topless women.

57:03.640 --> 57:05.440
I couldn't do anything with them.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.840
None of them were into goats.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.840
It made me so wack.

57:10.840 --> 57:16.040
Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, dead goat, Bill?

57:16.040 --> 57:20.560
I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.

57:20.560 --> 57:24.960
They want me to tell you to buy God of War II if you haven't.

57:24.960 --> 57:27.680
Well, I will definitely have to consider that.

57:27.680 --> 57:31.680
I mean, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our stations.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.880
Especially from beyond the grave.

57:33.880 --> 57:38.280
So shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.120
Well, thanks for letting me call in.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.840
I love listening to your show.

57:42.840 --> 57:43.840
No problem.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.240
Actually, I have another question.

57:45.240 --> 57:50.240
Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
episode?

57:51.240 --> 57:58.440
I'll get back to office, so I don't want to talk about it on the air.

57:58.440 --> 57:59.440
All right.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.080
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.080
Okay.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.080
Let us know, Bill.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.080
Okay.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.080
Thanks, Ryan.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
All right.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.080
Take care.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
Bye.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.080
Bye.

58:09.080 --> 58:10.080
Bye.

58:10.080 --> 58:17.080
Oh my God, there's tons of stupid people on the internet.

58:17.080 --> 58:19.680
What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?

58:19.680 --> 58:21.440
That's what I want to know.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.680
How do you get Skype in the graveyard?

58:22.680 --> 58:27.960
I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, tucking into a mic.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.360
We need to Photoshop that.

58:29.360 --> 58:31.680
They're going, crap, the levels are off.

58:31.680 --> 58:32.920
We need to adjust the microphone.

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
That needs to be imagined.

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
It's the guy who called it.

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
It's the Raven's Dolphin.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?

58:36.920 --> 58:39.280
Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.280
I called it.

58:40.280 --> 58:41.280
It's a chat room.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.280
What?

58:42.280 --> 58:43.280
It's a shit show.

58:43.280 --> 58:44.280
This is the what?

58:44.280 --> 58:45.280
I called it.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.840
You don't give a shit tonight.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.840
I know.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
Well, we don't give a shit.

58:48.840 --> 58:52.560
Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?

58:52.560 --> 58:55.440
What do you call tonight?

58:55.440 --> 58:56.440
I'm sorry, Rob.

58:56.440 --> 58:57.440
I'm pissing you off.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.560
I just want to say I love it.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.960
I love the tone.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.200
You love the tone tonight?

59:01.200 --> 59:02.840
Yeah, I love it.

59:02.840 --> 59:06.480
I love that you go like, Kane and Lynch is going to the PS3.

59:06.480 --> 59:08.400
I just don't give a shit.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.640
Well, I don't know.

59:10.640 --> 59:12.440
Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.

59:12.440 --> 59:16.560
Maybe, I don't know, maybe Dark Soccer and I rode California Screamin' one too many times

59:16.560 --> 59:20.920
and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.

59:20.920 --> 59:21.920
I don't know.

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
That made me laugh.

59:22.920 --> 59:28.880
Everyone was like, oh my God, Kane and Lynch is going multi platform and you can go like,

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
I don't give a shit.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.440
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

59:32.440 --> 59:33.440
What else is on your mind?

59:33.440 --> 59:35.440
Gaming-wise this week, Raven's Dolphin?

59:35.440 --> 59:40.000
Well, the Xbox Elite came out today and I think they're last.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
The what came out?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
The Elite.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.200
Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.

59:45.200 --> 59:49.240
Did anybody, well, Dark Soccer, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.

59:49.240 --> 59:50.240
Yes, I did.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.920
Now, what made you want to get one?

59:51.920 --> 59:52.920
It wasn't me.

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
It was Dan because our old one died.

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
Oh, that's right.

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
You guys had no one that died.

59:55.920 --> 59:57.440
Okay, well, I can see that.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.400
Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.960
When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960
them.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.840
So, I would like someone else to get an Elite.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840
All right.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.700
Well, Raven's Dolphin, you're just not interested.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.880
You don't think there's nothing.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.280
Do you own an Xbox 360 regular?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280
Of course, yes.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.880
I own a premium with the nice chrome thing, but I'm not going to taunt you with that.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.640
Well, that's, yeah, I only have a mediocre core system, but that's all right.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.080
I'm not hurting or anything.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.880
So you're just thinking the Elite's not worth the upgrade because you already own one?

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.560
Yeah, but I feel like, well, hold, now let me hear.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.380
I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.080
The DS Lite was an upgrade?

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.560
Yeah, I had a DS Lite and I upgraded to a DS Lite.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.560
I thought that was the world.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.280
Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing, but with the, you know,

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.760
with the Xbox 360 Elite, there's not really, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.840
that much new to it.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840
You know what I mean?

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.000
How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.400
I can't.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400
That's why I don't care.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400
Well, then there you go.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.400
All right.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400
All right, let's go.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400
Thank you.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400
No problem.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400
One more thing?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.200
This is a great show.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.520
I hope you do another bullshit episode.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520
We'll see.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
We'll see what kind of mood we're in next week.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520
All right.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520
Thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520
Bye.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
Later.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520
All right.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520
That was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.840
Let's go back to the phones and take another call.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.840
If you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840
Hello.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840
Who's this?

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:33.840
Hi.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840
This is Chris.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840
Hi, Chris.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.840
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Oh, wow.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.720
First of all, I just wanted to say I'm glad to show.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.320
I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.720
I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720
Welcome to the live experience.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.280
Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Ah, congratulations.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280
That's right.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.200
Sundays are big days for Wiis.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.960
Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buyer Toys R Us was going to have

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960
them?

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960
Is that how you got them?

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
No.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960
I actually had a friend from work.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.240
He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wiis in today.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.840
That was the most they had ever coming at one time.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840
Very cool.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
Thanks a lot.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.400
Did you buy any games for the Wii?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.720
No, I didn't.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.080
I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080
rent something.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080
I wasn't really interested in that.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:36.280
I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago, and now they have 45 Wiis

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280
coming out.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
I said they were competing.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280
Okay.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.280
That's a good thought.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.720
Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wiis, maybe to have a big push

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.840
the day the Elite came out?

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.800
That way, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800
have Wiis in stock.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.440
Maybe I should get that instead.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440
No.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440
No, you don't think that would happen?

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440
I don't think so.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440
All right.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440
Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440
No.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.040
I kind of feel they did a student out there.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.880
It really isn't a real successor to the original one.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.720
So you think that was kind of more of a response to the PlayStation 3 going, well, we have

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720
HDMI, MMMMS.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.840
So the Xbox 360 and Microsoft was like, well, I guess we'll just put this out there and

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.080
make Sony shut up.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.080
Yeah.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.520
I pretty much feel that that's what they all did.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.880
Actually, one thing I want to say is because of Ken Kutaragi stepping down, but did Loki

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.360
have to think about that?

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.120
What does Loki think of Ken Kutaragi stepping down?

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.080
It's a step in the right direction, that's for sure.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:45.760
The goat thing, though, is a step in the wrong direction, but I don't know.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.680
Getting rid of him talking, that's definitely a good way to go.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.800
But what about all the good things Kutaragi did?

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.880
I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.560
I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.600
He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night,

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:05.680
is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.840
Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.800
I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but at some point you've got

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800
to put them down.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.360
And what about all the great things that goat did?

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.520
No, it's they had to put them down.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:29.120
Rice Prince of all cosmos in the chat room says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.920
Sounds like a great idea.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.680
All right, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.880
No, that's basically it.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.560
Actually, I want to know which game you think I should get for the Wii.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.120
You don't own any games yet for the Wii, and you want to know which game to get.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.600
Well, let's see, do you own a PlayStation 2?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600
Yeah.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.360
What's your favorite game on PlayStation 2?

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.760
I would say 2DX.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.160
Ah, sure.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160
You're a Bamani fan.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.520
Well, definitely, you've got to get DDR Hottest Party when it comes out then on the Wii.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.480
In the meantime, I would say check out Zelda Twilight Princess or Super Paper Mario are

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.800
two of my favorites right now.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.920
Anybody care to chime in?

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.560
What Wii game should Chris get?

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560
Excite Truck.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560
If you like Wii.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.640
Excite Truck's not bad.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.880
I was going to say Excite Truck 2.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.880
Does it use a controller?

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:21.080
I want to be able to use the Wii remote a little bit more.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.240
Yes, all those games.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.480
Not so much Super Paper Mario, I mean it does incorporate it a little bit, you do like thuds

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.320
by shaking the thing, but yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wii remote like a normal controller,

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.960
but you steer with it, like you turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.320
And then of course Legend of Zelda's all about using that, like you swing it like a sword

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.520
and all that crazy stuff.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
Okay.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
All right, thanks.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
All right, no problem, Chris.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Thanks for calling the show, and call us back sometime.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.760
All right, take care.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.760
Later.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.760
We like new colors.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.360
This is a good show.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.760
We need to take vacations more often, because we get new guests in the studio, and we get

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760
new callers.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.840
Not that we don't appreciate the old callers, too.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.480
Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:06.360
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.880
It's Legend of Zaku.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.080
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.360
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.360
Nothing much.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.680
Just coming back from Queens, playing Papa Nade, and pump it up.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.880
I love people calling this show.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.880
I go, hey, what's up?

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.880
Ah, nothing.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.720
I just thought I'd call to let you know.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
I did stuff today.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
No, I'm just kidding.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.880
What do you think of tonight's show?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.720
Any stories you want to comment on?

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.000
You know that they are happening.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.840
You know it's official now that the Supernova 2 test location has already been announced

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:37.840
for next month.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.360
Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.720
Actually, that was my post.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720
Was it?

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720
I don't know.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.720
Yeah, I configured it.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720
Maybe you submitted it, and we ran it.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.720
I don't know.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.720
I did.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.720
Well, good.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.320
Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us, and like

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.440
two Japanese Bimani sites linked to that story.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.840
So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.840
So good job.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.840
Yay.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840
All right.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840
Well, tell us.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.160
How did you come across this information about the location test?

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:15.360
No, just a random post from other Bimani sites, Bimani style, Air Japan, all the other stuff.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:24.240
Even the original posting in ride19.com, the place for the guy that had tech at Brunswick

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.640
Zone, I got it from there as well.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
All right.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.320
Since I know you're such a hardcore Bimani and music game fan because you've been listening

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:38.000
to us since the day when that's all we talked about on this show, what do you hope is the

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.580
number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:46.760
Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1?

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760
Unlockables.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760
Pretty much.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.200
You know how DDR Max was back in the day.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.520
It only had like 60 songs.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.280
It didn't have any returning songs.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.480
It just had brand new songs.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.800
And there wasn't really that much.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:06.520
And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and added new ones and had an unlock system.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520
Okay.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.520
I got you.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.040
And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards, was

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040
unlocking all this stuff.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.040
Yeah.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.040
I mean, think about it.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.120
If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami just to

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:23.560
gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.760
And we already know the outcome of that.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.120
I guess so if we're getting a Supernova 2.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120
Mm-hmm.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120
All right.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.600
That and hopefully, you know, they are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.080
to EMUs, you know, something that's not necessarily connected online.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.040
Like a card system like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.040
Build your own dancer.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.480
It'd be fun.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480
Not even that.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.400
Just track scores, but, you know, battle people and stuff like that.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.520
Buy hot pants for your character.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.440
Hopefully, Konami would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440
in Supernova this morning.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.960
Totions yelling link support in chat room.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960
Yes.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
I hope they found a good work-around.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960
That's all I'm saying.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.960
Let's see what else is being said in chat here.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.360
GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bahmani.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.040
Well, that too.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.400
I mean, also like revival songs that weren't even, that haven't been revived in a long

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.400
time.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.200
Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.960
I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.600
You know, stuff like that.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.920
Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bahmani, Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.360
Well, what do you expect?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.160
Hey, it ruined my life too.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160
That's how I met Dark Sakura.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.960
Hugs and kisses and bunnies.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960
Love you, Rob.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.400
What?

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.800
She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.120
Yes I do.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120
Let's see.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.320
James Patrick says, DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320
DDR is pretty big.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320
What?

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.320
500?

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320
Really?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.320
Where's that sales figure come from?

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.720
I'll be damned if it reaches a million.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720
That's a lot.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720
And we don't even know when they're jumping.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.960
I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know,

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.080
for any future DDR mixes, obviously I don't see that happening now since they're going

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.760
to hold onto the PS2 as long as, as long as possible.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.200
There's a big install phase backing it up.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200
All right.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.640
Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go, but how far are you going to drive out to the

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.400
test of Supernova 2?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400
I don't know.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400
Maybe.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.800
I don't even know if I, I don't even know if I have vacation time, but I'll probably

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.760
get, I'll probably get the videos, you know, eventually and I'll see.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.520
And hopefully once, once Supernova 2 comes in the city, then I'll be able to decide for

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.520
myself.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520
All right.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520
Well, good luck with that.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.520
Have fun.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520
Okay.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520
All right.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520
Later, dude.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.520
Bye.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.520
Ah, Zaku's hilarious.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520
He's got the best, best voice.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.400
Yeah, this is Colin, talk about Supernova.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.120
You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120
games.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.480
You know, I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow like

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.760
no rules.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.000
When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.240
when you meet them.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.440
No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York city.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.840
He's, he's a good kid.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.760
We just give him a hard time on the show because he's been listening for a long time and we

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760
can.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.320
Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York city

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.680
the week of June 9th.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.760
That's all I'm saying for now.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.040
I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.080
June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York city, which is good.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080
I love New York city.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.080
Love it, love it, love it.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.560
So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.880
make a, make an appearance.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:52.280
And so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo world store with people just

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.360
loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.400
All right.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.440
Let's see.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.960
The Rob Dean chat says Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.480
We'd love to do that if we had the money.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.200
I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.320
Yeah, they'll be there.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320
They're going to ASEN.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.680
So the OLR lesbians will be there.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.200
So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.880
I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN, so look for them.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.160
They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160
We'll be in front of me.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160
Oh yeah.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.240
Hell, we should have announced that at the top of the show.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.280
Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.280
We did get confirmed for this year's FONOMAY.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:34.480
We're going to be doing a live show from FONOMAY, the Saturday of FONOMAY at 2 p.m.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.440
We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right, right?

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.440
We only have the one, which is fine because we didn't really need two last year.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.760
Your panels were booked solid.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760
Yeah, so.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760
We're lucky to get a Saturday.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760
That's a good time.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.600
So Saturday at two, we'll be there taping one of our shows live, and for that reason

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.800
we will not be live Memorial Day weekend because some folks will be staying at FONOMAY.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.800
I have other commitments.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:00.160
I'm going to be going to FONOMAY for like a day and a half, but then I have other commitments,

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160
so we'll see.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160
All right.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.520
I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.720
the rest, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:16.360
I'm very excited about because that's a thing I'm like really into is bad movies like Rocky

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.680
Horror and all that.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.680
Excellent.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.560
So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, and let's ask right now if there's

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.520
any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:32.460
Well, something interesting you should know.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:39.380
The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess, and a review on IGN saying

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.720
that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the blue, was it the Blu-ray

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.080
Java or whatever, the BD Java.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.320
It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:57.880
There used to be one for five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.640
Some other fun stuff, I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend, but they had the announcement

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.940
for Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, and it looks pretty fucking awesome, and of course

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:18.320
Tom Clancy's End War, which is supposed to be an online persistent war, you're basically

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.120
going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.960
So, that's kind of neat, and let's see what else, oh, Lego Star Wars 2 and Saints Row

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:36.480
have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both of

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.920
those games are available for $29.99.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.480
Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.480
Saints Row is fucking awesome.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.000
I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game and I never bought it, so maybe

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.400
I will now.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:52.480
There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disgaea are coming to the PS3.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480
That's kind of interesting, I guess.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.160
I know it was a new Disgaea game coming out, I thought, or maybe that's called the stuff

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.480
that I'm thinking.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:09.680
Let's see, what else do we have here?

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.960
I think that was pretty much it.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960
Yeah.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Alright.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.200
Dark Sakura, you got anything?

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200
Any last minute stories?

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.200
No.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200
Oh, alright.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.000
I guess that does it then for tonight, so Warrior Bob, you got anything you'd like to

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
read about?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.640
So the show I used to co-host, pressstart.thefighting.org.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640
Are they still on?

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.640
Yeah, they still are.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640
I've just left.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.720
I Skype in now and again, but first I want to plug them second.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.080
I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week, so ha, that's

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.080
our news.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.080
Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.360
Ah, yes, that's right.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.600
That's coming up, what, Friday, when they officially announced it?

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.600
Two days ago.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.600
Oh, two days ago.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.600
I think so.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.040
Ah, yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.080
Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st or,

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080
you know, weird.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.680
Oh, I think they said it'll be done when it's done.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.760
They want to make a good game, and if it takes that long, it'll take that long.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.760
I guess so.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.400
This game better do my dishes, that's all I have to say, it better be that freaking

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400
good.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400
I mean, they named it after the development time.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400
That was innovative, right?

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400
I guess so.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400
Alright.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.400
I guess that's it.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.600
Here, Bob, thanks so much for being here, and I hope you enjoyed your first show.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.800
The only guest who ever brought their own mic, that's pretty impressive, oh, wait, I

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.080
take that back, because I believe DDR Angel actually brought this mic when she came with

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.080
it.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.080
So you're the second guest to ever bring their own mic.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.880
Well, now that one's Dark Sakura's mic, and this one's still mine.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.880
That's true.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.420
She ended up giving hers away, and we haven't heard from her in a long time, I hope she's

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.420
doing well.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.800
But yeah, you got your mic there, so anyway, thanks for being on the show.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.800
Thank you for having me.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800
It's been a pleasure.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.720
Awesome radio voice, chat loves you guys, chat room loves you and wants you to come

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720
back.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.720
I love chat.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.720
Make sure you do come back soon.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720
Thank you very much.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720
No problem.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720
Final thought.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720
Oh, that was my final thought.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720
Thank you for having me.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.720
All right.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720
There you go.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.720
Good enough.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720
My final thought.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:10.880
My final thought is garlic is delicious and keeps the vampires away.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.920
Loki, your final thought.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:19.720
Apparently Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and Starcraft 2 as well.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.600
Wouldn't that be one and the same?

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.880
No, they're going to be two different games.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.960
My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.760
It costs money and I don't have money.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.760
That's my new final thought is I want you to open a laser tag arena.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.000
Me too.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.240
Dark Sakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240
Reject false icons.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.180
It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.080
It's good to see it make a comeback.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.600
Without you guys, we would die.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.440
Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.320
It's you guys that help support us.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.040
If you like what you hear, all we ask is to tell two friends.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.720
They don't even have to be friends.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.720
Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.840
us and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.160
If you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:23.460
more, you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or podcast

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.640
alley or any of those sites that are like, hey, rate your favorite podcast because then

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.240
we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people will bother to look at it.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:37.680
If you really, really like us and you can do it, you'll send us invitations to E3.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.680
That's also a good idea.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.440
On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.880
