00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on Sunday, April 1, 2007.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We already did our April Fool's joke. The rest of the show is legit.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
If you want to check out our fun little April Fool's joke, go back in our podcast archive or audio archive, whatever you want to call it, and check it out.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
It's there.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
But we have a lot of news this break.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Some video game noobs and Dark Sakura and Loki joining me as always.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Also joining me tonight, Chris and Meg Z, the OLR lesbians.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Alright.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Let's go to the Xbox 360.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
Xbox 360 Elite is official, which further proves the point that all Microsoft rumors are true, except the ones that came out today on April 1.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
But we all knew the black Xbox 360 was coming for some time.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
And Loki, I got to hand it to you.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Last week when we went over this on the show, you called it a 120 gigabyte hard drive for $179.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You called the price down to the dollar.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
It's not that hard.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It's really not, but it's still kind of impressive.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
The premium system and the Elite system are the price of the core plus the hard drive.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
So the pro system being $399.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The hard drive is $100 to the 20 gig.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
So I figured, OK, $479 so that the hard drive is probably $179.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And what do you know?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
They kept to the pattern.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So yay me.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, the Elite will be coming with this 120 gigabyte hard drive, and it's coming out for $479 on April 29.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
The Elite also comes with an HDMI port and comes in sexy black.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
They're bringing sexy black.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm bringing sexy black.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Wow.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Just because it's April Fool's Day doesn't mean I ran out of bad jokes.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
That was not an invitation to break into song.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Also, black wireless controllers, black battery packs, and black play and charge kits will be coming out as well.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Pretty exciting stuff.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
And black headsets.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Although, I don't know.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
It's exciting stuff for some people, but not for me.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Because the first Xbox period was black.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
So hooray for having a black console for Microsoft.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I mean, we've already had one.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
People still buy the black console.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Why?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Because the DS Lite came out and it's white, and now the black one came out and everyone's like,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh my God, I got to get it black.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Or pink.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Pink.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, no one wants pink.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I've got a pink one.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Black.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You know, it's just, I don't know.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
People are suckers for new colors.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
It's like, one of the things you look at in marketing is the color of something.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
As long as it's different from whatever it was before, it'll be more popular.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And also, it's only limited time.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's going to go back to the white.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
So buy the black ones while you can.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Random thought.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
The low-end PlayStation 3 is $4.99.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
So isn't it interesting that Microsoft's kind of getting close to entering Sony's price range,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
especially when they have their own little back and forth and stuff?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
As they would say, it's all about choices.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
You don't have to buy that Elite One.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Although, if you want HDMI, you do.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So, hooray.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
JeremyTod1 wants you to know, the DS Lite is a handheld, not a console.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Aha, touche.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, fine.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
Let's see then, how about, well, the GameCube came in multiple colors.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Look at the PlayStation 2 Slim.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
That came out in multiple colors.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Or PlayStation 2, the original system, came out in multiple colors in different countries.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I mean, who cares?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It doesn't matter.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It's just a fucking console.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
To be honest, if you really wanted a black console, you can do it for like $60.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Or get some spray paint and you can do it even less.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, seriously.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Rama's in our chat room, taping live here on Sunday nights.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Chad.orangelandtrader.com.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Rama says, I have a big black Wii.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
And if you know Rama, then that's funny if you're six years old.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Or if you're a lesbian, apparently.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
If you hear the cackling in the background, that's the two lesbians giggling at Rama's big black Wii.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Anyways.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Isn't he cute?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So, with the 120 gigabyte system, you're probably wondering a few things like,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
say for example you do have a 20 gig hard drive, how are you going to move your stuff over?

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, you'll be happy to know that it is going to come with a data cable.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
So, if you do have one of the older hard drives, you can transfer your saves using that data cable to the new hard drive.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
However, you cannot transfer more than one hard drive.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
And I remember previously they suggested that you get more than one hard drive for those digital downloads and stuff.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, you're fucked because if you put another hard drive on there, it will just overwrite all the data on there.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
That also being said, you know...

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, not to sound like a cock, but it's not that hard to switch the hard drives out.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, if you could afford multiple hard drives, is it really going to kill you to switch the one out and put the other one in?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It makes you say yes.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Y'all are some lazy bitches.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
No. Well, here's what I'd suggest though.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
If you're going to run into these problems and you don't like these restrictions that they have on there,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
buy the XSATA or something very similar to that.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
It's one of those devices you can buy for 50 bucks, you can transfer stuff to your PC, vice versa and stuff.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Just transfer, dump everything on your PC, dump it back onto the hard drive.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
There you go.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You can do multiple hard drives, whatever.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So, do that if you don't like these restrictions.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Otherwise, stick with the free cable.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
The other thing, much like the original hard drive, it's going to be loaded full of crap.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
And, you know, as you probably remember before, and I'm kind of wondering how much of that 120 gigs is actually available to use,

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
because you remember before in the 20 gig one, 7 gigs is for the updates and stuff for the emulation.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
So, logic tells me 113.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, there's been more updates since then and that partition might be bigger.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
TouchÃ©.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
Anyway, so, what you're going to get, or I should say, have to delete off your hard drive are the following things.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
For trailers, you're going to be getting the Forza 2 customization damage videos,

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
Halo Wars Fable 2, Halo 3 TV ad, Halo 3 trailer, Halo 3 8.2 Brute video,

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Accessory TV Spot, Wireless World video, and Holiday 06 accessories video.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Why the fuck do they have this stuff on there for free?

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
I don't understand, because you can download it off of Live for free.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Not everybody gets on Live though.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Oh, goody.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
So, they really probably want to see the Holiday 06 accessories video, because I'm sure that's really exciting.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
You know, I have to be honest, when I first bought my Xbox 360, I did watch some of the videos on there,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
because I was like, oh, hi-def videos on my HDTV, that's kind of pretty, because I didn't have an HD DVD player,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
and I don't think Comcast had been installed yet for the HD.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
It was kind of fun, I don't know.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I deleted those.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, I deleted them since then.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
Other things you'll have on there, playable demos, including Assault Heroes, Cloning Clyde, Geometry Wars,

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Marble Blast Ultra, Small Arms, Feeding Frenzy, Uno, Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Luminous Live,

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
Zuma, Heavy Weapon, Lego Star Wars 2, Lost Planet, the multiplayer one, Madden 07, Fusion Frenzy 2,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
and Call of Duty 3, and of course, like usual, Hexac HD will be on there, the full game.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Wow.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
But then again though, from what I hear, if you do end up having to transfer your stuff over to that new hard drive,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
you'll wipe it all out anyways.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Some real quick chat comments before we get to our next story.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
In chat we have Hostile One says, I guess they don't want people sharing downloaded games.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I mean, with this whole...

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, at least with that free cable, you're going to have to buy an extra tool to do that.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Mystic Gohan asks, does anyone know if the 360 uses USB hard drives for storage?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
No, it does not.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Big fat no, sorry.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Mystic Gohan also asks, who would buy a 120GB hard drive without Live?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
What would be the point, other than music, which I doubt is what someone would do?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Good point, good point.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Seems fairly pointless.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Some people, Magsy, what was this?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, okay, this is my first reaction.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
It's like, ooh, it's bigger and better, I must have it.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You know what, it's a valid point.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
There are not a lot of people, but there are a small amount of people.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
It's like, ooh, big, new, shiny, must have.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
No.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
But you want to know what's funny, though, is that Sony is taking all the credit for the idea.

09:14.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, they're going around saying that, you know, there's actually a quote from their SVP of marketing

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
saying, we think that every PlayStation 3 owner should have the elite experience,

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
which is why we include an internal hard drive and HDMI output in every PS3 we sell,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
along with the 50 gigabytes of storage capacity on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
So they're all trying to do, like, oh, well, we're all hot shit, and, you know, they're trying to be like us.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
It's getting really soap opera-y and kind of fun to watch what's going on between Microsoft and Sony,

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
because like with the UK launch where Microsoft was, like, crashing the party with those big Xbox 360

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
heart shoe signs and stuff, it's kind of getting funny watching the two fight like little bitches.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It's great. I mean, I'm eating this shit up.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
There should be a podcast all to, like, dramatizing this whole thing.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
These are the days of our gaming.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Maisie, I'll put you in charge of that project.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
They should do a reality show like that.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
All right. Cool.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
All right.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, I have another story, speaking of which, which is an interesting follow-up,

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
because, you know, Sony says that, you know, welcome to the elite status Xbox 360.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
But what's interesting is that Sony actually filed something on March 2nd, 2007,

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
indicating that they are going to be releasing another PlayStation 3 model with an 80-gigabyte hard drive.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It was something that, you know, they were running it by the FCC.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
They have to get the approval and all that stuff.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Could this be a whole new model?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Could this just be a storage upgrade?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't know, but Sony kind of was doing a little bit of damage control earlier this week with the whole thing.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I remember reading a little later.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, we have no plans to do that.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Except we do have plans to do that.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I don't know.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
No, we're not copying them.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
We are not copying them.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
How many times has Sony done that, though, really?

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Like, you know, back when, I think it was E3 2004, I think,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
was when the, it was announced that the 360 was going to have two packages,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
and Sony just lapped them, and then, you know, what happened with the PS3 is two packages.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Good point.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Yes, because of hard drive size, that's why people aren't buying your console.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
It must be because the hard drive's not 80 gigs.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
That's why.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That's why you're not selling any systems.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, rumor goes around that Ken Kutaragi wants 250 gigabytes.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Great!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Two, great, so the system will be...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Hey, you know how many Crayolas that holds?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You know what I'm doing with my system?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And I'll tell you right now, we're loading that shit with porn.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I kid you not.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
That is what we are doing with that 20 gigabytes I have in there.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Maybe.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I do have lesbian porn in HD, so we can do that, but...

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I've seen the lesbian porn in HD, it's pretty weird.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Wait, you have pirates on HD DVD, don't you?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh my god, bring that shit over, I have an HD DVD player.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Okay.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, I have the highest budgeted porn in my possession that's HD DVD.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It's actually pretty funny.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Hey, I wonder if I can get that in Blu-ray.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
You can.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
No, maybe.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
The porn industry signed their allegiance over to HDTV.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Blu-ray's going down.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Sorry guys, we forgot we were a video game show for a minute.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Hey, it's talking about...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm talking about video games, so I'm just saying though,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
that's the only use I've found for the 20 gigs that I have in there right now,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
and I couldn't imagine if I had 250 gigs, I guess.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It'd be cool if you could use it as external storage or something.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
More porn.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
That's what I was thinking.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
All right, well, I don't know about you guys,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
but if you're Dark Sakura and you only own a Blu-ray player,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
you're pretty pissed to hear that HD DVD is going to get the porn industry,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and I know that makes Dark Sakura a little bit angsty, right?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
No, not really.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Roll with me here, because we've got...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Makes me angsty.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh, so angry.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Maybe I'll just use the music to do this.

13:07.000 --> 13:17.000
If you're not mad about the Blu-ray,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
then find something else to F you of the week, Dark Sakura.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
My rage is the fact that I can't find any decent Deadpool icons for LiveJournal,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
so I have to make them myself.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
That's really it, because I've had a pretty darn good week.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I graduated!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Congratulations.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Seriously, those who have been listening to the show for a long time,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I know you've been working hard at the massage stuff.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I am a fucking massage therapist now, bitches.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I want my Happy Birthday!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
No!

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh, great.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm really glad to hear you've graduated.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Now, Jamie, I have a real sore spot right here.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
$75.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Low-key.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
F you to Epson.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
I tried refilling my printer ink.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Apparently there's some fine print that they don't like to talk about,

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
and that fine print would be that you can only use Epson cartridges for your Epson printers.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I have the Photo R300 or whatever,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
and apparently I tried buying generic brand ink,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
because in the past for every other fucking printer I've owned, it works.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I understand that maybe the quality of the ink or whatever may be the last big deal.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm willing to spare the extra dollars for lower quality ink.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Whatever.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
But when I put it in my printer, after spending, I might add,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
even on this cheaper ink, $60,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
because that's how much it costs to refill the fucking ink and this stuff,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
it said we've detected that this is not Epson ink,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
and please use genuine products, and it will not work at all.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
So that's money just down the drain.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Thank you, Epson.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm not buying any more of your products.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
In fact, I'm thinking about dumping my printer into the dumpster.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
So fuck you, and I'm writing some hate mail to you.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Build on eBay. They'll always help.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Better business bureau.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
All right. Is that it?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, I was going to say, if you're looking for a printer out there,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Epson, I think Canon, HP, they all have the chips inside of them

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
that will count how many days go by or whatever,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
and basically your cartridge will stop working after so many days,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
even if you don't print anything.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
So just that in mind, you want to make sure you freeze them

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
when you first get them.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
If you get software off the internet, feel free to do that.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Just be careful when you're buying stuff.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Read up on it first.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
More FUs of the Week from me. I have many tonight.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
One FU to April Fool's Day.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
This is my least favorite day of the year, because everybody's a damn fool.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
This is my voice for making me sound like a 12-year-old all over again tonight.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
And I want to say FU to folks that don't...

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
Folks that sometimes don't have to work for what they're given very hard,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
and sometimes folks are kind of giving things on a silver platter

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and it makes them a little bit ungrateful.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm not... I'm talking about people who are ungrateful.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I'm not talking about anybody. No, no, no.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
This is something completely in another dimension.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Because there are people I know that are, you know, fortunate,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
but are yet humble, if that makes sense.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
There's a big difference between that and being un-humble.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
So there's certain people out there that should have to work harder for the FUs.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And then I would also like to give a big FU to the fact

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I have to pee so fucking bad right now,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
so I'm going to run out of the room while Chris and Megsy do their FUs.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I found something for Megsy just now.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
I found an icon of Emma Foster's boobs that makes me happy.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I'm angsty. Okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, FU. Okay, my FU goes to the guy that was sitting behind us

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
during T. and Susan's turtles, which we went to see today.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
This guy sitting behind us first had the nerve to talk on his cell phone

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
during the first part of the film, which was annoying,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
but I mean, he's just like, oh, I'll call you back.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
I liked his cell phone ring, which was like, don't pick up the phone.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
That was his cell phone ring. Don't pick up the phone.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Which was fucking annoying to begin with.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
And then after that, like maybe 20 minutes later,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
we hear someone kind of snoring.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
This guy started talking on his cell phone and then fell asleep and was snoring.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
I really wish I had some possible reflection like throwing back at him.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
He should have thrown some reason at his head, then you would have given him a reason to wake up.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Hell yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Well, I don't really have a big FU of the week,

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
except for your people who cannot take a joke, Mickey.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
I'm not going to elaborate too much since we spent like a half an hour of me bitching about it.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
So I'm not going to elaborate.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
But FU to the people on April Fools who fall for an April Fools joke

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
and then can't take a fucking joke, you losers.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't mean that. You guys are nice, but seriously, fuck off.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I mean it then.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Okay, Jamie means it.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Dude, this is the best icon ever. It's the one where Kitty has a gun at Emma's head.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
That's hot.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Did Maisie do hers?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah, we're done.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Sorry, I was peeing. I didn't know.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
You and your peeing, Ross.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Well, look, when Mother Nature calls, I've learned you probably want to answer.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Because if you hang up on her, she's not going to like that.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Mother Nature will do that to you.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
She's killing you for that shit.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Let's get back into the news.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Anyways, speaking of killing you.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
No, well, I'm not really dying in this case.

18:52.000 --> 19:03.000
But Sony, CR, and Vivendi, I guess, are being sued because Spyro has induced seizures in somebody's baby.

19:03.000 --> 19:19.000
Yes, Corinne Gamespot is reporting that a mother of a child who suffered permanent disability injuries from a grand mal seizure while playing Spyro Enter the Dragonfly has filed suit in New York State Supreme Court.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
And she names all those three companies and seeks unspecified damages.

19:25.000 --> 19:34.000
And you might want to point out also that it is in the manual. There is an epilepsy warning in there.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
And it is common practice in the video game software industry to put that stuff in there.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
So I think it's your own damn fault, to be honest.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah, you know, it's funny because you always see those warnings.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Like, I know I see those warnings all the time.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
And I always just kind of go, oh, gosh, I must really kind of, like, suck if that's, you know, you.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
I mean, sometimes we take certain things for granted that, you know.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
But to kind of hear that somebody's going to sue over that is kind of like, well, I mean, I know I see that thing all the time because I've thought about people who might want to be careful about that.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I don't know.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
I've actually got a friend with epilepsy and he loves playing video games and he plays them all the time.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
So is that kind of like, you know, you're lactose intolerant but you still have ice cream?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Something like that, I guess.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You know what? Ice cream is tremendous.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
I know, but, you know, and I know plenty of people who are lactose intolerant, they're like, fuck it, I'll just take a lactate.

20:24.000 --> 20:37.000
You know, it seems like this is just another person trying to get money out of big corporations and by pointing a finger and saying, you caused this, et cetera, et cetera.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Like, you know, when I threw my Wiimote at the TV and it, yeah, or the strap broke.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
DJ Morpheus in chat says, so I can sue OLR for giving me the AIDS.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, it wasn't me that gave you AIDS.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
What?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Yeah, exactly.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Okay.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
See, I hate April Fool's Day. I just hate it.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Well, let's move on.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
Speaking of more bullshit, okay.

21:06.000 --> 21:14.000
There is actually research going on at the University of Bolton, one of the UK schools.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Like Michael Bolton?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Somebody had to say it, Jamie.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Rob.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yes.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Dynamifier.

21:25.000 --> 21:41.000
Saying that gaming addiction is over diagnosed up to 10% of the time because there are certain indicators that they were attributing to gaming addiction are actually the same as gambling addictions.

21:41.000 --> 21:51.000
So it's actually along the same lines as a gambling addiction, not just, you know, really being addicted to gaming.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
But they're saying that they like to, that basically it's just hype.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It's all this.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
That they're using it as a scapegoat.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
That it's just like the same type of addiction people have to gambling.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
So it's kind of like, you know, the best cure for video game addiction is to grow up.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Is that basically what they're saying?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Or just shoot them.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
All right.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Anybody have anything they want to say on gaming addiction?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
An addiction is an addiction is an addiction.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
It doesn't matter what it's to.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It doesn't matter what caused it.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
It's an addiction.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I think there's a difference between a chemical addiction and a physical addiction.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
See, I don't think so.

22:33.000 --> 22:45.000
Then again, I actually, you know, now that you think about the biology behind activities, I would say, just like how there's people who are addicted to sex, people addicted to gaming, people addicted to gambling.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Addicted to lesbians.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
People, especially people addicted to running.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
You get that chemical response whenever you perform this action and people become addicted to the feeling they get when they're doing it.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
And it's all chemical.

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
There's people who are addicted, who always have to be, you know, this is the only way I can describe it.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
People who always have to be in a relationship because of the chemicals your body releases while you are, quote, in love.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And they may not be in love for real.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
They have that feeling.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And so they're addicted to that feeling of being with another person.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
So what you're trying to say is you're going to have to face it.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You're addicted to love.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
Well, that also, though, goes a lot to explain people who keep themselves in abusive and codependent relationships, too.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Wow.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I know.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm like, wow, this show took an interesting turn all of a sudden.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't know.

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
I was just thinking about it because I honestly see the same type of mentality of people who are addicted, like, say, the Evercrack people.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
You point out to them, well, you could be doing this, this, this, and this to improve your life.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Don't you use sort of the same type of arguments with your friends who are in abusive relationships?

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Well, you know, if you left so-and-so, you could do this, this, this, and this.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh, but I need him.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Oh, but I need to level.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm thinking of addicts to online games.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
You know what?

24:15.000 --> 24:25.000
I think about, though, also, I'm someone who used to smoke, and I know you did, too, for a while, and that's something that's, you know, it's a mental and...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I smoke cigars.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
There's a difference.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
You don't inhale a cigar.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Oh, okay.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, whatever.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I thought you smoked cigarettes for a while.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I smoked cloves, like, off and on.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
All right.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Well, in college, I started cigarettes for a while.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
That's my voice, right?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
But I quit.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yay.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
And with that, you got the nicotine addiction and the mental addiction.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
So, it's kind of like, like, I could kind of see that where wow might be something similar when you get folks who are addicted to wow, because there's that addiction of, like, I need to level.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I need to see my friends.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Da-da-da.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
But then there's also kind of the, like, I'm addicted to it because I don't know what else to do.

24:57.000 --> 25:12.000
That's why you, I mean, and people, I think this also goes with the gaming addiction thing is that people are afraid of change to the point that you would rather stay in a negative situation because it's something you know.

25:12.000 --> 25:26.000
You know, people who may have social anxiety, they use, you know, an MMO as their means of communicating with the outside world and their ways of having interaction when they're afraid of doing something a different way.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
Also, one thing about it, I've done a lot of research on addiction and stuff because I've dealt with different kinds of addiction.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Nothing illegal, but yeah.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
One of the things, addiction a lot of times acts as an escape from real life.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
And, you know, it doesn't really matter what you're doing.

25:42.000 --> 25:49.000
You know, if you're doing, you know, an activity repetitively, it's usually an escape from real life, whether it's video games or anything.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
So, yeah.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Just something to add about addiction.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
All right.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
No, I agree with that too.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
And I think that also kind of goes hand in hand with the whole afraid of change, afraid of things that are different.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
People don't want to face their fears, so they try to avoid them one way or another.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Or could we be forgetting the one factor that really is an issue, I think.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Games are getting so fucking awesome that you can't stop playing them.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Like Earth Defense Force 2017.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It is fucking awesome.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Are you someone's payroll?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
No.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I've never played that game until you mentioned it 50 times on this program.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Here's why I like that game.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It's because it was originally part of the Simple 2000 series.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
And everyone remembers, you know, that is like the bottom of the barrel, you know, crap games.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Weird shit like, you know, zombies versus ambulance and stuff.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
It is just like, for me, my bad movie collection.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
All right, we've got to get back into the news, but real quick comments from chat.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
ActDeaf says, by the way, I'm addicted to OLR.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Well...

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
That's a good addiction to have.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Just like being addicted to doing good deeds is a good addiction.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Being addicted to being a good Samaritan is a good addiction.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Round nose plus two!

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
All right, let's see what else is there.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
Legend of Zaku says, whatever happened to smoking a joint, eating a Twinkie, and going to sleep?

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Thank you, Dennis Leary.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Wow, good job catching that.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Can I just add my little quick quirk and then you can move on?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Sure, sure. We'll move on after this.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
My only thing to say about addiction is if you're not hurting anybody and you're...

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, that's my only thing.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
If you're not hurting anybody else, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
Well, but, you know, a lot of folks joke with me like, oh, Rob, you're addicted to Warcraft.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You're so addicted to World of Warcraft stuff.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And I'm like, you know, I see Magsy's joking with Chris right now.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
But look, Chris is outside the house right now being social with people.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
You know, so am I.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
So there's a difference, too, between like joking about it and like...

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
No, like seriously, you're fucking addicted to WoW because like, you know, you are...

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
And there are people...

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You're having social repercussions and all that stuff.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
You know what's really funny?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
What?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
After this, I swear, you can move on.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
But if all the WoW addicts will be able to say...

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
Like when you're first loading into your character, you know how they got that little message for you?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
When the little bar is like loading the thing?

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
One of the things that it said, all good things should be taken in...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Moderation?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
In moderation.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Even WoW.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I thought that was hilarious.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I see that one, too.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I like how Blizzard can laugh at themselves.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Well, it's true, though.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, it's very true.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
Final Fantasy XI has a big old disclaimer that comes up every time you click to log into the game that says...

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
The World of Anadil is an exciting place.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
And I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for so long, I'd probably read the damn thing verbatim, but it says something like...

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
The World of Anadil is an exciting place.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
However, please do not neglect your friends' work and all that stuff.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
It's interesting.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Alright, we gotta keep it moving, but we do welcome your feedback.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Do you know anyone that's addicted to video games?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And what kind of effect has that had on their life?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
We want to hear your emails.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And we will get to the mailbag a little later in the show, but first...

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
We have to feed my Castlevania addiction, because Castlevania is one of the best series in the history of video gaming.

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
And, well, Paul Anderson has left Castlevania to go work on his new Death Race 2000 remake.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Oh, yeah!

29:04.000 --> 29:13.000
Or at least that's what early reports indicated, but then came out later to say that, well, it's not so much that Paul Anderson plans on ditching Castlevania,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
it's just that he's having scheduling problems between the two right now, so we're not sure which is going to happen first.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Good, because Death Race 2000 needs to be out before Castlevania, because that's a fucking awesome movie.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
It's so awful. I can't wait.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
Alright, really quickly indulge me here, because all the gamers probably know what Castlevania is, but what is Death Race?

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Death Race 2000 is basically almost like Carmageddon the movie.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
It's an old-ass movie, one of the first ones that Sylvester Stallone was ever in.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
It's basically David Carradine plays this guy who's in this race that you get points for killing people with your car.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
And at the very end, he takes out the commissioner of this race, I guess who's the president of the world or something like that,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
with his hand grenade. Pun intended.

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
But it's so ridiculous, though, and I can't wait to see this movie.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Definitely worth checking out, though, if you haven't seen it yet.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Death Race and Death Sport, both about the same thing.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I could just watch The Running Man.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, that's pretty funny.

30:15.000 --> 30:27.000
Anyways, so Hitman is getting, of course, a film made about it, and Variety's reporting that it looks like Fox has picked it up,

30:27.000 --> 30:37.000
and they'll be getting shooting, looks like this week, in Bulgaria's capital of Sofia.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
And kind of interesting, though, it says the film's going to be filmed in South Africa, London, and Istanbul as well.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Not Constantinople?

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Not Constantinople, no.

30:49.000 --> 30:59.000
Anyways, and I guess the guy who's actually shooting this right now is Xavier Genz, who I believed...

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Let's see here.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I don't really know what else he's done.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Anyways, who cares?

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
But it is kind of interesting, though, because they're saying that one of the stars of Desperate Housewives has actually been confirmed as one of the villains,

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
and I don't follow Desperate Housewives too much, but apparently a cast member...

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Let's see.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I don't know.

31:24.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, Dougree Scott is going to play a suitor Ian Hainsworth.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
Sorry, this story was putting me to sleep.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
What?

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Timothy Olfant will play the lead as the assassin Agent 47.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
It'll just be a generic fucking action movie like all the others.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It is.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
So Dougree Scott, the guy who plays the British guy in Desperate Housewives, is going to play the villain.

31:56.000 --> 32:05.000
Alright, well, thank you for that, and we will be sure to not see that and wait for a DVD so I can Netflix it.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Just kidding.

32:06.000 --> 32:14.000
Anyhow, one other great fucking same old thing we like to look forward to every week here is the mailbag here at orangeonshreddy.com.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
People will email us, and of course that email address is mailbag at orangeonshreddy.com.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
Dark Soccer likes to dive in head first into the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
I do?

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
Well, April Fools, or so she tells me.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
She likes to read them here on the air.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I do?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Don't make me shove this mic up your butt.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
That's just the voice.

32:42.000 --> 32:52.000
Anyway, anyway, hey, O.L.R., I was just listening to the last episode of O.L.R., and I heard about the youngest O.L.R. listener, a 12-year-old.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
But now I declare myself the second youngest listener of O.L.R. at 13 years old.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
No matter what you guys say, I'll still listen to you because you guys are great, from Ron.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Thank you, Ron.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You're so cute.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Oh, the cute little baby.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Hey, don't patronize the...

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
You're so cute, little baby.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Do not patronize the kid.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Anyway...

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Wait.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
This is from...

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
Oh, my God, if this kid is 13, then that means he was born in 94, right?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
That's the year I graduated high school.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Oh, my God, I know, I was like a sophomore.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Oh, God.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Thank you for making me feel old, Rob.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I was in fourth grade.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
When I was your age.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I was in second grade.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
No, wait, I was in first grade.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Holy crap.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
So, next email.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I was on the date with your mama.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Last night.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Really?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
No, that was okay.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
This is from Alex.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Hi, Alex.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Rondo of Blood sucked because it was on PSP.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
PSP equal to evil.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Youngest OLR listener.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
P.S.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
My parents don't know I listen to this.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
That's okay.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
We're going to call them live on air.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Do you know what your kid is listening to?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Wow.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Anyway, Rondo of Blood is awesome.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Okay.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh, we have a joke.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
We have a joke.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh, God, here we go.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Two jokes.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
This is from...

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
Can someone remind me how the Orange Launch radio listeners got encouraged to send us

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
jokes?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Because we actually read one on air.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
This is from Aris, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
All right, I got two.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
What's meant to go deep and is full of semen?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
A penis?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
No, submarine.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
A submarine.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Ha, ha, ha.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Okay, what makes people yell when you blow it?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
A penis?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
A whistle.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Blow my whistle.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Is this another 13-year-old listener of Orange Launch Radio?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Blow my whistle, bitch.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Anyway, this is from, I guess it's pronounced Zaid.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
My name is Zaid Mohammed.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm from the UK.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Yes, Sky, your Brit accent is a joke.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
It's funny.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Bro cracks me up.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Anyways...

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Thank you for understanding me.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
I really appreciate it.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Shut up, Rob.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
I've been listening to your podcast since the PSP RSS feed enabled, and it's good to

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
listen to you guys because you work during the day and make such a great effort to do

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
the shows on Sunday night in your own time.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
And that's an achievement for anyone.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
Okay, this person uses the mixing numbers and shit with their words.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Oh, a MySpace message?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So this fucking pisses me off.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm going to read it because it's cool that you took the time to write us.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
But next time, please actually use full words.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Spell everything out, and if in doubt, use a spell checker.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
You know what's fucking awesome?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Huh?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Punctuation.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Punctuation is great.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
But make sure that when you use...

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
Can we put that on a poster with Chris's picture, doing a big thumbs up?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You know what's fucking awesome?

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Punctuation.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.800
Make sure, though, that when you use your spell checker, the words that have been spell

35:49.800 --> 35:54.000
checked are the right versions of the word that you want to spell check.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Remember, B-R-A-K-E.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That's in your card, dummy.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Okay, sorry.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Saw that fucking joke a mile away.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Back to the email.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Back to the email.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Back to the email.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Back to the email.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Because when I get home from work, I'm tired.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Unfortunately, I can't listen to the live show due to time zones.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Anyway, I sold my PSP, and funny enough, but you guys stuck with me.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
I enjoy your show so much that I now download the podcast on my PC and listen every Mondays

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
and Wednesdays.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Loki PSP is fun.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Dark Alex Customs gets real boring once you kit it up to the max.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
L-O-L, hence the word, sold it.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that you guys are doing a really great show for us

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
hardcore and non-hardcore gamers.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
With all your efforts with keeping us updated on the gaming world, I wish you the best on

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
the future and more to come.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I love Rice Princess L-O-L.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
Okay, I have a headache, but thank you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I love it when listeners send us nice things.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Please don't get me wrong, but please don't email us in a hieroglyphics.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
No offense.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm not trying to dog on you or anything, but just because you type the email on your

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
computer, which doesn't have access to the internet, it's still not the internet.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Please don't talk like you're on the internet.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
The more you know.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Okay, next email.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Hey.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Wait, wait, wait.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm sorry.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I have a quick something for Chris.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
It's a little bit late, but I'm sorry I'm slow because the files on my computer are

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
misorganized, but here you go, Chris.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Blow my whistle, baby.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Everybody dance.

37:25.000 --> 37:33.000
Suddenly the studio's turned into a lesbian bitch disco.

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
This mailbag segment was ruined to you courtesy of DJ Alligator Project.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
I have the vinyl, by the way.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Didn't I buy you a Guitar Wolf CD once?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Record.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Record.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
You were supposed to rip that for me.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
That's why I bought it for you.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
No, I'm kidding.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Anyway, next one.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Hey, love your show.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
I wanted to send you a message that we should all ponder about.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
The actual cost of an Xbox 360.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
Now that the Elite finally announced, is the 360 still the cheapest current gen hardware?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
No way.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Let me explain.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
Everyone complains that the PS3 is too expensive, but I believe the 360 is the biggest ripoff.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Here's why.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
First of all, to get a comparable 360, you must A, buy the Elite or B, upgrade your hard

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
drive for $179.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
Second, even if you buy the Elite for $479, it doesn't even compare to the PS3 in terms

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
of features.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
A, to get the wireless network, you must pay $99.99.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
B, to get high definition movie player, you must pay $199.99.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
To play online, you must pay $59.99.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
D, to charge your controllers using the console, you must pay $19.99.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
So if my math is right, the consumer must pay a total of $859.95 to get a console comparable

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
to the features and hardware featured in the PS3.

38:50.000 --> 38:56.000
So the old saying now should read, sorry Microsoft, but I can't buy a PS3 Nintendo Wii for the

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
price of one of yours.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Let me know what you guys think of this.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Thanks, Matt.

39:00.000 --> 39:07.000
The PlayStation 3, probably about 30 games out right now.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Microsoft's Xbox 360, a lot more than that.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
I understand what this person is saying and that is true.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
It's that sometimes we are unfairly comparing the charges.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
When I say we, I don't mean us specifically because obviously a lot of the Internet is

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
on the same page.

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
But again, when all is said and done, price be damned.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Xbox 360 has the games I want on it right now.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
PlayStation 3 does not yet, but when it does, I will consider buying one.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
No problem.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Home still looks pretty cool.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Little Big Planet, yes, more, more, more.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
But they'll start showing the real good, Sony.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
That's all.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
That's basically what I want to say.

39:50.000 --> 40:02.000
You know, PS3 may cost less apparently, but Xbox still has better games on it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Xbox has Ublis.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
It's Ublis.

40:05.000 --> 40:13.000
I do think if Sony were to really start to threaten Microsoft's grip that they've got

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
going right now, which I think Sony may do in a year, I would not be surprised.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
This has been rumors and rumblings already.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
If Xbox drops some elements of their gold service and they give you a little more stuff

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
for free and the gold people get, I don't know, something else special to compensate,

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
they've been talking about that sort of rumor has been going around for a long time.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
I think Microsoft will cut corners where they have to to compete with Sony, but until Sony

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
really has a lot more games, I don't know.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Anyway, I guess that's my thought.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Okay, well, we have one more email.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Yay.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
One more email.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
One email to rule them all.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Okay.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
Okay, I have been listening to the podcast version of the show for about two to three

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
months now.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, technically it says two thirds of a month, but I think it means two to three months,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
I hope.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
So now I have managed to catch a couple of live shows.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I want to give you all props because the show is great.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
I love Loki's insider info and the comedy of Robin Jamie's bickering like siblings.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
That's because Rob's my bitch.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Whatever.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
You don't know me.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Sit down.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Shut up.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I'm your mom.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Mom.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Be quiet.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
That doesn't sound like my mom.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
My mom is like this.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
That's my mom.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Wow.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
That sounds like your mom giving birth.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
That's somebody else's mom.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Someone's sick and deranged mom.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
This is my mom.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Rob.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Rob, why are you doing that dumb show on the internet on Sunday?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Rob, why don't you come over once in a while?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Now, this is my mom now.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
When are you going to come home?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
When are you going to come home?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Why did you move to California?

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Actually, I think California is better for you, but you should come back and visit sometime

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
and bring your husband with you.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
You know, your brother Matthew is being such a little ass.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
Now, when I was little, it was, you need to clean your room.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
I want to take your TV away.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Mom, you didn't get it for me.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Dad did.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I don't care.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Oh, my God.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
Your mom was the bus driver on South Park.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Sit down.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Shut up.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
What did you call me?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
What did you say?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
That's very true.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
My mom was a screamer.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Anyway, back to the email.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Really now?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
That's why I'm not breathing, okay?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I don't want to be like my mom.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Okay, now.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
And that's where I learned how to drown out while people are talking to me and then repeat

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
everything they just said.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It also helped me pass tests when I was in high school.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Mailbag, please.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Okay.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I'm sure that you all have had this debate before, but I'm looking at finally taking

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
the plunge and investing my summer into an MMO.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I am at ends, however.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
My brother is hardcore hooked on Final Fantasy XI and constantly comments on its wondrousness.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.440
Like many people, I have some friends who play Final Fantasy XI and some who play World

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
of Warcraft.

43:11.440 --> 43:17.480
I am torn between two much less in-depth environments of World of Warcraft and the fact that Final

43:17.480 --> 43:19.000
Fantasy XI is Final Fantasy.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.280
Unfortunately, I don't like any group better than the other.

43:22.280 --> 43:26.000
So I would like you all to help me decide World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI and

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
why?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.400
Some debate would actually help, too, so that it isn't a pure landslide toward World of

43:30.400 --> 43:31.400
Warcraft.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.800
I said that because you always seem to talk about World of Warcraft and you never really

43:33.800 --> 43:36.520
mention Final Fantasy XI.

43:36.520 --> 43:44.360
So, World of Warcraft versus Final Fantasy XI, keep up the good work, the show is great,

43:44.360 --> 43:46.720
and damn Live 365 increasing fees.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.880
That's from Boco Thet.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.800
You can damn the government for increasing those fees.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.200
Live 365 is just doing what they have to do to stay afloat.

43:54.200 --> 43:57.720
If you want more information on that, live365.com slash choice.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.000
I encourage you all to check it out.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.560
But anyway, back to the other topic.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.360
Final Fantasy XI is full of bitches.

44:04.360 --> 44:07.760
Well, I did play Final Fantasy XI for two years and I realize you're a new listener

44:07.760 --> 44:11.480
or in lounge, so you kind of missed that whole period where my gaming week every week was

44:11.480 --> 44:13.520
Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.520
Here's the thing.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.900
Final Fantasy XI forces you to have a social experience and be social with other people.

44:19.900 --> 44:25.680
The problem with XI is that it's very difficult to sign on for a short period of time to just

44:25.680 --> 44:28.400
kind of go, hey, I just want to check, you know, I just kind of want to sign on real

44:28.400 --> 44:29.400
quick.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.880
Especially since it takes five hours to get a fucking party.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.480
Yeah, and sometimes you're having to really wait for a party for a long time.

44:34.480 --> 44:38.640
Now, I know Final Fantasy XI, recently I read something about a new patch they're doing

44:38.640 --> 44:43.720
that's addressing some of those issues to try and make smaller parties more effective,

44:43.720 --> 44:45.480
but I don't know.

44:45.480 --> 44:50.440
The reason why I've stuck with Warcraft is that sometimes you have to party, but there's

44:50.440 --> 44:55.340
so much you can do solo as well that kind of keeps the game going.

44:55.340 --> 45:00.640
The thing, though, that I think would maybe woo you over this, check out, I mean, Warcraft

45:00.640 --> 45:02.240
does the 10-day free trial.

45:02.240 --> 45:06.080
To my knowledge, Final Fantasy XI offers nothing similar yet, but maybe you could watch your

45:06.080 --> 45:09.300
brother, whoever you said has it, play it for a little bit.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.760
Get the 10-day free trial for WoW, try it out.

45:11.760 --> 45:15.160
If you don't like it, maybe Final Fantasy XI is more your taste.

45:15.160 --> 45:20.920
If Final Fantasy XI ever chooses to do a free trial, I would say go for that as well.

45:20.920 --> 45:26.640
For someone who, again, is addicted to WoW, shut up.

45:26.640 --> 45:31.760
I'm actually very antisocial when it comes to games, and the only reason I picked up

45:31.760 --> 45:34.720
World of Warcraft is because I'm a big fan of Blizzard.

45:34.720 --> 45:41.360
I used to play Diablo II and Diablo and whatnot, and the expansions on that, but I'm a solo

45:41.360 --> 45:42.360
game player.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.180
I don't like interacting with a lot of people, and then every now and then I'll want to chat

45:46.180 --> 45:50.600
with people, but most of the time people are just stupid, so I don't want to go near them.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.020
But WoW is actually really fun.

45:52.020 --> 45:56.160
You can do it all by yourself, and you can only team up if you want to, and that's the

45:56.160 --> 45:59.160
reason I like it a lot.

45:59.160 --> 46:03.240
Any MMO is going to have some annoying little aspects of it, but I just found that WoW is

46:03.240 --> 46:08.800
a lot more easier to deal with if you don't want to deal with other people.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.520
Then they dance.

46:11.520 --> 46:18.620
Well they do, but to Final Fantasy XI's credit, there is no Taru slash Panic, which does win

46:18.620 --> 46:19.620
in Final Fantasy XI.

46:19.620 --> 46:22.520
You just have to see it to know what I'm talking about.

46:22.520 --> 46:26.240
You know what, our chat room is debating this too, and it looks like World of Warcraft is

46:26.240 --> 46:27.240
winning by a landslide.

46:27.240 --> 46:31.120
I hate to say, for those Final Fantasy XI fans who might be listening, if you want to

46:31.120 --> 46:34.560
argue your points, send us an email, mailbag, orangehonestreader.com.

46:34.560 --> 46:39.280
Hitstun says, objection, Final Fantasy XI is not Final Fantasy.

46:39.280 --> 46:42.880
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, neither MMO is corrupt.

46:42.880 --> 46:46.980
Drunami says, Final Fantasy XI is dead, Final Fantasy XI remains dead, Gill Sellers killed

46:46.980 --> 46:47.980
it.

46:47.980 --> 46:52.600
Yuni says, I suggest that Final Fantasy XI is not worth it, I played three years on it.

46:52.600 --> 46:58.600
DJ Tyrant says, WoW has 90% of their content that can be soloed, Final Fantasy XI has very

46:58.600 --> 47:04.240
little solo content.

47:04.240 --> 47:10.400
In my honest opinion after having played them both, I've put more time into World of Warcraft

47:10.400 --> 47:19.320
than I have Final Fantasy XI, because I could play a lot more solo if I wanted to.

47:19.320 --> 47:41.840
To be perfectly honest though, I actually still like Ragnarok Online more, because I

47:41.840 --> 47:50.760
am curious to hear what's keeping you in the game, because you've heard a lot of us talking

47:50.760 --> 47:54.120
about WoW now, I'm kind of curious, because I know there's a lot of people that still

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
play it.

47:55.120 --> 48:00.160
I'm just glad I can contribute something, because that's the only game I play now.

48:00.160 --> 48:04.560
You always contribute lots of stuff to the program, whether you'd like to admit it or

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
not.

48:05.560 --> 48:11.000
Moving on, Halo 2 also has a lot of folks who are addicted to it, and Microsoft has

48:11.000 --> 48:15.400
announced they will be putting out two new maps for Halo 2.

48:15.400 --> 48:21.340
Actually I believe they just went up, they're available for $4 to download.

48:21.340 --> 48:24.360
No word yet if they're going to be free later on.

48:24.360 --> 48:33.640
The maps that just came out are Hangem High and Desolation, which came over from Halo

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
1.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.560
Kind of cool, if you're a Halo fan.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.780
Yes, if you're a Halo fan.

48:37.780 --> 48:40.940
Now bring on the Halo 3 beta.

48:40.940 --> 48:46.560
Oh wait, and everybody thinks that each update or whatever is going to be a Halo 3 beta.

48:46.560 --> 48:52.320
If you're not a fan of Halo, maybe you're a fan of Xbox Live's video downloads, if that's

48:52.320 --> 48:56.920
the case, well, there's going to be some more content up there for you guys, including some

48:56.920 --> 48:57.920
new stuff.

48:57.920 --> 49:02.800
A few more studios have jumped on board, including Paramount Pictures.

49:02.800 --> 49:09.160
They're going to be adding Braveheart, Team America World Police, World Trade Center,

49:09.160 --> 49:12.240
and South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.

49:12.240 --> 49:23.640
Warner Brothers Home Entertainment is also adding Sublime and Babylon 5 The Lost Tales.

49:23.640 --> 49:27.800
Some other stuff from TV that you're going to be getting, A&E Networks.

49:27.800 --> 49:35.280
They're providing Dog the Bounty Hunter, King of Cars Driving Force, and Chris Angel Mind

49:35.280 --> 49:38.440
Freak, as well as Gene Simmons Family Jewel.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.720
Oh, that's that show they used to make fun of on the soup all the time, remember?

49:41.720 --> 49:42.720
Mind Freak!

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
Remember that?

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
Yes.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.720
Oh, God.

49:45.720 --> 49:50.680
ADV Films, they're going to have some anime stuff on there, so you can check that out.

49:50.680 --> 49:53.680
National Geographic, of course, adding some stuff there.

49:53.680 --> 49:58.640
New Line Cinema is bringing snakes on a plane, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning, Tenacious

49:58.640 --> 50:08.360
D, and The Pick of Destiny, plus some other top titles, including Austin Powers' The

50:08.360 --> 50:18.600
Spy Who Shagged Me and Magnolia, and Total Vid is providing some extreme sports videos.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.040
How about some titles we don't all already own on DVD already?

50:22.040 --> 50:25.960
I'm looking at you, Austin Powers.

50:25.960 --> 50:31.760
Yay for Microsoft getting more stuff on the marketplace, but how about something to compete

50:31.760 --> 50:33.320
with the DVDs that are out there now?

50:33.320 --> 50:34.320
Does that make sense?

50:34.320 --> 50:35.320
I know.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.120
Especially in the TV department, more HDTV.

50:38.120 --> 50:43.640
Also interesting is their pricing structure has changed.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.880
Now basically, here's how it's going to work.

50:45.880 --> 50:52.720
The new releases now, the 720p HD movies are going to be 480 Microsoft points, or $6, while

50:52.720 --> 50:58.200
the standard size movies are going to be $4, or 320 Microsoft points.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.520
That went up, didn't it?

50:59.520 --> 51:00.520
I think so.

51:00.520 --> 51:08.760
The music films, the HD ones are going to be $4.50, or 360 Microsoft points, and $3

51:08.760 --> 51:13.600
for the normal resolution movies, or 240 Microsoft points.

51:13.600 --> 51:22.880
Then TV purchases, for HD it's going to be $3, and for SD it's going to be $2.

51:22.880 --> 51:28.760
I don't know, I haven't bought anything yet, and I'm not really looking to purchase anything

51:28.760 --> 51:29.760
anytime soon.

51:29.760 --> 51:35.000
I got the one movie, which was cool, the hard candy or whatever, because it was an artsy

51:35.000 --> 51:39.080
house movie that I didn't think I'd find in HD otherwise.

51:39.080 --> 51:43.440
But now that I have the HD DVD player, and I've got some Netflix here, I got Babel on

51:43.440 --> 51:44.440
HD DVD.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.440
I don't know.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.720
I'm kind of using Netflix to get my movie filled right now.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.240
I know this is not the avenue that they want to go in.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.480
I'm telling you, big money here.

51:53.480 --> 51:58.560
Porn downloads, confirm with a credit card number or something like that, that you're

51:58.560 --> 52:01.840
over 18 or something like that.

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
That would be fucking awesome.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.640
I would love to see porn downloads.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.440
Do you really think Microsoft would do that?

52:06.440 --> 52:07.440
No.

52:07.440 --> 52:15.040
No, because it would be horrible for PR, but they should.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.880
Maybe there's a creative way they could do it.

52:16.880 --> 52:22.720
Like you know, Pimps at Sea.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.040
That's the Halo 3 alpha name.

52:24.040 --> 52:25.040
It's a joke.

52:25.040 --> 52:29.040
They had a movie poster for that, which looked funny.

52:29.040 --> 52:35.280
It was a parrot with a pirate's hook for a head.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.280
You know what?

52:36.280 --> 52:37.280
What?

52:37.280 --> 52:38.280
Chicken butt.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.640
We need ninja, like more ninja stuff going on.

52:41.640 --> 52:48.480
Anyway, because we all know that the natural enemy of the pirate is the ninja, so a pirate

52:48.480 --> 52:49.480
ninja.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.680
There was a pirate ninja in Weebles.

52:51.680 --> 52:58.480
Anyway, for anyone who has been keeping up with Bullet Witch, the Xbox 360 shooting game,

52:58.480 --> 53:00.400
there is now some downloadable content.

53:00.400 --> 53:03.120
Who hasn't yet committed suicide.

53:03.120 --> 53:06.080
Announced by Atari.

53:06.080 --> 53:09.200
What's out is there is a White Witch outfit.

53:09.200 --> 53:14.480
There's also going to be coming up a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary and Pixie outfits later

53:14.480 --> 53:17.480
on.

53:17.480 --> 53:23.080
Mummy slash schoolgirl comma.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.080
We can't hear Megzi.

53:24.080 --> 53:28.840
I was going to say a Mummy Schoolgirl Secretary.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.840
With pixie wings.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.200
With pixie wings.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.680
I came.

53:32.680 --> 53:33.680
Wow.

53:33.680 --> 53:39.560
Anyway, so also coming up, these are new missions that are 20 Microsoft points each.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.340
The Dynamite Beauty is available now.

53:42.340 --> 53:50.400
Coming up is Clad and Streaming and Great Spells and some other difficulty settings.

53:50.400 --> 53:56.400
There will also be Caterpillar City, Endless One Shot Kill, Geist Search and Destroy and

53:56.400 --> 54:03.040
enhanced additions of City of Screams, Up in Flames at 10,000 feet, Down in the Valley,

54:03.040 --> 54:06.060
The Bound Soul and The End of Chaos.

54:06.060 --> 54:09.960
There will also be theme packs.

54:09.960 --> 54:16.440
For people who don't know much about the game, it's by the studio Cavia.

54:16.440 --> 54:22.740
It's a third person action game and this witch lady has to shoot things.

54:22.740 --> 54:25.600
Which download content will make my game not suck?

54:25.600 --> 54:26.760
I know.

54:26.760 --> 54:31.200
Coming out next month for 100 Microsoft points, a patch that makes the game not suck.

54:31.200 --> 54:35.760
Here's the thing that's really ridiculous about the whole thing anyways is that for

54:35.760 --> 54:40.400
20 Microsoft points, I think that's the equivalent of a quarter, just make it free.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.400
I mean, seriously, you're making a quarter off this crap.

54:43.400 --> 54:52.760
I mean, just make the goddamn content free as if, you know, sorry the game sucks so bad.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.640
I'm going to download this by the way because I have the game, although I don't know if

54:56.640 --> 54:58.360
I want to waste a quarter on this stuff.

54:58.360 --> 54:59.480
I'll think about that.

54:59.480 --> 55:03.600
I may throw it at a hobo instead, you know?

55:03.600 --> 55:06.000
Have any of you worth, you know, a little bit more to me?

55:06.000 --> 55:10.580
Mummy school girl pixie wings, quarter at hobo.

55:10.580 --> 55:12.360
I don't know.

55:12.360 --> 55:15.600
But I do know that Pcross DS is coming out in Europe pretty soon.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.600
Do you like my transition?

55:17.600 --> 55:22.920
Pcross DS is this kind of like picture crossword type game.

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
I don't know.

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
It kind of looks like Minesweeper to me.

55:24.920 --> 55:25.920
I haven't played it.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.760
But it's coming out on May 11th in Europe.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.600
It's a part of the Touch Generations label.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.260
Nintendo's putting it out on the DS.

55:32.260 --> 55:37.800
Over 300 puzzles, everything from easy to the toughest upon tough.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.420
Also multiplayer amongst the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

55:41.420 --> 55:45.360
So if you want to do some puzzling over Wi-Fi, here's something to check out.

55:45.360 --> 55:49.120
The game has been getting very solid reviews, even though I don't make it sound very good.

55:49.120 --> 55:52.720
Keep in mind I haven't actually played it, so my opinion doesn't mean shit.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.720
Right.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.360
It's an old Game Boy game.

55:56.360 --> 55:57.360
Is it?

55:57.360 --> 55:58.360
I don't remember.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.360
Yeah, it's a very, very old game.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.920
It was Mario's Pcross a long time ago.

56:00.920 --> 56:01.920
Well shit.

56:01.920 --> 56:03.480
And I like puzzle games too.

56:03.480 --> 56:08.120
In fact, I kind of actually, for some sick side of me, kind of wants to get Honeycomb

56:08.120 --> 56:11.760
Beat just because it was kind of fun at that show we played it at.

56:11.760 --> 56:12.760
Oh, I don't know.

56:12.760 --> 56:13.760
I'll hook you up.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
Don't worry.

56:14.760 --> 56:15.760
Okay.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.760
Well, let's move on then.

56:17.760 --> 56:24.400
Anyways, so in case you may have been under a rock for some reason, you know, it might

56:24.400 --> 56:25.880
be nice and cool down there.

56:25.880 --> 56:26.880
Who knows?

56:26.880 --> 56:32.040
Well, there, Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hit the internet and the internet exploded because

56:32.040 --> 56:35.000
I crashed a bunch of different websites.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Sounded just like that.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.760
That was also the same sound that was in my pants after watching it, but no, seriously

56:40.760 --> 56:43.200
though.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.200
It was awesome.

56:44.200 --> 56:52.220
That was also the sound Lizzie Lohan's vagina made shortly after she got out of rehab.

56:52.220 --> 56:53.220
Never mind.

56:53.220 --> 56:55.100
There's a joke there.

56:55.100 --> 56:56.100
Look for it.

56:56.100 --> 57:00.120
A few politicians are a little bit pissed off at the fact that the game takes place

57:00.120 --> 57:02.680
in Liberty City.

57:02.680 --> 57:07.920
Note to politicians, the game is taking place in Liberty City for about four different games

57:07.920 --> 57:08.920
now.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.840
Where the fuck were you?

57:10.840 --> 57:17.440
Anyways, so now they're just like, oh, but now that it really looks like New York, we

57:17.440 --> 57:18.440
don't like it.

57:18.440 --> 57:22.600
And it's funny because I'm going to quote this, I think the best one I read here, sorry

57:22.600 --> 57:24.400
about it, was on Kotaku.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.400
They were saying, and here are some of the quotes that they picked out here, setting

57:28.400 --> 57:34.100
Grand Theft Auto in the safest big city in America would be like setting Halo in Disneyland.

57:34.100 --> 57:37.160
City Councilman Peter Velour.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.480
I want to play Halo.

57:38.480 --> 57:43.160
Halo in Disneyland might make me interested in that game a whole lot more than I already

57:43.160 --> 57:44.160
am.

57:44.160 --> 57:49.680
That's like the lady with the SUV, that'd be right up there with the lady on the cell

57:49.680 --> 57:52.840
phone in the SUV.

57:52.840 --> 57:58.320
The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or killing

57:58.320 --> 57:59.320
police officers.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.840
Jason Post, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg.

58:02.840 --> 58:08.880
And then the best one, and probably the most uninformed, in previous incarnations, players

58:08.880 --> 58:13.320
advanced through the game by killing cops, selling pornography to children, and killing

58:13.320 --> 58:14.960
prostitutes.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.000
I'm just going to take a wild guess here.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.960
I think one of those three is not right.

58:21.960 --> 58:26.640
Must be the killing cops part, because I don't think you sell pornography to children in

58:26.640 --> 58:27.640
there.

58:27.640 --> 58:31.680
There's not Grand Theft Auto child pornography.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.720
But if they put that in Grand Theft Auto IV, that'd be a great new feature.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.920
It'd be a cool side mission.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.780
Either way though, they're going to bitch and moan.

58:39.780 --> 58:42.400
It's just going to build up the hype for it.

58:42.400 --> 58:46.080
Certain people are going to file lawsuits, and the game's going to come out and fucking

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
rock.

58:47.080 --> 58:53.320
So anyway, way to go Rockstar, you know how to hype up your games.

58:53.320 --> 58:54.960
Here comes the hype train.

58:54.960 --> 58:55.960
Come on, rather train.

58:55.960 --> 58:56.960
Choo choo.

58:56.960 --> 58:57.960
Choo choo.

58:57.960 --> 58:58.960
It did look good though.

58:58.960 --> 58:59.960
Very good.

58:59.960 --> 59:00.960
I can't wait to play it.

59:00.960 --> 59:02.320
I'll tell you what I'm happy about though.

59:02.320 --> 59:07.080
I'm happy about more Ninja Gaiden, because I need to play this demo.

59:07.080 --> 59:16.120
I've been a big Ninja Gaiden fan forever, so coming out on the Japanese PSN, we have

59:16.120 --> 59:18.720
the demo for Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.960
And it's not Gayden, it's Gaiden.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.600
Pronounce it right, fuckers.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.600
Ninja Gaiden?

59:23.600 --> 59:24.600
No.

59:24.600 --> 59:28.840
There's a joke I want to make, but I can't.

59:28.840 --> 59:29.840
I know.

59:29.840 --> 59:31.080
I'll make my people angry.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.080
Sure.

59:32.080 --> 59:40.600
No, it just, it really pisses me off, because I grew up, and I was like, I don't think that's

59:40.600 --> 59:42.560
how it's supposed to sound.

59:42.560 --> 59:46.160
And Gaiden, by the way, means side story, huh?

59:46.160 --> 59:47.160
Okay, anyway.

59:47.160 --> 59:49.640
Stop being so Gayden.

59:49.640 --> 59:52.000
I'm going to kick your butt.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.760
So anyway, you run around in tight leather, maybe it is a little gay.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.640
That made Jamie's bitching all worth it, seriously.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.800
The demo is to be out.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:17.560
I don't see a date, April 27th is going to be their date, so happy birthday to me.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:27.560
Alright, well, while DarkSakura is playing Ninja Gayden on her PlayStation Network, Ninja

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.100
Gaiden Dragon Sword is coming out for the DS, and it's been spotted in Famitsu Magazine.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.560
The game is completely controlled on the touchscreen, but not blocking.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.720
So don't expect your typical 2D Ninja Gaiden.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.160
Great, I'm sure that controls like, awesome.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.720
We'll see, I mean, very little is known about the game except for the fact that it's on

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.720
its way.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.360
Unless you can read Japanese, maybe you can get some more out of that than I can, I don't

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360
know.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.080
I did hear that there was, this was shown during like, I think one of their gamer days

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.240
or whatever, the equivalent of a press event, and it didn't control very well.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Uh oh.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.320
But then again, then again, the game is, you know, still early in development, and they

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.360
didn't fix that, but there were some issues.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360
Uh oh.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:17.140
Anyways, something that makes me very happy, I might have to stop playing Earth Defense

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.840
Force 2017 for it, Crackdown is getting a new update, in fact they're going to fix the

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.720
multiplayer and lag issues, which is nice, because they need to do that.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.840
Enable the Halo 3 Beta.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.160
They're not going to enable the Halo 3 Beta.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160
Fuck.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.360
Anyways, so some other stuff that they're going to be doing as well, they're supposed

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:42.920
to be possibly expanding the co-op to allow some more players, in fact one of the things

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.880
they're going to be adding a new multiplayer mode that was based off of some YouTube videos,

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:55.440
so that's pretty interesting, and then also rumors that they might do airborne cars as

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440
well.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.520
However, there is, there has been a- Wait, flying cars?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.800
Isn't that already a patch for that?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.840
What would you do for the flying car?

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:12.920
You know- Me, George Jetson, his boy, Elroy.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:19.320
No I- Okay, so but there are going to be some free updates, I know there was one that was

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.380
fixing the patching stuff, there's another one that they added that's going to be increasing

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:28.560
the number of gang control cars that are roaming the streets for certain achievements, and

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.880
there's going to be later on I guess a free thing to reset the gang so that all the bosses

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.160
come back to their normal spot, so you can play co-op and get that co-op achievement

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.160
for finishing all the missions that we need to do.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160
Cool.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160
Have you been playing the game?

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.720
A little bit.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.680
Strangely enough I've been playing Tetris a lot this week, so, because the achievements

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.880
are not that hard, so I'm trying to get my 1500 score by mid-April or whatever it was,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.680
I don't have much time left and I have like 600 points to go.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680
You too may win Contra.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680
Contra.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680
I already have it.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.680
I love Contra.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:11.080
Well, there's something that I'd have to say, some Japanese airlines are getting contrary,

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:21.180
ha ha, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is banning local wireless gaming

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.640
on flights because the Wi-Fi signal allegedly interferes with the airplane's instruments,

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.720
the same, you know, cell phone thing.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:37.640
Now, there's an interesting thing about that, as was indicated, and I'm going to go ahead

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:45.000
and quote the source of this, I think is a very good point that Joystiq made, is that

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.560
Lufthansa has been offering in-plane Wi-Fi since 2003 and haven't had any crashes because

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.240
of it.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:04:03.160
The FAA states that Wi-Fi is safe, so I guess that maybe Japanese planes are built differently.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160
Maybe.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.200
Where the hell does Lufthansa fly?

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.480
I've always seen their airline, I've never flown them.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.720
Where do they go?

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.600
I flew in Lufthansa when I went to France.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.480
Oh, they're like a Europe airline.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.800
Yeah, well, I went to O'Hare to Frankfurt, to Paris.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.520
That's why I've never flown them, because I've never been to Europe.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520
Well, you should go to Europe.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.520
I want to.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.320
Are there any listeners out there who want to send me a lot of money, so go to Europe.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.920
Well, speaking of another place I want to go to, Australia, this is some interesting

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.720
news here.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.520
Richie Young, who was once the Australian PlayStation 2 magazine's editor, he says he

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:52.160
was offered sex, money, overseas trips, and other types of gifts, all in the name of inflating

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.560
game review scores.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.320
We all know that little handouts and freebies and all that kind of crap goes on all the

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.480
time, which we try to tell you, this is why you should support indies, because the mainstream

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.600
gaming doesn't give a shit about indies, and boy, have we learned that in a big way recently.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.560
I have not had any offers for sex.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560
Exactly.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:19.680
We don't get offers for sex, but anyway, very interesting, so that all kind of came to light

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:25.240
this week, and of course, has the internet abuzz about sex for game reviews.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.240
So there you have it.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.000
It's my nerd dream, the two things I love the most.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:39.240
I want to review video games and fuckerkers, all while leveling my blood elf.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.040
I want to cast a spell!

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040
Oh, Black Wolf.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
Why do you want to cast a spell?

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
There's nothing to attack you.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.800
I'm attacking the darkness.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.320
Black Wolf in chat totally wins with this comment.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.400
OLR doesn't get offers for sex, but they do get fucked.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.440
God, I love you, Bobby Black Wolf.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:04.680
All right, Skyblind's open, 1877 Game OLR, or username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680
Let's go to the phones.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
They're already ringing.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680
Oh, Chris, real quick.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680
Skype, baby.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.680
I'll make it worth your wild.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.520
Well, how can you turn that down?

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.640
Let's go check out the phones.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.640
They're ringing.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.640
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.640
Who's this?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.640
This OLR?

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.640
Is this OLR?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.360
Yes, this is Luigi Mario.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.960
Hiya, Luigi Mario.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960
What's on your mind?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.880
Not much, just calling and say that I love the show.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880
Do you, Luigi?

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.880
Yes, I do.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880
Yeah.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Why are you, I mean, I've never had a video game celebrity call into the show before.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.280
I mean, you don't have anything better to do on Sunday nights, like save a princess

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280
or whatever?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.280
No, because she's too busy humping Mario.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280
What, Luigi?

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:53.200
Daisy's in the back playing DDR Supernova.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.400
Daisy's playing DDR Supernova?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.200
Why isn't she playing DDR with Mario?

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200
Yes.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.560
Well, she didn't like that.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.160
She wanted something to up her game.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.160
Okay.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.520
Hey, I got a question.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.880
I've always wanted to ask Luigi this question.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.200
How does it feel to constantly get shafted with your brother getting all the attention?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.520
Well, it doesn't bother me much because it gives me more time to relax and have a little

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520
fun.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.520
Because between a you and a me, I think Peach is a little bit of a whore.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:30.520
Wait, so are you saying you trade off Princess Peach with your brother?

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.520
That's kind of gross.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.640
Well, what can I say?

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.920
She keeps getting kidnapped by Bowser all the time.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.680
My girl is at home having fun.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.720
I have a nice accent.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.360
I'm sorry, but I think this joke is in another castle.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.960
I really don't know what to say.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960
Okay.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960
Wait.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.760
Well, Luigi, I'm going to ask you, what made you decide to call into our program tonight?

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.600
Well, I just got a newer computer and someone had sent me a link to check it out, so I decided

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600
to.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.440
Was that Charles Martinet who sent you that link?

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.560
No, one of your listeners.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.560
Oh.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.680
The other guy by the name of Rama.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680
Oh.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680
I like Rama.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680
Rama?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680
Yeah, he's okay.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.280
I didn't know why you spoke to Rama.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.680
Rama's got a big black wee.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.200
Is that really true?

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.340
Wait a minute.

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.960
Have you been sleeping with Rama as well as Princess Peach?

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
Oh, no.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.440
I told the girl about the way.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440
You should.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440
Hey, wait.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440
I've always wanted to know this.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440
Does Toad?

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440
What?

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.700
What do you think?

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.700
I think yes.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:35.700
He's a screaming queen.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.700
What do you think?

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.000
Look at what the hell we're at.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.160
All right, Luigi.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.840
Say something else before I hang up on you.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840
Love the show.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Keep it up.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840
All right?

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.840
I'll be listening to the next one week.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840
All right.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.480
Thank you, Luigi, for the call.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.480
You're so weird.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.000
All righty.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.760
It's something about the damn holiday today that's making everybody crazy.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.320
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320
Who's this?

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.320
Oh, it's Darth Vader on the line.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320
Hi.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.320
It's Uni.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.320
Hi, Uni.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.320
What's on your mind?

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.760
You know, we were talking about Final Fantasy XI versus WoW earlier.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.720
Yes, and you were a Final Fantasy XI player for a long time, right?

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.720
Oh, yeah.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.440
I was playing it for about three years, two months.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.800
I keep reminding everybody that.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.080
It turned out I was playing the wrong game.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080
Really?

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.240
And what made you decide that you were playing the wrong game?

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.940
Because everybody kept treating me like crap, and I was only helping everybody out that

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.920
I possibly could.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.720
You were a white mage, weren't you?

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720
Yes.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.120
I was a white mage, and that's why I quit.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120
I was also a white mage.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.040
The white mage is the party bitch.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.680
Oh, I know.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.680
This is the...

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680
I little...

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680
Come on.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680
Come on.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.960
This is where my decision to quit the game was.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.960
I was...

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.080
And Rob has seen me play.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.960
I did fucking macros with a controller.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960
I was hardcore awesome.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960
I did everything manually.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.960
You did everything manually?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960
Yes.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960
Oh, my God.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960
You're nuts.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.960
Well, I was patient.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960
Wow.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.960
I would say...

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960
Well, you have to be for that game.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.200
I would call up 22nd Stino to buff to give everyone plenty of freaking time to get there,

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:17.080
and our team was like, oh, I'm going to go pump this log.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.600
So when the bitch comes and we call in our thing, he's like, where's my buff?

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.440
I'm like, no, you suck.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:30.120
So I let him die by going all black mage on whatever our thing was, and then he's messaging

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.600
me like, oh, you bitch, blah, blah, blah.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.880
I'm like, no, you're the bastard who didn't show up.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:44.440
I also leveled ninja and black mage, all both to 75.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:50.720
My favorite class I think I ever played on Final Fantasy XI was probably when I played

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.720
Summoner, but the problem was I was so screwed because if you didn't have Fenrir, you were

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.720
like this, you were a piece of shit Summoner.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720
I know.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.120
I had to deal with that too.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:08.760
I did, though, have to say that I loved Monk.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760
Monk was pretty great.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760
Monk?

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.880
I was going to level that to 75, but that was before I decided to quit.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.360
Well, Uni, one more question for you.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.440
What is WoW giving you that Final Fantasy XI was lacking?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:32.080
The rest of the EXP, a lot more better people that don't treat me like crap, and I can solo

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.880
my EXP instead of being the party's bitch.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.920
Are you playing a priest in WoW?

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.480
I'm playing a tank.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.560
See, well, it's a different type of character, but then again, the priests I know don't get

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.000
treated like bitches in WoW, so I don't know.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.840
Oh, priests get treated like bitches.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840
It depends.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840
It depends.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.640
Okay, Uni, I got to let you go so we can get to some other calls, any really quick last

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.480
messages for our listeners?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Okay.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480
Listen to Diana Fire.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480
Thank you.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480
All right.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480
Take care, Uni.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480
Bye.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.480
Uni does her own show on another network.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.480
She has a cute little picture.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Call the Diana Fire.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480
It is.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.480
That's her.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.480
That's her.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.480
A little Skype picture.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.480
A little Skype picture.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480
We like it when listeners.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480
One time we had a listener call us with video.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480
It was crazy.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480
Sweet.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.480
I didn't even know Skype could do that.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480
I'm so behind the times.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480
Who's this?

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.480
Rayden Softin.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480
Hi, Rayden.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480
Analog.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.480
Hey, Rayden.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480
What's on your mind?

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.480
What's on my mind?

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.480
Two things.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.680
Can I say actually one thing real quick?

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.760
I want to say thank you, Rayvenstaufen, and sorry.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.520
Our original April Fool's joke for tonight was that we were going to have Rayvenstaufen

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.480
and some of our other infamous callers host the show, but unfortunately it didn't play

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
out that way.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480
Some things happened.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.440
It was kind of easier to throw this together, but thanks, Rayvenstaufen, for being a good

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.160
sport and being ready and willing to do that.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Always, guys.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160
Always.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160
All right.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.360
I've got two more news stories that you didn't mention, and this you didn't mention on the

01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:01.640
other podcast two weeks ago, GameWise opening up a new... This is not bullshit.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.220
They're opening up a new distribution center in Pittsburgh, and that's good for me because

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.760
I don't have to wait eight days for a turnaround.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.640
I had heard of that, and that is very good news.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.080
I think part of the thing I like about Netflix is that they have a distribution center in

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.840
West Sacramento, so I always get movies within a day.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.840
Always.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.160
I can imagine how frustrating that's got to be to have GameFly, and you're on the East

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.640
Coast and you're waiting so long for games because GameFly is a good idea in theory.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.520
In fact, I really don't know why I'm not using it or something similar.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.240
I hear there's one for games and flicks that maybe I should look into.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240
I don't know.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.760
Not flicks is too good.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.040
Are they not good?

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.720
Whatever the case is, I probably should be doing this with games, but for some reason

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720
I keep buying.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.720
I don't know why.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.200
It's an addiction or something.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.840
I don't know.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840
All right.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.760
Well, congratulations on that, and let me know how the service improves for you once

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760
that happens.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.520
Well, I'm fine with the service already.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.200
It's just, like I said, the turnaround time sucks.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.200
Black Wolf agrees, by the way, that games and flicks sucks.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.120
There you go.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.680
Thank you, Black Wolf.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.000
All right.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What else is on your mind?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.280
Your resurrection hit the PlayStation 3 today.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.160
Oh, on the PlayStation Network store?

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
Or yesterday.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160
It hit.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160
It hit.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160
So no joke, right?

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
No joke.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
I don't know.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
Well, that's cool.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160
How do I know that?

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Because I picked it on my podcast.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.160
Oh, I see.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.560
Is this just a cheap plug for your own podcast?

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
No.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560
All right.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.000
Well, have you downloaded Tekken yet?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.400
I don't have a PlayStation 3.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.160
That would be a problem.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.600
I don't know why.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.040
I'm curious.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.960
Black Wolf says Tekken Dark resurrection came up a few weeks ago.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.240
I thought I saw some story about it, but again, I don't have a PS3, so I've been able to check

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.720
for myself.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:02.480
So Raven's talking about you might be a little late for that train.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480
What?

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480
I guess where I got it was old.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.480
All right.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.480
I put that on the disclaimer on the thing anyway.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480
All right.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480
Well, that's okay.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.400
Anything else on your mind, buddy?

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.400
No.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.720
I'm not going to even plug the podcast.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720
You all know about it.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720
All right.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.080
Take care, Raven's Dolphin.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.080
The infamous, the one and only later.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080
The one and only, Raven's Dolphin.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.360
Hi, you're on Orange Talents Radio.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
Who's this?

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360
This is Legend of Zaku.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360
Hey, buddy.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
What's up?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.360
Smoking a little bud.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.360
I want some cookies.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.360
Buddy.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.360
Hey, buddy.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360
What's on your mind?

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.360
Having a little...

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360
Just chilling out.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360
Having some Twinkies.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360
Yeah.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360
Yeah.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.360
Yeah, buddy.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360
It's on your mind.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360
Anyways.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:54.920
Just doing shit like going to this small time anime convention wasn't that big.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.040
I had to chug the Ramune bottle really fast.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.040
Nearly burned my throat.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:05.000
But yeah, I also went to Nintendo World today trying to win a Wii and a Wii Play tournament.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Never made it though.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Dude, if you play Cooking Mama, it's like so much food in Cooking Mama.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It's lame.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You should have asked to borrow Radma's Big Black Wii.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yeah, I should have.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
But yeah, that's the whole point.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I mean, yeah.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I don't know.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It's just...

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
It wasn't really that much.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.320
Oh, and another thing.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.760
On behalf of New York City, I apologize with the way our elected officials react to how

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.600
GTA IV looks like our hometown.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600
I forgive you.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600
And you should...

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.600
Yeah, but it's also...

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.000
I also forget to disregard what the Daily News and New York Post spews out.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It's just...

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
They're sensationalists.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
They're not even...

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.540
They just push junk news to our eyes.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.280
And all they do is just...

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.760
They act like the Daily Bugle if it was run by that guy, that Jameson guy.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.480
As in, so did you do nothing but print shit about Spiderman?

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.720
Yeah, no.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720
Not even that.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.000
It's just that they report on...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.680
They hype up everything.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.680
They have a slant...

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.680
They're mostly slanted.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.400
They're not as neutral as other papers like the New York Times are.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400
So I don't take their word...

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.360
I only take their word at face value and nothing else.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
I want to go back to the...

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
I know it's just bullshit.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.600
I want to go back to the Wii Play tournament.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.600
What exactly...

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.240
Is this some tournament on Wii Play or what exactly was going on?

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.560
Yes, it was in Nintendo World.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.100
How did you get denied entry into this contest?

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.100
Because I woke up late.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.100
Oh.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.100
Because I woke up late today.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.600
Party a little too hard, huh?

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.800
Yeah, pretty much.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.240
Dude, I didn't know you could gut your Wiimote and then smoke it.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.040
Yeah, Wiimote.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.280
It's a Wiimote right there.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.400
We make an excellent bong.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.480
I'm so trying that when I get home.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.720
Yeah, so too.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.560
Dude, this is the most entertaining call Zach has ever made at this program.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.560
This is great.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560
All right, Zach.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
He's up really late.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.520
I'm hoping to see you when I come out to New York City in June.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.120
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.120
I went to that too.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120
We'll see.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.120
More details to come.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.120
Bye.

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.120
All right, later, man.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.120
Bye.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.120
All right, later, buddy.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120
Smoke another bow.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120
Get her done.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120
Sorry.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120
Get her done.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.640
Wow, you did that way too well.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.120
That's why I have no voice tonight, because I keep straining my throat with those stupid

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120
jokes.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120
Stop it.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.120
All right, yes, Mommy.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.120
All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.600
Thank you, boys and girls, for calling in and participating on the Skypline, because

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600
rock.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.680
All right, let's go around and ask if there's any last minute stories tonight.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.240
Last minute stories.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.000
Speaking news, I rule.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.800
April fool.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.520
She's okay.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.520
Loki?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:52.160
Guitar Hero 2, 360 will have Fector Pedals, because there's a port at the bottom of it.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.200
I think we reported something like this.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:59.680
There was a story like this a long time ago, but now it's confirmed, because apparently

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.280
the manual says so.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.760
Pedals sold separately.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.520
Now you really can't put the pedal to the metal.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520
Get it?

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.760
Here's my impression of Rob tonight.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.320
This is Rob.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.640
I do sound like a queef.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.400
So here's something interesting.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.080
I think someone, I don't remember if we reported on this or not, but apparently the ochreing

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:36.520
of time guy, the guy who was doing the 2D kind of homebrew game, I remember how he was

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.680
dead and everything, well, people aren't sure if this is an April Fool's joke or not.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.320
It might be, but apparently they think that he's not dead because he's been active on

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.600
his MSN and Myspace accounts.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.040
Either way, this is going to end up fucked up.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.200
Either way you look at this story is going to end up fucked up, because if it was a big

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.460
April Fool's joke, that's fucked up.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:08.680
But if he really was dead and all these people are not believing it, that's fucked up too.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.080
So there are no winners in this scenario, only losers.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.560
Mitch Hedberg died on April Fool's Day.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560
That's fucked up too.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.080
And everyone thought it was a joke.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.640
But seriously, if you're going to smoke 500 drugs, you got it coming.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.400
I'm sorry to say, but Mitch Hedberg, rest in peace, but dude.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:32.720
I wonder if he's like, dude, that'd be so funny if I fucking died on April Fool's Day.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.160
You know that crossed his mind.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.280
Alright, well, anything else, Logie?

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:47.000
No, I don't really have much else other than the lineup of games on Gamefly looks pretty

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
good.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.120
Oh, like how you can go to Gamefly and look up all these great new games that are coming

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.120
out?

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120
Yeah.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:58.160
They haven't picked up on yet, or well, maybe some folks did, but they can't really talk

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160
about it anymore.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.280
So, you know, you might want to scan Gamefly, see what they got, because apparently Gamefly,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.280
you know, they can do whatever they want because they're Gamefly.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280
So there you go.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.280
That's hot.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280
I too made new Wallpaper.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.480
This is what I was doing during the show, was making new Wallpaper.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.600
Well, I'm proud of all of you.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.000
Meanwhile, there's a radio show going on, so-

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Why Wallpaper?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Why don't you put some of this stuff up on OLRPSP?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Whatever happens.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Where's the PSP site?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Where's the Wii site?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Where's the love, Loki?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.840
PSP site's still up, just updated, and the Wii site, yeah, about that.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.880
It's coming.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
Soon.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.720
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.000
Chris, Meg Z, thank you guys so much for being here and helping us with our April Fool's

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
joke tonight.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You guys rock.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I know.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Get her done!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Get her done!

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Meg Z, final thought.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Okay, I had it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Chris, your final thought.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.560
Well, I had a final thought, and then I forgot it.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.880
Oh, my final thought is, fuck you, Jiranami.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.320
Yeah, you heard me.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320
I said it.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320
Fuck you.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.320
You know why?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320
You know why?

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.360
Because that one time I went into the chat room, the one time my computer was working

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.760
right with the chat room, you booted me off because I was trying to get Rob's attention.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.500
Fuck you!

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.120
I idle in chat all the time.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.120
So I'm using that there.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120
Watch!

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.120
All right.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.120
I love you, Rob.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.880
My final thought is, I want a hamburger too, and watching Logi put all that burger to waste

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.880
makes me a sad panda.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.880
I'm going to throw it away.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880
You're going to throw it away right in front of my face.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880
No, I don't want it.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.880
I don't want to eat something you have eaten, but it makes me go, I want a burger.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880
Final thought.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880
Oh, you have a real final thought, Meg Z.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880
I have an actual final thought.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880
Okay.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.480
If any of the people in chat or any of the people listening live in the Chicago Midwest

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.960
area and are planning on going to Anime Central this year, Chris and I will both be there.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.320
I will actually have an art table, and you should come by and see me and buy my art,

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320
because it's awesome.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.080
Actually, I think one of our listeners said she was going to Anime Central, so you guys

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.720
should plan an OLR meetup or something.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.720
Yeah, we should.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:06.400
Actually, I think somebody friended me from your OLR live journal, and she's going to

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.060
ASUN, so we're hopefully... Yeah, I'm going to try and see if I can do a promo thing for

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.060
you guys.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:13.060
Fuck yeah.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.060
Do it.

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060
We'll get you some flyers or something.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060
Yeah.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.060
I'll do a total promo.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:20.640
I'll do a total promo with her art and the person who's going to share her art table,

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.480
which is Misa, by the way, anyone who is on DeviantArt.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.200
If you're on DeviantArt, you know who Misa is.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200
Yeah.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.480
I'm going to walk around with both of their art prints all over my body, and I'll have

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:39.600
some OLR flyers, and saying, buy these prints and listen to the show, or God will hate you.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.020
All right.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.020
But God already hates them.

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.020
We're going to Anime Central.

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.020
Get her done, Chris.

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.020
Get her done.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.020
Get her done.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.680
Okay, for Sakura, your final thought.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.680
I have two.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.280
Uno.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:55.480
I'm doing my last two massages for my school, because I did graduate, but I haven't got

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.780
my diploma yet, and I'll have it after I do my massage final on Tuesday, so everybody

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.780
think good thoughts for me.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.780
And then... Dos.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:10.360
She says, you had two, uno, dos.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:18.880
My other one is in regards to waking up at four in the morning tomorrow, do not want.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.560
Low key, your final thought.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560
Don't worry.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.880
The Wii site will be done soon, I promise you.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.280
I've got 3D Realms working on it.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.480
They promised me they have the best guys, you know, the guys working on Duke Nukem Forever,

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.480
working on the site.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.220
It should be done very soon, I promise you.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.440
They wouldn't let you down like that.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.720
My roommate, Extrofer, just poked his head in here wanting to make a final thought.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.760
I don't know if we should let him, but whatever.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760
Extrofer, final thought.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.080
I was just going to say, I'm straight now.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.080
You are not.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.080
April Fools.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080
I am too.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.440
No, not, look at my Myspace.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.160
I'm in a date with the girls now.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.760
Look at your Myspace, that's proof.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.680
Yeah, because I'm really going to believe what I read on Myspace.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.360
Myspace is proof.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.800
You know we already did our April Fools show like two hours ago, right?

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.880
No, this is not an April, I know it's coincidence.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880
Coinkydink.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.360
But I'm with the girls, I want the boobs.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:21.160
Does vagina taste like pussy?

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.160
Does it taste like pizza?

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.160
No.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.040
Okay, good, because I don't like pizza.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.600
You know what pink stuff tastes like?

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600
It tastes like mmm.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
Oh, okay.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:44.000
Mmm, ooh please, ooh please.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.440
We hope you enjoyed the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:53.000
It was fun, it was a great five years, but unfortunately I draw the line at pussy talk.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.320
No, anyway, seriously, we'll see you next week, when we might actually talk about video

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320
games.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Wouldn't that be great?

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.520
I can't wait.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:25.160
So we'll see you then here on Orange Lounge Radio.
