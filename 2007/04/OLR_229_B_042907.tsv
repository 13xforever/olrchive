19670	20251	Orange Lounge Radio
39042	42044	Just head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com All the details are there.
42164	53009	Or whatever program you use to get this program, like maybe iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show, there should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.
53389	55690	So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.
56411	62794	And of course our chat room is over at chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.
63234	64575	And we always like to read your comments.
64595	67096	And of course the skyline will be open in the show a little later.
68496	73841	The Eye Toy is no more, as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.
74242	83992	Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out, and it's called just the Eye, not the Eye Toy, because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.
84832	87375	And the camera will now, instead of taking a 320 by, or no,
88649	91030	I think before, like, the camera was only taking, like, what, 300 by 200 pixels?
91090	92451	I mean, it was really small.
92831	97654	Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.
97694	98154	That's not bad.
98194	99875	It's not HD, but that's not bad.
100096	103658	Or 320 at twice that.
103718	107240	Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye.
107580	108680	But I guess so.
109161	109621	So there you go.
110736	121199	It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.
121519	132802	You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.
133402	133822	Enjoy.
134182	135763	Does this have anything to do with the...
136880	139022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
162165	167967	So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.
169147	177369	Anyways, it is going to use the iCamera, and it's going to be a card game.
177909	178669	Hurrah!
179610	187732	I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like $80 if this game is bundled in there, so...
188547	193111	I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.
194532	198656	Now, to be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.
198716	203540	Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.
203660	204861	Looks exactly the same to me.
205862	210386	Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.
210787	212448	I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff.
212488	213889	Let me put it this way.
215090	215511	Granted...
215956	218638	The camera is better than the last camera.
219378	221220	But let's just look at the examples here.
221360	225342	And I'm not just saying, you know, that the eye toys suck.
225442	228304	Because, to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks.
230109	254241	as well, and, you know, this, hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special, you know, I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that, if that's, you know, actually what it can do, then great, you know, I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that, and according to this, I think you can, but if it does suck, I'm gonna be fucking pissed, again, but I'm not buying it.
254341	256522	I was gonna say, are you actually buying this to try it out?
256542	258503	There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.
259776	260957	Don't buy it, exactly.
261298	270349	I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.
270970	272632	That was very fucking lame.
273353	277178	I wanted that game to be so good and then it required the camera and I said, screw it.
278087	282489	That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera, but I don't want to use it.
282509	283009	It's useless.
283269	285130	I seriously don't even want to play it.
285150	286130	It's useless.
286210	286530	Stupid.
286550	290792	Apparently in multiplayer, though, you get to see other people playing the game, which might be kind of funny.
292132	292412	No.
292532	294713	I would play it just so I can play it.
294893	305557	If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet, maybe somebody in chat can clarify, but if that's true, that you can play that by waving your arms and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing,
306024	313406	What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube and we could all have a laugh.
314846	317507	That might be a good use of the... You can already do that with DDR, though.
317707	319607	That might be a good use of the Xbox 360 video game.
319647	321148	I did show him the orange bat, by the way.
322368	322848	Alright, anyway.
323068	323488	Oh, yes.
323508	324008	The bat.
324028	325089	That's old.
325169	325789	I saw the bat.
326089	327549	Did you go to her house and play pinball?
327949	329990	Yeah, you know, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.
330390	330630	Sorry.
330650	334251	DarkSakura invited me over and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games.
335507	336368	Marvel Ultimate Alliance
361460	362681	It's not a very good joke.
362701	367464	There's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?
367745	370627	I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.
370647	371668	You can play Spider Woman.
372668	373008	My word.
376171	376591	Anyway.
378252	378793	Pinball's awesome.
378913	381194	So, moving forward, shall I?
383516	386018	God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.
387647	398516	Hasbro actually is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game God, why?
399416	409945	Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast Oh no And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us Our card crack!
411121	414724	Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.
414824	415104	Me too.
415124	416025	Well, I didn't play it very long.
416225	417406	I started playing Magic again.
417806	433219	I had my black-bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books, turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to... I just gave them away because they were... Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?
434537	435377	Why don't you sell half of it?
435697	437958	No, but... I sold what I could out of it, like my moxes.
438138	439198	No, I go outdoors.
439518	443719	I sold my moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.
444939	448560	I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.
450260	450900	Nerd alert!
450940	451420	Nerd alert!
451480	452561	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
452821	454781	This show has reached maximum nerd levels.
455081	458682	The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get.
459042	459842	Wow, that goes back a ways.
459862	460542	Wow, that goes back a ways.
481758	487801	But you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same because the camera doesn't know any different.
488182	489422	It's a fucking camera.
489442	491543	It sees a card and boom, works.
491663	492544	I was going to ask you about this.
492604	495446	So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there.
495506	506652	In fact, it's really complicated to play the game because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated because otherwise it'll just recast the card because the game doesn't know.
506952	510634	It's very fucking complicated to play and when I asked them, I'm like...
511420	514022	Well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?
515443	516764	Uh... What's the point of this game?
517525	520107	Uh... See, it's just... It's retarded.
520167	521388	It's a fucking tech demo.
521828	525571	It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box, but the problem is...
526369	528652	It's thinking a little too far outside of the box.
528832	533297	It's one thing to think outside the box if the box, you know, is made out of cardboard.
533537	537401	I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.
537561	546031	All it's going to do, all it's really going to do is supplement, like, you know, if they want, let's say, for example, they want to take this and make, like, an official...
546731	550712	Magic the Gathering, Game, The Judgment, or something like that.
550792	556053	And actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever, and it just enhances that.
556113	564895	So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that, you can place them down and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.
565196	567256	Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster!
568016	570817	But to be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though...
571437	577058	I don't think anyone's going to give a shit, and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place.
577658	583280	Like any other itoy game that's out on the market right now, because they're frustrating and don't work properly.
583900	591822	I will give a shit when you can hack that thing, like people have hacked other games, to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in, so we can get our OLR game going.
592802	596463	And we can see a little dancing Rob, whenever we put his cart down.
596483	597103	Oh, hooray.
598610	600872	I am so excited, I just can't hide it.
600932	601873	That will go on YouTube.
602633	608418	Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube, Sony is creating a service called iVio.
608798	617585	It's a video sharing site in Japan, and of course, you know, it's something that's going to, hopefully, if PlayStation gets their way and Sony will compete against YouTube.
618106	624351	Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now, but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.
624881	630785	What's interesting about it is that you can actually download PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.
631345	637229	There will be a mobile version of this service as well, and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.
638507	645449	Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped, which is kind of funny.
645529	646229	So there it is.
646669	663413	So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that, oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation Eye, you'll also be able to upload those to the service, and then so you can hopefully someday download Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.
663713	666774	I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.
667560	668341	My homes, my homes, my homes.
668361	669721	And it's definitely not in slow motion.
670102	672043	Come on, just... My lovely lady homes.
672063	672523	Come on, Loki.
675325	676086	So retarded.
677647	677987	Anyways.
679007	682970	So, some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.
683350	687353	They've actually put out a new patent.
687973	689194	I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.
689214	692236	James Patrick in chat says, How is it a good idea?
692336	693457	Just go to YouTube.
694474	697155	So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.
699937	701858	Zing.
701898	702358	Sorry, Loki.
702818	709522	Anyways, so they have a brand new patent, and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.
710302	716285	And what this basically is in layman's terms is it will actually use your console to have...
717457	745619	communicate with other devices like handheld devices so say for example I have a Playstation 3 although this isn't a Microsoft thing but say I had a Playstation 3 and it had this thing in it and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers but at the same time my game system is communicating to my PSP to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster so this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to I guess speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out you know
746229	747470	More polygons and whatnot.
748230	749931	Or full proteins!
750111	751292	Goody, goody, goody!
752272	752813	Fuck that shit.
752853	754854	I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.
755494	765200	I am damn well not wasting my console resources, wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.
766200	773585	So this is like the original design for the cell processor, where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together, except that it works with things that aren't Sony-branded.
774265	774385	Yeah.
775294	775754	Something like that.
775874	776195	Alright.
778516	780037	Wait, is this Microsoft?
780457	781057	This is Microsoft, right?
781077	781758	Yeah, this is Microsoft.
781818	794144	It says, basically, in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones and consoles, in a way that increases the processing power of all the connected devices.
794264	797967	The more gaming components in the network, the more computing power is generated.
798287	800608	So, can you imagine... So, it's Voltron.
803272	805955	No, it's not gay and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.
806035	808337	No, it's Voltron!
808397	809598	I liked Vehicle Voltron.
809618	811819	Microsoft has just patented Voltron.
812120	815863	It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.
816443	817544	That's what it is, it's Voltron.
817584	819146	It doesn't have theme music, it isn't Voltron.
819206	820587	I like Vehicle Voltron.
821007	821848	I like Vehicle Voltron.
823129	824010	Hey, guess what?
824330	824550	What?
824990	826772	I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.
828564	829565	A lot cooler.
829865	831586	Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.
831646	833147	Yes, DarkSakura, a lot cooler.
833487	833767	Tron!
833787	834147	Tron.
834428	834968	Tron.
835008	838050	That's like Voltron without a V. You can't make Voltron without Tron.
838070	840451	Great minds.
840871	842012	Rob, three words for you.
842172	842973	Great minds think like me.
843673	844153	End of line.
846255	846575	Anyway.
847015	847716	Four words for you.
847736	848356	Die in a fire.
849619	855962	For people who don't know, Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever, which I have on Laserdisc and DVD.
856563	861825	I have like the uber, uber Laserdisc that's like this big fat box of Tron.
862986	867428	And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.
867668	869870	This reminds me of something, if I may real quick.
870010	870170	No.
870370	872071	No, DarkSakura, trust me, this will have your blessing.
872311	872451	What?
878897	881739	Why does that have to do with Tron?
881799	885202	F you to Disney for not having the People Mover.
885682	888504	I know, all because that stupid grad jumped off of it.
888825	893328	Because the People Mover was only... Let's graduate high school and jump off the People Mover.
893408	895770	Tron ride at Disneyland.
896190	903336	Because you could go through, like, Tron, which was the coolest thing ever, and I believe Tim Curry narrated it, which makes it just double cool.
903856	906097	You know what they could do though?
906257	910179	The people movers actually just do the things together like a little track ride and have it enclosed.
910199	912120	Yes, it was called the Rocket Rods.
912320	915242	Also, someone died on that one and they removed that as well.
915262	918523	Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad and I rode on it in the back.
918603	922005	Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some gaming.
922505	927567	Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool because it was like the people movers except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.
927587	927987	Same track.
928007	929028	It went through the Tron thing too.
929288	931029	It was just like real fast.
931329	931889	No narration.
932390	932630	Tron.
932670	933170	Tron.
934727	935888	Sark is ready, are you?
962635	971222	and so we're getting, oh sorry, another note to that was two classics returned this summer to the arcade, more data to be downloaded soon.
971943	974184	So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.
974465	977147	That is so freaking rad, I can't even contain myself.
977167	978568	I found a Discs of Tron machine.
978808	980890	Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games ever.
980910	981911	That was an excellent game.
982091	984352	The light cycles, that little cone thing, oh my god.
984373	985313	Did you ever play Tron 2.0?
987057	987718	No, I never did.
988158	991780	I have, there's something that Dan downloaded a while back, and it was pretty fun.
992221	993582	It's actually just a light cycle game.
993722	995383	I was about to say, the online one?
995603	996764	Yeah, the online light cycle game.
996784	997504	That was pretty cool.
997764	1001327	But no, that Tron 2.0, though, was supposed to be like a big playthrough game.
1001727	1004129	I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.
1004149	1008572	Dude, why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?
1008592	1009632	Because you're a nerd?
1010113	1012795	No, Dan was using my laptop last, and, oh God.
1013595	1013935	Anyway.
1014596	1016257	Tron is one year off from Prawn.
1016988	1017208	That's true.
1017228	1018448	Do you know how everyone misspells porn?
1018668	1019129	Prawn.
1019689	1020209	Tron.
1021029	1021689	TR0N.
1021809	1022830	Discs of prawn.
1025550	1029852	Oh no, that's what DarkSakura denies having, is hard discs of prawn.
1030972	1031192	What?
1031932	1032412	End of line.
1035093	1037294	Oh wait, no, I pointed, I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?
1037754	1040915	Loki's like sitting here going, are you gonna cut her off yet with the next story?
1041943	1044105	And I'm going, come on, Loki, get into your story.
1044125	1044906	Oops, it's my turn.
1044946	1045146	Hi.
1045286	1045466	Rob.
1045867	1046067	What?
1046307	1046707	No, no, no.
1046768	1047748	I just wanted to try that one time.
1047768	1048509	It doesn't work for you.
1048529	1049070	It works for her.
1049470	1050151	It's actually kind of fun.
1050971	1051372	No, it's not.
1052693	1058158	There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on the way.
1058959	1065945	Now, it's one step above a rumor because Harmonix fans seem to call the first set of arcade packs before they came out.
1065985	1067507	So this looks like it could be pretty...
1068374	1072135	Pretty true is that there are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.
1072195	1079957	Pack 1 will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett, and Coach Ice by Audioslave.
1080517	1086198	Content Pack 2 will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones, and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.
1086738	1093280	And Content Pack 3 will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand, and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.
1093700	1097761	Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,
1098206	1099307	then fail.
1099787	1102589	Although I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price they changed.
1102849	1109534	I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had like these one packs that cost, you know, 200 points and these other packs that cost like, you know, 100 points?
1109574	1110515	That would look kind of stupid.
1110575	1113237	So I think they're going to be the same price, like it or not.
1113397	1114077	Everybody bought them.
1114217	1115038	The market sustains it.
1115798	1116279	Yeah.
1116439	1119061	I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.
1119261	1119661	Exactly.
1119921	1120202	Ditto.
1120382	1124365	And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.
1124665	1125846	That's kind of rad.
1125866	1126926	That was the one pack I really didn't want.
1126946	1127747	I didn't enjoy it.
1128223	1129604	Any of those songs nearly as much as the others.
1130605	1142394	Anyways, there is a rumor that the Bioware sci-fi role-playing game, this phenomenal game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.
1143035	1151001	And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1151482	1154264	So it's rumor mill, yada, yada, yada.
1154744	1155225	It's actually moved.
1157649	1157889	Nothing.
1157909	1158990	I didn't say anything.
1159210	1160391	Did you say it's actually true?
1161252	1161733	Probably.
1162934	1163814	And how would you know this?
1165196	1166317	Because I heard about it before.
1167438	1168719	But it's probably true.
1170860	1171561	It's not done.
1171581	1172142	Let me put it this way.
1172162	1175885	It's not coming out right now, but definitely later.
1176946	1178847	So September until you get your Mass Effect.
1180389	1180849	At least.
1181550	1181910	At least.
1182782	1187586	I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at 2Human, delayed to, like, next year.
1190668	1203178	Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because their games division is actually reporting lower sales by 21%.
1203219	1204339	Basically, they've had a...
1210875	1217279	Drop from $402 million for this quarter last year to $315 million.
1217800	1218780	So that's quite a bit.
1221602	1224824	They're basically saying the revenues are actually down by $1.2 billion.
1224904	1230168	Of course, that's not surprising.
1230208	1232729	They've lost a lot of money before with their product.
1233330	1236752	Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.
1237551	1247375	Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter 2003.
1247695	1249555	See, there's that shipped again.
1250856	1251856	It's not sold, it's shipped.
1253637	1256198	Shipped equals sitting on storage shelves collecting dust.
1257658	1260539	But also during the same time, their operating losses fell by 20%.
1262860	1265221	So maybe it's going to balance?
1266704	1267504	They'll pull through.
1267585	1268325	They have the resources.
1268345	1269125	It's Microsoft.
1269165	1270386	They have the power of gates.
1271587	1272647	Because he's tainted them.
1275069	1275689	It'll be fine.
1276430	1276970	They'll be fine.
1277010	1278151	Halo 3's on its way.
1278211	1278631	Halo Wars.
1278651	1279011	They'll be fine.
1279051	1279972	I see their parachutes.
1280152	1280432	Alright.
1281953	1283894	This is not going to help their situation though much.
1284514	1284774	Sorry.
1286075	1293900	Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't have any sort of idea what's coming out the list of
1294775	1297636	Mass Effect for September as well.
1297716	1299717	You heard it from Gamefly!
1300057	1300777	It's September!
1301957	1307759	Because they were listing some other weird title called Beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out.
1308200	1308400	Ever.
1309220	1313341	Didn't some little internet radio site somewhere mention that one once?
1313761	1315222	We disavow all knowledge of that.
1317263	1320284	Yeah, Loki's afraid of getting Namco'd by 9Microsoft.
1320564	1321764	Namco is a verb now.
1323945	1324045	Uh...
1325618	1326958	Out of some site, somewhere.
1327138	1330479	Something we wish would get Namcode is this, although I don't see how that's possible.
1330539	1336041	But look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox Live Marketplace recently.
1336581	1339662	And what they are is they're 100 MS Point videos.
1339702	1342143	That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.
1343143	1348284	Basically, all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears of War.
1348924	1351125	And they have one of these videos for each chapter.
1351545	1357549	So basically you could spend, what, about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.
1357909	1366013	That's awesome, except for the facts that YouTube and GameFAQs and many other gaming sites will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing!
1367694	1377400	So Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.
1378021	1382523	It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell strategy guides.
1382643	1386645	So should they stop publishing strategy guides since GameFAQ is out there?
1386726	1397271	To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things that you can't really get online.
1398052	1400853	and they make great coffee table books for the gamer.
1401013	1401553	They really do.
1401873	1410096	I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is, but a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of cool art and stuff.
1410116	1414457	I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.
1415037	1416858	I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.
1416958	1417818	Same thing with strategy guides.
1418442	1419422	I don't know about these videos, though.
1419843	1428166	I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay, because if there's suckers out there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're gonna sell it, and that's just gonna motivate them to make more.
1428646	1437490	I'm just gonna say a preemptive F you to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy-type videos for free.
1438350	1438430	Hmm.
1439605	1446470	Well, apparently Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kanan Lynch and Crossfire.
1446550	1451674	Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1452034	1459979	Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but, well, news to me, but they are now coming out in both systems.
1460280	1466304	I don't know why this is a big surprise, because, I mean, how many games like before came out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?
1466946	1469188	I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.
1469648	1470809	Who gives a fuck anyways?
1470869	1477373	I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.
1478374	1481716	So, you know, Heavenly Sword, ooh.
1482536	1485198	So, you know, whatever.
1486419	1495165	Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing exclusive things.
1495595	1504098	So, you know, there's been a lot of rah-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May Cry's coming out on 360, blah-blah-blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's working the other way.
1506759	1507100	I don't know.
1507520	1510661	I think it's just really... It's not surprising, though.
1510681	1513722	I mean, that's just... Why would you publish something for one system?
1513922	1514703	Only one system?
1515003	1516523	Unless... I don't know.
1516924	1518164	I don't know why you would just do that.
1519545	1522506	If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?
1522706	1522906	I mean...
1523581	1524041	More people.
1524321	1527864	Even if it is only a few million more, more is better.
1528124	1529785	So, I don't know.
1530225	1533867	Raven Stolfen is in our chatroom and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.
1533967	1535448	It's like, I do not give a shit.
1536829	1537870	I thought we were like that every week.
1537930	1538390	I don't.
1538910	1540351	I really don't some weeks.
1541892	1542253	Let's see.
1542393	1543954	And Kiki's in our chatroom.
1543974	1544554	That's a new name.
1544574	1545154	I don't recognize that.
1545194	1545615	Hi, Kiki.
1545935	1548416	Says, Rob, Rob, Rob, I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.
1550217	1552599	Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.
1553581	1554202	Sounds awesome.
1556343	1556744	All right.
1558605	1562028	Deakman says, announcement of the podcast, my girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.
1562768	1562889	Oh.
1563349	1565130	Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.
1565511	1565911	Oh, what's that?
1565951	1566311	Oh, my.
1566892	1567452	No.
1569434	1570555	Really, DarkSakura?
1570575	1571576	You have Deakman's baby?
1571896	1572697	No.
1572717	1574078	You're carrying Deakman's baby?
1575519	1576359	Hi, married.
1576420	1578161	I don't even carry my own husband.
1578181	1579362	We kid, we kid, we kid.
1580249	1586733	Um, I, um, wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 a.m.
1586873	1587673	by a cesarean.
1588413	1590354	Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 a.m.
1590815	1592776	He is six pounds, eight ounces.
1594597	1596818	How come you have it at 6.66 a.m.?
1597218	1598539	Yeah, Rob, duh.
1598939	1599980	It's a joke, people.
1600060	1600720	It's a joke.
1600960	1602941	But his name is Julian Donald.
1603361	1607123	Um, she had a... He just did not want to come out anyway.
1607804	1608384	So, um...
1609541	1613805	I did want to share that though with everyone because I'm very... I feel what that baby's going through.
1614386	1615166	Not wanting to come out.
1616808	1618489	Seriously though, this is my friend's first baby.
1619710	1621472	And I'm very excited for her.
1621752	1622673	Congratulations to her.
1623253	1623634	Thank you.
1623794	1624354	And to Deakman.
1624374	1626516	See, we have someone nice in the room wrong.
1626596	1629099	And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?
1630580	1631080	God of War.
1631120	1634643	Let's send it... How about a decapitated goat?
1635504	1636325	It's an offering.
1636345	1636385	No.
1637189	1640490	I think it's great though because his parents are both Trekkies.
1641510	1645171	His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.
1645211	1647212	They didn't name the kids Spock, did they?
1647412	1648272	His name is Julian.
1650373	1653974	Wait a minute, wasn't that Picard's real name or something?
1655254	1655854	Jean-Luc?
1656454	1659015	Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.
1659055	1661216	I swear I read that in some dig article this week.
1661276	1663696	It was supposed to be Julian Picard and they changed it last minute.
1664377	1665537	I think we have another segment to do.
1667288	1678970	Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and I'm so excited that DarkSakura is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails for you to read.
1679950	1681551	Let's start the mailbag segment.
1682151	1683051	Hooray!
1683071	1687092	You can read them with that attitude.
1689412	1694533	Anyway, first email is from Ariz... I guess that's how it's pronounced.
1695379	1697040	Should I get an Xbox 360?
1697480	1700302	I have a high def monitor that can support 360 VGA.
1701123	1703424	I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.
1703545	1704025	Is it worth it?
1704485	1705106	No, get a Wii.
1706126	1706767	No, you should get a 360.
1707307	1711610	I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need live.
1711850	1713471	I have live and I don't play games over it.
1713991	1718675	Although I do like to download some arcade games but you'd be fine without it.
1718875	1719195	Get a Wii.
1719588	1719728	A.Z.H.P.
1743795	1748218	Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad, dirty jokes that people have been coming up with.
1748578	1749479	I'm here to save you guys.
1749559	1752441	I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.
1752881	1754282	Let me pull up the ad!
1756304	1763169	Oh god, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will share with our chatroom right now.
1764690	1765530	There you go, everybody.
1765550	1769053	Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual innuendos in it.
1769333	1770634	It actually is too small for me to read.
1771906	1773667	I use a higher resolution, obviously.
1774527	1776427	Anyway, um, oh no, here it is.
1776468	1778108	The text says this, and this is no joke.
1778828	1781389	Please have this read in the sluttiest voice you can find in the studio.
1781649	1783410	Well, fuck that, I'm going to use my regular voice.
1784110	1791012	There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night, and you're warm and safe in your living room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.
1791112	1796234	Killing vampires goes great with friends, and the closest ones you have here are helping you through a tough level.
1796614	1799515	You pause, there are monsters up ahead, and you're unsure of how to proceed.
1799955	1803097	You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.
1803498	1804999	Perhaps it's something in the juice.
1805319	1812765	Perhaps it's the high from the intense side-scrolling action that only NES can deliver, which is alike as the Genesis had it too, and so did the Master System.
1814846	1816648	But there seems to slow around the two of you.
1816948	1817629	You don't look away.
1817689	1818089	You can't.
1818109	1821171	There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.
1821692	1823353	It scares you, yet you must have it.
1823752	1825753	Your gaze never breaks, neither does his.
1826193	1830256	There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions in Fantasylands.
1830616	1831997	Tonight there will be a new adventure.
1832477	1833838	Nintendo, now you're playing with power.
1833858	1835619	I was going to say, what did you see in his eyes?
1835659	1837160	You saw blast processing.
1841702	1849087	I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.
1850387	1850968	In the U.S. ?
1852268	1853408	or Japan or whatever.
1853428	1853669	Oh, really?
1853809	1855050	That's where it's at.
1855350	1855830	Korea?
1855850	1856531	All right.
1856651	1857372	I wonder about that.
1859013	1859593	Yeah, you're right.
1861335	1863136	Anyway, next email, shall I?
1863997	1868441	Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every week.
1868781	1873024	That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.
1873064	1873925	Can I say it real fast?
1874285	1878249	I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.
1879395	1882658	I'm like the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck.
1883279	1884901	I actually like your show.
1885361	1887103	Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.
1887663	1888965	But today I actually like it.
1889005	1889545	Can I continue, please?
1889845	1890366	All right, sorry.
1890806	1894090	For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.
1894450	1898894	Week after week I listen to the cowardly, beat-around-the-bush responses, Apple sucks, Apple blows.
1899215	1903279	Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well-thought-out, valid response to that argument.
1903920	1905241	Is it because you can't run Windows?
1905361	1906182	Oh wait, yes you can.
1906222	1907742	Is it because you can't play The Sims?
1907803	1909864	And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance?
1909924	1910744	Oh wait, yes you can.
1911205	1913926	Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?
1914427	1916628	Would you feel better if they called it a Zunecast?
1916888	1918649	By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?
1918970	1922031	I guess because me and Chris bought a Mizzun, hi.
1922532	1923432	Weren't you listening to this?
1923773	1927475	You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got a Mizzun, hi.
1928456	1930017	And sure you did just out of spite.
1930097	1932218	Have you tried to install Vista yet?
1932950	1936111	I believe if you did, you'll notice that it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?
1936191	1945133	Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total ripoff of the Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.
1945913	1949334	It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.
1950775	1953875	Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?
1954796	1955896	Oh, and this was by...
1958403	1959944	God, I'm sorry I closed the email.
1959964	1961204	God wrote that email?
1961744	1962844	I'm sorry, person.
1962904	1964185	You are fucked, Loki.
1964985	1966045	I closed your email.
1966085	1967085	I'm sorry, person.
1968386	1969026	Oh, wait, here it is.
1970026	1970906	It's by JG2000.
1971026	1972887	Oh, not God.
1973147	1973547	One of those.
1973567	1976688	I was going to say, if God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.
1977808	1978528	I'm not fucked.
1979068	1982269	No, but seriously, though, I mean, let's talk about...
1983214	1987155	what they're doing, like, to basically advertise the, you know, the iMac right now.
1987195	1997557	They're talking about how, you know, oh, yes, programs are so hard to install, but with, you know, Apple, you don't have to do anything, because they're all preloaded on there for you.
1997797	2009359	Well, that's good that you've preloaded the software that'll actually run on a Mac, you know, versus, you know, actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and we're not talking about, like, Doom 2 or stuff like that.
2009759	2011780	You know, oh, goody, Prey plays on there.
2012020	2012420	Wonderful.
2012580	2012980	You know, that's
2014090	2016231	That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.
2017872	2025477	But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it based on colors or flavors, as I should put it.
2026437	2028578	Who cares what color the damn system is?
2028678	2032100	If I can't fucking install... Nintendo DS?
2033801	2035622	Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.
2035642	2037664	That's retarded that they even sell by colors.
2038184	2038324	But...
2039233	2041915	To be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.
2042055	2043236	I really don't.
2043256	2046138	I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.
2046578	2047319	It sucks.
2047959	2049320	I'm not going to buy one.
2050181	2051141	And you know what?
2051221	2056004	If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.
2056605	2057325	But you know what?
2058006	2065731	When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice, but
2066505	2073407	whenever I guess the next next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out Mac's definitely not going to be able to play it.
2073427	2076747	Eh, I still like being bi with computers.
2076767	2078548	I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop.
2078568	2079048	Works great.
2079608	2085290	I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things and do emails.
2085310	2085990	It's quick.
2086170	2094712	I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh, well the, you know, iDVD, it's so awesome, you know, it's, so he's used, there's programs out there that use, you know, they're on everything.
2095292	2095352	It,
2096033	2106541	I don't get... Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because all the programs are there for you and you don't need to download any extra stuff.
2106962	2107622	But you know what?
2107982	2118370	People like me who aren't super basic with computers like to have that option to customize things and I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.
2119071	2120832	Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.
2121853	2123394	So shall I move on to the next email then?
2123414	2124075	Yes, please.
2124924	2125204	Okay.
2125344	2126045	Hi, guys.
2126745	2127165	Hey.
2127665	2128245	Boobs, please.
2128285	2128646	Thank you.
2129846	2130766	I'm just writing to let you know.
2130786	2133027	Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?
2133047	2134848	That was me saying that because you said, guys.
2134908	2135809	And I'm like, no.
2135849	2136129	No.
2136969	2138210	BPC, thank you.
2138230	2139310	I thought that was a request.
2139350	2141751	I'm like, well, if you really want, I'll just... Rob.
2142711	2142912	No.
2144232	2144832	I don't need that.
2146053	2146293	Anyway.
2147210	2151831	I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.
2151931	2152391	Oh, thank you.
2152831	2155632	I'm studying abroad for my junior year of high school in Italy right now.
2155892	2156292	Lucky.
2157432	2160332	So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.
2160652	2163133	That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.
2163173	2164433	They never fail to disappoint.
2165313	2166574	And they never fail to disappoint.
2167894	2168134	What?
2170754	2171054	Okay.
2173735	2174095	They never...
2175220	2175480	Anyway.
2175600	2176581	I don't think that was what they meant.
2176621	2177421	I don't think that's what they meant.
2177441	2178061	Chirp, chirp, chirp.
2178701	2180062	Because everything else is all positive.
2180082	2181302	Like, what?
2181582	2181863	Anyway.
2182643	2188025	I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up hearing you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.
2188805	2192787	Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint.
2194127	2195588	I haven't put a review up yet, I should do that.
2195608	2196008	Could you do that?
2196048	2196608	Could you put a five?
2196668	2198169	There's OLR never fails to disappoint.
2198189	2201251	This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.
2201291	2201651	Thank you.
2202111	2204732	Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.
2204953	2205433	I saw that.
2205453	2206073	That was beautiful.
2206373	2206854	Okay, anyway.
2208294	2221341	Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer, more specifically a Bitmoni fan, care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn, Moongina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.
2222040	2229403	I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.
2229743	2233164	You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.
2234105	2235985	Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.
2236005	2237606	I won't say the last name unless he wants me to.
2238346	2238646	P.S.
2238706	2244508	I challenge Sky's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to duel to the death over said throne at any time.
2245129	2247850	Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky, unwashed toilet.
2247870	2249750	Okay.
2250811	2251051	You...
2253136	2260542	I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at Halo 2.
2260842	2262383	But what if you fail to disappoint?
2263924	2264565	Then you lose.
2265786	2266687	So hey, I'm really curious.
2267067	2267908	Matthew, was that the name?
2268008	2268188	Yeah.
2268356	2271198	Matthew, you're in Italy, and that's pretty awesome.
2271238	2272599	First of all, listener base is international.
2272779	2272999	Rock.
2273459	2275440	Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan, and I'm curious.
2275560	2277481	What is the Bimani in arcade scene like over there?
2277922	2282084	I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never heard this confirmed.
2283045	2285786	I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.
2286066	2286567	Not Japan.
2287007	2287747	Well, yeah, Japan.
2288108	2290409	Well, unless you count, you know, Ticket Games and Pachinko.
2291910	2293031	Wait, Japan has tons of arcades.
2293051	2293551	Which I do.
2295872	2297013	Anyway, the last email tonight.
2298356	2300197	This is from Sakura Max.
2301718	2306020	Anime was created because we killed ourselves because hot anime chicks don't exist in real life.
2306540	2306820	Okay.
2307300	2309622	I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.
2310142	2314924	I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth.
2315325	2316805	Two weeks ago referenced in my email.
2317426	2318126	Rhea Dracer.
2319046	2320227	Recommend any MMOs.
2320247	2324209	I already played MapleStory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy Online.
2324639	2326759	FlyFF, Gunbound, Gunzi, and Ragnarok.
2327100	2327740	I think that's it.
2328120	2331140	Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.
2331760	2336581	Dude, those guys' emails... Okay, that guy's emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.
2337001	2341822	Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like... I can't say I have.
2341842	2343723	Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.
2343763	2345363	No, seriously, no, no, seriously.
2345823	2349544	No, I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is a site I love.
2349824	2354305	But like, you know, if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, you know...
2355363	2360024	uh, World Peace, I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, you know, it's like all these random things.
2360364	2361324	What's this guy saying?
2361364	2365485	Like, he's like, I was once served in a tavern, medium rare.
2365645	2366246	Like, what?
2367166	2369066	It's like poetry, practically.
2370687	2372387	I love the signature best on this, though.
2372667	2373407	Let me read this to you.
2374208	2377188	Sakura Max, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.
2378829	2383110	You get, like, you get a gold star just for your closing to that email.
2383130	2383910	You can play Loki's game.
2384210	2384590	Done!
2386897	2387457	Next, please.
2389518	2389818	Alright.
2390399	2392860	Well then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday.
2392920	2395761	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Meanwhile, more news.
2396322	2398583	And we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.
2398663	2401344	I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.
2402165	2404146	There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.
2404386	2406947	Robert Garcia, the man who brought us Dan Hedeke.
2407127	2407407	Right.
2408308	2409108	Yahoo!
2409428	2410229	I get that joke.
2410709	2414731	Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.
2415867	2425029	I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2 and this is again thanks to the ESRB who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.
2425069	2428410	It's like the ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.
2428890	2436791	And of course the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally came out on the Neo Geo.
2437372	2437772	Awesome!
2437812	2438912	And you know what else it does?
2439452	2444453	It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.
2445327	2449290	You know, they've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.
2451231	2453473	They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.
2453653	2459377	I mean... Make something new!
2459437	2462178	Well, weren't Neo Geo games supposed to become a virtual console anyway?
2462559	2463379	That's not new.
2463539	2464880	That's old shit again.
2465160	2467302	There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.
2468203	2468583	That was new.
2469603	2470304	And it was really good.
2471929	2473430	Oh, well, one game.
2473830	2476452	I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.
2479854	2480655	Alright, well, anyway.
2482356	2483757	So that's an art of fighting.
2484257	2490761	Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to the DS.
2491702	2494724	And yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on touchscreen.
2494884	2495684	Yay!
2495784	2497966	Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.
2498686	2499387	Exactly.
2499407	2499547	Exactly.
2501258	2520291	Dance 2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.
2521592	2529698	Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that song that goes, I don't wanna work, I just wanna bang on Z-Drum all day.
2529738	2530318	You know that song?
2532668	2533569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2562693	2576604	There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious about a person jailed for the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack!
2578245	2585250	So it's like a shooter that's like House of the Dead and what's that other one?
2586471	2589033	Like the Ghost Squad.
2589253	2590054	Like a light gun shooter.
2590700	2591300	Touch the Dead
2620745	2621265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2645223	2645483	Awful.
2645864	2646664	So disgusting.
2646925	2649687	Apparently it came from a butcher, making that okay.
2650207	2651308	Because it's from a butcher.
2651729	2653130	Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?
2654751	2656913	Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.
2657885	2659526	Well, but you can actually buy goat meat.
2659566	2660686	You can buy horse meat on the market.
2660746	2662647	They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.
2663827	2666008	They sell horse meat for international consumption.
2666448	2667848	I know, and I really want some.
2667908	2673070	But anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have.
2673350	2674350	They were doing all the jokes.
2674631	2675991	Like, this really gets my goat.
2676011	2678112	This is nothing to lose your head over.
2680913	2681813	Gotta love the Internet.
2683246	2690530	Well, the Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly because they opened it up and free and all that stuff.
2691091	2695373	One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put gay marriage in the game.
2695794	2698135	They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.
2698495	2703738	In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're not going to have marriage in the game at all.
2703758	2704299	It's stupid.
2704339	2705600	Why would you want marriage in the game?
2705760	2707681	In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.
2707961	2709362	It was completely pointless.
2710191	2713293	You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.
2713554	2714074	This is stupid.
2714094	2715615	I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.
2717637	2719698	You actually could share your hit points.
2720259	2723141	You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.
2724222	2728765	There were also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody else.
2729525	2733388	And on the private server I played on, the mods would actually have it.
2733729	2739493	Where in the game it was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.
2740188	2744911	If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you can marry anything.
2745231	2748293	Including the villains and creatures that you're fighting.
2748513	2750914	You would cast a spell and... I married a zombie!
2751454	2752355	I married the rabbit!
2752575	2754196	No, I'm gonna kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.
2754856	2757478	No, it's like The End of Shaun of the Dead.
2758218	2759419	But I still have the ring!
2759559	2760459	He's my husband!
2762904	2763204	Wow.
2763584	2771770	Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that, you know, the Lords of the Ring Online, they decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the original books.
2772430	2779695	And although they had some interspecial, you know, like a dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were going to have that.
2780075	2786419	There was no mention in the books ever of males, two males or two females marrying, so they weren't going to put it in the game.
2786459	2787480	You know the elves are doing it.
2788560	2789581	But who knows.
2790020	2794303	They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull the marriage option all together.
2794743	2803410	And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining Lords of the Ring online, you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game, because the game sucks.
2804390	2804791	A lot.
2806272	2809034	If you want to play Lords of the Ring online, just go play World of Warcraft.
2809134	2809574	Seriously.
2809714	2810895	Did you say Lords of the Ring?
2811455	2812096	I don't know.
2812696	2814378	So Lords of the Ring is you've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.
2814438	2816139	Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.
2816419	2817099	That's their problem.
2818200	2819181	It's a load balancing issue.
2820627	2827513	Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever you want in the game.
2828274	2830415	Actually, we have another announcement speaking of marriages.
2832277	2832597	Okay.
2833258	2835559	This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.
2837041	2841784	His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today, and she said yes, and they're getting married in an anime con.
2842365	2843406	Are they listening to the show?
2844206	2844767	I believe so.
2845628	2847289	Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.
2849926	2851067	This is Don't Give a Shit Night.
2852828	2857232	I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards.
2858293	2859234	Especially Loki.
2860315	2861596	I just got this on a PM.
2861876	2864959	I just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a dump right now.
2866780	2869743	Did he get married to him?
2869763	2870984	This is about marriage right now.
2872774	2877315	Oh my god, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.
2877816	2881297	Does this show cause people to want to release or something?
2881957	2882617	It's possible.
2883017	2885858	Okay, hey, congratulations to Ranma's friend, because that's awesome.
2887299	2893041	And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still hoarse from California screaming.
2893721	2895701	And congratulations to your other friend's bowels.
2895821	2896382	That's amazing.
2896402	2896782	Awesome.
2898160	2903681	Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version.
2904061	2912383	Because, you know, the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created, causing the game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.
2912923	2920705	But, as you're probably listening to this podcast now, or tomorrow if you're listening to it live, there will be a patch.
2921085	2921866	So, yay!
2923046	2924206	Your expansion will work.
2925406	2927667	As it should have when you first downloaded it,
2928291	2930292	Have they tested the damn game?
2930512	2931392	Tested the game.
2931432	2932492	That's very important.
2932812	2934693	Don't just release his shit and patch it later.
2939154	2939714	That's all I got.
2940034	2940414	Alright.
2941895	2942235	Anyway.
2943375	2946336	Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about.
2947176	2949597	Because, um... What?
2950277	2950957	It's the theme.
2951417	2951938	It really is.
2952038	2953558	Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.
2953918	2955519	Well, just because I hate Warhammer.
2956119	2956599	Warhammer 40k.
2957978	2965003	because I know people, I had an ex who would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.
2966984	2972248	And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool and I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.
2972528	2980093	But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.
2980313	2983896	So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed.
2984545	2987528	in the US and in Europe until first quarter 2008.
2987889	2988449	So yeah.
2991132	2997640	And in other news, Rice Prince of All Cosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.
2998781	3000383	You guys are so freaking mature.
3000443	3001684	I was just picking that up.
3001704	3002365	Mature.
3007588	3011450	Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe... Did it say yes or no?
3011610	3012411	I mean, seriously.
3012431	3015393	Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.
3015753	3016553	Dear God, why?
3016613	3017794	That game is shit on ice.
3019235	3021116	Exactly why I used that transition.
3021576	3023237	No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.
3023357	3029561	Well, I think... Okay, so I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind of loose and just... You run around... God damn it.
3029741	3030982	Loose like the bowels?
3032183	3033904	I should have thought that up before I said that.
3034324	3035625	They were not terribly... Okay.
3036145	3036345	Okay.
3037025	3037425	X, X, Y X, X, Y X, X, Y
3066352	3068754	X, X, Y. Oh, that batch of monsters is dead.
3068794	3069915	Let's go to the next zone.
3070435	3076821	X, X, Y. X, X, Y. It's like all you did in the whole game.
3076841	3077541	That's three buttons.
3077561	3079022	Most RPGs have one attack.
3080939	3083180	So, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.
3083220	3084900	It's called Ambition of the Illuminous.
3084940	3089541	And I have to confess, the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said Abortion of the Illuminous.
3089881	3091962	Like, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.
3092002	3092922	Like, I actually read that.
3092942	3093962	I was like, what?
3094062	3095382	Abortion of the Illuminous?
3095743	3099283	And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous.
3099924	3102224	And, yeah, that's the title.
3102444	3104545	And there's going to be some new weapon types.
3104745	3106585	Madug, Shadug, and Whip.
3107866	3109666	And also there'll be new Photon Arts.
3110519	3115301	and, uh, yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's gonna be new planets as well, I don't see how there couldn't be.
3116002	3120063	Uh, if you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.
3120404	3123565	If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're gonna have to buy a new disc.
3124245	3127127	Which seems weird, because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.
3127147	3129127	I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello.
3129948	3130168	Oh, well.
3131088	3131909	Um, so there it is.
3132089	3133730	Abortion of the Illuminous, coming soon.
3134830	3136551	Abortion of the Illuminous.
3136671	3137371	That's so wrong.
3137391	3139132	But anyways, um, now if
3139779	3144181	The brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today.
3145202	3161451	And if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could, of course, hack your current drive for, say, about $80 and get 120GB as well.
3164582	3183509	and this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things you can create your own 120 gig drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.
3184269	3193512	I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there without having to hack the whole drive apart which I'm sure someone can create.
3193911	3195072	If it's not already available.
3196093	3196933	To just do that.
3196993	3198795	Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.
3199515	3202698	Why they don't have that anyways, you know, is beyond me.
3205059	3205540	But there you go.
3205640	3205800	Save $100.
3206721	3209123	If you're not going to buy an Elite system, just want a larger hard drive.
3209823	3210263	Might as well.
3211644	3211945	Alright.
3212945	3213666	Hackin' and crackin'.
3214281	3222104	Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the internet and sometimes she stumbles upon a website that she wants to share with all of you.
3222784	3225305	It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.
3234669	3243552	The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.
3244830	3246010	It's real life comics.
3247811	3252793	And from what I understand, he used to, I think, buy comics from my husband at the GameStop.
3252813	3254833	He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.
3255574	3256934	Yeah, okay, well he was local then.
3257754	3259655	But it's a pretty cool webcomic.
3259995	3260696	I say check it out.
3260716	3266498	The URL is reallifecomics.com So it's funny.
3267378	3267738	It's good.
3269479	3269739	Alright.
3271599	3273480	I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.
3274547	3275067	Over in Folsom.
3275608	3275928	Really?
3276168	3278649	Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time that I saw a picture of him on his site.
3278669	3279089	Like, whoa!
3279969	3280309	That guy.
3280550	3282190	Did we ever run into each other playing DDR?
3282590	3283071	Back in the day?
3283091	3284811	Did you play it Folsom?
3284831	3287312	We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.
3287512	3287933	Geez.
3288353	3288753	Years ago.
3288813	3291954	I wonder, do I know you?
3292274	3291954	2001?
3292574	3294035	Did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?
3294611	3295552	Back in the day, yeah.
3295592	3296472	Wasn't that SCAT?
3296492	3297253	That was SCAT.
3297433	3298934	Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament?
3299074	3299634	Oh, God.
3299654	3300455	Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.
3300495	3303657	I started playing when I was 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.
3303857	3304297	Oh, funny.
3305598	3306059	Small world.
3306079	3306579	Small world, gee.
3306639	3307279	Yeah, exactly.
3308380	3313183	Not as small as my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives down my street.
3314164	3315685	Also happens to be in Denmark.
3316666	3317106	Very strange.
3317126	3318047	And they meet and have lunch.
3318967	3323250	All right, well, it is a small world, and we want to open up the world to call our show right now.
3324215	3324976	on the Skype line.
3325016	3330959	If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call on the old telephone.
3331359	3334581	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3334621	3337463	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3337583	3339564	And we'll take our calls on Skype.
3340164	3347208	And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, and you always go, why is it the same people calling into the show every week?
3347268	3348509	Well, hey, it's an open line.
3348888	3350669	All I gotta do is give us a call Sunday.
3351029	3357893	I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific Time, you can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.
3358033	3358893	So there you have it.
3359094	3359574	8.30 Pacific Time.
3359874	3361495	Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
3361575	3362615	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3362635	3362996	Who's this?
3364376	3365357	Hello.
3365817	3369119	This is the dead goat from the God of War story.
3370139	3372701	Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.
3373461	3374862	Dead goat, do you have a name?
3376663	3378204	My name's Bill.
3379329	3379809	I don't know.
3379869	3383371	Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.
3396923	3401025	Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.
3401045	3402306	I thought that was kind of gross.
3402366	3404207	But you got to hang out with topless women.
3423746	3425407	I couldn't do anything with them.
3425447	3427187	None of them were into golf.
3427808	3429788	It made me go wah.
3431589	3434430	Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, Dead Goat?
3434570	3434831	Bill?
3436191	3439032	I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.
3439372	3440033	Wah.
3440513	3443874	They want me to tell you to buy God of War 2 if you have it.
3443914	3444675	Wah.
3445855	3447656	Well, I will definitely have to consider that.
3447716	3447916	I mean...
3448598	3451759	You know, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our station.
3451779	3453060	Especially from beyond the grave.
3453840	3457082	So, shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.
3458983	3461084	Well, thanks for letting me call in.
3461284	3463045	I love listening to your show.
3463125	3463605	No problem.
3463625	3464605	Actually, I have another question.
3465205	3470688	Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary episode?
3472729	3472889	Um...
3473999	3476060	I'll get back to you off the show.
3476140	3478082	I don't want to talk about it on the air.
3478262	3478622	All right.
3479403	3481384	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3481464	3481684	Okay?
3481764	3482425	Let us know, Bill.
3483665	3484106	Okay.
3484206	3485066	Thanks, Rob.
3485126	3485367	All right.
3485407	3486347	Take care.
3487708	3488329	Bye.
3488369	3488749	Bye.
3489149	3489609	Bye.
3494833	3495293	Oh, my God.
3495333	3497074	There's tons of stupid people on the Internet.
3497114	3499536	What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?
3500407	3501468	That's what I want to know.
3501528	3503089	How do you get Skype in the graveyard?
3503109	3507453	I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, talking into a mic.
3507873	3509295	We need to Photoshop that.
3509315	3511657	So they go, crap, the levels are off.
3511917	3513238	I need to adjust the microphone.
3513298	3514379	It's the guy who called it.
3515240	3517202	Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?
3517222	3518262	Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?
3519343	3520665	I called it in the chat room.
3521205	3521305	What?
3521325	3522086	It's a shit show.
3522806	3523327	This is the what?
3524662	3525183	I called it.
3525263	3526384	You don't give a shit tonight.
3526904	3527124	I know.
3527164	3528666	Well, we don't give a shit.
3529747	3532369	Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?
3532449	3534250	What do you call tonight?
3535512	3536252	I'm sorry, Rob.
3536272	3537093	I'm pissing you off.
3537113	3538494	I just want to say I love it.
3538634	3539535	I love the tone.
3539955	3541036	You love the tone tonight?
3542077	3542798	Yeah, I love it.
3542878	3546521	I love that you go like, Kanan Lynch is going to the PS3.
3546581	3547822	I just don't give a shit.
3549485	3550165	Well, I don't know.
3550506	3552167	Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.
3552227	3560912	Maybe, I don't know, maybe DarkSakura and I rode California Screamin' one too many times and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.
3560972	3561312	I don't know.
3563073	3569777	That was, that made me laugh when you went like, everyone was like, oh my god, DataLynch is going multi-platform and you just go like, I don't give a shit.
3570957	3572238	Well, I don't know what to tell you.
3572258	3574439	Well, what else is on your mind gaming-wise this week, Ravis Dolvin?
3575820	3578922	Well, the Xbox Wii came out today and I think they're left.
3579975	3580855	The what came out?
3581996	3582296	Elite.
3582956	3585818	Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.
3586078	3589139	Well, DarkSakura, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.
3589179	3589599	Yes, I did.
3589740	3591700	Now, what made you want to get one?
3591921	3593961	It wasn't me, it was Dan, because our old one died.
3594322	3595742	Oh, that's right, you guys had no one that died.
3595782	3596803	Okay, well, I can see that.
3597423	3599544	Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?
3600304	3606107	When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from them.
3606727	3608148	So I would like someone else to get an Elite.
3609414	3612775	Yeah, but I felt, well, hold, now let me hear, I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.
3641357	3642818	The DS Lite was an upgrade?
3644118	3647419	Yeah, I had a DS Bad and I upgraded to a DS Lite.
3647459	3651360	Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing.
3651400	3658262	But with the Xbox 360 Elite, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not that much new to it.
3658302	3660562	How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?
3662123	3662483	I can't.
3663243	3663963	That's why I don't care.
3665824	3666524	Well, then there you go.
3667853	3670934	alright, left the tone, thank you one more thing?
3673855	3692160	this is a great show I hope you do another bullshit episode we'll see, we'll see what kind of mood we're in next week alright, thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin later alright, that was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call let's go back to the phones and take another call if you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3693640	3697161	hi, this is Chris hi, Chris what's on your mind, buddy?
3698217	3698657	Oh, wow.
3699497	3701718	First of all, I just wanted to say I like the show.
3701738	3706160	I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.
3706400	3709200	I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.
3709501	3710961	Welcome to the live experience.
3713042	3714802	Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.
3715782	3716783	Ah, congratulations.
3717143	3719064	That's right, Sundays are big days for Wiis.
3719144	3723105	Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buy or Toys R Us was going to have them?
3723145	3723765	Is that how you got them?
3724591	3727192	No, I actually had a friend from work.
3727352	3730354	He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wii's in today.
3730554	3733856	That was like the most they had ever coming at one time.
3734696	3735897	Very cool.
3736257	3737677	Did you buy any games for the Wii?
3739398	3740239	No, I didn't.
3740799	3746622	I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe rent something.
3747002	3748102	I wasn't really interested in that.
3748142	3753185	I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago and
3754284	3759828	and now they have like 45 Wii's coming out as if they were competing.
3760488	3761449	Oh, that's a good thought.
3761889	3767212	Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wii's maybe to kind of have a big push the day the Elite came out?
3767612	3772776	So that way, you know, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually have Wii's in stock.
3772856	3774177	Hmm, maybe I should get that instead.
3774677	3776178	No, I don't think so.
3777138	3779380	Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?
3780961	3782322	No, I kind of feel...
3783450	3784671	They just threw that out there.
3785391	3789214	It really isn't a real successor to the original one.
3789234	3790995	Yeah, I pretty much feel like that's what they all did.
3805388	3806169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3827503	3829264	That's definitely a good way to go.
3829464	3831745	Yeah, but what about all the good things Kutaragi did?
3831805	3834026	I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?
3834106	3835507	I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.
3835527	3845652	He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night, is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.
3846013	3850675	Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?
3850735	3854317	I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but...
3855080	3858923	At some point, you gotta put them down, so... And what about all the great things that Goat did?
3860825	3861305	No, it's dead.
3861325	3862026	They had to put them down.
3863467	3867450	RicePrince of all cosmos in the chatroom says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.
3868991	3869912	Sounds like a great idea.
3870933	3872674	Alright, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?
3874216	3876017	Uh, no, that's basically it.
3876077	3878900	Actually, I wanna know which game you think I should get for the Wii.
3879140	3879200	Um...
3880109	3880469	Excite Truck
3911425	3912186	Excite Truck's not bad.
3912646	3913787	I was going to say Excite Truck too.
3914747	3915848	Does it use a controller?
3915868	3919390	I want to be able to use the Wiimote a little bit more.
3921711	3922752	Yes, all those games.
3923072	3924513	Not so much Super Paper Mario.
3924533	3926274	I mean, it does incorporate it a little bit.
3926334	3928596	You do thuds by shaking the thing.
3928616	3934679	But yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wiimote like a normal controller, but you steer with it.
3934719	3936120	You turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.
3936830	3941233	and then of course Legend of Zelda is like all about using that like you swing it like a sword and all that crazy stuff.
3942014	3943135	Okay, alright, thanks.
3943315	3944176	Alright, no problem, Chris.
3944196	3946257	Thanks for calling the show and call us back sometime.
3946938	3947518	Alright, take care.
3947598	3947858	Later.
3949400	3950260	We like new callers.
3950320	3951901	This is a good show.
3952162	3957525	Maybe we need to take vacations more often because we get new guests in studio and we get new callers.
3958626	3960448	Not that we don't appreciate the old callers too.
3960888	3963310	Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.
3963630	3964551	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3964571	3964871	Who's this?
3965994	3967435	Uh, it's Legend of Zaku.
3967555	3969936	Uh, hello, Legend of Zaku.
3969976	3970756	What's on your mind, buddy?
3972017	3972717	Uh, nothing much.
3972877	3976578	Just coming back from Queens, playing Poppin' 8, and pumping up.
3977799	3978919	I love people calling this show.
3978959	3979660	I go, hey, what's up?
3979760	3980340	Ah, nothing.
3980480	3984702	I just thought I'd call and let you know I did stuff today.
3984782	3985362	No, I'm just kidding.
3985642	3986742	What do you think of tonight's show?
3986802	3988003	Any stories you want to comment on?
3989659	3997751	You know it's official now that Supernova 2 test location has already been announced for like next month.
3998011	3999954	Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.
4000971	4002292	Actually, that was my post.
4002573	4003013	Was it?
4003373	4003734	I don't know.
4003754	4004574	Yeah, I contributed.
4004654	4006296	Maybe you submitted it and we ran it.
4006336	4006696	I don't know.
4006856	4007217	I did.
4007597	4008037	Well, good.
4008378	4017085	You know, I think, actually, Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us and, like, two Japanese Bomani sites linked to that story.
4017406	4019668	So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.
4019808	4021369	So good job.
4021389	4022750	Yay.
4022811	4023131	All right.
4023151	4025573	So tell us, how did you come across this information about the location test?
4026534	4027274	No, it's just...
4028783	4039252	All right, since I know you're such a hardcore, you know, Bomani and music game fan because you've been listening to us, you know, since, you know, the day when that's all we talked about on this show.
4056081	4061045	What do you hope is the number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?
4061545	4065549	Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1.
4066710	4068131	Unlockables, pretty much.
4068451	4071133	You know how DDR Max was back in the day.
4071193	4074436	It only had like 60 songs.
4074516	4077358	It didn't have any returning songs.
4077438	4078879	It just had brand new songs.
4079420	4080621	And there wasn't really that much.
4080761	4083543	And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and
4084164	4086226	and added new ones and had an unlock system.
4087567	4088508	Okay, I gotcha.
4088588	4092871	And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards was unlocking all this stuff.
4092891	4094152	Yeah, I mean, think about it.
4094412	4102719	If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami to gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.
4103480	4105081	And we already know the outcome of that.
4106002	4107683	I guess so, if we're getting a Supernova 2.
4108304	4108644	Mm-hmm.
4109645	4111046	That and hopefully, you know,
4111616	4115398	They are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar to EMUs.
4116178	4119940	You know, something that's not necessarily connected online.
4120000	4124462	Like a card system, like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.
4124862	4125963	Build your own dancer.
4125983	4126643	It'll be fun.
4127343	4132186	Not even that, just track scores, you know, battle people and stuff like that.
4132366	4134026	Buy hot pants for your character.
4134106	4135327	Hopefully Konami would
4135748	4140310	would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent in Supernova this time.
4140330	4142611	Toshin's yelling Link support in chat room.
4142631	4142872	Yes.
4143752	4145273	I hope they found a good workaround.
4145293	4146593	That's all I'm saying.
4146813	4148754	Let's see what else is being said in chat here.
4148814	4152917	GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bomani.
4153917	4154597	Well, that too.
4155118	4159860	I mean, and also like revival songs that haven't been revived in a long time.
4160629	4164750	Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.
4165290	4167791	I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.
4168911	4169731	You know, stuff like that.
4170511	4172772	Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bomani.
4172832	4174612	Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.
4176053	4177453	Well, what do you expect?
4177813	4178973	Hey, it ruined my life too.
4179013	4180274	That's how I met DarkSakura.
4182914	4184715	Hugs and kisses and bunnies.
4184835	4185195	Love you.
4185295	4185935	Rob, what?
4188342	4191244	She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.
4192586	4193586	Yes, I do.
4194988	4195388	Let's see.
4195468	4199171	James Patrick says DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.
4199271	4200052	DDR is pretty big.
4200452	4201213	What?
4201413	4201213	500?
4201653	4202013	Really?
4202614	4204015	Where's that sales figure come from?
4204315	4205616	Cite your source, James Patrick.
4206477	4208198	Yeah, I'd be damned if it reaches a million.
4208619	4210360	And we don't even know when they're jumping.
4210821	4217306	I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know, for any future DDR mixes.
4218021	4247596	obviously I don't see that happening now so is it going to hold on to the PS2 as long as possible there's a big install phase backing it up alright well Zaku we're going to let you go but are you going to drive out to the test of Supernova 2 I don't know maybe I don't even know if I have vacation time but I'll probably get the videos you know eventually and hopefully once Supernova 2 comes in the city then I'll be able to decide for myself alright well good luck with that have fun
4248737	4249538	Alright, later dude.
4249838	4250078	Bye.
4252380	4253480	Oh, Zaku's hilarious.
4253520	4254961	He's got the best voice.
4255922	4259504	Yeah, this is Colin talking about Supernova.
4261326	4266629	You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music games.
4267210	4272413	I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow no rules.
4272673	4276516	When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like when you meet them.
4277791	4281294	No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York City.
4281614	4282154	He's a good kid.
4283595	4287038	But we just give him a hard time on this show because he's been listening for a long time and we can't.
4287378	4292481	Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York City the week of June 9th.
4292501	4294763	That's all I'm saying for now.
4294823	4297525	I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.
4298145	4301127	June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York City, which is good.
4301167	4301908	I love New York City.
4301988	4302648	Love it, love it, love it.
4302889	4306211	So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of
4306621	4315665	make an appearance, and so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo World Store with people just loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.
4317826	4318066	All right.
4319807	4320147	Let's see.
4320447	4324529	TheRobD in chat says, Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.
4324929	4326430	We'd love to do that if we had the money.
4326570	4330092	I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?
4330372	4331092	Yeah, they'll be there.
4331240	4332080	They're going to ASEN.
4332120	4333601	So the OLR lesbians will be there.
4333641	4335202	So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.
4335242	4336903	I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN.
4337283	4338264	So look for them.
4338804	4340085	They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.
4340125	4340785	We'll be at FONAME.
4341445	4341685	Oh, yeah.
4341886	4342946	Oh, hell.
4343026	4344267	We should have announced that at the top of the show.
4344347	4345948	Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.
4346228	4348309	We did get confirmed for this year's FONAME.
4348609	4353932	We're going to be doing a live show from FONAME the Saturday of FONAME at 2 p.m.
4354432	4357073	We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right.
4357374	4358014	We only have the one.
4358464	4360304	Which is fine, because we didn't really need two last week.
4360324	4361585	Your panels were book solid.
4361705	4363685	Yeah, so... We're lucky to get a Saturday.
4363805	4364646	Yeah, that's awesome.
4364686	4365386	That's a good time.
4365486	4368707	So, Saturday at 2, we'll be there taping one of our shows live.
4368987	4371707	And for that reason, we will not be live Memorial Day weekend.
4371968	4374588	Because some folks will be staying at Faname.
4374968	4375909	I have other commitments.
4375929	4378049	I'm going to be going to Faname for like a day and a half.
4378069	4379049	We still need to talk about that.
4379169	4380010	Yeah, I have other commitments.
4380090	4380670	So, we'll see.
4381310	4381530	All right.
4382708	4391714	I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with the rest of them, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco.
4391774	4397017	I'm very excited about it because that's the thing I'm really into is bad movies like Rocky Horror and all that.
4397298	4397618	Excellent.
4397938	4398198	Alright.
4399139	4407264	So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line and let's ask right now if there's any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.
4407284	4409866	Okay.
4410310	4412251	Well, something interesting you should know.
4412411	4416453	The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess.
4417174	4425838	And a review on IGN saying that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the Blu... Was it the Blu-ray Java or whatever?
4426178	4427039	The BD Java.
4428099	4431021	It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.
4431221	4436764	There used to be one for a five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha!
4437804	4438885	Some other fun stuff.
4439696	4465185	I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend but they had the announcement for Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and it looks pretty fucking awesome and of course Tom Clancy's End War which is supposed to be an online persistent war you're basically going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other so that's kind of neat
4466435	4467455	And let's see what else.
4467836	4477403	Oh, LEGO Star Wars 2 and Saints Row have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both those games are available for $29.99.
4478364	4480025	Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.
4480045	4481467	Saints Row is fucking awesome.
4481527	4484389	I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game, I never bought it, so maybe I will now.
4485270	4490594	There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disguise are coming to the PS3.
4492355	4493396	That's kind of interesting, I guess.
4494451	4497012	I know it was your new Disgaea game coming out, I thought.
4497252	4498693	Or maybe that's called Deceptive, I'm thinking.
4501335	4502835	Let's see, what else do we have here?
4502855	4511120	Yeah, I think that was pretty much it.
4512140	4512320	Yeah.
4513501	4513821	Alright.
4514781	4515882	DarkSakura, you got anything?
4516102	4516943	Any last minute stories?
4517643	4517803	No.
4519004	4519724	Oh, alright.
4519844	4521885	I guess that does it then for tonight's Warrior Bob.
4521925	4523406	You got anything you've read about?
4523526	4523586	Um...
4525942	4532344	So, the show I used to co-host, PressStart.TheFighting.org Are they still on?
4532685	4533225	Yeah, they still are.
4533665	4534145	I've just left.
4534945	4535826	I Skype in now and again.
4536066	4536306	Oh, okay.
4536526	4538046	But first I want to plug them.
4538086	4542828	Second, I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week.
4543308	4544368	So, ha, that's our news.
4545189	4547829	Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.
4548610	4549390	Ah, yes, that's right.
4549450	4551170	That's coming up, what, Friday?
4551190	4551931	It was two days ago.
4553772	4554332	Oh, two days ago.
4554372	4554713	I think so.
4556494	4558635	Yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.
4559015	4562937	Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st?
4563678	4565419	I think they said it'll be done when it's done.
4565639	4566439	They want to make a good game.
4566479	4567740	If it takes that long, it'll take that long.
4567880	4568641	I guess so.
4568681	4570622	This game better do my dishes.
4570642	4571322	That's all I have to say.
4571342	4572703	It better be that freaking good.
4572743	4574264	I mean, they named it after the development time.
4574284	4575084	That was innovative, right?
4575645	4576065	I guess so.
4576705	4576985	All right.
4578967	4579567	I guess that's it.
4579997	4580737	Thank you for watching!
4602219	4630355	but yeah, you got your mic there so anyway, thanks for being on the show thank you for having me, it's been a pleasure awesome radio voice, chat loves you guys chat room loves you and wants you to come back make sure you do come back soon thank you very much final thought oh, that was my final thought, thank you for having me alright, there you go, good enough my final thought my final thought is garlic is delicious and keeps the vampires away
4631198	4632219	Loki, your final thought.
4632919	4639383	Apparently that Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and StarCraft 2 as well.
4640444	4641464	Wouldn't that be one and the same?
4642005	4643045	No, they're going to be two different games.
4644846	4648189	My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.
4648829	4650610	But it costs money and I don't have money.
4650650	4653252	That's my new final thought, is I want you to open a laser tag arena.
4653752	4654132	Me too.
4654853	4657815	DarkSakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.
4659235	4660096	Reject false icons.
4661055	4662855	It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.
4663096	4664276	It's good to see it make a comeback.
4664936	4668737	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
4668757	4671018	Without you guys, we would die.
4672218	4676859	Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.
4677879	4679540	So it's you guys that help support us.
4680080	4683121	Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two friends.
4683421	4684501	They don't even have to be friends.
4684601	4688922	Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to us.
4689395	4718421	and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world and if you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even more you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo Podcasts or Podcast Alley or any of those sites that are like hey rate your favorite podcast because then we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people bother to look at it and if you really really like us and you can do it you'll send us invitations to E3 that's also a good idea
4719865	4722307	On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.
4722347	4723747	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
