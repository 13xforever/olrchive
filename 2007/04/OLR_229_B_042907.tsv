0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	29000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We're here on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 29th of 2007, continuing on with episode number 229 of our show.
29000	33000	If you are just tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the very first time, hi, how are you?
33000	36000	But you're listening to the second part of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	If you want to go back in our audio archive and listen to the first part, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
41000	49000	All the details are there or whatever program you use to get this program like maybe iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or whatever you're using to get the show.
49000	53000	There should be the older show right in the same list where you got this one from.
53000	56000	So let's get to some more gaming news from tonight.
56000	63000	And, of course, our chat room is over at www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you happen to be listening to our show live.
63000	64000	And we always like to read your comments.
64000	68000	And, of course, the Skype line will be open in the show a little later.
68000	74000	The iToy is no more as we're now going to get the PlayStation Eye.
74000	84000	Sony Computer has announced that there's going to be a new PlayStation camera coming out and it's called just the Eye, not the iToy because it's no longer a toy, apparently, but it's the Eye.
84000	92000	And the camera will now instead of taking 320 by, or no, I think before like the camera was only taking like what, 300 by 200, I mean it was really small.
92000	97000	Now it's taking 640 by 480 shots at 60 frames a second.
97000	98000	That's not bad.
98000	100000	It's not HD, but that's not bad.
100000	103000	Or 320 at twice that.
103000	109000	Yeah, 320 by 240 at 120 frames a second, which I didn't even think you could see with your eye, but I guess so.
109000	110000	So there you go.
110000	121000	It's going to come with what's called the iCreate editing software that will make you able to edit video and audio and photos and put in visual effects and save all that stuff to the hard drive.
121000	133000	You can also do slow-mo and time-lapse, which means if you want to make videos to yourself, dancing to my humps in the privacy of your own living room and put it to slow-mo, you now have the ability.
133000	134000	Enjoy.
134000	141000	Does this have anything to do with the exclusive release Loki got word about for The Brown Eye of Judgment some months ago?
141000	143000	I have no idea. Possibly.
143000	146000	I don't know, Loki. How about The Brown Eye of Judgment?
146000	153000	Speaking of The Brown Eye of Judgment, it's a sisterly game or brotherly game, whatever.
153000	162000	The Eye of Judgment has been dated for the very specific date of fall, and that's for Japan, of course.
162000	169000	So I guess when the leaves start to change colors and come off the trees, it's time for a crappy card game to come out.
169000	178000	Anyways, it is going to use the eye camera, and it's going to be a card game.
178000	179000	Hurrah.
179000	188000	I'm sure that's really worth the $600 purchase of the PlayStation 3, and you know this is going to be like 80 bucks if this game is bundled in there.
188000	194000	I hope it's really worth that card game that you're going to get sick of after about a day.
194000	199000	To be fair, Loki, maybe they've given this game some enhancements.
199000	204000	Maybe this game looks a little better than what essentially was a tech demo that we saw at the last E3.
204000	206000	Looks exactly the same to me.
206000	211000	Well, yeah, but probably these sites that are running the pictures are just using the old E3 stuff.
211000	213000	I don't know if they've actually put out new stuff, have they?
213000	215000	Let me put it this way.
215000	219000	Granted, the camera is better than the last camera.
219000	225000	But let's just look at the examples here, and I'm not just saying that the eye toys suck.
225000	231000	Because to be fair, the vision camera for the 360 sucks as well.
231000	236000	Hey, if they can make it work, if this camera's got some special...
236000	240000	I believe it's supposed to be able to recognize faces and stuff like that.
240000	244000	If that's actually what it can do, then great.
244000	247000	I just want to be able to use this in low light and stuff like that.
247000	250000	And according to this, I think you can.
250000	253000	But if it does suck, I'm going to be fucking pissed again.
253000	255000	But I'm not buying it.
255000	257000	I was going to say, are you actually buying this to try it out?
257000	259000	There's an easy way to not be pissed at it.
259000	261000	Don't buy it, exactly.
261000	265000	I'm not going to buy it because I have that stupid vision camera,
265000	271000	and I've used that to play with a stupid totem ball.
271000	273000	That was very fucking lame.
273000	276000	I wanted that game to be so good, and then it required the camera,
276000	278000	and I said, screw it.
278000	281000	That pinball game I got supposedly has a mode where you can use the camera,
281000	283000	but I don't want to use it.
283000	284000	It's useless.
284000	286000	I seriously don't even want to play it.
286000	289000	Apparently in multiplayer, you get to see other people playing the game,
289000	292000	which might be kind of funny.
292000	295000	I would play it just so I could play it.
295000	297000	If that's true, and I haven't played the mode yet,
297000	299000	maybe somebody in chat can clarify,
299000	302000	but if that's true, then you can play that by waving your arms,
302000	306000	and you can see your friends on Xbox Live doing the waving their arms thing.
306000	310000	What I would do is I would convince Bobby Blackwolf to play a game with me
310000	312000	and then secretly tape him and then put it on YouTube,
312000	315000	and we could all have a laugh.
315000	316000	That might be a good use of the...
316000	318000	You can already do that with DDR, though.
318000	320000	That might be a good use of the Xbox 360.
320000	322000	I did show him the orange bat, by the way.
322000	323000	All right, anyway.
323000	324000	Oh, yes, the bat.
324000	325000	That's old.
325000	326000	I saw the bat.
326000	328000	Did you go to her house and play pinball?
328000	330000	Yeah, I forgot to mention this in my gaming week.
330000	334000	March soccer invited me over, and I got to go play a whole bunch of awesome pinball games,
334000	337000	and then Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was great.
337000	340000	The only PS3 game I've ever played, but it was tons of fun.
340000	342000	Cool. All right. Good job.
342000	343000	I played Deadpool the whole time. It was great.
343000	344000	Yeah, she did. Nerd.
344000	345000	She was kicking ass.
345000	346000	Well, who are you playing?
346000	348000	I played Thor, and then I played Iron Man.
348000	351000	I played a lot of Iron Man, and I was like, dude...
351000	354000	Dude, he has a freaking rocket kick. It's great.
354000	356000	All right. No Wonder Woman still.
356000	359000	It's Marvel!
359000	361000	That's my new favorite joke on this show.
361000	363000	It's not a very good joke.
363000	367000	It's going to be a downloadable pack of DC characters, and you're just going to be like, what the fuck?
367000	370000	I will play Marvel Ultimate Alliance when I can play Wonder Woman.
370000	372000	You can play Spider Woman.
372000	375000	Uh, my word.
375000	378000	Anyway.
378000	379000	Pinball's awesome.
379000	383000	So, moving forward, shall I?
383000	387000	God, I'm so sick of this game already, and I haven't even played it.
387000	398000	Hasbro, actually, is set to produce and distribute cards for the Eye of Judgment game.
398000	400000	God, why?
400000	405000	Anyway, for those who don't know, Hasbro is the parent of Wizards of the Coast.
405000	406000	Oh, no.
406000	409000	And we know what Wizards of the Coast have given us.
409000	411000	Our card crack!
411000	415000	Yes, even I played Magic for a very, very long time.
415000	416000	Me too.
416000	418000	I started playing Magic again.
418000	423000	I had my black bordered collection that I sold the first time around for a few thousand dollars in D&D books,
423000	429000	turned right around and replaced most of them, and then managed to...
429000	431000	I just gave them away because they were my...
431000	434000	Have you ever had a collection that's too expensive to sell?
434000	435000	Why don't you sell half of it?
435000	436000	No, but...
436000	438000	I sold what I could out of it, like my Moxes.
438000	439000	No, I go outdoors.
439000	444000	I sold my Moxes, my original manipulators, all that type of stuff, my candelabra.
444000	448000	I managed to get about $1,500 out of it before I just gave the rest of it away.
448000	451000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert, nerd alert!
451000	453000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, anyway.
453000	455000	This show has reached maximum nerd levels.
455000	461000	The only card games I'm going to play are card games I can get money for or I can see naked chicks.
461000	464000	And obviously Magic has neither of those.
464000	466000	I used to play the Illuminati game.
466000	467000	Oh, was that good?
467000	468000	That was really fun.
468000	470000	Ooh, ooh, ooh, nerd alert!
470000	476000	Anyway, so yeah, Hasbro's bringing out cards for piece of shit the game.
476000	477000	Piece of shit the game?
477000	481000	No, what's kind of funny though is they're still producing these cards,
481000	485000	but you can scan them and print them out and they work exactly the same,
485000	488000	because the camera doesn't know any different.
488000	491000	It's a fucking camera, it's a card, and boom, works!
491000	492000	I was going to ask you about this.
492000	495000	So the camera actually just sees the image of the card and figures it out from there?
495000	497000	Yeah, in fact, it's really complicated to play the game,
497000	503000	because you can't leave the card on the board if it's been defeated,
503000	505000	because otherwise they'll just recast the card,
505000	506000	because the game doesn't know.
506000	509000	It's very fucking complicated to play,
509000	511000	and when I ask them, I'm like,
511000	515000	well, what's going to stop people from photocopying these things?
515000	518000	What's the point of this game?
518000	520000	See, it's just retarded.
520000	521000	It's a fucking tech demo.
521000	524000	It's a cool idea, because it's really thinking outside of the box,
524000	528000	but the problem is it's thinking a little too far outside of the box.
528000	533000	It's one thing to think outside the box if the box is made out of cardboard.
533000	537000	I mean, it's something that will not enhance card playing.
537000	541000	All it's really going to do is supplement.
541000	548000	Say, for example, if you want to take this and make an official Magic of the Gathering game,
548000	550000	The Judgment or something like that,
550000	554000	and actually just kind of have these on your existing Magic cards or whatever,
554000	556000	and it just enhances that.
556000	559000	So if you want to have this feature at a tournament or something like that,
559000	561000	you can place them down,
561000	565000	and it does a little animation for the people that don't give a shit about Magic to watch.
565000	567000	Oh, look, the monster's beating the other monster.
567000	571000	To be honest, if you're playing an actual game, though,
571000	573000	I don't think anyone's going to give a shit,
573000	577000	and if anything, you're going to get frustrated trying to get this thing to work correctly in the first place,
577000	581000	like any other iToy game that's out on the market right now
581000	584000	because they're frustrating and don't work properly.
584000	587000	I will give a shit when you can hack that thing like people have hacked other games
587000	590000	to stick your own cards and 3D models that show up within it in
590000	592000	so we can get our OLR game going
592000	596000	and we can see a little dancing Rob whenever we put his card down.
596000	598000	Oh, hooray.
598000	601000	I am so excited. I just can't hide it.
601000	602000	That will go on YouTube.
602000	605000	Yeah, speaking of things competing with YouTube,
605000	608000	Sony is creating a service called iVEO.
608000	611000	It's a video sharing site in Japan,
611000	614000	and of course it's something that's going to hopefully,
614000	616000	if PlayStation gets their way in,
616000	618000	Sony will compete against YouTube.
618000	621000	Now, they will be introducing it outside of Japan for right now,
621000	624000	but of course they're trying to gauge how it's going to go over in Japan first.
624000	627000	What's interesting about it is that you can actually download
627000	631000	PSP and iPod compatible video files from the service.
631000	634000	There will be a mobile version of this service as well,
634000	638000	and you can upload videos from your mobile devices.
638000	644000	Also, the logo for the service is the old Boomerang PS3 controller shaped,
644000	645000	which is kind of funny.
645000	647000	So there it is.
647000	650000	So I'm wondering if now, you know, it seems like a natural progression that,
650000	653000	oh, if you're going to be able to make your own movies with this PlayStation i,
653000	656000	you'll also be able to upload those to the service,
656000	659000	and then so you can hopefully someday download
659000	663000	Loki singing My Humps in slow motion directly to your PSP.
663000	667000	I don't sing, and I definitely do not sing My Humps.
667000	668000	My Humps, My Humps, My Humps.
668000	670000	And it's definitely not in slow motion.
670000	672000	Come on, just My Lovely Lady Humps.
672000	675000	Come on, Loki.
675000	677000	So retarded.
677000	683000	Anyways, so some interesting stuff that's coming out of the Microsoft camp.
683000	688000	They've actually put out a new patent.
688000	689000	I'm sorry, I just have to say this really quick.
689000	691000	James Patrick in chat says,
691000	694000	How is it a good idea? Just go to YouTube.
694000	700000	So it's two companies who aren't making money competing against each other.
700000	702000	Zing.
702000	703000	Sorry, Loki.
703000	706000	Anyways, so they have a brand new patent,
706000	710000	and what it is, it's for a multi-component gaming system.
710000	713000	And what this basically is, in layman's terms,
713000	717000	is it will actually use your console to have,
717000	720000	communicate with other devices, like handheld devices.
720000	722000	So say for example, I have a Playstation 3,
722000	724000	although this isn't a Microsoft thing,
724000	727000	but say I had a Playstation 3, and they have this thing in it,
727000	730000	and so my game or whatever is crunching numbers,
730000	734000	but at the same time, my game system is communicating to my PSP
734000	736000	to crunch numbers as well to make it work faster.
736000	742000	So this will use any devices that you have to crunch numbers faster to,
742000	748000	I guess, speed up gameplay or possibly be able to put out more polygons and whatnot.
748000	750000	Or fold proteins.
750000	752000	Goody, goody, goody.
752000	753000	Fuck that shit.
753000	755000	I don't give a shit about the cure for cancer.
755000	759000	I am damn well not wasting my console resources,
759000	766000	wasting my TV, or my power, or my bandwidth on crunching numbers for cancer.
766000	769000	So this is like the original design for the cell processor,
769000	771000	where the more of them you have set up, the more of them work together,
771000	774000	except that it works with things that aren't Sony branded.
774000	776000	Yeah, something like that.
776000	778000	That's right.
778000	780000	Wait, is this Microsoft?
780000	781000	This is Microsoft, right?
781000	782000	Yeah, this is Microsoft.
782000	786000	It says basically in plain English, the patent seems to be proposing a way
786000	789000	to connect portable gaming devices, including PDAs and cell phones,
789000	792000	and consoles in a way that increases the processing power
792000	794000	of all the connected devices.
794000	796000	The more gaming components in the network,
796000	798000	the more computing power is generated.
798000	799000	So can you imagine?
799000	803000	So it's Voltron, right?
803000	807000	No, it's not gay, and it doesn't have stupid robot lines.
807000	808000	No, it's Voltron.
808000	809000	I like vehicle Voltron.
809000	812000	Microsoft has just patented Voltron.
812000	816000	It's all the systems coming together to form one Uber system.
816000	817000	That's what it is. It's Voltron.
817000	819000	It doesn't have theme music. It isn't Voltron.
819000	821000	I like vehicle Voltron.
821000	823000	I like vehicle Voltron.
823000	824000	Hey, guess what?
824000	825000	What?
825000	828000	I have something that's a lot cooler than all that.
828000	830000	A lot cooler.
830000	831000	Blaze says Voltron will whoop your ass, Loki.
831000	833000	Yes, Star Soccer. A lot cooler.
833000	834000	Tron.
834000	835000	Tron.
835000	836000	That's like Voltron without a mole.
836000	840000	You can't make Voltron without Tron.
840000	841000	Great minds.
841000	842000	Rob, three words for you.
842000	843000	Great minds think like me.
843000	846000	End of line.
846000	847000	Anyway.
847000	849000	Four words for you. Die in a fire.
849000	850000	For people who don't know,
850000	853000	Tron is like my all-time favorite Disney anything ever,
853000	856000	which I have on laserdisc and DVD.
856000	859000	I have like the Uber, Uber laserdisc that's like,
859000	862000	you know, this big fat box of Tron.
862000	867000	And I have a Tron t-shirt from the Disney vault.
867000	869000	This reminds me of something, if I may, real quick.
869000	870000	No.
870000	871000	No, Dark Soccer, trust me.
871000	872000	This will have your blessing.
872000	873000	What?
873000	881000	What does that have to do with Tron?
881000	885000	F you to Disney for not having the people mover.
885000	886000	I know.
886000	888000	All because that stupid grad jumped off of it.
888000	890000	Because the people mover.
890000	893000	Most graduate high school and jump off the people mover.
893000	896000	Tron ride at Disneyland.
896000	899000	Because you could go through like Tron,
899000	900000	which is the coolest thing ever.
900000	902000	And I believe Tim Curry narrated it,
902000	903000	which makes it just double cool.
903000	904000	You know what they could do though?
904000	905000	And so, you know,
905000	906000	if they should do instead of the people movers,
906000	908000	actually just do the things together,
908000	910000	like a little track ride and have it enclosed.
910000	911000	Yes.
911000	912000	It was called the Rocket Rods.
912000	915000	Also someone died on that one and they removed that as well.
915000	916000	Someone died on Big Thunder Railroad
916000	918000	and I rode on it in the back.
918000	921000	Someone's gonna die in here if we don't get back to some games.
921000	923000	Rocket Rods is actually pretty cool
923000	925000	because it was like the people movers,
925000	927000	except it moved like 70 miles an hour through the track.
927000	928000	Same track.
928000	929000	It went through the Tron thing too.
929000	931000	It was just like pew, real fast.
931000	932000	No narration.
932000	933000	Tron.
933000	934000	Tron.
934000	938000	Anyway, although Disney Interactive has not confirmed this yet,
938000	944000	the ESRB is actually reviewing a rating for the discs of Tron.
944000	949000	And also it says there's another one supposed to be coming out,
949000	953000	but they were talking about a...
953000	956000	IGN actually was saying that they received a package
956000	958000	that included a DVD of Tron
958000	962000	and a note that says, SARC is ready, are you?
962000	964000	And so we're getting...
964000	965000	Oh, sorry.
965000	966000	Another note to that was,
966000	969000	two classics return this summer to the arcade.
969000	971000	More data to be downloaded soon.
971000	974000	So it looks like it's going to be Tron and Discs of Tron.
974000	977000	That is so frickin' rad, I can't even contain myself.
977000	979000	I found the Discs of Tron machine.
979000	981000	Tron is like seriously one of my favorite arcade games.
981000	982000	That was an excellent game.
982000	984000	The light cycles, that little cone thing.
984000	986000	Did you ever play Tron 2.0?
986000	988000	No, I never did.
988000	991000	There's something that Dan downloaded a while back,
991000	992000	and it was pretty fun.
992000	994000	It's actually just a light cycle game.
994000	996000	I was about to say, the online one?
996000	997000	Yeah, the online light cycle game.
997000	998000	That was pretty cool.
998000	1001000	That Tron 2.0 though was supposed to be like a big play-through game.
1001000	1004000	I need to go back through Kingdom Hearts 2 so I can get to Tron World.
1004000	1008000	Why do I have Stargate Atlantis in my laptop?
1008000	1010000	Because you're a nerd.
1010000	1012000	No, Dan was using my laptop last and...
1012000	1013000	God.
1013000	1014000	Anyway.
1014000	1016000	Tron is one letter off from Pron.
1016000	1017000	That's true.
1017000	1018000	Do you know how everyone misspells porn?
1018000	1019000	Pron.
1019000	1020000	Tron.
1020000	1021000	T-R-0-N.
1021000	1023000	Discs of Pron.
1023000	1030000	Oh no, that's what Dark Sakura denies having, is hard discs of Pron.
1030000	1031000	What?
1031000	1032000	End of line.
1032000	1035000	Oh wait, no, I pointed...
1035000	1037000	I'm sorry, it's my turn, huh?
1037000	1038000	Loki's like sitting here going,
1038000	1041000	Are you going to cut her off yet with the next story?
1041000	1042000	And I'm going,
1042000	1044000	Come on, Loki, get into your story.
1044000	1045000	Oops, it's my turn.
1045000	1046000	Hi.
1046000	1047000	Rob.
1047000	1048000	No, I just wanted to try that one time.
1048000	1049000	It doesn't work for you, it works for her.
1049000	1050000	It's actually kind of fun.
1050000	1052000	No, it's not.
1052000	1058000	There's a big, fat, scary rumor on the internet that more Guitar Hero 2 song packs are on
1058000	1059000	the way.
1059000	1065000	Now, it's one step above a rumor because harmonics fans seemed to call the first set of arcade
1065000	1070000	packs before they came out, so this looks like it could be pretty true, is that there
1070000	1072000	are these new packs coming out for Guitar Hero 2.
1072000	1077000	Pack one will contain Cowboys from Hell from Pantera, I Love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett,
1077000	1080000	and The Black Hearts and Cochise by Audioslave.
1080000	1084000	Content pack two will have Godzilla by Blue Oyster Cult, I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones,
1084000	1086000	and Sharp Dressed Man by ZZ Top.
1086000	1091000	And content pack three will have Iron Man by Black Sabbath, Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand,
1091000	1093000	and Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple.
1093000	1098000	Yeah, those are cool, but if they charge the same price as they did the first time around,
1098000	1099000	then fail.
1099000	1102000	Although, I really don't see how they can't charge the exact same price.
1102000	1107000	I mean, wouldn't that be weird if you had these one packs that cost 200 points and these
1107000	1109000	other packs that cost 100 points?
1109000	1112000	That would look kind of stupid, so I think they're going to be the same price like it
1112000	1113000	or not.
1113000	1114000	Everybody bought them.
1114000	1115000	The market sustains it.
1115000	1116000	Yeah.
1116000	1119000	I'd pay that happily if they were new songs that I hadn't already bought.
1119000	1120000	Exactly.
1120000	1121000	Ditto.
1121000	1124000	And I don't know, I do kind of want that pack three with Iron Man.
1124000	1125000	That's kind of rad.
1125000	1127000	That was the one pack I really didn't want.
1127000	1130000	I didn't enjoy any of those songs nearly as much as the others.
1130000	1138000	Anyways, there's a rumor that the BioWare sci-fi role-playing game, you know, this phenomenal
1138000	1142000	game that's coming out called Mass Effect, has been delayed to September.
1142000	1149000	And, of course, Microsoft is on the record saying that we have not made an official announcement
1149000	1151000	for a date, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1151000	1154000	So, it's rumor mill and yada, yada, yada.
1154000	1155000	It's actually moved.
1155000	1156000	What, what, what?
1156000	1157000	Nothing.
1157000	1158000	I didn't say anything.
1158000	1160000	Did you say it's actually true?
1160000	1161000	Probably.
1161000	1164000	And how would you know this?
1164000	1166000	Because I heard about it before.
1166000	1167000	Oh, right.
1167000	1170000	But it's probably true.
1170000	1171000	It's not done.
1171000	1172000	Let me put it this way.
1172000	1177000	It's not coming out, you know, right now, but definitely later.
1177000	1179000	So September until you get your Mass Effect.
1179000	1180000	Sorry.
1180000	1181000	East.
1181000	1182000	At least.
1182000	1189000	I mean, like, look at, well, perfect example, look at Too Human, delayed to like next year.
1189000	1199000	Well, Microsoft, though, I think might be feeling a bit of pain right about now because
1199000	1205000	their games division is actually reporting a lower sales by 21%.
1205000	1217000	Basically, they've had a drop from 402 million for this quarter last year to 315 million.
1217000	1221000	So that's quite a bit.
1221000	1226000	They're basically saying the revenues were actually down by $1.2 billion.
1226000	1227000	So.
1227000	1232000	Of course, it's not surprising, you know, they've lost a lot of money before with their
1232000	1233000	product.
1233000	1237000	Well, I would say that this is true because Halo 3 is not yet out.
1237000	1247000	Well, they shipped 500,000 consoles for this period versus 1.7 million in third quarter
1247000	1248000	2003.
1248000	1250000	See, there's that shipped again.
1250000	1253000	It's not sold, it's shipped.
1253000	1256000	Shipped equals sitting on store shelves collecting dust.
1256000	1260000	And they're up, you know, but also during the same time, their operating losses fell
1260000	1262000	by 20%.
1262000	1266000	So maybe it's going to balance.
1266000	1267000	They'll pull through.
1267000	1268000	They have the resources.
1268000	1269000	It's Microsoft.
1269000	1274000	They have the power of gates because he's tainted them.
1274000	1276000	It'll be fine.
1276000	1277000	They'll be fine.
1277000	1278000	Halo 3 is on its way.
1278000	1279000	Halo Wars.
1279000	1280000	They'll be fine.
1280000	1281000	I see their parachutes.
1281000	1282000	All right.
1282000	1285000	This is not going to help their situation though much.
1285000	1286000	Sorry.
1286000	1291000	Ultra rumor site, you know, such a site like Gamefly, you know, that obviously doesn't
1291000	1296000	have any sort of idea what's coming out the list mass effect for September as well.
1296000	1299000	So, you know, you heard it from Gamefly.
1299000	1304000	It's September because they were, they were listing some other weird title called like
1304000	1309000	beautiful Katamari, which we know is not coming out ever.
1309000	1313000	Didn't some little internet radio sites somewhere mentioned that one once?
1313000	1316000	No, we disavow all knowledge of that.
1316000	1317000	Yeah.
1317000	1320000	Look, he's afraid of getting NAMM code by nine Microsoft.
1320000	1326000	NAMM code is a verb now.
1326000	1327000	Some site somewhere.
1327000	1331000	Some, something we wish would get NAMM code is this, although I don't see how that's possible.
1331000	1337000	But, look, there's these videos that went up on Xbox live marketplace recently and what
1337000	1340000	they are is they're 100 MS point videos.
1340000	1343000	That's $1.25 for those that can't do math.
1343000	1348000	Basically all these videos do is they show you the locations of the COG tags in Gears
1348000	1349000	of War.
1349000	1351000	And they have one of these videos for each chapter.
1351000	1355000	So, basically you could spend, what about, I don't know, about six bucks and find out
1355000	1358000	the location of all the COG tags in Gears of War.
1358000	1363000	That's awesome except for the facts that YouTube and game FAQs and many other gaming sites
1363000	1367000	will give you this information for the low, low price of nothing.
1367000	1374000	So, Microsoft is deciding to, hey, let's see, I wonder if there's any suckers out there
1374000	1378000	that will, you know, just buy these videos because it's easy and convenient.
1378000	1382000	It's just like there are strategy guides out there that people buy and they still sell
1382000	1383000	strategy guides.
1383000	1387000	So, you know, should they stop publishing strategy guides since game FAQs are out there?
1387000	1392000	To some extent, I almost say that that's okay because of the fact that a lot of times those
1392000	1396000	strategy guides also come with artwork and a lot of really cool stuff like maps and things
1396000	1398000	that you can't really get online.
1398000	1401000	And they make great coffee table books for the gamer.
1401000	1402000	They really do.
1402000	1405000	I mean, it depends which publisher it is and which book it is.
1405000	1408000	But a lot of those ones, especially for the big, big games, come with a lot of like cool
1408000	1409000	art and stuff.
1409000	1415000	Well, you know, I can read a comic book online or I can go buy it in a store.
1415000	1417000	I usually choose to go buy it because I like having the book.
1417000	1418000	Same thing with strategy guides.
1418000	1420000	I don't know about these videos though.
1420000	1423000	I mean, it's not that I'm trying to say this isn't okay because if there are suckers out
1423000	1427000	there willing to buy this stuff, then, you know, they're going to sell it and that's
1427000	1428000	just going to motivate them to make more.
1428000	1432000	I'm just going to say a preemptive F.U. to anyone who wastes the money to buy these when
1432000	1438000	you can just go on YouTube or whatever and get these same strategy type videos for free.
1438000	1445000	Well, apparently, Microsoft has lost some more exclusives in the form of Kane & Lynch
1445000	1446000	and Crossfire.
1446000	1452000	Those are both now coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1452000	1456000	Although, from what I remember, I didn't think they were exclusives in the first place, but
1456000	1460000	I don't know, news to me, but they are now coming out on both systems.
1460000	1465000	I don't know why this is a big surprise because, I mean, how many games like before came out
1465000	1466000	on PlayStation 2 and Xbox?
1466000	1469000	I mean, that was just kind of standard that they'd be on both systems.
1469000	1471000	Who gives a fuck anyways?
1471000	1475000	I mean, the way I look at it right now, Sony needs all the help they can get because they
1475000	1478000	sure as hell don't have exclusives for the PlayStation 3.
1478000	1482000	So, you know, heavenly sword.
1482000	1485000	So, you know, whatever.
1485000	1489000	Now, even though I never heard of either one of those games really or care about them a
1489000	1494000	lot, it is kind of interesting to note that it's a two-way street, this whole losing the
1494000	1495000	exclusive things.
1495000	1499000	So, you know, there's been a lot of ra-ha-ha-ha, PlayStation lost the exclusives, Devil May
1499000	1503000	Cry is coming out on 360, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff, but now, you know, it's
1503000	1504000	working the other way.
1504000	1507000	I don't know.
1507000	1510000	I think it's just really, it's not surprising, though.
1510000	1514000	I mean, that's just, why would you publish something for one system, only one system,
1514000	1516000	unless, I don't know.
1516000	1519000	I don't know why you would just do that.
1519000	1522000	If it's easy to port it over to the other system, then why not?
1522000	1528000	I mean, more people, even if it is only a few million more, more is better.
1528000	1530000	So, I don't know.
1530000	1534000	Ravenstaufen is in our chat room and says, I like the tone of OLR tonight.
1534000	1536000	It's like, I do not give a shit.
1536000	1538000	I thought we were like that every week.
1538000	1539000	I don't.
1539000	1541000	I really don't some weeks.
1541000	1544000	Let's see, and Kiki's in our chat room.
1544000	1545000	That's a new name.
1545000	1546000	Hi, Kiki.
1546000	1547000	Says, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1547000	1549000	I have a Hello Kitty Dreamcast.
1549000	1553000	Kiki, send me your address so I can break into your house and steal it.
1553000	1555000	That sounds awesome.
1555000	1557000	All right.
1557000	1560000	Deakman says, announcement of the podcast.
1560000	1562000	My girlfriend is pregnant with my baby.
1562000	1563000	Wow.
1563000	1565000	Oh, speaking of which, I have an announcement.
1565000	1566000	Congratulations.
1566000	1567000	Oh, what's that?
1567000	1568000	Oh, my.
1568000	1569000	No.
1569000	1570000	Really, Dark Sakura?
1570000	1571000	No.
1571000	1572000	You're not Deakman's baby?
1572000	1573000	No.
1573000	1575000	You're not Mary Deakman's baby?
1575000	1576000	Hi, Mary.
1576000	1578000	I don't even carry my own husband.
1578000	1579000	We kid.
1579000	1580000	We kid.
1580000	1581000	We kid.
1581000	1587000	I wanted to say that my good friend Becky had her baby Friday morning at 6.06 AM by
1587000	1588000	a cesarean.
1588000	1590000	Aw, too bad she didn't have it at 6.66 AM.
1590000	1593000	He is six pounds eight ounces.
1593000	1597000	How come you have it at 6.66 AM?
1597000	1598000	Yeah, Rob, duh.
1598000	1599000	It's a joke, people.
1599000	1600000	It's a joke.
1600000	1604000	But his name is Julian Donald.
1604000	1608000	He just did not want to come out, anyway.
1608000	1612000	So, I did want to share that, though, with everyone because I'm very...
1612000	1616000	I feel what that baby's going through, not wanting to come out.
1616000	1622000	Seriously, though, this is my friend's first baby, and I'm very excited for her.
1622000	1623000	Congratulations to her.
1623000	1624000	Thank you.
1624000	1625000	And to Deakman.
1625000	1626000	See, we have someone nice in the room, Rob.
1626000	1630000	And what shall we be sending the baby as a baby gift?
1630000	1632000	God of War.
1632000	1635000	How about a decapitated goat?
1635000	1636000	No.
1636000	1637000	It's an offering.
1637000	1641000	I think it's great, though, because his parents are both Trekkies.
1641000	1645000	His room is all done up in space themed with Star Trek, Star Wars, and Stitch.
1645000	1647000	They didn't name the kid Spock, did they?
1647000	1649000	His name is Julian.
1649000	1650000	Okay.
1650000	1651000	Wait a minute.
1651000	1654000	Wasn't that Picard's real name or something?
1654000	1655000	I don't know.
1655000	1656000	I forget it.
1656000	1657000	Jean-Luc?
1657000	1658000	Yeah.
1658000	1659000	Oh, his original name was supposed to be Julian.
1659000	1660000	Patrick Stewart.
1660000	1661000	I swear I read that in some dig article this week.
1661000	1663000	It was supposed to be Julian Picard, and they changed it last minute.
1663000	1664000	Guess what, Rob?
1664000	1667000	I think we have another segment to do.
1667000	1673000	Every week, you send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and I'm so excited.
1673000	1678000	The Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite
1678000	1680000	emails for you to read.
1680000	1682000	Let's start the mailbag segment.
1682000	1683000	Hooray.
1683000	1688000	You can read them with that attitude.
1688000	1692000	Anyway, first email is from Ariz...
1692000	1695000	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
1695000	1697000	Should I get an Xbox 360?
1697000	1701000	I have a high death monitor that can support 360 VGA.
1701000	1703000	I can't get live and I can't play mature rated games.
1703000	1704000	Is it worth it?
1704000	1705000	No, get a Wii.
1705000	1707000	No, you should get a 360.
1707000	1711000	I think it's definitely worth it if you have just a VGA monitor and you don't really need
1711000	1712000	live.
1712000	1714000	I have live and I don't play games over it.
1714000	1719000	Although I do like to download some arcade games, but you'd be fine without it.
1719000	1720000	Get a Wii.
1720000	1723000	So I've got live silver and I play on a monitor, which looks fine.
1723000	1725000	I'd say a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1725000	1726000	Yes.
1726000	1727000	So what games do you want to play?
1727000	1729000	You can play mature games, so there's nothing really good out.
1729000	1730000	Anyway.
1730000	1731000	Oh, that's true.
1731000	1734000	Sorry, I stepped out of the room, but Warrior Bob sounded like he was on target.
1734000	1736000	What game was that?
1736000	1737000	Test Drive.
1737000	1739000	That is not a mature game and it is awesome.
1739000	1741000	I love it.
1741000	1743000	Next email comes from AZHP.
1743000	1748000	Hey guys, I know you're probably sick of the bad dirty jokes that people have been coming
1748000	1749000	up with.
1749000	1750000	I'm here to save you guys.
1750000	1753000	I came across this Nintendo ad from the late 80s on the internet.
1753000	1755000	Let me pull up the ad.
1755000	1762000	Oh God, it's the kids of the Super Mario beanbag and the plastic cases and stuff, which I will
1762000	1764000	share with our chat room right now.
1764000	1765000	There you go, everybody.
1765000	1769000	Yeah, but I think you're supposed to read it because it has sexual in the windows in
1769000	1770000	it.
1770000	1771000	It's very small for me to read.
1771000	1774000	I use a higher resolution, obviously.
1774000	1776000	Anyway, here it is.
1776000	1779000	The text says this and this is no joke.
1779000	1782000	Please have this read in the slightest voice you can find in the studio.
1782000	1783000	Well, fuck that.
1783000	1784000	I'm going to use my regular voice.
1784000	1787000	There's a chill in the air this crisp autumn night and you're warm and safe in your living
1787000	1791000	room, relaxing with a glass of fruit juice and a game of Castlevania.
1791000	1795000	Killing vampires goes great with friends and the closest ones you have here are helping
1795000	1796000	you through a tough level.
1796000	1797000	You pause.
1797000	1799000	There are monsters up ahead and you're unsure of how to proceed.
1799000	1803000	You turn to ask and your eyes meet as if for the first time.
1803000	1805000	Perhaps it's something in the juice.
1805000	1809000	Perhaps it's the high from the intense side scrolling action that only NES can deliver,
1809000	1813000	which is a lie because the Genesis had it, too, and so did the Master System.
1813000	1817000	But there seems to soar around the two of you.
1817000	1818000	You don't look away.
1818000	1819000	You can't.
1819000	1821000	There's something there, something frightening, something exciting in his eyes.
1821000	1823000	It scares you, yet you must have it.
1823000	1825000	Your gaze never breaks.
1825000	1826000	Neither does his.
1826000	1830000	There will be magic tonight, but it will be all spells and potions and fantasy lands.
1830000	1832000	Tonight there will be a new adventure.
1832000	1834000	Nintendo, now you're playing with power.
1834000	1836000	What did you see in his eyes?
1836000	1838000	You saw blast processing.
1838000	1841000	Game power.
1841000	1847000	I'm actually genuinely surprised that there is no type, like nobody has tried to capitalize
1847000	1850000	on some type of sex simulator for the Wii.
1850000	1852000	In the U.S.
1852000	1853000	Or Japan or whatever.
1853000	1854000	Oh really?
1854000	1855000	That's where it's at.
1855000	1856000	Korea?
1856000	1857000	Alright.
1857000	1858000	I wonder about that.
1858000	1860000	Yeah, you're right.
1860000	1863000	Anyway, next email, shall I?
1863000	1868000	Dear OLR, I just wanted to start off by saying I actually like your show and listen every
1868000	1869000	week.
1869000	1872000	That said, I would like to ask Mr. Loki for a well-educated explanation.
1872000	1874000	Can I say it real fast?
1874000	1879000	I love how they said, I just wanted to write to let you know I actually like your show.
1879000	1884000	Unlike the millions of people on the internet who think you guys suck, I actually like your
1884000	1885000	show.
1885000	1887000	Most of the time I write in, I hate your show.
1887000	1889000	Can I continue please?
1889000	1890000	Alright, sorry.
1890000	1894000	For a well-educated explanation as to why he does not like Apple computers.
1894000	1898000	Week after week, I listen to the cowardly beat around the bush responses, Apple sucks,
1898000	1899000	Apple blows.
1899000	1902000	Well, I ask you, Loki, and here's your chance to give a well thought out, valid response
1902000	1903000	to that argument.
1903000	1905000	Is it because you can't run Windows?
1905000	1906000	Oh wait, yes you can.
1906000	1907000	Is it because you can't play the Sims?
1907000	1910000	And well, hey, Prey and Star Wars Alliance, oh wait, yes you can.
1910000	1914000	Is it because they actually call your show a podcast?
1914000	1917000	Would you feel better if they called it a Zune cast?
1917000	1919000	By the way, have you picked up your Zune yet?
1919000	1922000	I guess because me and Chris bought him a Zune.
1922000	1923000	Hi.
1923000	1924000	Weren't you listening to this?
1924000	1927000	You obviously are not listening every week because you weren't there when we got him
1927000	1928000	a Zune.
1928000	1929000	Hi.
1929000	1930000	And sure, you did just out of spite.
1930000	1933000	Have you tried to install Vista yet?
1933000	1936000	I believe if you did, you'll notice it looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?
1936000	1940000	Every innovation, and I use that term very loosely, and Vista is a total rip off of the
1940000	1945000	Mac OS, it didn't even try to think differently or defend it, you can't, whatever.
1945000	1950000	It only took Microsoft five years to release a horrific response to the public anyway.
1950000	1954000	Well, to be fair, Loki, you also hate Windows Vista, correct?
1954000	1960000	Oh, and this was by, God, I'm sorry I closed the email.
1960000	1961000	God wrote that email?
1961000	1964000	Oh my gosh, you are fucked, Loki.
1964000	1967000	I closed your email, I'm sorry person.
1967000	1970000	Oh wait, here it is.
1970000	1971000	It's by JG2000.
1971000	1973000	Oh, not God, one of those.
1973000	1977000	Phew, I was going to say, God's an Apple fan, you're fucked, Loki.
1977000	1978000	I'm not fucked.
1978000	1985000	No, but seriously though, I mean, let's talk about what they're doing to basically advertise
1985000	1987000	the iMac right now.
1987000	1995000	They're talking about how, oh yes, programs are so hard to install, but with Apple you
1995000	1998000	don't have to do anything because they're all preloaded on there for you.
1998000	2003000	Well that's good that you've preloaded the software that will actually run on a Mac versus
2003000	2007000	actually any games or anything you want to play on there that are relatively new, and
2007000	2010000	we're not talking about Doom 2 or stuff like that.
2010000	2013000	Oh goody, Prey plays on there, wonderful.
2013000	2017000	That's nice that you're playing the brand new Prey.
2017000	2022000	But even still though, we're talking about a computer system that they were selling it
2022000	2026000	based on colors or flavors as I should put it.
2026000	2029000	Who cares what color the damn system is?
2029000	2031000	If I can't fucking install-
2031000	2033000	Nintendo DS.
2033000	2036000	Hey, yeah, I still have issues with that too.
2036000	2038000	That's retarded that they even sell it by colors.
2038000	2042000	But to be honest, I don't give a fucking shit about the Mac.
2042000	2043000	I really don't.
2043000	2046000	I don't need to defend my opinion of the Mac.
2046000	2051000	It sucks, I'm not going to buy one, and you know what?
2051000	2056000	If you want to spend the money and buy a Mac, go right ahead.
2056000	2058000	But you know what?
2058000	2063000	When Oblivion comes out for the Mac, whenever the hell that may be, later on when the Mac
2063000	2065000	can actually play Oblivion, that'd be nice.
2065000	2072000	But whenever I guess the next-gen super RPG or whatever comes out, Mac's definitely not
2072000	2074000	going to be able to play it.
2074000	2076000	Eh, I still like being bi with computers.
2076000	2079000	I have a Mac laptop and a PC desktop, works great.
2079000	2084000	I can do my DVD stuff on the Mac and make pretty little yearbook type things.
2084000	2086000	It's just two emails, it's quick.
2086000	2091000	I don't understand, you know, they're like, oh well the iDVD, it's so awesome, you know.
2091000	2094000	There's programs out there that use, they're on everything.
2094000	2101000	Granted, it makes it really easy for you if you don't know how to use computers because
2101000	2106000	all the programs are there for you, and you don't need to download any extra stuff.
2106000	2107000	But you know what?
2107000	2113000	People like me, who aren't super basic with computers, like to have that option to customize
2113000	2118000	things, and you know, I'd like to have the flexibility of being able to do what I want.
2118000	2121000	Alright, this is too much of a tech podcast now.
2121000	2123000	So shall I move on to the next email then?
2123000	2124000	Yes, please.
2124000	2126000	Okay, hi guys.
2126000	2129000	Hey, boobs please, thank you.
2129000	2131000	I'm just writing to let you know.
2131000	2133000	Was that in the email or did you just say that randomly?
2133000	2136000	It was me saying that because he said guys, and I'm like, no.
2136000	2137000	No.
2137000	2138000	BPC, thank you.
2138000	2139000	I thought that was a request.
2139000	2141000	I'm like, well if you really want, I'll just.
2141000	2145000	Rob, no, I don't need that.
2145000	2150000	Anyway, I'm just writing to let you guys know I'm really grateful for your efforts in putting
2150000	2152000	on this show and to tell you to keep up the good work.
2152000	2153000	No, thank you.
2153000	2156000	I'm studying abroad from my junior year of high school in Italy right now.
2156000	2157000	Lucky.
2157000	2160000	So gaming news obviously isn't always my top priority in life.
2160000	2163000	That being said, I always find time in my week for your podcast.
2163000	2165000	They never fail to disappoint.
2165000	2168000	And they never fail to disappoint.
2168000	2170000	What?
2170000	2173000	Okay.
2173000	2175000	They never.
2175000	2176000	Anyway.
2176000	2177000	I don't think that was what they meant.
2177000	2178000	I don't think that's what they meant.
2178000	2179000	Chirp, chirp, chirp.
2179000	2182000	Everything else is all positive.
2182000	2183000	What?
2183000	2184000	Anyway.
2184000	2186000	I never thought I would actually care about the European release dates until I ended up
2186000	2188000	here and you guys are the only outlet I can get them from.
2188000	2193000	Can somebody put a five-star review on iTunes that says, OLR never fails to disappoint?
2193000	2195000	I haven't put a review up yet.
2195000	2196000	I should do that.
2196000	2197000	Could you do that?
2197000	2198000	Could you put a five.
2198000	2199000	OLR never fails to disappoint.
2199000	2201000	This show is a festering rash that never fails to disappoint.
2201000	2202000	Thank you.
2202000	2205000	Actually, Chris put up the festering rash thing already.
2205000	2206000	I saw that.
2206000	2207000	That was beautiful.
2207000	2208000	Okay, anyway.
2208000	2212000	Not only do you provide quality commentary that I as a gamer and more specifically a
2212000	2217000	Bimani fan care about, you also help to give me a smile by talking about high-def porn,
2217000	2222000	the vagina, and too many other goofy things to write about in this email.
2222000	2226000	I just want you to know that your work doesn't go unappreciated and I wanted to thank you
2226000	2229000	for doing us gamers a service and giving me a chuckle or two in the process.
2229000	2234000	You're doing a fine job and I hope that you continue for some time to come.
2234000	2236000	Many thanks and best regards, Matthew.
2236000	2238000	I won't say last name unless he wants me to.
2238000	2239000	P.S.
2239000	2242400	I challenge Guy's claim to the throne as worst Halo player of all time and I'm willing to
2242400	2245000	duel to the death over said throne at any time.
2245000	2249000	Yeah, but Rob's throne is a stinky unwashed toilet.
2249000	2260200	Okay, I will challenge you to this Halo duel and I assure you I will disappoint you at
2260200	2261200	Halo 2.
2261200	2263000	But what if you fail to disappoint?
2263000	2265000	Then you lose.
2265000	2266000	So hey, I'm really curious.
2266000	2267000	Matthew, was that the name?
2267000	2268000	Yeah.
2268000	2270000	Matthew, you're in Italy and that's okay.
2270000	2271000	That's pretty awesome.
2271000	2272000	First of all, listener base is international.
2272000	2273000	Rock.
2273000	2275000	Second of all, you said you're a Bimani fan and I'm curious.
2275000	2277000	What is the Bimani and arcade scene like over there?
2277000	2281000	I've heard that Europe has a better scene than California does right now, but I've never
2281000	2282000	heard this confirmed.
2282000	2285000	I think anywhere in the world has a better scene than the entire United States.
2285000	2286000	Not Japan.
2286000	2287000	Well, yeah, not Japan.
2287000	2290000	Well, unless you count Ticket Games and Pachinko.
2290000	2291000	Anyway.
2291000	2293000	Japan has tons of arcades.
2293000	2295000	Which I do.
2295000	2298440	Anyway, the last email tonight.
2298440	2301000	This is from Sakura Max.
2301000	2305960	Anime was created because we killed ourself because hot anime chicks don't exist in real
2305960	2306960	life.
2306960	2307960	Okay.
2307960	2310060	I'm pretty sad to hear about Ken Kutaragi retiring.
2310060	2315600	I was served in a tavern medium rare and was stuffed into a fat gnome's mouth two weeks
2315600	2317480	ago reference to my email.
2317480	2318480	Rita Dracer.
2318480	2323880	I recommend any MMOs, I already played Maplestory, Albatross 18, World of Warcraft, Space Cowboy
2323880	2327040	Online, Fly FF, Gunbound, GunZ, and Ragnarok.
2327040	2328200	I think that's it.
2328200	2332520	Any recommendations, no subscription games, I'm going broke with World of Warcraft.
2332520	2336400	Those guys' emails are like Rosie O'Donnell's blog.
2336400	2339680	Okay, I don't know if you've ever read it, but it's like...
2339680	2341680	I can't say I have.
2341680	2344120	Rob, that's the gayest thing I've ever heard of you doing.
2344120	2345120	No, seriously.
2345120	2346120	No, no, seriously.
2346120	2349280	I only know because they make fun of it all the time on Perez Hilton, which is the side
2349280	2350280	I love.
2350280	2356720	But if you read her blog, it's like these total random things that are like, World Peace,
2356720	2360520	I Hate Donald Trump, Save Children, all these random things.
2360520	2361520	What's this guy saying?
2361520	2367300	He's like, I was once served in a tavern medium rare.
2367300	2370600	It's like poetry practically.
2370600	2372480	I love the signature best on this though.
2372480	2374280	Let me read this to you.
2374280	2378920	Zachary Maxx, youngest listener, loves Pocky and wants to blow shit up.
2378920	2383200	You get a gold star just for your closing to that email.
2383200	2385200	You can play Loki's game.
2385200	2386200	Done.
2386200	2387760	Next, please.
2387760	2389160	All right.
2389160	2394600	Well, then, if the mailbag is done, you can email us someday, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
2394600	2398640	Meanwhile, more news, and we're going to talk about the Art of Fighting Anthology.
2398640	2402320	I like the Art of Fighting Anthology because there's a character in it with my name.
2402320	2404240	There's a Rob in it, so that's always good.
2404240	2407880	Robert Garcia, the man who brought us is Dan Hideki.
2407880	2408880	Right.
2408880	2409880	Yee-hoo!
2409880	2410880	I get that joke.
2410880	2415800	Art of Fighting Anthology will also be coming to the Wii and the PSP.
2415800	2419120	I believe it was originally announced for the PlayStation 2, and this is, again, thanks
2419120	2425400	to the ESRB, who apparently has become the newest game leak resource everywhere.
2425400	2429040	The ESRB will spill all the beans on what games are coming out.
2429040	2435600	Of course, the Art of Fighting Anthology collects all three Art of Fighting games that originally
2435600	2437000	came out on the Neo Geo.
2437000	2438000	Awesome.
2438000	2439480	You know what else it does?
2439480	2445840	It gives SNK yet another game to re-release instead of making new shit.
2445840	2451320	They've seriously become like the Central Park media of the game world.
2451320	2456760	They make games that run on 14-year-old hardware.
2456760	2459800	Make something new.
2459800	2462760	Weren't Neo Geo games supposed to come to Virtual Console anyway?
2462760	2463760	That's not new.
2463760	2465240	That's old shit, again.
2465240	2468280	There was Samurai Spirits Tenkaichi last year.
2468280	2471040	That was new, and it was really good.
2471040	2474000	Oh, well, one game.
2474000	2477480	I still want to get Samurai Spirits 5 for my Neo Geo.
2477480	2484280	All right, well, anyway, so that's an Art of Fighting.
2484280	2490040	Anyways, so speaking of, well, not so new, but Taiko Drum Master is making its way to
2490040	2491040	the DS.
2491040	2494920	Yes, you'll be able to beat the drum on that screen.
2494920	2495920	Yay.
2495920	2499160	Smash the DS into your table in time to the music.
2499160	2500280	Exactly.
2500280	2501440	Don't die.
2501440	2507440	It's going to feature wonderful tracks like the Super Mario Brothers theme, as well as
2507440	2515560	classical tunes like Flight of the Bumblebee, and let's see, some J-pop songs like Dance
2515560	2520760	2 featuring Soy Sauce, which is, I guess, apparently from a Pocky commercial.
2520760	2524800	Now, it should have that song, and I forget what the name of the song is, but it's that
2524800	2527600	song that goes, I don't want to work.
2527600	2529760	I just want to bang on Z-Drum all day.
2529760	2531760	You know that song?
2531760	2533040	No.
2533040	2534880	Never mind.
2534880	2538120	We'll just clip that out of the audio archive.
2538120	2540840	We'll just make that an edit.
2540840	2542160	No.
2542160	2545760	Well, I don't know.
2545760	2549320	Is there any fun peripheral to come with it, or are they just doing the Leap Beat Agents
2549320	2550760	thing where you just tap on the thing?
2550760	2553200	The Leap Beat Agents thing.
2553200	2556240	It's kind of boring to me.
2556240	2561020	Well, there is actually something that might not be so boring, because I think this is
2561020	2562800	really cool.
2562800	2572040	There actually is a game to be released called Dead and Furious, about a person jailed for
2572040	2578320	the crime he didn't commit, that type of thing, and then he's in prison when zombies attack.
2578320	2586580	So it's a shooter that's like House of the Dead, and what's that other one?
2586580	2589320	Like the Ghost Squad.
2589320	2590320	Like a light gun shooter.
2590320	2593800	Yeah, it's a light gun shooter, but you're using your stylus.
2593800	2598880	So you shoot zombies dead with the power of tapping.
2598880	2600760	Like point blank on the DS, right?
2600760	2602440	Yeah, like that.
2602440	2605760	And you also have multiple possible endings depending on which way you do it, so that's
2605760	2606920	pretty cool.
2606920	2609280	I like Killing the Undead.
2609280	2614560	You know, there's a new game, and I'm thinking it's probably the same thing.
2614560	2623240	It's actually coming out in June called Touch the Dead, which I think may be the US version
2623240	2625920	of Dead and Furious.
2625920	2627120	They will have to change that name.
2627120	2628120	Touch the Dead.
2628120	2630800	Yes, that is the actual name.
2630800	2634400	That's actually what Sony was inviting everyone to do at their God of War II press conference,
2634400	2635400	to Touch the Dead.
2635400	2636400	They asked you to eat stuff out of it.
2636400	2642680	Apparently, the goat was emptied out, and they had some fake stuff, or some sort of
2642680	2645440	dish I guess that's like intestines in there.
2645440	2646440	Awful.
2646440	2647440	It's so disgusting.
2647440	2651160	Apparently, it came from a butcher making that okay, because it's from a butcher.
2651160	2654880	Well, what else are they going to do with the carcass?
2654880	2657680	Not behead it and have it at a Sony press event.
2657680	2660760	Well, you can actually buy horse meat on the market.
2660760	2663860	They actually have two horse farms in the Midwest.
2663860	2666280	They sell horse meat for international consumption.
2666280	2668480	I know, and I really want some.
2668480	2674880	Anyways, I was reading on this one site that they have, and they were doing all the jokes.
2674880	2676120	This really gets my goat.
2676120	2681080	This is nothing to lose your head over.
2681080	2684560	Gotta love the internet.
2684560	2688680	The Lords of the Ring online game has been getting a little bit of press lately, mostly
2688680	2691160	because they open it up and free and all that stuff.
2691160	2694200	One thing that's landing it back in the press is the fact that they were not going to put
2694200	2695880	gay marriage in the game.
2695880	2698520	They said, no, we're not going to have gay marriage in the game.
2698520	2702440	In fact, they took the easy way out of it, the whole controversy, and just decided they're
2702440	2703840	not going to have marriage in the game at all.
2703840	2704840	It's stupid.
2704840	2705840	Why would you want marriage in the game?
2705840	2707520	In Final Fantasy, it was retarded.
2707520	2710280	It was completely pointless.
2710280	2713360	You got a ring with your friend's name on it that you married in the game.
2713360	2714360	This is stupid.
2714360	2717720	I actually liked how it worked in Ragnarok.
2717720	2720360	You actually could share your hit points.
2720360	2724320	You could teleport to where your in-game spouse was.
2724320	2728480	There are also certain attacks that you could do if you were married in-game to somebody
2728480	2730040	else.
2730040	2734620	On the private server I played on, the mods that actually have it were in the game.
2734620	2740240	It was set gender specific, but you could have the mods and they would do same sex.
2740240	2745720	If I were to create my own MMO, I would have it where you could marry anything, including
2745720	2748600	the villains and creatures that you're fighting.
2748600	2751320	You would cast a spell and you'd be like- I married a zombie.
2751320	2752320	I married the rabbit.
2752320	2754680	No, I'm going to kill the rabbit and eat the rabbit.
2754680	2757560	No, it's like the end of Shaun of the Dead.
2757560	2759440	But I still have the ring.
2759440	2761440	He's my husband.
2761440	2762440	Wow.
2762440	2768080	Anyway, so basically the whole thing came up is that the Lords of the Ring Online, they
2768080	2770840	decided what they were and they weren't going to put in the game based on what was in the
2770840	2772940	original books.
2772940	2779020	Although they had some inter-special dwarf marrying human or whatever, then they were
2779020	2780160	going to have that.
2780160	2785400	There was no mention in the books ever of two males or two females marrying, so they
2785400	2786400	weren't going to put it in the game.
2786400	2788720	You know the elves are doing it.
2788720	2789720	But who knows?
2789720	2793120	They just decided, you know what, we're just going to get around this controversy and pull
2793120	2794840	the marriage option all together.
2794840	2799320	And if I could suggest something to the folks maintaining the Lords of the Ring Online,
2799320	2802800	you may want to stop there when it comes to pulling the plug on the game because the game
2802800	2806300	sucks a lot.
2806300	2809320	If you want to play Lords of the Ring Online, just go play World of Warcraft, seriously.
2809320	2811360	Did you say Lords of the Ring?
2811360	2812360	I don't know.
2812360	2813360	It's the Lord of the Rings.
2813360	2814360	You've got one lord and a whole bunch of rings.
2814360	2816540	Now it's like a whole bunch of lords and one ring.
2816540	2817540	That's their problem.
2817540	2820680	It's a load balancing issue.
2820680	2826760	Frisbee in chat says, I now pronounce you man and cow in regards to marrying whatever
2826760	2828440	you want in the game.
2828440	2831640	Actually we have another announcement speaking of marriages.
2831640	2833340	Okay.
2833340	2837080	This is sent to me by our good friend Ranma.
2837080	2840600	His friend Aaron proposed to his girlfriend today and she said yes, and they're getting
2840600	2841880	married in an anime con.
2841880	2844120	Are they listening to the show?
2844120	2845120	I believe so.
2845120	2850000	Because if they're not listening to the show, I don't give a shit.
2850000	2852640	This is don't give a shit night.
2852640	2860240	I'm trying to be nice and you people are bastards, especially Loki.
2860240	2864200	I just got us on a PM, just want you to know I have a friend of a friend who's taking a
2864200	2865200	dump right now.
2865200	2869840	Did he get married to him?
2869840	2871400	This is about marriage right now.
2871400	2877920	Oh my God, GS68 says, I now pronounce you glasses and staplers.
2877920	2882020	Does this show cause people to want to release or something?
2882020	2883020	It's possible.
2883020	2884020	Okay.
2884020	2887360	Congratulations to Ranma's friend because that's awesome.
2887360	2893760	And by the way, the whole thing with my voice is I'm still horse from California screaming.
2893760	2895920	And congratulations to your other friend's pals.
2895920	2896920	That's amazing.
2896920	2897920	Awesome.
2897920	2904600	Speaking of dump, Shivering Isles, they finally are going to patch the 360 version because
2904600	2909560	the first version kind of took a dump when too many items would get created causing the
2909560	2913080	game to crash and your game saved to delete or something like that.
2913080	2919000	But as you're probably listening to this podcast now or tomorrow if you're listening to it
2919000	2921160	live, there will be a patch.
2921160	2928440	So yay, your expansion will work as it should have when you first downloaded it.
2928440	2931600	Had they tested the damn game, tested the game.
2931600	2932600	That's very important.
2932600	2935680	Don't just release his shit and patch it later.
2935680	2940160	That's all I got.
2940160	2942040	All right.
2942040	2943040	Anyway.
2943040	2950360	Well, now this is a game that I personally don't give a shit about because what?
2950360	2951440	It's the theme.
2951440	2952440	It really is.
2952440	2953800	Whoever it was who said that in chat called it.
2953800	2960400	Well, just because I hate Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, because I know people, I had an ex who
2960400	2967040	would sit around and do nothing but paint his little toys all day.
2967040	2970520	And I understand, you know, some of them are really intricate and it's really cool.
2970520	2972240	And I was like, yeah, you've got a nice hobby.
2972240	2976920	But when all you talk about is Warhammer and you carry around this kit that looks like
2976920	2980360	five massage tables and I'm like, dude, okay, whatever.
2980360	2986960	So anyway, Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning has been delayed in the US and in Europe until
2986960	2990600	first quarter of 2008.
2990600	2991600	So yeah.
2991600	2998840	And in other news, RicePrinceOfAllCosmos PMs me saying, I'm getting married to my diarrhea.
2998840	3000320	You guys are so freaking mature.
3000320	3003720	I was just picking that up.
3003720	3005720	Mature.
3005720	3015920	Speaking of diarrhea, Phantasy Star Universe, Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion.
3015920	3016920	Dear God, why?
3016920	3018240	That game is shit on ice.
3018240	3019640	I actually like that game.
3019640	3021040	Exactly why I used that transition.
3021040	3023040	No, yeah, it wasn't that bad.
3023040	3026440	Well, I think, okay, because I like the old Phantasy Star games, which were really kind
3026440	3028920	of loose and just you running around.
3028920	3029920	Damn it.
3029920	3032040	Loose like the bowels?
3032040	3034360	I should have thought that up before I said that.
3034360	3037080	They were not terrible, okay.
3037080	3041240	There was not much there but battle system and so I grew to like it because I played
3041240	3042240	it too much.
3042240	3043240	So now I like the universe.
3043240	3044240	I think I remember correctly.
3044240	3046480	I don't know if it was something limited or whatever, but I think that you can get this
3046480	3050040	game for like 20 bucks now, which I mean for that price is not that bad.
3050040	3054600	I mean, especially when you consider it does have a single player game portion of it.
3054600	3060080	I mean, so you are getting an actual RPG, which for 20 bucks, that's not bad at all.
3060080	3067640	And this is what you do in said RPG, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y, X, X, Y.
3067640	3068880	That batch of monsters is dead.
3068880	3069880	Let's go to the next zone.
3069880	3070880	Just like every other bow I've ever played.
3070880	3073200	X, X, Y, X, X, Y.
3073200	3076960	It's like all you did in the whole game.
3076960	3077960	That's three buttons.
3077960	3080960	Most RPGs have one attack.
3080960	3084960	So Phantasy Star universe is getting an expansion, it's called Ambition of the Illuminous and
3084960	3088500	I have to confess the first time I read this on a headline, I thought it said abortion
3088500	3090000	of the illuminous.
3090000	3092120	Like I said, I'm not making that up to be stupid or something.
3092120	3093120	I actually read that.
3093120	3094640	I was like, what?
3094640	3095840	Abortion of the illuminous?
3095840	3103240	And it's actually called Ambition of the Illuminous and yeah, that's the title and there's going
3103240	3107960	to be some new weapon types, Medug, Shadug and Whip.
3107960	3113320	And also there'll be new photon arts and yeah, all that new stuff on, I guess there's going
3113320	3114320	to be new planets as well.
3114320	3116380	I don't see how there couldn't be.
3116380	3120440	If you're on Xbox 360, you can download all the good stuff to your system.
3120440	3124320	If you're on the PC or the PlayStation 2, you're going to have to buy a new disc, which
3124320	3127160	seems weird because I would think on the PC you'd be able to download it as well.
3127160	3131420	I mean, PS2, I understand, but PC, hello, oh well.
3131420	3135440	So there it is, abortion of the illuminous coming soon.
3135440	3136440	Abortion of the illuminous.
3136440	3144720	That's so wrong, but anyways, now the brand new Xbox 360 Elite was just released today
3144720	3152520	and if you don't want to buy said system or don't want to buy the expanded 120GB hard
3152520	3160000	drive, which would cost you an extra $179, you could of course hack your current drive
3160000	3164680	for say about $80 and get 120GB as well.
3164680	3171960	And this is done with a Western Digital SATA drive and I believe you need a special program
3171960	3178760	of course to do it called HDD Hacker and if you get those two things, you can create your
3178760	3184200	own 120GB drive for $100 cheaper than you would buying it.
3184200	3189600	I'm just waiting for them to actually have an adapter that you can just plug in there
3189600	3194100	without having to hack the whole drive apart, which I'm sure someone can create if it's
3194100	3197100	not already available, to just do that.
3197100	3199560	Just buy the drive, plug it in, done.
3199560	3205120	Why they don't have that anyways is beyond me.
3205120	3206740	But there you go, save $100.
3206740	3210000	If you're not going to buy an Elite system and just want a larger hard drive, might as
3210000	3211000	well.
3211000	3214200	All right, hacking and cracking.
3214200	3218560	Well, every week DarkSakura likes to look up her own hacking and cracking around the
3218560	3221720	internet and sometimes she stumbles upon to a website that she wants to share with all
3221720	3222860	of you.
3222860	3234680	It's called her Website of the Week and here it is.
3234680	3244920	The Website of the Week is a webcomic that as far as I know is done by a local guy.
3244920	3252320	It's a real life comics and from what I understand, he used to I think buy comics from my husband
3252320	3253320	at the GameStop.
3253320	3255440	He used to live in Rancho Cordova and then he moved to Seattle.
3255440	3260880	Yeah, okay, well he was local then, but it's a pretty cool webcomic as you check it out.
3260880	3268800	The URL is reallifecomics.com, so it's funny, it's good.
3268800	3271520	All right.
3271520	3273920	I think I actually played DDR with that guy once.
3273920	3274920	Yeah, cool.
3274920	3275920	Over in Folsom.
3275920	3276920	Really?
3276920	3278600	Yeah, I didn't realize who he was at the time and then I saw a picture of him on his site
3278600	3280600	like whoa, that guy.
3280600	3283120	Did we ever run into each other playing DDR back in the day?
3283120	3284840	Did you play at Folsom?
3284840	3287520	We had a tournament at Folsom Game Room years ago.
3287520	3288520	Jeez.
3288520	3289520	Years ago.
3289520	3291520	I wondered, do I know you?
3291520	3294800	2001, did we have a tournament over at Folsom Game Room?
3294800	3295800	Back in the day, yeah.
3295800	3296800	Wasn't that Scat?
3296800	3297800	That was Scat.
3297800	3298800	Sacramento's cosplaying tournament.
3298800	3299800	Oh, God.
3299800	3300800	Oh, no, I didn't hear about that.
3300800	3304600	I started playing in 99, 2000, so it might have been around there.
3304600	3305760	Oh, funny.
3305760	3306760	Small world.
3306760	3307760	Small world, jeez.
3307760	3308760	Yeah, exactly.
3308760	3312480	Small is my friend who goes to Denmark to study abroad and runs into a girl who lives
3312480	3316840	down my street, also happens to be in Denmark.
3316840	3317840	Very strange.
3317840	3318840	And they meet and have lunch.
3318840	3322680	All right, well, it is a small world and we want to open up the world to call our show
3322680	3325080	right now on the Skype line.
3325080	3329000	If you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can always
3329000	3331480	give us a call on the old telephone.
3331480	3340320	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll take our calls on Skype.
3340320	3344800	And remember, for those of you kids listening at home, you always go, why is it the same
3344800	3347200	people calling into the show every week?
3347200	3351000	Well, hey, it's an open line, all I got to do is give us a call Sunday.
3351000	3354400	I'll even tell you what, even though we should start taping at 6 o'clock Pacific time, you
3354400	3358120	can actually call at about like 8.30, and that's about the time we open up the lines.
3358120	3359560	So there you have it, 8.30 Pacific time.
3359560	3361560	All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
3361560	3362560	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3362560	3363560	Who's this?
3363560	3364560	Hello.
3364560	3369200	This is the dead goat from the God of War story.
3369200	3373640	Oh, it's the dead goat from the God of War story.
3373640	3376720	Dead goat, do you have a name?
3376720	3378200	My name's Bill.
3378200	3382160	Well, hi, Bill, I'm really sorry to hear about this.
3382160	3386780	I mean, gosh, what are your thoughts on being used as a dead carcass to promote God of War
3386780	3388640	II?
3388640	3389640	I don't know.
3389640	3397480	Before they killed me, I played the first one, and I thought it was pretty cool.
3397480	3402300	But I mean, some goats just get milked and are turned into goat milk, and some goats
3402300	3408040	get turned into burgers in some countries, but you get to be a promotional icon for God
3408040	3409040	of War II.
3409040	3411040	So that's kind of awesome, isn't it?
3411040	3416320	Not really, because they put food in my belly and people ate out of me.
3416320	3419400	I thought that was kind of gross.
3419400	3423640	But you got to hang out with topless women.
3423640	3425440	I couldn't do anything with them.
3425440	3427840	None of them were into goats.
3427840	3430840	It made me so wack.
3430840	3436040	Well, what did you call in to share with our program tonight, dead goat, Bill?
3436040	3440560	I'm actually calling on behalf of Sony.
3440560	3444960	They want me to tell you to buy God of War II if you haven't.
3444960	3447680	Well, I will definitely have to consider that.
3447680	3451680	I mean, it's not every day we get goats talking and calling our stations.
3451680	3453880	Especially from beyond the grave.
3453880	3458280	So shit, on those grounds alone, I might just have to consider it, Bill.
3458280	3461120	Well, thanks for letting me call in.
3461120	3462840	I love listening to your show.
3462840	3463840	No problem.
3463840	3465240	Actually, I have another question.
3465240	3470240	Do you have a cousin or somebody that might be willing to die for our fifth anniversary
3470240	3471240	episode?
3471240	3478440	I'll get back to office, so I don't want to talk about it on the air.
3478440	3479440	All right.
3479440	3481080	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3481080	3482080	Okay.
3482080	3483080	Let us know, Bill.
3483080	3484080	Okay.
3484080	3485080	Thanks, Ryan.
3485080	3486080	All right.
3486080	3487080	Take care.
3487080	3488080	Bye.
3488080	3489080	Bye.
3489080	3490080	Bye.
3490080	3497080	Oh my God, there's tons of stupid people on the internet.
3497080	3499680	What does it cost to get Skype from beyond the grave?
3499680	3501440	That's what I want to know.
3501440	3502680	How do you get Skype in the graveyard?
3502680	3507960	I'm imagining a severed goat head with a little headset on it, tucking into a mic.
3507960	3509360	We need to Photoshop that.
3509360	3511680	They're going, crap, the levels are off.
3511680	3512920	We need to adjust the microphone.
3512920	3513920	That needs to be imagined.
3513920	3514920	It's the guy who called it.
3514920	3515920	It's the Raven's Dolphin.
3515920	3516920	Hi, who's the Raven's Dolphin?
3516920	3519280	Hi, what's on your mind, buddy?
3519280	3520280	I called it.
3520280	3521280	It's a chat room.
3521280	3522280	What?
3522280	3523280	It's a shit show.
3523280	3524280	This is the what?
3524280	3525280	I called it.
3525280	3526840	You don't give a shit tonight.
3526840	3527840	I know.
3527840	3528840	Well, we don't give a shit.
3528840	3532560	Dude, we just had a dead fucking goat call in, okay?
3532560	3535440	What do you call tonight?
3535440	3536440	I'm sorry, Rob.
3536440	3537440	I'm pissing you off.
3537440	3538560	I just want to say I love it.
3538560	3539960	I love the tone.
3539960	3541200	You love the tone tonight?
3541200	3542840	Yeah, I love it.
3542840	3546480	I love that you go like, Kane and Lynch is going to the PS3.
3546480	3548400	I just don't give a shit.
3548400	3550640	Well, I don't know.
3550640	3552440	Maybe our show needs a new spin on it.
3552440	3556560	Maybe, I don't know, maybe Dark Soccer and I rode California Screamin' one too many times
3556560	3560920	and we just got the, you know, giving a shit bone kicked out of us.
3560920	3561920	I don't know.
3561920	3562920	That made me laugh.
3562920	3568880	Everyone was like, oh my God, Kane and Lynch is going multi platform and you can go like,
3568880	3569880	I don't give a shit.
3569880	3572440	Well, I don't know what to tell you.
3572440	3573440	What else is on your mind?
3573440	3575440	Gaming-wise this week, Raven's Dolphin?
3575440	3580000	Well, the Xbox Elite came out today and I think they're last.
3580000	3581000	The what came out?
3581000	3582000	The Elite.
3582000	3585200	Oh, that's right, the Xbox 360 Elite.
3585200	3589240	Did anybody, well, Dark Soccer, you got an Xbox 360 Elite.
3589240	3590240	Yes, I did.
3590240	3591920	Now, what made you want to get one?
3591920	3592920	It wasn't me.
3592920	3593920	It was Dan because our old one died.
3593920	3594920	Oh, that's right.
3594920	3595920	You guys had no one that died.
3595920	3597440	Okay, well, I can see that.
3597440	3600400	Is anybody else interested in getting an Elite here?
3600400	3605960	When my roommates back in San Luis Obispo get an Elite, I will get my 360 back from
3605960	3606960	them.
3606960	3608840	So, I would like someone else to get an Elite.
3608840	3609840	All right.
3609840	3612700	Well, Raven's Dolphin, you're just not interested.
3612700	3613880	You don't think there's nothing.
3613880	3616280	Do you own an Xbox 360 regular?
3616280	3617280	Of course, yes.
3617280	3621880	I own a premium with the nice chrome thing, but I'm not going to taunt you with that.
3621880	3626640	Well, that's, yeah, I only have a mediocre core system, but that's all right.
3626640	3628080	I'm not hurting or anything.
3628080	3631880	So you're just thinking the Elite's not worth the upgrade because you already own one?
3631880	3635560	Yeah, but I feel like, well, hold, now let me hear.
3635560	3641380	I'm going to tell you that I thought the DS Lite was an upgrade.
3641380	3644080	The DS Lite was an upgrade?
3644080	3646560	Yeah, I had a DS Lite and I upgraded to a DS Lite.
3646560	3648560	I thought that was the world.
3648560	3652280	Well, that's different because that's the whole system changing, but with the, you know,
3652280	3656760	with the Xbox 360 Elite, there's not really, besides that whole HDMI cable, there's not
3656760	3657840	that much new to it.
3657840	3658840	You know what I mean?
3658840	3662000	How many of us can actually make use of that HDMI cable?
3662000	3663400	I can't.
3663400	3664400	That's why I don't care.
3664400	3666400	Well, then there you go.
3666400	3667400	All right.
3667400	3668400	All right, let's go.
3668400	3669400	Thank you.
3669400	3670400	No problem.
3670400	3671400	One more thing?
3671400	3675200	This is a great show.
3675200	3677520	I hope you do another bullshit episode.
3677520	3678520	We'll see.
3678520	3679520	We'll see what kind of mood we're in next week.
3679520	3680520	All right.
3680520	3681520	Thanks for the call, Raven's Dolphin.
3681520	3682520	Bye.
3682520	3683520	Later.
3683520	3684520	All right.
3684520	3685520	That was Raven's Dolphin giving us a call.
3685520	3686840	Let's go back to the phones and take another call.
3686840	3689840	If you want to call us, it's username Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
3689840	3690840	Hello.
3690840	3691840	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
3691840	3692840	Who's this?
3692840	3693840	Hi.
3693840	3694840	This is Chris.
3694840	3695840	Hi, Chris.
3695840	3697840	What's on your mind, buddy?
3697840	3698840	Oh, wow.
3698840	3701720	First of all, I just wanted to say I'm glad to show.
3701720	3706320	I'm finally glad I got a chance to be able to talk to you guys.
3706320	3709720	I was going to say, I don't think I've ever heard you call in, so welcome, noob.
3709720	3711720	Welcome to the live experience.
3711720	3715280	Well, actually, I wanted to say I got a Wii today.
3715280	3716280	Ah, congratulations.
3716280	3717280	That's right.
3717280	3719200	Sundays are big days for Wiis.
3719200	3722960	Did you see some report on the internet that said Best Buyer Toys R Us was going to have
3722960	3723960	them?
3723960	3724960	Is that how you got them?
3724960	3725960	No.
3725960	3726960	I actually had a friend from work.
3726960	3730240	He let me in that they were going to have 45 Wiis in today.
3730240	3734840	That was the most they had ever coming at one time.
3734840	3735840	Very cool.
3735840	3736840	Thanks a lot.
3736840	3738400	Did you buy any games for the Wii?
3738400	3740720	No, I didn't.
3740720	3746080	I kind of was just going to try to play the Wii Sports for now, see what that was, maybe
3746080	3747080	rent something.
3747080	3748080	I wasn't really interested in that.
3748080	3756280	I was just shocking that the Elite came out not so long ago, and now they have 45 Wiis
3756280	3757280	coming out.
3757280	3758280	I said they were competing.
3758280	3759280	Okay.
3759280	3760280	That's a good thought.
3760280	3765720	Loki, do you think maybe Nintendo held on to all these Wiis, maybe to have a big push
3765720	3767840	the day the Elite came out?
3767840	3771800	That way, if people were going in and thinking, I'm going to get an Elite, but now they actually
3771800	3772800	have Wiis in stock.
3772800	3774440	Maybe I should get that instead.
3774440	3775440	No.
3775440	3776440	No, you don't think that would happen?
3776440	3777440	I don't think so.
3777440	3778440	All right.
3778440	3780440	Are you interested in the Xbox 360 Elite, Chris?
3780440	3781440	No.
3781440	3785040	I kind of feel they did a student out there.
3785040	3789880	It really isn't a real successor to the original one.
3789880	3793720	So you think that was kind of more of a response to the PlayStation 3 going, well, we have
3793720	3794720	HDMI, MMMMS.
3794720	3798840	So the Xbox 360 and Microsoft was like, well, I guess we'll just put this out there and
3798840	3800080	make Sony shut up.
3800080	3801080	Yeah.
3801080	3803520	I pretty much feel that that's what they all did.
3803520	3809880	Actually, one thing I want to say is because of Ken Kutaragi stepping down, but did Loki
3809880	3811360	have to think about that?
3811360	3814120	What does Loki think of Ken Kutaragi stepping down?
3814120	3818080	It's a step in the right direction, that's for sure.
3818080	3825760	The goat thing, though, is a step in the wrong direction, but I don't know.
3825760	3829680	Getting rid of him talking, that's definitely a good way to go.
3829680	3831800	But what about all the good things Kutaragi did?
3831800	3833880	I mean, wasn't he around for the PlayStation 2 era?
3833880	3835560	I mean, the PlayStation 2 was awesome.
3835560	3840600	He did do one good thing, and that's something that my husband pointed out Friday night,
3840600	3845680	is that he did give us the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.
3845680	3850840	Yeah, but Rob, what about all the good things Old Yeller did?
3850840	3855800	I mean, seriously, you may have loved the dogs so much, but at some point you've got
3855800	3856800	to put them down.
3856800	3859360	And what about all the great things that goat did?
3859360	3863520	No, it's they had to put them down.
3863520	3869120	Rice Prince of all cosmos in the chat room says, put the goat in Kutaragi's place.
3869120	3870920	Sounds like a great idea.
3870920	3873680	All right, well, Chris, anything else on your mind tonight?
3873680	3875880	No, that's basically it.
3875880	3880560	Actually, I want to know which game you think I should get for the Wii.
3880560	3884120	You don't own any games yet for the Wii, and you want to know which game to get.
3884120	3887600	Well, let's see, do you own a PlayStation 2?
3887600	3888600	Yeah.
3888600	3891360	What's your favorite game on PlayStation 2?
3891360	3892760	I would say 2DX.
3892760	3894160	Ah, sure.
3894160	3895160	You're a Bamani fan.
3895160	3899520	Well, definitely, you've got to get DDR Hottest Party when it comes out then on the Wii.
3899520	3904480	In the meantime, I would say check out Zelda Twilight Princess or Super Paper Mario are
3904480	3905800	two of my favorites right now.
3905800	3907920	Anybody care to chime in?
3907920	3909560	What Wii game should Chris get?
3909560	3910560	Excite Truck.
3910560	3911560	If you like Wii.
3911560	3912640	Excite Truck's not bad.
3912640	3914880	I was going to say Excite Truck 2.
3914880	3915880	Does it use a controller?
3915880	3921080	I want to be able to use the Wii remote a little bit more.
3921080	3923240	Yes, all those games.
3923240	3927480	Not so much Super Paper Mario, I mean it does incorporate it a little bit, you do like thuds
3927480	3933320	by shaking the thing, but yeah, Excite Truck, you hold the Wii remote like a normal controller,
3933320	3936960	but you steer with it, like you turn left or right, and that's kind of fun.
3936960	3940320	And then of course Legend of Zelda's all about using that, like you swing it like a sword
3940320	3941520	and all that crazy stuff.
3941520	3942520	Okay.
3942520	3943520	All right, thanks.
3943520	3944520	All right, no problem, Chris.
3944520	3946520	Thanks for calling the show, and call us back sometime.
3946520	3948760	All right, take care.
3948760	3949760	Later.
3949760	3950760	We like new colors.
3950760	3952360	This is a good show.
3952360	3956760	We need to take vacations more often, because we get new guests in the studio, and we get
3956760	3957760	new callers.
3957760	3960840	Not that we don't appreciate the old callers, too.
3960840	3963480	Speaking of which, I think we're going to get one right here with this call.
3963480	3966360	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3966360	3967880	It's Legend of Zaku.
3967880	3970080	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3970080	3972360	What's on your mind, buddy?
3972360	3973360	Nothing much.
3973360	3977680	Just coming back from Queens, playing Papa Nade, and pump it up.
3977680	3978880	I love people calling this show.
3978880	3979880	I go, hey, what's up?
3979880	3980880	Ah, nothing.
3980880	3983720	I just thought I'd call to let you know.
3983720	3984720	I did stuff today.
3984720	3985720	No, I'm just kidding.
3985720	3986880	What do you think of tonight's show?
3986880	3989720	Any stories you want to comment on?
3989720	3992000	You know that they are happening.
3992000	3996840	You know it's official now that the Supernova 2 test location has already been announced
3996840	3997840	for next month.
3997840	4000360	Yeah, I think we posted about it to our own site.
4000360	4002720	Actually, that was my post.
4002720	4003720	Was it?
4003720	4004720	I don't know.
4004720	4005720	Yeah, I configured it.
4005720	4006720	Maybe you submitted it, and we ran it.
4006720	4007720	I don't know.
4007720	4008720	I did.
4008720	4009720	Well, good.
4009720	4014320	Zaku, we should thank you because I was looking at the log today of who links to us, and like
4014320	4017440	two Japanese Bimani sites linked to that story.
4017440	4019840	So you got us a little bit of press over in another country.
4019840	4020840	So good job.
4020840	4021840	Yay.
4021840	4022840	All right.
4022840	4023840	Well, tell us.
4023840	4026160	How did you come across this information about the location test?
4026160	4035360	No, just a random post from other Bimani sites, Bimani style, Air Japan, all the other stuff.
4035360	4044240	Even the original posting in ride19.com, the place for the guy that had tech at Brunswick
4044240	4047640	Zone, I got it from there as well.
4047640	4048640	All right.
4048640	4052320	Since I know you're such a hardcore Bimani and music game fan because you've been listening
4052320	4058000	to us since the day when that's all we talked about on this show, what do you hope is the
4058000	4061580	number one thing they improve on in Supernova 2?
4061580	4066760	Or I guess I'd say either improve on or add to in Supernova 2 versus Supernova 1?
4066760	4067760	Unlockables.
4067760	4068760	Pretty much.
4068760	4071200	You know how DDR Max was back in the day.
4071200	4074520	It only had like 60 songs.
4074520	4077280	It didn't have any returning songs.
4077280	4079480	It just had brand new songs.
4079480	4080800	And there wasn't really that much.
4080800	4086520	And then Max 2 basically revived old songs and added new ones and had an unlock system.
4086520	4087520	Okay.
4087520	4088520	I got you.
4088520	4092040	And it was something like the whole arcade community could kind of work towards, was
4092040	4093040	unlocking all this stuff.
4093040	4094040	Yeah.
4094040	4095040	I mean, think about it.
4095040	4098120	If you really think about it, Supernova was just another litmus test by Konami just to
4098120	4103560	gauge how much interest is still in DDR, especially in the arcades.
4103560	4105760	And we already know the outcome of that.
4105760	4108120	I guess so if we're getting a Supernova 2.
4108120	4109120	Mm-hmm.
4109120	4110120	All right.
4110120	4114600	That and hopefully, you know, they are thinking of, you know, hopefully have something similar
4114600	4120080	to EMUs, you know, something that's not necessarily connected online.
4120080	4125040	Like a card system like Initial D. Yes, exactly like that.
4125040	4126040	Build your own dancer.
4126040	4127480	It'd be fun.
4127480	4128480	Not even that.
4128480	4132400	Just track scores, but, you know, battle people and stuff like that.
4132400	4134520	Buy hot pants for your character.
4134520	4139440	Hopefully, Konami would have at least fixed the memory card slot issue that was absent
4139440	4140440	in Supernova this morning.
4140440	4142960	Totions yelling link support in chat room.
4142960	4143960	Yes.
4143960	4144960	I hope they found a good work-around.
4144960	4145960	That's all I'm saying.
4145960	4148960	Let's see what else is being said in chat here.
4148960	4153360	GS68 says, Supernova 2 needs more original songs that aren't from other Bahmani.
4153360	4155040	Well, that too.
4155040	4159400	I mean, also like revival songs that weren't even, that haven't been revived in a long
4159400	4160400	time.
4160400	4165200	Like, you know, stuff, you know, like Radical Faith, for example, from Fifth Mix.
4165200	4168960	I don't even, it hasn't even been revived at all.
4168960	4170600	You know, stuff like that.
4170600	4174920	Kiki's in chat and says, I love Bahmani, Beatmania and DDR ruined my life.
4174920	4177360	Well, what do you expect?
4177360	4179160	Hey, it ruined my life too.
4179160	4181160	That's how I met Dark Sakura.
4181160	4184960	Hugs and kisses and bunnies.
4184960	4186960	Love you, Rob.
4186960	4188400	What?
4188400	4192800	She just made a little heart motion at me and broke it in half because she hates me.
4192800	4195120	Yes I do.
4195120	4196120	Let's see.
4196120	4199320	James Patrick says, DDR for 360 sold half a million or so.
4199320	4200320	DDR is pretty big.
4200320	4201320	What?
4201320	4202320	500?
4202320	4203320	Really?
4203320	4204320	Where's that sales figure come from?
4204320	4208720	I'll be damned if it reaches a million.
4208720	4209720	That's a lot.
4209720	4210720	And we don't even know when they're jumping.
4210720	4215960	I'm just worried about the day that Konami decides to jump on the PS3 and, you know,
4215960	4220080	for any future DDR mixes, obviously I don't see that happening now since they're going
4220080	4223760	to hold onto the PS2 as long as, as long as possible.
4223760	4226200	There's a big install phase backing it up.
4226200	4227200	All right.
4227200	4229640	Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go, but how far are you going to drive out to the
4229640	4231400	test of Supernova 2?
4231400	4232400	I don't know.
4232400	4233400	Maybe.
4233400	4236800	I don't even know if I, I don't even know if I have vacation time, but I'll probably
4236800	4240760	get, I'll probably get the videos, you know, eventually and I'll see.
4240760	4245520	And hopefully once, once Supernova 2 comes in the city, then I'll be able to decide for
4245520	4246520	myself.
4246520	4247520	All right.
4247520	4248520	Well, good luck with that.
4248520	4249520	Have fun.
4249520	4250520	Okay.
4250520	4251520	All right.
4251520	4252520	Later, dude.
4252520	4253520	Bye.
4253520	4254520	Ah, Zaku's hilarious.
4254520	4255520	He's got the best, best voice.
4255520	4261400	Yeah, this is Colin, talk about Supernova.
4261400	4266120	You wouldn't think someone with a voice like that is so freaking hardcore into the music
4266120	4267120	games.
4267120	4271480	You know, I've learned that people who are hardcore into the music games follow like
4271480	4272760	no rules.
4272760	4276000	When you hear somebody's crazy about it, you have no idea what they're going to be like
4276000	4277240	when you meet them.
4277240	4281440	No, I actually met Zaku in real life at the last OLR meetup in New York city.
4281440	4283840	He's, he's a good kid.
4283840	4286760	We just give him a hard time on the show because he's been listening for a long time and we
4286760	4287760	can.
4287760	4291320	Speaking of New York meetups, it does look like I'm going to be back in New York city
4291320	4292680	the week of June 9th.
4292680	4294760	That's all I'm saying for now.
4294760	4298040	I don't know any details yet, but just kind of keep that FYI.
4298040	4301080	June 9th, I'm looking to be back in New York city, which is good.
4301080	4302080	I love New York city.
4302080	4303080	Love it, love it, love it.
4303080	4306560	So hopefully there'll be some type of tournament or something going on where I can kind of
4306560	4307880	make a, make an appearance.
4307880	4312280	And so that way, you know, we're not flooding the Nintendo world store with people just
4312280	4316360	loitering in the lobby talking about games like we did last time.
4316360	4318400	All right.
4318400	4320440	Let's see.
4320440	4324960	The Rob Dean chat says Sky should come to ASEN with the other OLRites.
4324960	4326480	We'd love to do that if we had the money.
4326480	4330200	I don't think we can, but I think the lesbians are making an appearance, right?
4330200	4331320	Yeah, they'll be there.
4331320	4332320	They're going to ASEN.
4332320	4333680	So the OLR lesbians will be there.
4333680	4335200	So somebody from OLR will make an appearance.
4335200	4338880	I know we have a lot of fans going to ASEN, so look for them.
4338880	4340160	They're going to be passing out OLR flyers.
4340160	4341160	We'll be in front of me.
4341160	4342160	Oh yeah.
4342160	4344240	Hell, we should have announced that at the top of the show.
4344240	4346280	Remind me to announce that at the top of the show next week.
4346280	4348280	We did get confirmed for this year's FONOMAY.
4348280	4354480	We're going to be doing a live show from FONOMAY, the Saturday of FONOMAY at 2 p.m.
4354480	4357440	We only have one panel this year, not two, if I remember right, right?
4357440	4360440	We only have the one, which is fine because we didn't really need two last year.
4360440	4361760	Your panels were booked solid.
4361760	4362760	Yeah, so.
4362760	4363760	We're lucky to get a Saturday.
4363760	4364760	Yeah, that's awesome.
4364760	4365760	That's a good time.
4365760	4369600	So Saturday at two, we'll be there taping one of our shows live, and for that reason
4369600	4374800	we will not be live Memorial Day weekend because some folks will be staying at FONOMAY.
4374800	4375800	I have other commitments.
4375800	4380160	I'm going to be going to FONOMAY for like a day and a half, but then I have other commitments,
4380160	4381160	so we'll see.
4381160	4382160	All right.
4382160	4386520	I am actually, if things go well, I'm actually going to be hosting, well, co-hosting with
4386520	4391720	the rest, but probably emceeing for a movie, midnight movie thing going on in San Francisco
4391720	4396360	I'm very excited about because that's a thing I'm like really into is bad movies like Rocky
4396360	4397680	Horror and all that.
4397680	4398680	Excellent.
4398680	4404560	So, I guess that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line, and let's ask right now if there's
4404560	4408520	any last minute stories anyone in the studio would like to share.
4408520	4412460	Well, something interesting you should know.
4412460	4419380	The Dragon's Lair Blu-ray has finally made it out, I guess, and a review on IGN saying
4419380	4424720	that you can't play the game normally because of some error in the blue, was it the Blu-ray
4424720	4428080	Java or whatever, the BD Java.
4428080	4431320	It will only allow you to play the game in unlimited lives mode.
4431320	4437880	There used to be one for five lives option or whatever, but you can't do it, so ha.
4437880	4443640	Some other fun stuff, I don't know if anyone caught it this weekend, but they had the announcement
4443640	4450940	for Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare, and it looks pretty fucking awesome, and of course
4450940	4458320	Tom Clancy's End War, which is supposed to be an online persistent war, you're basically
4458320	4464120	going to be able to command groups of troops and stuff and kill each other.
4464120	4469960	So, that's kind of neat, and let's see what else, oh, Lego Star Wars 2 and Saints Row
4469960	4476480	have joined the Platinum Collection, or Platinum Hits, I guess, on the 360, so now both of
4476480	4477920	those games are available for $29.99.
4477920	4481480	Oh, maybe I'll get Saints Row now, finally.
4481480	4482480	Saints Row is fucking awesome.
4482480	4484000	I know, I've been hearing so much good stuff about the game and I never bought it, so maybe
4484000	4485400	I will now.
4485400	4492480	There's a rumor that Dead or Alive and Disgaea are coming to the PS3.
4492480	4493480	That's kind of interesting, I guess.
4493480	4498160	I know it was a new Disgaea game coming out, I thought, or maybe that's called the stuff
4498160	4501480	that I'm thinking.
4501480	4509680	Let's see, what else do we have here?
4509680	4511960	I think that was pretty much it.
4511960	4512960	Yeah.
4512960	4513960	Alright.
4513960	4516200	Dark Sakura, you got anything?
4516200	4517200	Any last minute stories?
4517200	4518200	No.
4518200	4519200	Oh, alright.
4519200	4524000	I guess that does it then for tonight, so Warrior Bob, you got anything you'd like to
4524000	4526000	read about?
4526000	4531640	So the show I used to co-host, pressstart.thefighting.org.
4531640	4532640	Are they still on?
4532640	4533640	Yeah, they still are.
4533640	4534640	I've just left.
4534640	4538720	I Skype in now and again, but first I want to plug them second.
4538720	4544080	I want to make fun of the co-host, Justin, for not updating yet this week, so ha, that's
4544080	4545080	our news.
4545080	4548080	Also, 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem Forever being announced.
4548080	4550360	Ah, yes, that's right.
4550360	4552600	That's coming up, what, Friday, when they officially announced it?
4552600	4553600	Two days ago.
4553600	4554600	Oh, two days ago.
4554600	4555600	I think so.
4555600	4559040	Ah, yeah, we'll be seeing that game, I'm sure.
4559040	4563080	Didn't they say last year, like, for sure you will have this game by December 31st or,
4563080	4564080	you know, weird.
4564080	4565680	Oh, I think they said it'll be done when it's done.
4565680	4567760	They want to make a good game, and if it takes that long, it'll take that long.
4567760	4568760	I guess so.
4568760	4572400	This game better do my dishes, that's all I have to say, it better be that freaking
4572400	4573400	good.
4573400	4574400	I mean, they named it after the development time.
4574400	4575400	That was innovative, right?
4575400	4576400	I guess so.
4576400	4577400	Alright.
4577400	4580400	I guess that's it.
4580400	4583440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4583440	4586600	Here, Bob, thanks so much for being here, and I hope you enjoyed your first show.
4586600	4589800	The only guest who ever brought their own mic, that's pretty impressive, oh, wait, I
4589800	4593080	take that back, because I believe DDR Angel actually brought this mic when she came with
4593080	4594080	it.
4594080	4595080	So you're the second guest to ever bring their own mic.
4595080	4597880	Well, now that one's Dark Sakura's mic, and this one's still mine.
4597880	4598880	That's true.
4598880	4601420	She ended up giving hers away, and we haven't heard from her in a long time, I hope she's
4601420	4602420	doing well.
4602420	4605800	But yeah, you got your mic there, so anyway, thanks for being on the show.
4605800	4606800	Thank you for having me.
4606800	4607800	It's been a pleasure.
4607800	4611720	Awesome radio voice, chat loves you guys, chat room loves you and wants you to come
4611720	4612720	back.
4612720	4613720	I love chat.
4613720	4614720	Make sure you do come back soon.
4614720	4615720	Thank you very much.
4615720	4616720	No problem.
4616720	4617720	Final thought.
4617720	4618720	Oh, that was my final thought.
4618720	4619720	Thank you for having me.
4619720	4620720	All right.
4620720	4621720	There you go.
4621720	4622720	Good enough.
4622720	4623720	My final thought.
4623720	4630880	My final thought is garlic is delicious and keeps the vampires away.
4630880	4632920	Loki, your final thought.
4632920	4639720	Apparently Blizzard's going to be announcing a new next-gen MMO and Starcraft 2 as well.
4639720	4641600	Wouldn't that be one and the same?
4641600	4644880	No, they're going to be two different games.
4644880	4648960	My final thought is I want to open a laser tag arena.
4648960	4650760	It costs money and I don't have money.
4650760	4653760	That's my new final thought is I want you to open a laser tag arena.
4653760	4655000	Me too.
4655000	4659240	Dark Sakura, last but certainly not least, your final thought.
4659240	4660240	Reject false icons.
4660240	4663180	It's been a while since you've had that as your final thought.
4663180	4665080	It's good to see it make a comeback.
4665080	4669000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
4669000	4674600	Without you guys, we would die.
4674600	4677440	Independent podcasts across the world would just turn out like that goat.
4677440	4680320	It's you guys that help support us.
4680320	4683040	If you like what you hear, all we ask is to tell two friends.
4683040	4684720	They don't even have to be friends.
4684720	4688720	Tell enemies about the program because then that's two more people that will listen to
4688720	4692840	us and help us grow and slowly we can take over the world.
4692840	4697160	If you have no friends or even if you do have friends and you just want to help us even
4697160	4703460	more, you can always leave us some kind words over on iTunes or Yahoo podcasts or podcast
4703460	4707640	alley or any of those sites that are like, hey, rate your favorite podcast because then
4707640	4711240	we'll put them higher on the listing and then more people will bother to look at it.
4711240	4717680	If you really, really like us and you can do it, you'll send us invitations to E3.
4717680	4718680	That's also a good idea.
4718680	4722440	On behalf of the whole crew here, have a great week.
4722440	4723880	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
