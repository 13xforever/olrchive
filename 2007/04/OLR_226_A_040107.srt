00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jamie Summers

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yo

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How you doing Jamie?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My nose is full of goo

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Gross

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Also joining us tonight say hello to Tech Master Loki

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How you doing Loki?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm doing good

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright we have some special guests in the studio tonight

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They helped us out with our little April Fools joke tonight

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you didn't check it out the reason why you may not have gotten it

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is because we are going to push the April Fools joke show

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Right around the same time we push out this show

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So iTunes may not catch it but we wanted to build it that way

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So that you know those folks that want to skip through the April Fools joke

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Cause you know April Fools is lame or whatever can do that

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But those that want to hear what a really funny job Chris and Megsy

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And well myself and everybody else did with that can hear it

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So there you have it Chris is here tonight everybody

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hi Rob

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And she is a lesbian but not the giggling type

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No I'm not

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well once in a while if I tell a funny joke she might giggle

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah laugh like a hyena is more like it

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Alright and joining us all the way from Wisconsin say hello to Megsy

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How you doing Megsy?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm okay

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thanks for your help with the show earlier appreciate it

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh hi

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hi

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something so

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah I'm looking at porn

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hot are you down low on lesbian porn on my Mac?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hells yeah

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hot right

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well anyway again you know our April Fools joke was all in good fun

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you don't know what it is yet go back in the podcast archive and check it out

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just a little bit of a disclaimer first though

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because we want to say that it is April Fools day today

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So we've been trying to be very careful in what stories we picked out tonight

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We didn't take any extra submissions for our show roll after last night

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And we're not going to be accepting any last minute submissions through our chat room today

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As we usually do just because we're going to try to keep it as legitimate as possible

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
First off also we did our gaming weeks in the previous show

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I want to see if anybody wanted to expand on that

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because I know we were being a little silly in the April Fools show

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Does anybody have anything they want to say in their gaming week that they didn't say in the previous show?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I really didn't get a pin bot

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Aww I'm sorry to hear pin bot sounds awesome though

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know you weren't here last week we missed you

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I had the plague, the disease

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I totally thought of you and I wish I could have stole it for you

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I has played one

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
At California Extreme or whatever they call it?

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yep

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to go to that this year sounds hot

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was great

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Anything you wanted to add Loki?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's kind of cool

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's like a shoot em up game I guess

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But it's fun we're checking it out it's a free download

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if you want the link to it check that out

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But you got to be a friend

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
community.allgames.com

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You got to be one of my friends and I'll be able to get the link

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So there you go

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you should check it out

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's just an awesome game

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's all I meant

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Of course

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Alright

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My gaming week what I really played

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But with a listener of the program not a stupid boy

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We were cracking each other up

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But I also played a lot of Castlevania 70 of the night

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Just trying to make my way through that

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Which of course I love

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You know what I surprisingly liked a lot though

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is Jetpack Refueled I didn't think I'd like this game

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Because I thought it looked a little cheesy

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I think that's kind of why I like it

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is because it really does remind me of

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know an old Commodore 64 type game

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which you know well it kind of was

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So but it's the type of game I totally grew up on

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And they really did give it an overhaul

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For Xbox 360

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know it's only five bucks

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think it's a good like

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Like an 80's arcade type game

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's just that instead of getting the same old

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Root Beer Tapper, Joust those type of games

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like something you may not have played before

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's kind of fun

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet though

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But for five bucks honestly so far

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not a bad deal

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I apologize about my voice

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And to the chatters in our chat room

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
At chat.orangelandradio.com

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who say I still sound like a woman

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
From the previous show

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Screw you I have no voice left

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
From yelling a lot last night

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I was at Rocky Horror MCing

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I have like no voice

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been drinking hot tea all night

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To try and make myself feel better

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chris is amazing

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh I'm sorry Tetris Evolution

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I also bought

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And hey it's Tetris

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
$30 not a bad deal

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Pretty easy achievement points

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All things considered

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Online play is like you remember it

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
On the Game Boy version

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know why they didn't do it as an

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Xbox Live Arcade title

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know I think a lot of people are going to be wondering that

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because yes you can have videos

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And they're high def pretty videos

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can't randomize them which is kind of weird

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And they do have music included

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But I've actually found the way I enjoy listening

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
To the game is I use the

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
XB stream program to grab

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Podcasts and I'll play Tetris while

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As a podcast like I don't know

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Either you know our show if I want to

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nelson or something you know

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And it's kind of fun so

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah $30 not a bad deal but I think it'll be

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In your bargain bin soon

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Chris make see anything you guys want to add

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've played Animal Crossing

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Animal Crossing on DS? Yeah on the plane

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
On the plane how was that we can't you didn't use the

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Wi-Fi though on the plane did you? Of course not

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No but I haven't played for like

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Three months and everybody in my village was like

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Bitch I invited you to tea like

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Five months ago

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I'm like I'm sorry and there was like

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A gajillion weeds and I had a bunch of

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mail and it was a mess but I cleaned it up

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
All the way from Madison to

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Here

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It would be that long to clean up your village

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Kind of and then make everybody not mad at me

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Anymore

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Alright well good times

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I wonder if there's like a still

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I guess there probably still is a real active

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Animal Crossing community online cause I was thinking

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Wow if I just got the game now like most people

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I know quit playing that a long time ago

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So there would be nobody left to visit my village

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I guess there's still a pretty active

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Community online somewhere huh

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Chris anything you want to add

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well I actually really did play

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
World of Warcraft cause it's the only game

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fuck you

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I had to spend a lot of time waiting

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
For Meg Z to get here so I did that by playing

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow although I did it more as an experiment

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have found if you go to any of the major

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Areas where there are lots of people in traffic

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And you have a girl character

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And you start making her dance

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Watch how many guys

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Decide to join in it's very

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Funny it doesn't even matter

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not when you're a tauren I'm finding out

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cause nobody wants to dance with a cow

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I like to dance with a cow

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It works well with the elves and sometimes

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The humans just cause there's a lot of traffic

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It is

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Especially when you're sitting there knowing wow these guys have no clue

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah really

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like some guy asked me ASL and I said

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mail

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I said mail 42 Arizona

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And he walked away

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Awesome

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was very funny

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's in our chat saying I'm going to make a draenei

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Dude the draenei chicks are hot

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They are

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh my god I'd bang those if I could

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know I might be gay and all but even I think the draenei

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Chicks are hot what can I say

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just like their accent

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Not enough rage

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Alright so there it is conclusion of our gaming weeks

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So um

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's do some real brief housekeeping here

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have to keep this a little bit vague

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We were going to say a little more about it

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Obviously it pains us

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Journalistically

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
To have to go back and remove

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Something that used to

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Be there before

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Trust me we did not enjoy doing that

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We didn't want to do it

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We kind of had to do it

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Unfortunately Orange Lounge Radio

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Is a hobby for us

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it doesn't pay the bills

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Push comes to shove

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Things got to change

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We also believe in karma

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What goes around comes around

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think what we do here is really great

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
For the community and we give a lot of

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Publicity to a lot of

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Great up and coming games

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We don't get paid for it

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They don't pay for us to talk about their games

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I guess the only impression we can take away from this

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is that

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If a company doesn't want us to talk about their games

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I guess there's a lot of other

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dependent games that aren't getting enough exposure

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That we should maybe be spending our time talking about

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A little more like to Miki Fighters

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Miki Fighters

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's fun, it's free

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a good price

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We've certainly been spending a lot of time this week

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kind of reassessing I don't want to go about doing things

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Still be the same Orange Lounge Radio

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know and love

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's get into some news

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Game Stuff have their

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Financial conference call

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I guess their investor

273
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Conference call

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The COO Dan D'Amato

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I think that's how you pronounce his name

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Was talking a little bit about the crippling

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Wii shortage that's been

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Kind of happening ever since the system came out

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And particularly bad

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You know with this month

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Or I should say last month

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
March

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He was quoted saying I don't think it's going to be

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
An issue going forward

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I think this is just my

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is just my opinion but I think Nintendo

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Essentially dried up the supply

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because they made their numbers for the year

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The new year starts April 1st

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I think we're going to see the supply flowing

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Now

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's interesting of course

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Nintendo responded to that saying

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No that's not true they never intended

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
For you know shortage to actually happen

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You know so on and so forth of course

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know my opinion on that is

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I mean if they're really drying up the

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know the sources on purpose

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They're not going to go yeah we're holding them back

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because we hit our numbers for the year so

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sorry if you can't get one

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean that's just going to piss people off

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So anyways

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You know long story short

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know you know

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But I know that the systems haven't been in stores

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
For a long time and I know

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You know at least distribution

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
As a whole hasn't been able to

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get a hold of them for

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The month of March I mean they pretty much

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You know

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Allocated everything to retail

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So what little there was in retail I don't know

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If it's because they did it intentionally

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or if it was just they're

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Really behind and they really

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Can't make enough you know

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Either way

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hopefully it'll start getting better in April

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
April fools

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No just kidding

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What I'm wondering though is and this is something I've been kind of wondering

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
About this week is that I seem to remember

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Last year obviously Xbox 360

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Had some real shortage problems as well

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And we were pretty harsh

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
With the Xbox 360 and Microsoft

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And you know why the F aren't there more systems out there

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And blah blah blah blah

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It seems like we've been a little more forgiving

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Of Nintendo through all this and I'm trying to figure out

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why that is is that because they just they have

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
More consoles out there on the market

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So that those of us diehards that really

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or is that because we were smarter about it this time

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When we all camped out and got them or whatever

343
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think we were just a little bit smarter about it

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And also the fact that I mean

345
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The 360

346
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Was like kind of the first next gen console

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So it was like something you really had to have it

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You know a lot of times now it's like

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well the Wii's not out oh well I'll just play my

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
360 or I'll just play my Playstation 2

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or something like that until it comes out

352
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's really and also it'd be a little

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Different if Super Mario Galaxy

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Was out there now

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Versus you know later or Smash Brothers

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know Brawl or something like that

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If that stuff was out there now

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know that'd be a little bit different but I

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean personally I don't

360
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But to be honest Perfect Dark Zero is nothing to get that

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Excited about for me I mean and the Xbox

362
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Launch games were nothing like oh I gotta have it

363
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
True and

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I just wanted the system as a whole you know

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know the download

366
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The live I don't know I just wanted the damn thing

367
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A year ago you know and I was frustrated when I couldn't

368
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Get one I would think it'd be pretty dumb even

369
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If they are hitting their numbers to

370
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know intentionally drive the market

371
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't think that's even I mean I just think

372
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They just can't produce enough of these I mean

373
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's even the issue with their accessories

374
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean that's kind of a good you know point right there

375
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That they just don't have enough accessories

376
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Out there even to

377
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know fill the market and you can't

378
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Tell me that that stuff's hard to produce

379
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I mean come on

380
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I guess I'm just wondering aloud here

381
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are we being fair

382
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
To Nintendo like

383
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The same way

385
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Fuck no they should be getting more systems out there

386
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Some goddamn technology has been out forever

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean with the goddamn GameCube

388
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Produce more fucking systems

389
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And Dustcap in our chat room agrees with you

390
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube

391
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Version 2

392
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SSJ100Matt wants to know how long did the 360

393
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Shortage last I got mine in February

394
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I think it was May

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It was May yeah

396
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I work at Gamestop it lasted until about

397
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Mid March April

398
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You could walk into a store I think I saw

399
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The first available one around the end of January

400
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But seriously though

401
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They need to get on top of

402
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
At least the systems out there

403
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean okay great

404
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They want to keep the demand up or something like that

405
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think the demand's up there

406
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
People want to buy this thing and if it's any

407
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Kind of indicator

408
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean you basically show your friends this

409
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Game system if they don't have it yet

410
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
After playing with it for a little bit

411
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They're just like God I gotta get one of my own

412
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I would think you'd want as many systems out there

413
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
As possible to get as many impressions as possible

414
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
To sell even more systems

415
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Which in turn you sell more software and make more money

416
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So I don't think they're doing it on purpose

417
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I mean

418
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Everyone's kind of running with this

419
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know before because it was the CEO

420
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's his opinion and

421
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's it I mean it's as valid as my opinion

422
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I don't know

423
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We don't know you can only speculate

424
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
All that matters is

425
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's April now more systems in stores

426
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well at least

427
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We do have some good news

428
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And this is no joke

429
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Nintendo and Sega

430
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Have both stated

431
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That Miyamoto is going

432
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
To be part of the development

433
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Of Mario and Sonic

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
At the Olympic Games

435
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So

436
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They're actually talking specifically

437
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That there are going to be

438
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Not just that there's a number of different titles

439
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
From what I'm seeing anyway

440
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But the game is being

441
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Created by Sega with work by Miyamoto

442
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry

443
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When it comes down to like the 500 meter dash

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Or whatever the hell it is

445
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario

446
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Mario's a big fat plumber

447
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Tear his ass open

448
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Who lives on a diet of mushrooms

449
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Megsy's pointing at her shirt

450
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Getting upset because she's wearing flying Mario

451
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay but in defense

452
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to

453
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The high jump and shit like that because he's got hops

454
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But fucking Sonic will beat him

455
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?

456
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah

457
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Well Sonic can go faster

458
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Than the god damn speed of sound

459
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So there

460
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think

461
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Mario will also have Sonic

462
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Beat in the ability

463
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To make a good next gen

464
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Game competition

465
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But you know who will win?

466
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Nintendo and Sega

467
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because they have tricked you into

468
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Buying a god damn olympics game

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If history

470
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Have shown you anything

471
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Olympics games suck

472
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Really bad

473
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So

474
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Personally I don't know

475
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If this gets you interested in the olympics

476
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hooray I'm not falling for it

477
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I ain't buying this shit

478
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's see I'm looking at chat room

479
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Funny deal had a really quick comment on the last story

480
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now

481
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And fans keep buying their bullshit

482
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage

483
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Or the Nintendo 64 shortages?

484
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No you must be old

485
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No I'm just kidding

486
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I wasn't really following gaming back then

487
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
As closely as I am now

488
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I mean a little bit but I was much younger

489
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And a lot of that didn't sink in like it does now

490
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's see

491
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Also moving on here

492
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
MooMooCannogram says

493
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
DarkSakura

494
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Y'all know that there are other characters in the game

495
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well I would say yeah

496
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But Mario and Sonic being in the same game

497
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Is kind of news worthy

498
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So what if there's other characters

499
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Just seeing Miyamoto with Sonic

500
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is weird

501
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It doesn't matter who else is in the game

502
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
To some extent really

503
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Alright

504
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well moving on to

505
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Something that did not turn out to be an April Fools

506
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Joke and I told you it wasn't

507
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you want to go back a couple weeks I said

508
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Look I know something you don't know

509
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But this Knights thing is not bullshit

510
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And sure enough

511
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's not bullshit

512
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
A magazine cover was leaked out of

513
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I believe this is Sweden

514
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This games magazine

515
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Game Reactor put this image up on the internet

516
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then of course it caught wildfire

517
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image

518
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Of Knights but there it is

519
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
A world exclusive on Knights

520
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I'm sure they just beat the punch

521
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
To some American publication

522
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Just going to have the same thing

523
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
As previously in the teaser thing

524
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And I was going to say there's also been screenshots out there now too

525
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So it looks kind of cool

526
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now here's a question though

527
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know Sonic games as of late

528
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Ever since the Dreamcast

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Have not been that great

530
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So is this

531
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sega's chance to redeem themselves

532
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Or should we just

533
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment

534
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I want another Clockwork Knights

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Dark Soccer

536
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I know you've been a long time Sonic fan

537
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But what are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii

538
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do you think they can make a good one?

539
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What if it turns out

540
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like Sonic on 360 and PS3

541
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It can't, it's on the Wii

542
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You think that will be it saving grace?

543
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
WEEEEEE

544
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Be honest

545
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog

546
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Control issues won't be

547
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That big of a problem

548
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I hope

549
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We'll see

550
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well there it is

551
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,440
Um, not to say told you so, but, but yeah, Maisie, wait, wait, before we get to the next

552
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
story, Maisie, you're squeaking over there.

553
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,320
What I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie as a Knights fan girl, I mean, could, Sega's

554
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,480
kind of done a lot of misfires lately.

555
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,980
What, what's going to stop them from misfiring this one?

556
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,560
Because it's Knights.

557
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,240
But Sonic was cool and Sonic on PlayStation three and 360 was not fun.

558
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Okay.

559
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
That's Sonic.

560
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,280
Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.

561
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
You know what?

562
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,520
It will be, it will be good because it is Knights period.

563
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,000
But okay, Mario is missing had Mario in it and it wasn't that much fun.

564
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Mario was missing was the shit.

565
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
You're just easy to please.

566
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't know.

567
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,400
There's no, I don't know what else to think.

568
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,080
Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?

569
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,880
I said, you have no idea.

570
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,080
Ooh, la la.

571
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:17,280
In that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it, the E3 event or E3 like

572
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,560
event that you can go to because it's open to the public, God help us all.

573
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,360
Um, anyways, so one reason you're probably gonna want to go there other than the fact

574
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,320
that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to

575
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,640
be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of, um, huge lineup.

576
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,760
Hopefully by that time we'll see, you know, the big, you know, Super Mario Galaxy and

577
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,680
Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.

578
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,880
But um, it should be interesting.

579
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,040
I know, especially if they're on board then, you know, it's likely other people will jump

580
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,280
on board as well.

581
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,920
So anyways, E for everyone or E for all, it's going to be coming October in LA, same place

582
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,800
as the original E3 and only $100 to get in.

583
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,040
And there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.

584
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Wow.

585
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,160
That's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.

586
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,480
I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there.

587
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
You know what?

588
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,280
I have to admit I'm interested.

589
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,040
I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.

590
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,200
I think I'm, I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.

591
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,240
200,000 people in half the exhibition space.

592
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah.

593
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
That's going to be very uncomfortable.

594
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I don't know.

595
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.

596
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't know.

597
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,440
That is a very lofty goal, but E3 was crowded as it is.

598
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,920
I mean, I don't know, but I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because

599
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600
we did not feel the love.

600
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
reason it didn't happen.

602
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,840
I don't know what possibly went wrong there, but yeah, we're not going to E3.

603
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,400
Well, I'm not, Loki's not.

604
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,160
You know, you know, I am, you know, you know, you know, when E3 started going, going down,

605
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,080
you know, you know, it was the mark of it, of it starting to go down because they got

606
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,000
rid of the booth, babes, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

607
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't know.

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Going down was having to fight my way around the crowd.

609
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
That's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.

610
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,780
That is that's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark when Paris Hilton was getting those

611
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,160
kinds of lines at E3.

612
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,720
I was like, what's wrong with this picture?

613
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,160
This is it, but the booth babes, well, there'll be booth babes at E4 all.

614
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm sure.

615
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
There you go.

616
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Are you going to go to E4 all?

617
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Maybe.

618
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't know.

619
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm thinking about it.

620
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
She says, no, I don't know.

621
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I want to know a little more about it.

622
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,240
Like what is the, I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be

623
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
the must have?

624
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Yeah.

625
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
I mean, seriously, am I going to pay a hundred dollars to wait five hours to play a game?

626
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,200
I mean, seriously, there's 200,000.

627
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,680
If 200,000 people actually are, first of all, I don't know that that could actually work,

628
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,920
especially with like fire codes and stuff, but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000

629
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,760
people in there as it was last year with E3, 70,000 people, I believe.

630
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
And it was fucking crowded.

631
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,480
And now you have half the space and more than double the people.

632
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Fuck that.

633
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,280
Uh, JVMON says 200,000 could be a typo.

634
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,320
Maybe they meant to say 20,000, which is a bad, and that's not a bad, that's not a bad

635
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,440
showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.

636
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,440
You know, if they can pull off 20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first

637
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
year out the gate.

638
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
So, well, we'll see.

639
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
Best of luck to E4ALL.

640
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,960
And um, I think I'm going to go, I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it, but

641
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I want to go.

642
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,280
I want to go to E3 though, but yeah, well, we don't always get what we want sadly.

643
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,000
Like I said, you know, we give free publicity, we give free publicity to games on this show.

644
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,180
So if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your

645
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,880
work cut out for you, Jamie.

646
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
Hey, I'm amazing.

647
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?

648
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,080
Like we did last year.

649
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Chirp.

650
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,720
So guess what's not live?

651
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Zombies.

652
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,940
They're in Resident Evil.

653
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,040
My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.

654
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
That's okay.

655
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,520
I'm going to.

656
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Hey.

657
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,640
So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?

658
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,680
It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii is going to be at 480p progressive

659
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,000
scan 16 to 9 widescreen.

660
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Isn't that great?

661
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,520
Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this

662
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
or whatever.

663
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,920
I mean, hooray for, you know, it doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.

664
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,920
It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.

665
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,320
There will be after the Capcom Gamers' Day thing, which was, I think, I think that's

666
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,160
like in the next couple of weeks here.

667
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,760
There's been mumblings that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for

668
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,760
the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers' Day, because

669
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,520
they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?

670
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Yeah.

671
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.

672
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
That's true.

673
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,320
All right, well, we do know some things that are coming out.

674
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,600
Well, I guess it is still a little bit of a rumor, but these have a lot more foundation

675
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,440
to them, and that would be Final Fight and Street Fighter II Turbo making an appearance

676
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
on the Virtual Console.

677
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,000
We know this because it has shown up on the ESRB's list of clear titles.

678
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,240
Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter II Turbo is going to be making its way to

679
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,720
Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter II just came out not that long ago.

680
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,320
It's kind of like, obviously, Street Fighter II Turbo was the superior game.

681
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't know why anyone would want to have both.

682
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,960
At least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between

683
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,760
the games, but now it's kind of like, sucker.

684
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,360
You still can't play it online, but if you want to relive it in all its Super Nintendo

685
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,440
glory, you have that ability.

686
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,960
Final Fight, by the way, sucked on Super Nintendo, I thought, because it-

687
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Booze!

688
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I have all those games.

689
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
But it didn't have Guy in it, and yes-

690
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,800
I have Final Fight Guy.

691
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,960
But in Final Fight Guy, it didn't have Cody in it.

692
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,000
It's like they just replaced the sprites or whatever.

693
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No they didn't.

694
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And there was like stages missing.

695
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,120
He had his moves.

696
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,320
That's why it was all about Final Fight CD.

697
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,600
Or yeah, or just Final Fight Arcade, you know, I don't know.

698
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,160
I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console, but these are a little

699
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,280
more exciting, other Virtual Console releases, because Hudson updated an official list, so

700
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,080
we know these will be happening for sure, Bonk's Revenge, which I assume comes as a

701
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,880
surprise to no one, will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console.

702
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,760
Also Bravo Man, Shock Man, and Battle Lode Runner, which is kind of cool, because Lode

703
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,960
Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love, and I have to be honest, I'm

704
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,460
not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting

705
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,080
very excited over this game, so it must be good.

706
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,480
You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.

707
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Do you know Battle Lode Runner?

708
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
I remember.

709
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I totally know.

710
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Hmm.

711
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Interesting.

712
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.

713
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

714
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,560
Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week, and we've

715
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,640
got some good stuff coming out in the US.

716
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,960
It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2,

717
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,720
we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.

718
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,600
It's kind of a good kid's game, I guess.

719
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,680
If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones,

720
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,000
or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.

721
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,120
I have a random question.

722
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
Can you use a Karaoke Revolution mic with these games?

723
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
No.

724
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Bastards.

725
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,640
But hey, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of

726
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,120
them, and it's the normal price of karaoke revolutions.

727
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Well, I know.

728
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,160
I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but you know.

729
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,720
Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.

730
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Anyways.

731
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,480
I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.

732
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Yeah.

733
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,040
Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that

734
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,680
got ported over, and it's very, very cheap.

735
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:29,320
Let's see, PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, that is also coming out on the Wii, and Pimp

736
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,400
My Ride will be making its way out on the PSP as well.

737
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,480
I don't know if you should be too excited about that.

738
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,240
Rapala Trophies, if you're into bass fishing, hooray, on the 360.

739
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,700
On the PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, which should be pretty cool.

740
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,080
Same damn game as before, I believe they added maybe a few things to it.

741
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,960
And let's see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, I already said that.

742
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,760
Let's see, Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out, also ported the GameCube

743
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,960
game.

744
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:10,360
Let's see, on PC, The Sims 2 Celebration, that looks kind of neat, and a bunch of other

745
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,520
crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way,

746
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,680
and actually, Locomania sounds kind of fun.

747
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,400
That might be kind of neat.

748
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,240
And then, let's see, on the DS, Cake Mania, and Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales,

749
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,500
that should be pretty cool.

750
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,360
And then, finally, the game, probably going to be picking up this week, Guitar Hero 2,

751
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,080
making its way to the 360, so, pretty awesome.

752
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,760
I thought you were getting my copy early, what happened?

753
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,840
Comes out Wednesday.

754
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm working on it.

755
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,760
Pull through for me, I have to be the coolest kid on the block, and have it before anyone

756
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
else.

757
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,000
What do you mean you have it?

758
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,440
You're a liar, April Fools, Magsy, full of lies and loos.

759
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,560
Just get heart, love ya.

760
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,800
Well let's move on to more release dates.

761
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
How about the UK?

762
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,960
Well here's what we've got coming out, on the 5th we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords,

763
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,080
we also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360, on the 6th we have Frontline Fields of

764
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:31,160
Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and the Red Star on PS2.

765
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,280
I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.

766
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,840
What's that about?

767
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,440
I just remember it was shooting stuff, and I like guns.

768
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,320
It's an old acclaimed game that finally got published, and it's being made into a movie,

769
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,400
it's based off of a comic book series as well.

770
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah, what he said.

771
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Alrighty.

772
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,440
Well, moving on over to Japan and checking out what's on their release date schedule.

773
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,300
Cold Set Saga is getting an updated version out in Japan this week, which I think is kind

774
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
of interesting.

775
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,880
I thought the game had already come out, but it looks like they're getting an updated version.

776
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm not sure what exactly they've updated, but there you have it.

777
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,240
If you're a Cold Set fan, I'm sure you're going to want to pick that up.

778
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,180
Also coming out, Championship Manager 2007 in the Asian territories.

779
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,200
On the Nintendo Wii, Barnyard comes out in Japan.

780
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,900
I'm not sure if this is a game we already have here.

781
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,240
I think it is.

782
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Is it based on the movie?

783
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
It is, yeah.

784
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Blech.

785
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have

786
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
a ball.

787
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,040
PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into

788
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,960
Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.

789
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:49,240
Netsuchuu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachi Slots Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love

790
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
your pachinko.

791
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,080
It looks like some sexy ladies there.

792
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Actually, wait.

793
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,200
I don't know, though.

794
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,720
That might actually be just a slot machine game.

795
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,080
Maybe that's why they go on pachi slots.

796
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,360
I'm sure they've got pachinko in it, too, though.

797
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Come on.

798
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
It's a gambling sim.

799
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,400
A gambling sim with sexy ladies.

800
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,800
I've never played pachinko.

801
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,520
Can you explain pachinko to me?

802
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,840
How exactly does it work?

803
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I have no fucking clue.

804
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,240
But you played it?

805
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,760
I was in Japan, and they told me, you've got to play pachinko, because it's one of those

806
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,720
Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.

807
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,560
So I went to the pachinko parlor and put $10 in, and it ate my $10, and I didn't know what

808
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
to do.

809
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
It's basic.

810
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Okay.

811
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I don't know the basics of the game.

812
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm sure somebody-

813
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
It's legalized gambling.

814
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
It's pretty much legalized gambling.

815
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,480
So there you put these little metal balls falling in certain spots.

816
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,600
I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little

817
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
metal balls.

818
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,120
I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.

819
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,640
And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes-

820
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,240
This game sounds fucking hot.

821
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,780
You can exchange those for prizes, or you can usually go around the corner and get money

822
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
for them.

823
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,520
Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and whatnot, and it gives you money.

824
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,480
But Rob makes you eat too gross.

825
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,760
I've collected a lot of balls over the years.

826
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Where's my prize?

827
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,440
I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.

828
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,900
You have your own set of balls.

829
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,060
Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.

830
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,400
That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant very similar to the ones that

831
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,860
would serve Rocky Mountain oysters, you know?

832
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,360
Rack of lamb, rack of balls.

833
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:42,640
Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.

834
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
Do you even care what's coming out of Nintendo DS in Japan?

835
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Sure you do.

836
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,640
Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.

837
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,160
And of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover, but I assume that this

838
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,240
is a simulation game that teaches you manners, because you can pick A, B, C, and it looks

839
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,200
like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever.

840
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,420
So this is interesting, to say the least.

841
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,360
Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.

842
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,920
Isn't this series ever going to die?

843
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
I like that.

844
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Probably never.

845
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
The app is old.

846
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,720
And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Soup Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam

847
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
games.

848
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,360
Nintendo vs. ZAFT Portable.

849
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,480
There you have it, Japanese release dates.

850
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Aren't we happy?

851
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,840
We are happy.

852
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,000
One thing though that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting

853
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,920
you yet another firmware, 3.30.

854
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,040
And what will it give you?

855
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,720
Well, some interesting stuff.

856
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,360
For example, you can have some brand new video sizes, including full screen video now at

857
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,520
480x272, the native resolution of the PSP.

858
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:10,620
Somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution, which is actually DVD resolution, that's 480p.

859
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,320
I don't know how the hell that's going to fit, since there's not that many pixels on

860
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,880
the damn screen, but okay, sure.

861
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,420
And then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, which I believe

862
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,000
is the T-Mobile hotspots, and you get like 60 days, like a trial for that or something.

863
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,360
It will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there, so you know, you may want

864
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:43,320
to wait a little bit because, let's see, because there's some good news, and that is that like

865
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,960
most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.

866
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:55,640
And yeah, it's been cracked already, and actually the rumor is that DarkAlex is working on a

867
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,640
custom firmware for 3.30, so I would say give it a couple more weeks, and you'll probably

868
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,380
see this on the internet.

869
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:12,960
Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a TA82PSP

870
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,660
motherboard in there, and you have the custom firmware already on there, if you try to upgrade

871
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,960
to this it may break your PSP, so you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have

872
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,600
the custom firmware in there, so just be careful.

873
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,480
Well, better hope that people heed that, right?

874
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Yes.

875
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,140
Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's

876
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:41,960
really surprised by this, is that the man, the voice, David Hayter, is returning as Solid

877
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,700
Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriot.

878
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,340
That just makes me absolutely so happy.

879
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:55,800
Also coming back are the voice actors for Raiden, Roy Campbell, and Otacon, so that's

880
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,840
very cool.

881
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,900
And that actually just makes me very happy.

882
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,240
Isn't David Hayter also the voice of the blood elves in World of Warcraft?

883
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,460
He's awesome.

884
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,120
He also wrote the first X-Men movie, too, the screenplay.

885
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
The first two movies.

886
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
He wrote it?

887
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
Yeah.

888
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
I did not know that about him.

889
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
I'm so sorry, guys.

890
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
My voice is giving out so bad tonight.

891
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,800
Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.

892
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
I didn't realize that's what he did.

893
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know where that's going.

894
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,640
And he also did Applebee's commercials.

895
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,160
I found his voice reel.

896
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,920
I want my baby bit, baby bit.

897
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,240
Oh, Jiranami says, no, David Hayter did not do the blood elves.

898
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,880
Somebody pulled the Napier Fools joke on me then, bastards.

899
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.

900
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
My bad.

901
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I

902
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,880
think.

903
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
For the game.

904
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Hmm.

905
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,800
Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?

906
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,880
But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.

907
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, cool.

908
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
You'll have to check that out, then.

909
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,920
They still, you know, have to do the translations.

910
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
I guess that's true.

911
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
That's true.

912
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,600
Because the game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.

913
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,040
Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was

914
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,240
promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.

915
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,800
They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than

916
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,160
Talladega Nights was.

917
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,200
That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.

918
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,840
But they were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network, and then the first 20,000 were going

919
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
to get their movie.

920
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,640
But nobody's gotten it yet.

921
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,120
Casino Royale is fucking awesome.

922
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,000
I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.

923
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It's so good.

924
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.

925
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's all she freaking talks about.

926
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's not all I freaking talk about.

927
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So he's like, have you seen the Bond movie?

928
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Have you seen the new Bond movie?

929
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's freaking hot.

930
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,880
Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie, because it's really

931
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
good.

932
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
And you should see it too.

933
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,160
I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either, and it was really good.

934
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Fucking hate Bond.

935
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
No, I hate fucking Bond.

936
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
You know what?

937
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
This just isn't working out.

938
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
You know what?

939
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Fuck you.

940
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,400
I love it when lesbians fight on this program.

941
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Let's see.

942
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember,

943
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,720
you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets

944
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,520
mailed to you.

945
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,600
Ouch.

946
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,080
So, perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.

947
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,440
Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation

948
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
3.

949
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
It bundled in there.

950
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,320
Well, it was bundled in, and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?

951
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
That's true.

952
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,960
It was like a real special something, huh?

953
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,880
Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.

954
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
You're special ed.

955
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
You're mom's special ed.

956
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Anyways.

957
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Last night.

958
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,080
So, you may be waiting a while to get your copy of Casino Royale.

959
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,240
Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation

960
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
3.

961
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,680
According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they

962
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,960
are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.

963
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,600
And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful

964
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,280
platform and developing technology and products, and they're planning on developing technology

965
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,120
and products for this console, says, however, we believe that the install base will be high

966
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,800
enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year.

967
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,280
So not only do you have to wait until 2008, you have to wait until the second half of

968
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,800
2008, which fiscal year for most companies is from, I believe, April to April, I want

969
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
to say, or March to March or something like that.

970
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,600
So second half would actually be fall of 2008.

971
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,960
No Tomb Raider on PlayStation 3 for you.

972
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
You know what?

973
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises

974
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
could this affect?

975
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Umm...

976
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Juice X?

977
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm trying to remember, Eidos recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.

978
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,160
They were doing like Battle Stations Midway.

979
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.

980
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Thief, Hitman.

981
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Hitman, yeah.

982
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Oh, that's a pretty big series.

983
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Okay, there you go.

984
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Huh.

985
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Well, I don't know.

986
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,440
None of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted

987
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
to try.

988
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,960
Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and

989
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
I just, I haven't.

990
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
You know?

991
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,560
So many games, so little time.

992
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,960
And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there too.

993
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
That's true.

994
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
That's true.

995
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,960
It looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain too, I forgot about

996
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
that.

997
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,000
All right, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008, but Jamie's got a lot of love

998
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,720
for you all out there, don't you, Jamie?

999
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Yeah.

1000
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,760
And she loves to share the website she finds with you on the internet every week in a little

1001
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,040
segment we call Dark Socras.

1002
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,280
I really need tea or something.

1003
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,760
My voice is cracking like I'm 12 all over again.

1004
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,320
No, it's, well, I have tea, I have my licorice tea, but it's just not enough.

1005
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,600
Licorice is nasty.

1006
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I'm sorry.

1007
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I love licorice.

1008
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Anyway.

1009
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,480
Dark Socras website of the week.

1010
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:20,760
Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random, and it's transmission.org.

1011
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:29,840
It's T-R-A-N-S dash mission dot org, and it's a UK website for the club scene for Transvestites.

1012
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,640
So I'm done.

1013
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Did you actually browse the website?

1014
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
I mean, what kind of-

1015
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,160
I was looking for shoes.

1016
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,720
You were looking for, wait a minute.

1017
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
I was looking for shoes.

1018
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Hold on.

1019
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,160
Stop the damn music for a minute.

1020
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,640
How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual

1021
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,360
clubs in Britain?

1022
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Let's get them.

1023
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,480
Because there's a link on here, on their links page.

1024
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,760
There's a shops link, and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.

1025
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,760
These shoes are $300.

1026
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,480
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.

1027
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,440
Let's get them.

1028
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
So yeah.

1029
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
You started it, Rob.

1030
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
You started it, Rob.

1031
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
I guess I, I don't know.

1032
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
I guess I deserve that.

1033
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
I don't know.

1034
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Let me borrow that top.

1035
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,800
It really is a pretty, pretty famous transit.

1036
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,480
You want the rest of my water bottle for now?

1037
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
I'm not sick.

1038
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Okay.

1039
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I have a drink.

1040
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Let me go bribe people.

1041
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
All right.

1042
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,840
Chris is going to go bribe people.

1043
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Try to get us some drinks.

1044
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,320
I'm going to give people some blood.

1045
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
All right.

1046
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Anyhow.

1047
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Can I help?

1048
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Can you just help?

1049
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,400
Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NCSoft and ArenaNet, because they

1050
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,200
are putting out not just one, but two new Guild Wars titles, for those of you guys that

1051
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,120
are into Guild Wars.

1052
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,580
Guild Wars Eye of the North will be a new expansion that is coming out.

1053
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,920
It is coming out for around the holidays, 2007.

1054
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,320
It's got 18 dungeons, 10 brand new heroes, and 150 new skills.

1055
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,960
It's going to be pretty awesome.

1056
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,520
Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 is also going to be coming out in the second half of 2008.

1057
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,700
That was officially announced, and they are going to follow what worked for them with

1058
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,820
Guild Wars, no monthly subscription fee.

1059
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,600
The world will always be available, just like the original Guild Wars.

1060
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,480
That's kind of cool, especially for those folks into Guild Wars.

1061
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,680
What I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?

1062
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,760
I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.

1063
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,040
EverQuest 2 didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got, because people didn't want

1064
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,320
to leave their characters behind.

1065
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,040
I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate, or if because, eh,

1066
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,560
I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there will be some extra incentive.

1067
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,360
I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the

1068
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,920
North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2, just to, you know, make people buy everything

1069
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
they want.

1070
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
So there you go.

1071
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Gotta collect them all.

1072
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Yeah.

1073
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Gotta get them all.

1074
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,360
Anyways, this isn't really a news article, more of a, I guess a commentary by me, but

1075
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:18,480
I was reading, there was this post on Joystiq actually, and it's a column that they do,

1076
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,360
I believe every other week, by a woman named Bonnie Ruberg, and basically she writes a

1077
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,880
column called Playing Dirty.

1078
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,520
It's a column on sex and gender in video games.

1079
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,280
And her article this week was, Lady, Get Off the Road, and it's basically talking about

1080
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,480
men say women are bad drivers.

1081
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,780
This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license

1082
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,320
photo to prove it.

1083
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,240
I take my on-road duties seriously.

1084
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,760
And basically her complaint is that she believes that those comments about women being bad

1085
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,960
drivers are unfounded, and in fact, it's-

1086
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,720
Can I say something funny I saw a woman doing on the road yesterday?

1087
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,360
No, this is, Chris, I swear to God, this is a true story.

1088
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,840
I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?

1089
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,840
So, but she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.

1090
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,400
She's not even the student driver.

1091
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
No, I know.

1092
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,080
No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.

1093
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,280
She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper to bumper trying to

1094
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,760
go across the Bay Bridge, text messaging while driving.

1095
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,200
You can't text message, break up.

1096
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,640
You can't text message, break up.

1097
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,120
So yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.

1098
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,200
True story, I am not shitting you.

1099
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,440
This is- That takes a special kind of loser.

1100
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,320
This is why you women get a bad rap.

1101
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Exactly.

1102
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,800
You wanna know why men get a bad rap?

1103
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,780
Small penis cars every single fucking time.

1104
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,760
I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.

1105
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,120
What the hell is that car called?

1106
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,120
What is that car?

1107
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,120
It's like a four BMW.

1108
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,600
I know, but- I don't know.

1109
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,280
It's one of the new little beamers I've got.

1110
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,180
So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that

1111
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,120
they've got a bigger cock than I do.

1112
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,080
I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.

1113
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,840
And then they perceive- Now, what you boys don't know is that Chris

1114
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,980
has a very big cock.

1115
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
That's right.

1116
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,980
In her top dresser drawer.

1117
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,980
Exactly.

1118
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,240
And when it vibrates, beat that motherfucker.

1119
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,400
Not as big as mine.

1120
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
That's right.

1121
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,400
Hers is detachable though.

1122
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,400
So- Shut up, Rob.

1123
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,600
But yeah, you men are- Lesbian sex, bleh!

1124
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,480
You men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that car.

1125
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,680
Okay, and maybe- Okay, so men-

1126
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,920
Sorry, do you wanna finish the article?

1127
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Sorry.

1128
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Yeah, I wanna finish.

1129
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,640
Anyways, so they go on to complain basically that men, you know, are driving fast and they're

1130
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,240
breaking- Oh, and they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.

1131
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,720
They're all- Just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.

1132
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,880
Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.

1133
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,400
They've got awful driving written all over them.

1134
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,120
Yeah, I don't think games are reality.

1135
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Duh!

1136
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,080
You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!

1137
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,680
I can make some points for that!

1138
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,360
No, I'm not retard, okay?

1139
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,280
So here's the thing.

1140
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,120
I fucking hate the goddamn women that drive the giant SUVs, talking on their goddamn cell

1141
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,380
phones, not paying attention to the fucking world, and because- Getting distracted by

1142
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,800
stupid shit like, hey, look, there's a bird over there, and meanwhile like swerving all

1143
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,120
over the fucking place because their conversation's interesting.

1144
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,160
That's the difference.

1145
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,540
Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?

1146
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
That's why.

1147
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,760
You know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great, then we

1148
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,200
can go out there and play that and you'll have something to play.

1149
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,600
But I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think

1150
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,680
they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are,

1151
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,880
you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that,

1152
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,200
you know, but usually I let them pass me no problem.

1153
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,080
But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway talking on the cell

1154
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:14,920
phones swerving all over the place, not using her signal, and you know, goddamn, might as

1155
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,800
well stop and back up on the freeway, and I have seen that by the way before.

1156
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
That's what pisses me off.

1157
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,400
And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples, actually a lot, a lot, a lot

1158
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,400
of bad apples out there too, kind of spoil a bunch, and you know, women should just get

1159
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,800
pissed off at these stupid people that drive, it's really SUV drivers.

1160
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,200
I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.

1161
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,800
I actually have to agree with you, those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with

1162
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,800
fire.

1163
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,840
And you know what, the guys at speed out there, they end up crashing anyways, so it's all

1164
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
bad drivers.

1165
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,840
I'm sorry, I missed something, what the fuck does this have to do with games?

1166
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,680
It doesn't have to do anything with games.

1167
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,120
Why the fuck did you bring this story up, man?

1168
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,160
Because it was on Joystick, and because it was, and because it's basically, they're talking

1169
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,360
about like Need for Speed, Cytruck, and Burnout and stuff like that, kind of blaming, I guess,

1170
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,400
So what, is that how the article reads?

1171
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,120
Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop

1172
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,640
texting, blah, blah, blah.

1173
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,640
That's what I read.

1174
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Cytruck, burnout, okay thanks.

1175
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,840
Is that it?

1176
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,720
That's what I read, that's how my guy filter went through that, you know, it's like squawk,

1177
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,600
squawk, squawk, med suck, squawk, squawk, squawk.

1178
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
I thought that was your wife talking to you.

1179
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Oh no.

1180
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Or me.

1181
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Or me.

1182
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,960
Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.

1183
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,080
That's right, that's right, I'm going 120 miles on the freeway, I'm wondering why somebody

1184
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
going 80 is in my way.

1185
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,000
Okay, I'm going to go fry people.

1186
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Next!

1187
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Alright, wow.

1188
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,920
Oh by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills

1189
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,560
at racing sims because they need to practice.

1190
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:06,000
Women, they're already such good drivers that they can squander their free time on destruction.

1191
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So smackdown.

1192
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, are you politely commenting for a reason here, because anytime there's

1193
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,160
a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it, but tonight, strangely quiet.

1194
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:23,720
I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in, or if you're just rolling your eyes mentally,

1195
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
I don't know.

1196
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,880
I'm trying to get a feel.

1197
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,300
What is going through Jamie's mind?

1198
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:36,040
Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective, so moving forward.

1199
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.

1200
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,560
What the hell do they do with anything?

1201
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,440
They do bad driving and good driving.

1202
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,360
So how about smackdown, right?

1203
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,800
There's going to be some smackdown in here pretty soon.

1204
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:58,560
On new smackdown vs raw 2008 edition, to be on the PS3, we DS also a bunch of other shit.

1205
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:08,460
So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system,

1206
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:15,160
you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff, and some of the fan requested

1207
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:22,680
updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience,

1208
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:29,320
out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff, but I just think smackdown vs raw is

1209
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:36,320
funny because wrestling is like soap opera for guys.

1210
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:43,000
Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start

1211
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,200
your own reality show that appears on VH1?

1212
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,280
Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan though, he comes back a year later.

1213
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,840
It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right, or whatever?

1214
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:01,960
I'm so gay, obviously, I don't know what I'm talking about.

1215
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,120
You like the last smackdown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up,

1216
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,120
Darkseid?

1217
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,200
Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.

1218
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,840
Who puts the smackdown when you and Dan do battle in smackdown?

1219
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,680
I just make characters and make him use them.

1220
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,040
I usually make really kickass characters though.

1221
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,600
Like the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was this really pretty boy in

1222
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:29,680
D-Generation X, and then we just let him play on watch mode where you could just watch all

1223
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,200
the matches and he won every single match, had all the belts.

1224
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,160
We even put him in a women's match.

1225
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,000
That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game, but still, he had all

1226
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the belts.

1227
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He was fucking awesome.

1228
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,340
I just remember because he was pretty.

1229
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,360
Pretty Boy, was that his wrestling name?

1230
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Pretty Boy?

1231
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,120
No, he had some cool name, but he was just, I think his name was actually just Mr. X.

1232
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
How original.

1233
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
All right.

1234
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,760
Maisie, what, you had something to say?

1235
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,920
Maisie has a joke about wrestling, sure, why not?

1236
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,420
We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with the joke.

1237
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,120
The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.

1238
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,760
How's that?

1239
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,000
Just watch professional wrestling, and then watch some gay porn.

1240
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Not much of a difference.

1241
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,160
Some advice from Maisie there.

1242
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
All right.

1243
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,840
Well, we are going to take a quick break here.

1244
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,240
The lesbians saw boobies.

1245
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,040
What are you looking at here?

1246
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,520
I'm on Destructoid, scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore 69, Celebrity Boobs

1247
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,040
and Nakedness, etc.

1248
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:42,480
Then they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller

1249
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,120
on there.

1250
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,440
Is it like an April Fools joke or something?

1251
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
I don't know.

1252
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,080
I'm just scrolling down.

1253
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,920
They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.

1254
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
I do like that site.

1255
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,920
It's a lot of fun.

1256
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
All right.

1257
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,760
I guess that's going to do it, though, for part A here of Orange Laundry.

1258
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,680
I don't know if you're thinking, gosh, this is a little short.

1259
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,860
Well, don't forget, we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was

1260
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,860
a separate show.

1261
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,400
But we will be back for your full part B right after a quick little segment here.

1262
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,280
Coming up in part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite, because there's

1263
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
a lot on that.

1264
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,480
We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers,

1265
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,040
Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.

1266
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:26,520
Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.

1267
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,040
