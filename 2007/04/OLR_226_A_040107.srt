1
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, April 1st, 2007, it's no joke that Sonic and Mario are teaming up for an Olympic game.

2
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360 Elite gets officially unveiled, and we talk about who is already upset with the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer.

3
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:38,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week, no really this time, of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:45,303
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that internet podcast dedicated to video game culture, the gaming lifestyle, and what you, the gamer, really want to know about.

5
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:50,347
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:50,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo.

7
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:51,868
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Jamie?

8
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: My nose is full of goo.

9
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:54,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Gross.

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

11
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:58,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

12
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:58,973
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Loki?

13
00:00:59,073 --> 00:00:59,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.

14
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we have some special guests in the studio tonight.

15
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:02,635
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:31,603
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

17
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:32,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is here tonight, everybody.

18
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:34,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Rob.

19
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And she is a lesbian, but not the giggling type.

20
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:38,286
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

21
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, once in a while, if I tell a funny joke, she might giggle.

22
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, laugh like a hyena is more like it.

23
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:43,669
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

24
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And joining us all the way from Wisconsin, say hello to Meg Z. Hi.

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,471
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Meg Z?

26
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:49,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.

27
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your help with the show earlier.

28
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:51,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

29
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:52,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hi.

30
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:52,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

31
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like got her head buried in the PC or Mac looking at something.

32
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:58,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking at porn.

33
00:01:58,948 --> 00:01:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot.

34
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you downloading lesbian porn on my Mac?

35
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:01,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Hells yeah.

36
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,670
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

38
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, again, you know, our April Fool's joke was all in good fun.

39
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:09,894
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what it is yet, go back in the podcast archive and check it out.

40
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:12,456
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have some real gaming news we want to talk about tonight.

41
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit of a disclaimer first, though, because we want to say.

42
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:17,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, um,

43
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't get a pinbot.

44
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.

45
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinbot sounds awesome, though.

46
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:51,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

47
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's funny how many people thought I actually got one.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,620
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you weren't here last week.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,281
[SPEAKER_05]: We missed you.

50
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the plague.

51
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

52
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:58,642
[SPEAKER_05]: The disease.

53
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:05,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine while I was on vacation in Mendocino, and I totally thought of you, and I wish I could have stole it for you.

54
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I has played one.

55
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,627
[SPEAKER_05]: At California Extreme or whatever they call it?

56
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:10,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

57
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go to that this year.

58
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:12,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds hot.

59
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you wanted to add, Loki?

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a PC game called Tomiki Fighters.

62
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

63
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a shoot-em-up game, I guess.

64
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

65
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:29,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those needle Japanese games that's insanely hard.

66
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,465
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's fun, so we're checking it out.

67
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:33,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a free download.

68
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:38,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked a little bit about it on my blog post on the All Games thing, so if you want the link to it, check that out.

69
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got to be a friend.

70
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:45,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Community.allgames.com Yeah, you've got to be one of my friends in order to be able to get the links.

71
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:45,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

72
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's something in the blog post he wrote he's not saying here.

73
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So you should check it out.

74
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:51,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an awesome game.

75
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:52,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

76
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I meant.

77
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:54,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

78
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:55,235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

79
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:57,257
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

80
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,057
[SPEAKER_05]: What I really played.

81
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did play Ninja Turtles online a little bit.

82
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,020
[SPEAKER_05]: But with a listener of the program.

83
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:02,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a stupid boy.

84
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:03,782
[SPEAKER_05]: We were cracking each other up.

85
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also played a lot of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

86
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:07,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Just trying to make my way through that.

87
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good, like, 80s arcade type game.

89
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:41,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that instead of getting the same old root beer, tapper, joust, those type of games, it's like something you may not have played before.

90
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of fun.

91
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:46,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't checked out multiplayer mode yet, though, so I feel like I haven't gotten the full experience of the game.

92
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:49,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But for five bucks, honestly, so far, it's not a bad deal.

93
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:54,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And I apologize about my voice and to the chatters in our chat room at chat.orangelandsradio.com.

94
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,283
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

95
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,919
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll see you next time.

96
00:05:35,168 --> 00:06:01,379
[SPEAKER_05]: and their high def pretty videos although you can't randomize them which is kind of weird and they do have music included but I've actually found the way I enjoy listening to the game is I use the XB stream program to grab podcasts and I'll play Tetris while listening to podcasts like I'll set a custom soundtrack as a podcast like I don't know either our show if I want to kind of listen back see how we're doing or Major Nelson or something or one of the other all game shows I'll listen to those and it's kind of fun so

97
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, $30, not a bad deal, but I think it'll be in your bargain bin soon.

98
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Chris, maybe anything you guys want to add?

99
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played Animal Crossing.

100
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:10,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Crossing on DS?

101
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on the plane.

102
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: On the plane?

103
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:12,637
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

104
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:14,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you didn't use the Wi-Fi, though, on the plane, did you?

105
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course not.

106
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:15,438
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

107
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:23,042
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but, um, I haven't played for, like, three months, and everybody in my village was like, Bitch, I invited you to tea, like, five months ago!

108
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:29,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm sorry, and there was, like, a gajillion weeds, and I had a bunch of mail, and it was a mess.

109
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,706
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cleaned it up all the way from Madison to

110
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:35,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So it took you that long to clean up your village?

111
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, and then make everybody not mad at me anymore.

112
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well good times.

113
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:58,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if there's still, I guess there probably still is a real active Animal Crossing community online, because I was thinking, wow, if I just got the game now, like most people I know quit playing that a long time ago, so there'd be nobody left to visit my village, but I guess there's still a pretty active community online somewhere, huh?

114
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, anything you wanted to add?

115
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:03,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually really did play World of Warcraft, because that's the only game.

116
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:05,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.

117
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck!

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

119
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:14,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to spend a lot of time waiting for Megzi to get here, so I did that by playing WoW.

120
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, I did it more as an experiment.

121
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:27,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found if you go to any of the major areas where there are lots of people in traffic, and you have a girl character, and you start making her dance, watch how many guys decide to join in.

122
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:28,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very funny.

123
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,345
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if you're a girl or not.

124
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Not when you're a tauren, I'm finding out, because nobody wants to dance with a cow.

125
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to dance with a cow.

126
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:41,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It works well with the elves and sometimes the humans, just because there's a lot of traffic.

127
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,989
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really funny to watch all the boys flirt with you.

128
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, especially when you're sitting there knowing, wow, these guys have no clue.

129
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:48,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.

130
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guy asked me ASL, and I said male.

131
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:54,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I said male, 42, Arizona.

132
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:54,153
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

133
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked away.

134
00:07:59,683 --> 00:07:59,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

135
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:00,544
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very funny.

136
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Uni's in our chat saying, I'm going to make a Draenei.

137
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the Draenei chicks are hot.

138
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.

139
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Draenei.

140
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:08,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

141
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd bang those if I could.

142
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:12,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I might be gay and all, but even if I think the Draenei chicks are hot, what can I say?

143
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:13,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like their accent.

144
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:14,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

145
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:14,995
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot, too.

146
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough rage.

147
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

148
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

149
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:19,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Conclusion of our gaming weeks.

150
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

151
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some real brief housekeeping here.

152
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to keep this a little bit vague.

153
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to say a little more about it, but I don't want to draw this out much longer than we have to.

154
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it pains us, journalistically, to have to go back and remove something that used to be there before.

155
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, we did not enjoy doing that.

156
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:48,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't want to do it, but as I'm sure a lot of you guys will understand, we kind of had to do it.

157
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, unfortunately, Orange Lounge Radio is a hobby for us, and it doesn't pay the bills.

158
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:56,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So when push comes to shove, um, things gotta change.

159
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:59,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, we also believe in karma.

160
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,158
[SPEAKER_05]: What goes around comes around.

161
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:09,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I think what we do here is really great for the community, and we give a lot of publicity to a lot of, um, great up-and-coming games.

162
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't get paid for it.

163
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,603
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't pay for us to talk about their games.

164
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:17,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I guess the only impression we can kind of take away from this is that, um,

165
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,712
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

166
00:09:45,242 --> 00:10:08,373
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop had their financial conference call, I guess, their investor conference call, and the COO, Dan D'Amato, I think that's how you pronounce his name, was talking a little bit about the crippling Wii shortage that's been kind of happening ever since the system came out, and particularly bad with this month, or I should say last month, March,

167
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:13,548
[SPEAKER_03]: He was quoted saying, I don't think it's going to be an issue going forward.

168
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:21,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is just my opinion, but I think Nintendo intentionally dried up the supply because they made their numbers for the year.

169
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:26,034
[SPEAKER_03]: The new year starts April 1st, and I think we're going to see the supply flowing.

170
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:32,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's interesting, of course, Nintendo responded to that saying, no, that's not true.

171
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:37,059
[SPEAKER_03]: They never intended for a shortage to actually happen, and

172
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,120
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on and so forth.

173
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, my opinion on that is, if they're really drying up the sources on purpose, they're not going to go, yeah, we're holding them back because we hit our numbers for the year, so sorry if you can't get one.

174
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,997
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just going to piss people off.

175
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:55,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways,

176
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:12,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Long story short, I don't know, I'm sure GameStop and a lot of the retailers, but I know that the systems haven't been in stores for a long time, and I know at least distribution as a whole hasn't been able to get a hold of them for the month of March.

177
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they pretty much allocated everything to retail, so what little there was in retail, I don't know if it's because they did it intentionally, or if it was just they were

178
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:29,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Really behind and really can't make enough, you know, either way.

179
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it'll start getting better in April.

180
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be able to get some systems in time for Super Paper Mario.

181
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:35,272
[SPEAKER_05]: April fools.

182
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,273
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding.

183
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm wondering, though, is, and this is something I've been kind of wondering about this week, is that I seem to remember last year, obviously Xbox 360 had some real shortage problems as well.

184
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:52,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were pretty harsh with the Xbox 360 and Microsoft and, you know, why the F aren't there more systems out there and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

185
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like we've been a little more forgiving of Nintendo through all this.

186
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:58,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to figure out why that is.

187
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:06,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that because they have more consoles out there on the market so that those of us diehards that really wanted to get one were able to get one a little bit easier?

188
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:10,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that because we were smarter about it this time when we all camped out and got them or did whatever we did?

189
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:19,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're just a little bit smarter about it and also the fact that, I mean, the 360 was kind of the first next-gen console so it was something you really had to have it.

190
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,584
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times now it's like,

191
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Wii's not out.

192
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:28,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'll just play my 360 or I'll just play my PlayStation 2 or something like that until it comes out.

193
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really... And also, it'd be a little different if Super Mario Galaxy was out there now versus, you know, later or Smash Bros.

194
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:37,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl or something like that.

195
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,210
[SPEAKER_03]: If that stuff was out there now, you know, that would be a little bit different.

196
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, personally, I don't... But to be honest, Perfect Dark Zero was nothing to get that excited about for me.

197
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and the Xbox launch games were nothing like, oh, I gotta have it.

198
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:49,773
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

199
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:49,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

200
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:59,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted the system as a whole, you know, I don't know, the download, the live, I don't know, I just wanted the damn thing a year ago, you know, and I was frustrated when I couldn't get one.

201
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:05,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think it'd be pretty dumb even if they are hitting their numbers to, you know, intentionally drive the market.

202
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:08,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's even, I mean, I just think they just can't produce enough of these.

203
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:10,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's even the issue with their accessories.

204
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:17,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of a good, you know, point right there that they just don't have enough accessories out there even to, you know,

205
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:28,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm just wondering aloud here, are we being fair to Nintendo?

206
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we treating Nintendo and Microsoft the same way?

207
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:35,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no, they should be getting more systems out there because it's built on goddamn technology.

208
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been out forever.

209
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:38,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with the goddamn GameCube.

210
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Produce more fucking systems.

211
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And Duscap in our chatroom agrees with you.

212
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there a shortage of the Wii when it's just GameCube version 2?

213
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:50,015
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ on 100 Mount wants to know, how long did the 360 shortage last?

214
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine in February, but I think it was resolved in April, May.

215
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:54,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It was May, yeah.

216
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at GameStop.

217
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasted until about mid-March, April.

218
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,342
[SPEAKER_00]: You could walk into a store.

219
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:03,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw the first available one around the end of January.

220
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, though, they need to get on top of at least the systems out there.

221
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, okay, great.

222
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,586
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to keep the demand up or something like that.

223
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the demand's up there.

224
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: People want to buy this thing.

225
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's any kind of indicator, you basically show your friends this thing.

226
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:20,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Game System.

227
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't have it yet, after playing with it for a little bit, they're just like, God, I gotta get one of my own.

228
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:34,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think you would want as many systems out there as possible to get as many impressions as possible to sell even more systems, which in turn, you sell more software, make more money.

229
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't think they're doing it on purpose.

230
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, everyone's kind of running with this, you know, before because it's the CEO, it's his opinion.

231
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

232
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:47,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's as valid as my opinion.

233
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

234
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, you can only speculate.

235
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,182
[SPEAKER_03]: All that matters is, it's April now, more systems in stores.

236
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least we do have some good news, and this is no joke.

237
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:15,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo and Sega have both stated that Miyamoto is going to be part of the development of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.

238
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:15,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

239
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:31,346
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually talking specifically that there are going to be, not just that there's a number of different titles, from what I'm seeing anyway, but the game is being created by Sega with work by Miyamoto.

240
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:38,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, when it comes down to the 500 meter dash or whatever the hell it is, Sonic is going to beat the crap out of Mario.

241
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario's a big fat plumber.

242
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,693
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to tear his ass open.

243
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Who lives on a diet of mushrooms.

244
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:49,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Megsie's pointing at her shirt getting upset because she's wearing Flying Mario.

245
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:54,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but in defense, Mario will kick the crap out of Sonic when it comes to the high jump and shit like that because he's got hops.

246
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But fucking Sonic will beat him.

247
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,924
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when Mario sets Sonic on fire?

248
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:01,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

249
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Sonic can go faster than the goddamn speed of sound, so there.

250
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:16,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mario will also have Sonic beat in the ability to make a good next-gen game competition.

251
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know who will win?

252
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:24,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo and Sega, because they have tricked you into buying a goddamn Olympics game.

253
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:33,048
[SPEAKER_03]: If history has shown you anything, Olympics games suck really bad.

254
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

255
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,568
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, personally, I don't know.

256
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,870
[SPEAKER_03]: If this gets you interested in the Olympics, hooray.

257
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not falling for it.

258
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:42,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't buying this shit.

259
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:44,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I'm looking at chat room.

260
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:46,414
[SPEAKER_05]: FunnyDL had a really quick comment on the last story.

261
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:50,597
[SPEAKER_05]: People, Nintendo has been pulling this shit for years now and fans keep buying their bullshit.

262
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone remember the Nintendo NES chip shortage or the Nintendo 64 shortages?

263
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,900
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you must be old.

264
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,121
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

265
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really following gaming back then as closely as I am now.

266
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a little bit, but, you know, I was much younger and

267
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:09,854
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

268
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

269
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,630
[SPEAKER_05]: This games magazine, Game Reactor, put this image up on the internet.

270
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, it caught wildfire.

271
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of had to replace it with a ghost image of Knights.

272
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:07,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But there it is, a world exclusive on Knights.

273
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:12,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure they just beat the punch to some American publication that's going to have the same thing.

274
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, we learned about that previously in the teaser thing.

275
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to say, there's also been screenshots out there now, too.

276
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks kind of cool.

277
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here's a question, though.

278
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:29,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sonic games as of late, ever since the Dreamcast, have not been that great.

279
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:37,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this Sega's chance to redeem themselves, or should we just prepare to set ourselves up for disappointment?

280
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:39,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I want another Clockwork Knights.

281
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,827
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I know you've been a longtime Sonic fan.

282
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your thoughts about Knights on the Wii?

283
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:45,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they can make a good one?

284
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:46,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy.

285
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:47,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy.

286
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:47,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy.

287
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:51,056
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it turns out like Sonic on 360 and PS3?

288
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:51,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't.

289
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the Wii.

290
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that'll be at Saving Grace?

291
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii!

292
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:05,146
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, though, I mean, it's not as fast as Sonic the Hedgehog, so control issues won't be that big of a problem, I'm hoping.

293
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:05,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope.

294
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

295
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:08,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there it is.

296
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Nights is confirmed and coming out.

297
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:16,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to say told you so, but... But yeah.

298
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzi, wait, wait, before we get into the next story, Megzi, you're squeeing over there.

299
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask you the same thing I asked Jamie.

300
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: As a Knights fangirl, I mean, Sega's kind of done a lot of misfires lately.

301
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,598
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to stop them from misfiring this one?

302
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's Knights.

303
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,622
[SPEAKER_05]: But Sonic was cool, and Sonic on PlayStation 3 and 360 was not fun.

304
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:38,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's Sonic.

305
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know about your logic, but okay.

306
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:44,702
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

307
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,884
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be good because it is nights, period.

308
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:52,888
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, Mario is Missing had Mario in it, and it wasn't that much fun.

309
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:54,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Mario is Missing was the shit.

310
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just easy to please.

311
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:58,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

312
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to think.

313
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

314
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's this from her girlfriend?

315
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:05,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you have no idea.

316
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh la la.

317
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Any who hates...

318
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: and that E3 for everybody or E for all, whatever you want to call it.

319
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:20,065
[SPEAKER_03]: The E3 event or E3-like event that you can go to because it's open to the public.

320
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,086
[SPEAKER_03]: God help us all.

321
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:34,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so one reason you're probably going to want to go there other than the fact that it's open to everybody is that Nintendo is going to be there and they're going to be one of the flagship exhibitors demonstrating their kind of...

322
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:36,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge lineup.

323
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:44,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully by that time we'll see the big Super Mario Galaxy and Brawl and whatever fun crap that they're coming out with.

324
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But it should be interesting.

325
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, especially if they're on board, then it's likely other people will jump on board as well.

326
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:56,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, E for Everyone or E for All.

327
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:59,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming October in LA.

328
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Same place as the original E3.

329
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:03,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And only $100 to get in.

330
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:08,802
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's going to be, I want to say they said 200,000 people there.

331
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's going to be interesting if they really pull that many in.

332
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's going to happen, but still though, 200,000 people there?

333
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:16,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

334
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I'm interested.

335
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to reserve the time off work and go down and check it out.

336
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:25,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm very interested in seeing what this is all about.

337
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:28,885
[SPEAKER_03]: 200,000 people in half the exhibition space.

338
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's going to be very uncomfortable.

339
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:31,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

340
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,611
[SPEAKER_05]: But unless they're talking about, you know, they're counting each day separately.

341
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:35,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

342
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very lofty goal.

343
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But E3 was crowded as it is.

344
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:40,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

345
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm seeing as most of us won't be going to E3 this year because we did not feel the love.

346
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:53,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I was convinced that Namco Bandai was going to send us an invite, but for some reason it didn't happen.

347
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:55,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what possibly went wrong there.

348
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:58,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, we're not going to E3.

349
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not.

350
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's not.

351
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:03,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I am!

352
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:07,003
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when E3 started going down?

353
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,383
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what was the mark of it starting to go down?

354
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:10,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that they got rid of the booth babes.

355
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,305
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

356
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:23,468
[SPEAKER_03]: The mark of it going down was having to fight my way around a crowd that's lined up to get autographs from Paris Hilton.

357
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,429
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when I knew that E3 had jumped the shark.

358
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_05]: When Paris Hilton was getting those kinds of lines at E3, I was like,

359
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,181
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with this picture?

360
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:35,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But the booth babes?

361
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:38,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there'll be booth babes at E4ALL, I'm sure.

362
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:39,564
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

363
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to go to E4ALL, maybe?

364
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:41,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

365
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:42,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about it.

366
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:43,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

367
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know a little more about it.

368
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, Nintendo's going to be there, but what is going to be the must-have?

369
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, am I going to pay $100 to wait?

370
00:22:52,891 --> 00:23:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: 5 hours to play a game I mean seriously there's 200,000 if 200,000 people actually are first off I don't know that that could actually work especially with like fire codes and stuff but let's just say they're able to cram 200,000 people in there as it was last year with E3 70,000 people I believe and it was fucking crowded and now you have half the space and more than double the people fuck that

371
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says $200,000 could be a typo.

372
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:23,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they meant to say $20,000.

373
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: $20,000 is not bad.

374
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do $20,000.

375
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:32,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not a bad showing for a conference, especially your first freaking year.

376
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:37,219
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can pull off $20,000, I say that's a hell of an achievement for your first year out the gate.

377
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, we'll see.

378
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of luck to E4ALL.

379
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm going to go.

380
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about how you guys are feeling about it.

381
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:45,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go.

382
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:47,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go to E3, though.

383
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we don't always get what we want, sadly.

384
00:23:51,192 --> 00:24:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we give free publicity games on this show, so if you guys want to rely on Jamie to deliver that all to you, then I guess you got your work cut out for you, Jamie.

385
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:04,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm amazing.

386
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be doing live shows every night, right?

387
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we did last year?

388
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:11,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp.

389
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So guess what's not live?

390
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:14,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Zombies.

391
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Resident Evil.

392
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,259
[SPEAKER_05]: My voice sounds like a zombie tonight.

393
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:20,272
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, your face looks like one too.

394
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:20,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

395
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Resident Evil Wii, yeah?

396
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:34,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Resident Evil, the Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, is going to be at 480p, progressive scan, 16 to 9 widescreen.

397
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that great?

398
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd be interested to know if they're going to do any control changes with this or whatever.

399
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hooray for, you know...

400
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't look like there's any word on it yet.

401
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:49,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just supposed to be in pretty mode, I guess.

402
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:56,551
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be after the Capcom Gamers Day thing, which I think that's in the next couple weeks here.

403
00:24:57,012 --> 00:25:04,518
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been mumblings that that might not be the only Resident Evil thing on the cards for the Wii, but I guess we really won't know anything until Capcom Gamers Day.

404
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're pretty good at keeping secrets, huh?

405
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:11,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and pretty good about being pissy to people who try to get into their stuff.

406
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:12,625
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

407
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:14,838
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:44,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems kind of screwed up that Street Fighter 2 Turbo is going to be making its way to Wii Virtual Console when Street Fighter 2 just came out not that long ago.

409
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:48,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, obviously Street Fighter 2 Turbo was the superior game.

410
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:50,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why anyone would want to have both.

411
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:55,461
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at least back the first time this all happened, there was like a two or three year span between the games.

412
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's kind of like, sucker.

413
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And you still can't play it online.

414
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

415
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fight Arcade I don't know if I can get that excited about that on Virtual Console but these are a little more exciting other Virtual Console releases because Hudson updated an official list so we know these will be happening for sure Bonk's Revenge which I assume comes as a surprise to no one will be coming out on the Wii Virtual Console also Bravo Man Shock Man and Battle Lode Runner which is kind of cool because Lode Runner was like an old school computer game I used to love

416
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:04,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to be honest, I'm not familiar with the TurboGrafx-16 version, but I know some of our other staff was getting very excited over this game, so it must be good.

417
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You've played more TurboGrafx than I have.

418
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know Battle of Lode Runner?

419
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no.

420
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:10,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

421
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe someone in chat wants to say something on it.

422
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:21,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Anyways, it's that time to talk a little bit about what's coming out this week.

423
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got some good stuff coming out in the U.S.

424
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:32,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very slow month as far as games go, but this week, starting with PlayStation 2, we've got Brave the Search for the Spirit Dancer.

425
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a good kids game, I guess.

426
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:45,921
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into karaoke, you have SingStar Pop coming out, both the version with microphones, or if you bought SingStar Rocks, you can get the game by itself.

427
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a random question.

428
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:49,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you use a karaoke revolution mic with these games?

429
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:49,704
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

430
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:49,764
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

431
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:51,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards!

432
00:27:52,455 --> 00:28:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you know, SingStar Pop, though, it does come with the actual microphones with it, two of them, and it's the normal price of, like, Karaoke Revolution, so.

433
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:01,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know.

434
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:05,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize it's two different companies and all that stuff, but, you know.

435
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know that for a fact that those don't work.

436
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

437
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of sick of karaoke games, anyway.

438
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

439
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, coming out, let's see, on PlayStation 2, we have The Plan, which is a PC game that

440
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:24,745
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Pimp My Ride, Rappala Trophies, on the 360, on the Playstation 3, Enchanted Arms,

441
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Same damn game as before.

442
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they added maybe a few things to it.

443
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And, see, on the Wii, Prince of Persia, Rival Sword.

444
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I already said that.

445
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

446
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Bionicle Heroes is also supposed to make its way out.

447
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a port of the GameCube game.

448
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

449
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:07,085
[SPEAKER_03]: On PC, um... The Sims 2 Celebration.

450
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks kind of neat.

451
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:15,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of other crap games, including Hot Dog King, which is my favorite title of the week, by the way.

452
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

453
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:19,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were getting my copy early.

454
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:21,155
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

455
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out Wednesday.

456
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I still miss... I'm working on it.

457
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull through for me.

458
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be the coolest kid on the block and have it before anyone else.

459
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,287
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean you have it?

460
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:57,848
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a liar.

461
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:58,588
[SPEAKER_05]: April Fools.

462
00:29:58,989 --> 00:29:59,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzy.

463
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Full of lies and loos.

464
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:03,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just get hard.

465
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:04,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Love ya.

466
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:08,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let's move on to more release dates.

467
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:09,398
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the U.K.? ?

468
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's what we've got coming out.

469
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,346
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 5th, we have Prince of Persia, Rival Swords.

470
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have Rayman Raving Rabbids on Xbox 360.

471
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 6th, we have Frontline Fields of Thunder, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, NBA 2K6, and The Red Star on PS2.

472
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that at E3 a couple years ago.

473
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that about?

474
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:36,523
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

475
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,269
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:30,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look that fun, but if those of you guys in Japan want to play that, have a ball.

477
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:41,333
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3, absolutely nothing, but PlayStation 2, you're getting a couple games moving into Koei's The Best series, including Neo Angelique, but some new games for you.

478
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:49,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Netsu Chu Pro Baseball 2007, and Rakusho Pachislot Sengen 5, for those of you guys who love your pachinko.

479
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like some sexy ladies there.

480
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Gambling Sim with Sexy Ladies

481
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:13,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no fucking clue.

482
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:15,188
[SPEAKER_00]: But you played it?

483
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:22,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Japan and they told me, like, you gotta play pachinko because it's like one of those Japanese things you just have to do when you're in Tokyo.

484
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to this pachinko parlor and put like $10 in and it ate my $10.

485
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:28,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to do.

486
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:30,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basic, okay.

487
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:33,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the basics of the game, I'm sure somebody... It's legalized gambling.

488
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:35,073
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much legalized gambling.

489
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:35,933
[SPEAKER_01]: You sit there, you put...

490
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:40,498
[SPEAKER_01]: You put these little metal balls in certain spots.

491
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:44,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly how it's supposed to go, but the goal is to collect these little metal balls.

492
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:48,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I can turn that into a sex joke, but I'm not going to.

493
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:57,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what you do is you can exchange those racks of balls for either prizes... Yeah, shut up!

494
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This game sounds fucking hot!

495
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:04,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You can exchange those for prizes or you can usually go around the corner and get money for them.

496
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:08,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you go exchange them for these little voucher things and what not and it gives you money.

497
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:11,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob makes me too gross.

498
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I've collected a lot of balls over the years.

499
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my prize?

500
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:19,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a prize right here, Rob.

501
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,775
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your own set of balls.

502
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:23,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dick is bigger than any man's I know.

503
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:31,108
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like something you can order at a restaurant, very similar to the ones that would serve Rocky Mountain Oysters, you know?

504
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:32,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Rack of lamb?

505
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Rack of balls?

506
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the maturity level of this program just sunk to a whole new low.

507
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:45,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you even care what's coming out on Nintendo DS in Japan?

508
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:45,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure you do.

509
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:51,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Watashi no Happy Manor Book, which is my favorite Japanese title of the week.

510
00:33:52,597 --> 00:34:10,260
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course another pretty lady wearing a purse on the cover but I assume that this is like a simulation game that teaches you manners because you can pick A, B, C and it looks like these little scenarios with a guy and a girl out on a little date or whatever so this is interesting to say the least.

511
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out on the DS, Detective Conan, Tantai Ryoku Trainer.

512
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that series ever going to die?

513
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

514
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:19,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably never.

515
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yab is old.

516
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly on the PSP, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, because you know you love your Gundam games.

517
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Rengo vs. ZAFT Portable.

518
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:32,802
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it, Japanese release dates.

519
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:35,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't we happy?

520
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: We are happy.

521
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:43,564
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, that may make you happy, doesn't make me happy, but PSP is getting yet another firmware, 3.30.

522
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And what will it give you?

523
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some interesting stuff.

524
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:49,285
[SPEAKER_03]: For example...

525
00:34:50,753 --> 00:35:15,295
[SPEAKER_03]: you can have some brand new video sizes including full screen video now at 480x272 the native resolution of the PSP somehow it's able to pull off 720x480 resolution for which is actually DVD resolution that's 480p I don't know how the hell that's going to fit since there's not that many pixels on the damn screen but okay sure

526
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:26,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then there's another thing that you can actually use a wireless hotspot, um, which I believe is the T-Mobile hotspots and you get like 60 days, uh, like a trial for that or something.

527
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:31,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it will of course break any of your homebrew stuff on there.

528
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:39,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you may want to wait a little bit because, um, let's see.

529
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:47,235
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's some good news and that is that like most PSP firmware releases, this one's already been cracked.

530
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:57,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's been cracked already and actually the rumor is that Dark Galaxy is working on a custom firmware for 3.30.

531
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:03,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say give it a couple more weeks and you'll probably see this on the internet.

532
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:07,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Another interesting thing though you may want to watch out for is if you do have a...

533
00:36:09,656 --> 00:36:13,698
[SPEAKER_03]: was a TA-82 PSP motherboard in there.

534
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the custom firmware already on there.

535
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try to upgrade to this, it may break your PSP.

536
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways if you have the custom firmware in there.

537
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:23,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be careful.

538
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:28,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, better hope that people heed that, right?

539
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:29,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

540
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:36,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on, I have actually some more good news for everybody, although no one's really surprised by this.

541
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,201
[SPEAKER_02]: David Hader, Blood Elves, World of Warcraft

542
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: He's awesome.

543
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:11,560
[SPEAKER_02]: He also, like, wrote the first X-Men movie, too.

544
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

545
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The first two movies.

546
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:14,241
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote it?

547
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:14,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

548
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:16,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not know that about him.

549
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:17,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry, guys.

550
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My voice is giving out so bad tonight.

551
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why the third one sucked, because he didn't write it.

552
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:24,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't realize that's what he did.

553
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:27,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, now that you say it, I'm like, oh, I don't know.

554
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:28,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also did Applebee's commercials.

555
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I found his voice real.

556
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:32,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my baby back, baby back.

557
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Drew Nami says, no, David Hayter did not do the Blood Elves.

558
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody pulled an April Fool's joke on me then.

559
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:39,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastards.

560
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was some famous voice actor that did it.

561
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:44,645
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

562
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:54,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's also, let's see, he's also, I think, working on the script as well, I think, for the game.

563
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:57,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, God, shouldn't the script be done by now?

564
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's actually in Kojima's podcast this week.

565
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:01,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

566
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:06,020
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have to do the translations.

567
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

568
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:10,842
[SPEAKER_05]: The game will come out in Japan, I'm sure, before it comes out here.

569
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:20,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that still hasn't come out in the UK would be the free Blu-ray movie that was promised to the PlayStation 3 adopters over in the UK.

570
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:24,887
[SPEAKER_05]: They were supposed to get Casino Royale, which I think is a much better pack-in movie than Talladega Nights was.

571
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome for those folks in the UK.

572
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:28,168
[SPEAKER_05]: But

573
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:33,550
[SPEAKER_05]: They were supposed to connect to the PlayStation Network and then the first 20,000 were going to get their movie.

574
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But nobody's gotten it yet.

575
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Casino Royale is fucking awesome.

576
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I still haven't seen it, but I really want to.

577
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.

578
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one for Bond, but that movie is amazing.

579
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,951
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all I freaking talk about.

580
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:48,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the new Bond movie?

581
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,012
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking hot.

582
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:54,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time Bond comes up, I ask if they've seen the new Bond movie because it's really good and you should see it too.

583
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't like Bond, but I don't like Bond either and it was really good.

584
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,014
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hate fucking Bond.

585
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,234
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this just isn't working out.

586
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:04,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it when lesbians fight on this program.

587
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:05,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

588
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:17,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Sony is saying, though, they're going to make good on their promise, but remember, you might have to wait 45 days after the release of the movie in your region before it gets mailed to you.

589
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

590
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:23,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps it's going to take a long time for that movie to come out.

591
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:27,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I seem to remember when Talladega Nights came out here with the PlayStation 3.

592
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:28,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bundled in there.

593
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:33,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was bundled in and it was before the movie actually came out here, right?

594
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:34,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

595
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a real special something, huh?

596
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:40,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though that movie is not that special, unless you're talking special ed.

597
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:43,396
[SPEAKER_05]: You're special ed.

598
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,078
[SPEAKER_03]: You're special ed.

599
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:49,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night... So you may be waiting a while to get your

600
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Copy of Casino Royale.

601
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:57,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you may be also waiting quite a while for getting any Eidos games on the PlayStation 3.

602
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:08,264
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Eidos, they are planning to hold most of the PlayStation 3 titles they are planning on releasing until their 2008 fiscal year.

603
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:17,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason behind that is they believe the PlayStation 3, while it being a successful platform and developing technology and products for

604
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:47,391
[SPEAKER_03]: and their plan on developing technology and products for this console says however we believe that the install base will be high enough until the second half of the 2008 fiscal year so not only do you have to wait until 2008 you have to wait until the second half of 2008 which fiscal year for most companies is from I believe April to April I want to say or March to March or something like that so second half would actually be fall of 2008 no Tomb Raider on Playstation 3 for you

605
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:54,644
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I'm kind of done with Tomb Raider anyway, so I'm not that upset, but what other franchises could this affect?

606
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:57,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Juice X?

607
00:40:58,445 --> 00:40:59,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember.

608
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:03,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Eidos, recently, they haven't had too much stuff come out.

609
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing, like, Battle Stations, Midway.

610
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:08,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at their page on Wikipedia.

611
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Thief, Hitman.

612
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitman, yeah.

613
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:12,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a pretty big series.

614
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:13,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there you go.

615
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:14,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

616
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:26,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, none of those games are games I get super excited about, although I have always wanted to try, Thief is always one of those games I'm always like, oh, I really need to play that, and I just, I haven't, you know, so many games, so little time.

617
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:30,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe original IPs also that, you know, aren't on there, too.

618
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:36,059
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, that's true, it looks like Eidos does do a lot of, oh, they do Legacy of Kain, too, forgot about that.

619
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, no love for the PlayStation 3 until 2008.

620
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:43,178
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

621
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I couldn't find another website, so I just picked one at random.

622
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's transmission.org.

623
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It's t-r-a-n-s-mission.org.

624
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a UK website for the club scene for transvestites.

625
00:42:31,446 --> 00:42:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm done.

626
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you actually browse the website?

627
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what kind of... I was looking for shoes.

628
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:40,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You were looking for...

629
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

630
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for shoes.

631
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:44,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop the damn music for a minute.

632
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: How does looking for shoes on the internet turn into, oh my gosh, I just found transsexual clubs in Britain?

633
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:59,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a link on here, on their links page, there's a shops link and it has fetish footwear and shoes for trannies.

634
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,050
[SPEAKER_01]: These shoes are $300.

635
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,992
[SPEAKER_01]: These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.

636
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:06,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them!

637
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:08,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

638
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:09,158
[SPEAKER_00]: You started it wrong.

639
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:09,999
[SPEAKER_00]: You started it wrong.

640
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I, I don't know.

641
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I deserve that.

642
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:12,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

643
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me borrow that top.

644
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:16,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Kelly is a pretty, pretty famous transit.

645
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,920
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the rest of my water bottle for now?

646
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:18,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sick.

647
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

648
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:21,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go, let me go bribe people.

649
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:23,161
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

650
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:25,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is going to go bribe people, try to get us some drinks.

651
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:27,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give people some blowjobs.

652
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:27,322
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

653
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:27,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

654
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:37,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you guys are about to get bribed pretty soon by NC Soft and ArenaNet because they are putting out

655
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:41,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Guild Wars 2 is coming out in the second half of 2008 officially announced

656
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:08,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are going to follow what worked for them with Guild Wars.

657
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,861
[SPEAKER_05]: No monthly subscription fee.

658
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:15,325
[SPEAKER_05]: But the world will always be available just like the original Guild Wars.

659
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:17,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool, especially for those folks in the Guild Wars.

660
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:25,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I wonder about is, are folks going to abandon Guild Wars 1 for Guild Wars 2?

661
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:29,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is the question we ask ourselves every time a sequel to an MMO comes out.

662
00:44:29,698 --> 00:44:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: EverQuest 2...

663
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:35,266
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't quite get the love that EverQuest 1 got because people didn't want to leave their characters behind.

664
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:43,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of curious if Guild Wars is going to suffer that same fate or if because, eh, I only have to buy it once, I'm not paying a monthly fee, there'll be some extra incentive.

665
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:58,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I also heard something about if you get the expansion for Guild Wars 1, this Eye of the North, you will unlock stuff for Guild Wars 2 just to, you know, make people buy everything they want.

666
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:58,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

667
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:00,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta collect them all!

668
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:03,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta get them all!

669
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:35,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And her article this week was, Lady, get off the road.

670
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:39,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically talking about, Men say women are bad drivers.

671
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:45,883
[SPEAKER_03]: This confuses me greatly as a woman behind the wheel with the token grumpy driver's license photo to prove it.

672
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:49,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I take my on-road duties seriously.

673
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically her complaint is,

674
00:45:54,933 --> 00:46:08,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a woman driver in one of those student driver cars, right?

675
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:14,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But she didn't have anyone with her, so she was obviously the teacher.

676
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,481
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but the woman wasn't a student driver, she was like the teacher.

677
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:21,243
[SPEAKER_05]: She was sitting there in traffic, because we were all in bumper-to-bumper trying to go across the Bay Bridge.

678
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:23,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Text messaging while driving.

679
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:25,810
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't text message break up!

680
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,771
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't text message break up!

681
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:33,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, she was text messaging while driving a student driver car.

682
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:36,075
[SPEAKER_05]: True story, I am not shitting you.

683
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:39,216
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes a special kind of loser.

684
00:46:39,336 --> 00:46:41,457
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why you women get a bad rap.

685
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:43,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly!

686
00:46:44,722 --> 00:46:46,544
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna know why men get a bad rap?

687
00:46:46,564 --> 00:46:47,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

688
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Small penis cars.

689
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:48,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it, bring it.

690
00:46:48,787 --> 00:46:54,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single fucking time I'm on the road, especially in the BMW that I have, I have a little beamer.

691
00:46:55,014 --> 00:46:55,975
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that car called?

692
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:57,617
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that car?

693
00:46:58,218 --> 00:46:58,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Ford...

694
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:03,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's one of the new little beamers I've got.

695
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:12,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single time I'm in that car, men decide that they need to let me know that they've got a bigger cock than I do.

696
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:14,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but this is what they feel like they need to do.

697
00:47:15,986 --> 00:47:22,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what you boys don't know is that Chris has a very big cock in her top dresser drawer.

698
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, and it vibrates.

699
00:47:25,432 --> 00:47:26,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat that motherfucker.

700
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:28,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as big as mine.

701
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:29,704
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

702
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:30,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Hers is detachable, though.

703
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:34,929
[SPEAKER_01]: So... Shut up, Rob.

704
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, you men are just as bad.

705
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:38,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Lesbian sex.

706
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:40,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Men are just as fucking bad, so don't talk to me about that, Kurt.

707
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:44,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and maybe... Okay, so... Sorry, do you want to finish the article?

708
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I want to finish.

709
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:52,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so they go on to complain, basically, that men, you know, are, you know, driving fast and they're breaking...

710
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're also kind of blaming the racing games a little bit.

711
00:47:55,927 --> 00:48:00,328
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all, just, I mean, just think about racing games we design for guys.

712
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:03,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Breaking speed limits, injuring other vehicles, even crashing.

713
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:06,750
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got awful driving written all over them.

714
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:10,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think games are reality.

715
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:10,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

716
00:48:11,032 --> 00:48:13,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't go around, I'm gonna try to hit the car!

717
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I get extra points for that!

718
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:17,194
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not a retard, okay?

719
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:17,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

720
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

721
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:35,559
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the difference.

722
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they don't have a game made on that kind of retardedness, okay?

723
00:48:39,362 --> 00:48:45,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, you know, if there was crazy cell phone driving SUV bitch, the game, I mean, great.

724
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can go out there and play that, and you'll have something to play.

725
00:48:49,070 --> 00:49:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and I will give you that there are guys out there that drive their stupid, they think they're sports cars, you know, or race cars or whatever the fuck they think they are, you know, super fast and zip through traffic and stuff, and great, okay, they do that.

726
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:05,024
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually I let them pass me, no problem.

727
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:11,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a dumb bitch that's driving 20 miles an hour on the freeway, talking on her cell phone, swerving all over the place, not using her signal.

728
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:16,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, goddamn, might as well stop and back up on the freeway.

729
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:18,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have seen that, by the way, before.

730
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:21,568
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what pisses me off.

731
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:24,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why, I'm sorry, it does take a few bad apples.

732
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:27,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, a lot, a lot, a lot of bad apples out there, too.

733
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of spoiled a bunch, and...

734
00:49:29,946 --> 00:49:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, women should just get pissed off at these stupid people who drive... It's really SUV drivers.

735
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to make that crazy SUV cell phone talking bitch game.

736
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have to agree with you.

737
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:45,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bitches need to fucking die in a car accident with fire.

738
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

739
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:49,094
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys that speed out there, they end up crashing anyway.

740
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:50,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all bad drivers.

741
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I missed something.

742
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:53,775
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck does this have to do with games?

743
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to do anything with games.

744
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck did you bring this story up then?

745
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:05,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was on Joystick, and because it was... And because it's basically, they're talking about Need for Speed, Excite Truck, and Burnout, and stuff like that.

746
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of blaming, I guess... So what, is that how the article reads?

747
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, woman drivers, blah, blah, blah, stop texting, blah, blah, blah.

748
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:17,054
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I read.

749
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:18,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck, Burnout, okay, thanks.

750
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:19,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

751
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:20,455
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I read.

752
00:50:20,555 --> 00:50:22,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how my guy filter went through that.

753
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:23,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's basically...

754
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, squawk, squawk, squawk.

755
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:27,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Meds suck.

756
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:28,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Squawk, squawk, squawk.

757
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was your wife talking to you.

758
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

759
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:32,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Or me.

760
00:50:32,453 --> 00:50:32,754
Or me.

761
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:37,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I just would like to say my little beamer can kick all your guys' asses.

762
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:39,779
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, that's right.

763
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going 120 miles on the freeway wondering why somebody going 80 is in my way.

764
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:49,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to go find people.

765
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:49,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Next!

766
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:50,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

767
00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:50,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

768
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:58,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, in this final thought she had on here, men like perfecting their skills at racing since because they need to practice.

769
00:50:58,828 --> 00:51:03,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Women, they're already such good drivers that they could squander their free time on destruction.

770
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:06,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So, SmackDown.

771
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:08,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

772
00:51:08,894 --> 00:51:11,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you politely commenting for a reason here?

773
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:15,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Because anytime there's a story about bad driving, you have something to say about it.

774
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:16,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But tonight, strangely quiet.

775
00:51:17,218 --> 00:51:20,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering if you're holding the anger in or if you just

776
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:24,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

777
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:25,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get a feel.

778
00:51:25,802 --> 00:51:27,103
[SPEAKER_05]: What is going through Jamie's mind?

779
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Because men can't think beyond their own egos to be objective.

780
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward.

781
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows that Capricorns are the best drivers anyway.

782
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that have to do with anything?

783
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:42,397
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with bad driving and good driving.

784
00:51:43,438 --> 00:51:44,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about Smackdown, right?

785
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,962
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some Smackdown in here pretty soon.

786
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: on a new Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 edition to be on the PS3, Wii, DS, also a bunch of other shit.

787
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be superstar fighting styles, a lot of new ones, a struggle submission system, you also have new arenas, new weapons, you have ECW stuff.

788
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:27,555
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the fan requested updates like new rosters, environmental hotspots, seasonal and general manager mode experience, out of the ring, online, kind of interesting stuff.

789
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:33,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think SmackDown vs. Raw is funny because it's like, you know, wrestling is like soap opera for guys.

790
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, can you retire... Not this guy.

791
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:45,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you retire your character after a few successful seasons or whatever, and then start your own reality show that appears on VH1?

792
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:47,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, stuff like that.

793
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:49,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you try to retire Hulk Hogan, though, he comes back a year later.

794
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:52,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like Michael Jordan in basketball, right?

795
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:53,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever?

796
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:56,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so gay, obviously.

797
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what I'm talking about.

798
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well...

799
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I, uh, you like the last SmackDown game, so is this something you're interested in picking up, DarkSakura?

800
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:07,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan will, so I don't have to worry about it.

801
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:12,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, who puts the SmackDown when you and Dan do battle in SmackDown?

802
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just make characters and make him use them.

803
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:15,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

804
00:53:15,773 --> 00:53:17,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually make really kick-ass characters, though.

805
00:53:17,974 --> 00:53:27,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, on the old WrestleMania 2000, I made this character who was, like, this really pretty boy in Degeneration X, and then we just let him play in, um, in, uh,

806
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:32,214
[SPEAKER_02]: On Watch Mode, where you could just watch all the matches, and he won every single match, had all the belts.

807
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:34,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We even put him in a women's match.

808
00:53:36,555 --> 00:53:38,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't another game, because I remade him in another game.

809
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:40,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, he had all the belts.

810
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:41,497
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fucking awesome.

811
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:42,497
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

812
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember because he was pretty.

813
00:53:45,198 --> 00:53:45,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty Boy.

814
00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:47,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that his wrestling name, Pretty Boy?

815
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:53,601
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he had some cool name, but he was just... I think his name was actually just Mr. X. How original.

816
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:54,521
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

817
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:56,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Macy, what, you had something to say?

818
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Macy has a joke about wrestling.

819
00:53:59,035 --> 00:53:59,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

820
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:02,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about ready to wrap up this segment, so we'll close with a joke.

821
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:06,219
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between gay sex and professional wrestling is mostly mental.

822
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,640
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?

823
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watch professional wrestling and then watch some gay porn.

824
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:15,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much difference.

825
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:15,744
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

826
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Some advice from Macy there.

827
00:54:18,606 --> 00:54:18,926
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

828
00:54:18,986 --> 00:54:20,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are going to take a quick break here.

829
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:25,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, the lesbians saw boobies.

830
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,941
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you looking at here?

831
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on Destructoid, and I'm just scrolling down, and apparently they have this Nerdcore69, Celebrity Boobs, and Nakedness, etc.

832
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:42,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And they very badly photoshopped the old Boomerang controller and Atari controller on there.

833
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like an April Fool's joke or something?

834
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:45,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

835
00:54:46,214 --> 00:54:47,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just scrolling down.

836
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,918
[SPEAKER_05]: They do some pretty funny photoshops over on Destructoid, though.

837
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:53,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like that site.

838
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:53,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.

839
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:55,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um...

840
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:58,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's going to do it though for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

841
00:54:58,877 --> 00:55:04,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're thinking, gosh, this was a little short, well, you know, don't forget we had a little joke we played on you at the beginning here that was a separate show.

842
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:09,304
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will be back for your full Part B right after a quick little segment here.

843
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:13,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And coming up in Part B tonight, we're going to talk about the Xbox 360 Elite because there's a lot on that.

844
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:19,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about the Castlevania movie as well, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto trailers, Ninja Gaiden, a whole lot more.

845
00:55:19,952 --> 00:55:25,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Your calls coming up in Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We'll be back in just a little bit.

846
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:36,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
